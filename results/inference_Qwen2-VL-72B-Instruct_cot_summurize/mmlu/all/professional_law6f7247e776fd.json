                    "text": "During the final days of his presidency, many of the President's Cabinet members began leaking rather embarrassing stories about the President to the press. In one such story, which appeared in a newspaper, an unidentified Cabinet member was quoted as saying that the President pardoned the owner of a professional baseball team, for a previous felony conviction because the owner promised to give the President a lifetime pass to all future games. Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor. The executive order called for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order. After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order. Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course. The magazine printed the story and named the senior adviser as the source. In compliance with civil service regulations, a hearing was conducted and the senior adviser was found to have violated the executive order barring unauthorized conununications with print media. Subsequently, the senior adviser was summarily dismissed from his executive staff position. The senior adviser brings an appropriate action seeking reinstatement and challenges the constitutionality of the executive order. If this case reaches the U. S. Supreme Court, the justices should rule the executive order is\n\nA. constitutional, because governmental employment is a privilege and not a right.\nB. constitutional, because the President has plenary power to set forth employment regulations for executive department employees.\nC. unconstitutional, because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment.\nD. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the executive order is constitutional or not, we need to consider several key legal principles and precedents related to executive power, free speech, and the role of Congress in regulating federal employment.\n\n1. **Governmental Employment as a Privilege**: While it is true that government employment is generally considered a privilege rather than a right, this principle alone does not necessarily justify the constitutionality of the executive order. The nature of the restriction on speech must also be evaluated.\n\n2. **Plenary Power of the President**: The President does have significant powers over the executive branch, including setting policies and regulations for executive department employees. However, these powers are not unlimited and must be balanced against other constitutional protections, such as the First Amendment rights to free speech and association.\n\n3. **Congressional Authority**: Congress indeed has the authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment. However, the President also has substantial discretion in managing the executive branch, and courts often defer to the President's judgment in matters of internal administration unless there is a clear constitutional violation.\n\n4. **First Amendment Considerations**: The executive order bans all executive employees from speaking to the press without prior permission, which could be seen as a broad restriction on their freedom of speech and association. Such restrictions might be permissible if they serve a compelling government interest and are narrowly tailored, but a blanket ban raises serious constitutional concerns.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling argument against the constitutionality of the executive order is likely based on the First Amendment. The order appears to impose a broad restriction on the ability of executive employees to communicate with the press, which could be viewed as an infringement on their free speech rights.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the principle that while the President has significant powers over the executive branch, those powers must be exercised within the bounds of the Constitution, particularly when they impinge upon fundamental rights like free speech."
