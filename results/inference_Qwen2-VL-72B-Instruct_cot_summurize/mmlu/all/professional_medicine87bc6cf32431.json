It typically presents with painful genital ulcers and tender, swollen lymph nodes (inguinal and femoral adenopathy). The presence of satellite lesions around the primary ulcer is characteristic of chancroid.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely causal organism in this case is:\n\nB. Haemophilus ducreyi"
