The program may have bugs.\n\nEven though a Java program has been tested extensively and no errors were found, it does not guarantee that there are no bugs present. Testing can only reveal the presence of bugs, not their absence. It's possible that some bugs might not have been triggered during testing or that certain conditions or inputs were not covered by the tests. Therefore, while extensive testing increases confidence in the program's correctness, it does not eliminate the possibility of undiscovered bugs."
