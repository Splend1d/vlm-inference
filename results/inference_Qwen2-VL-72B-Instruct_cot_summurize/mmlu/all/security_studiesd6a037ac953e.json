The conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable for the adversary.\n2. The threat must be credible, meaning the coercer must have the capability and willingness to carry out the threat if the adversary does not comply.\n3. The adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with the demand, allowing them to consider their options and respond appropriately.\n4. The coercer must assure the adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands, providing a clear endpoint to the coercion.\n5. The conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game, where one party's gain is necessarily another's loss, but rather as a situation where both parties can achieve some level of satisfaction through cooperation.\n\nOption B accurately reflects these necessary conditions for compellence success according to Schelling's framework."
