This decision can be seen as a failure to act when there is a clear duty to help someone in imminent danger. According to ordinary moral standards, failing to take reasonable action to prevent harm when one has the ability to do so is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character gives customers they don't like coffee with spit in it.\n\nThis scenario involves intentionally contaminating someone's food or drink, which is a violation of basic hygiene standards and can cause harm to the customer. It is also a form of deception and disrespect towards the customer. According to ordinary moral standards, such an action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
