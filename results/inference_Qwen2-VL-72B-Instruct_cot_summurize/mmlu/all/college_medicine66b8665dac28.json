Glycogen, which is stored in muscles and the liver, is broken down into glucose to provide this energy. The breakdown of glycogen in exercising muscle is primarily activated by hormones such as cortisol, which helps to mobilize energy stores during times of stress or physical activity. Insulin, on the other hand, typically promotes glycogen synthesis and storage rather than breakdown. Increased pH (which would indicate a more alkaline environment) is not a typical trigger for glycogen breakdown; in fact, during intense exercise, pH decreases due to the production of lactic acid."
