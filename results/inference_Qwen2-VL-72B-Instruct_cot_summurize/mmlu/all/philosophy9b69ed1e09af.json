This means that an action is morally right if it can be willed to become a universal law without leading to a logical contradiction or rendering human beings as mere means rather than ends in themselves. The moral character of the agent and the consequences of the action are not the primary determinants of moral worth according to Kant; rather, it is the intention behind the action and whether it conforms to the categorical imperative."
