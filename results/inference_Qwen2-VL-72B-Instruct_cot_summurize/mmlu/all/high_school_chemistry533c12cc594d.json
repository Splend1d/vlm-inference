                    "text": "To determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a potassium-40 atom that is part of a K2SO4 compound, we need to consider the atomic structure of potassium-40.\n\n1. **Protons**: The atomic number of potassium (K) is 19, which means every potassium atom has 19 protons.\n   \n2. **Neutrons**: The mass number of potassium-40 is 40. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of neutrons} = \\text{Mass number} - \\text{Number of protons}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of neutrons} = 40 - 19 = 21\n   \\]\n\n3. **Electrons**: In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Since potassium-40 is an atom and not an ion in this context, it will have 19 electrons.\n\nSo, potassium-40 has:\n- 19 protons\n- 21 neutrons\n- 19 electrons\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons"
