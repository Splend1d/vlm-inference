The adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors\n\nThe poem \"To New York\" by Senegalese poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor demonstrates the adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors. Senghor, a key figure in the N\u00e9gritude movement, uses the structure and style of Western poetry to express African and diasporic experiences and perspectives. This approach reflects a broader trend in modern literature where non-Western writers engage with and transform Western literary traditions to articulate their own cultural identities and narratives."
