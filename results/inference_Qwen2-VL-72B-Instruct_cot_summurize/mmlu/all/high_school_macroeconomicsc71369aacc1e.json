I, II, and III are correct.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a comprehensive measure of the economic activity within a country over a specific period, usually a year. It represents the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given time period. GDP can be calculated using three main approaches:\n\n1. **Production Approach**: This method sums up the value added at each stage of production across all industries in the economy. Value added is the difference between the sales value of output and the cost of inputs used to produce that output.\n\n2. **Income Approach**: This approach calculates GDP by summing up all incomes earned in producing national output. This includes wages, rents, interest, profits, and depreciation.\n\n3. **Expenditure Approach**: This method adds up all the spending on domestic goods and services by consumers, businesses, governments, and foreigners. The components include consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (exports minus imports).\n\nTherefore, all three aspects\u2014production, income earned during the production process, and spending by consumers, businesses, governments, and foreigners\u2014are included in the calculation of GDP."
