Ten miles long and nearly 500 feet deep (152.4 m meters), Lake McDonald, the largest lake in the park, is a direct result of glacial carving. High peaks surrounding the lake all show evidence of the power of glaciers to carve even the hardest of rock. The powerful glaciers that carved the broad U-shaped valley that Lake McDonald sits in also carved smaller hanging valleys with wonderful waterfalls that are accessible by numerous hiking trails. Which of the following best identifies the intended audience of the passage?\n\nA. Scientists researching glacier development\nB. Teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips\nC. Academics studying the historical context of national parks\nD. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald\n"
