To find the molar mass of the metal (M), we use the formula:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{\\text{mass of metal}}{\\text{moles of metal}} \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{0.0623 \\text{ g}}{0.001263 \\text{ mol}} \\]\n\\[ M \\approx 49.3 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is approximately 49.3 grams.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 49.3 g."
