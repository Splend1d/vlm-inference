Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Higher spending** - This would increase aggregate demand and help close the recessionary gap.\n   **Lower taxes** - Reducing taxes increases disposable income, encouraging consumer spending and investment.\n   **Sell Treasury securities** - Selling Treasury securities would withdraw money from circulation, which is contractionary and counterproductive in a recession.\n\nB. **Lower spending** - This would reduce aggregate demand, which is not desirable during a recession.\n   **Higher taxes** - Increasing taxes reduces disposable income, further dampening consumer spending and investment.\n   **Buy Treasury securities** - Buying Treasury securities injects money into the economy, which is expansionary but may not be sufficient to offset the negative effects of lower spending and higher taxes.\n\nC. **Lower spending** - Again, this reduces aggregate demand, which is counterproductive.\n   **Lower taxes** - Reducing taxes stimulates consumer spending and investment.\n   **Increasing the reserve ratio** - This makes it more expensive for banks to lend, reducing the money supply and is contractionary.\n\nD. **Higher spending** - Increases aggregate demand and helps combat the recession.\n   **Higher taxes** - This reduces disposable income, which can dampen consumer spending and investment.\n   **Lowering the discount rate** - This makes it cheaper for banks to borrow, encouraging lending and increasing the money supply, which is expansionary.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most balanced approach to fight a recessionary gap while avoiding large budget deficits would likely involve:\n\n- **Higher spending** to directly stimulate the economy.\n- **Lower taxes** to boost consumer spending and investment.\n- **Lowering the discount rate** to encourage lending and increase the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the best combination would be:\n\n**Higher spending**, **lower taxes**, and **lowering the discount rate**.\n\nThis aligns with option D, except for the tax policy component. The correct approach should ideally include **lower taxes** instead of **higher taxes** to ensure that disposable income remains high enough to support consumer spending and investment. Thus, the most appropriate answer would be a modified version of option D, where \"higher taxes\" is replaced with \"lower taxes.\""
