This intervention can occur to prevent excessive volatility or to achieve specific economic objectives. Therefore, option A is correct. Options B and C are incorrect because intervention does occur, albeit not constantly. Option D is incorrect because exchange rates in a managed float system are not fixed; they are allowed to fluctuate within certain bounds or according to market conditions, with occasional intervention by the central bank."
