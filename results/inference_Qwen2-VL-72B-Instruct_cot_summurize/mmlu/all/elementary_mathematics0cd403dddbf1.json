If 7 coins represent 5% of her entire collection, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ 7 = 0.05 \\times \\text{Total Number of Coins} \\]\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of coins in Kate's collection. Then,\n\n\\[ 7 = 0.05x \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides by 0.05:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{7}{0.05} \\]\n\\[ x = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's collection is 140.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 140."
