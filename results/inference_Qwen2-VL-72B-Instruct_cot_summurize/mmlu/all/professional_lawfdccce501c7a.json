Thereafter, the skier sued the ski resort alleging negligent maintenance of the ski lift machinery. The ski resort's skier's attorney took a discovery deposition of a witness who was seated behind the skier at the time of the accident. The witness died shortly after the deposition. At trial, the skier offers the witness's deposition testimony into evidence. Upon objection by the ski resort's attorney, the deposition is\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible, provided that the witness's statements are more probative on the point than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts and that the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the ski resort's right to confront the witnesses against itself.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

The death of the witness makes them unavailable, and thus the deposition can be admitted under the \"former testimony\" exception to the hearsay rule. This exception allows for the admission of prior sworn testimony given under oath in a previous judicial proceeding, provided that the opposing party had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the deposition."
