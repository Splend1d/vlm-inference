Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nBased on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions?\n\nA. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.\nB. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.\nC. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n"

The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\n\nBoth passages highlight the limitations and shortcomings of revolutionary outcomes. Olympe de Gouges' declaration criticizes the French Revolution for failing to extend its principles of liberty and equality to women, while Halima Ghomri's account reflects on the limited social and economic changes experienced by Algerians after their war of independence. These accounts suggest that while revolutions may bring about significant political changes, the benefits are not always equitably distributed among all segments of society."
