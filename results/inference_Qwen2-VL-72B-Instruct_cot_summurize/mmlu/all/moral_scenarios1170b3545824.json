This can lead to health issues and unhealthy habits for the children.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I buried her up to her neck on the beach.\"\n- Burying someone up to their neck on the beach can be dangerous, especially if they cannot free themselves or if there is a risk of drowning or suffocation. This action can cause harm and is generally considered morally wrong unless it is done with full consent and under safe conditions (e.g., a controlled environment where the person can easily be freed).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also clearly morally wrong unless it was done with full consent and under safe conditions, but without additional context, we must assume it is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
