Males have one exit structure for urine and reproductive fluids (the urethra), whereas females have two separate structures: the urethra for urine and the vagina for reproductive fluids. This statement is correct.\n\nB. Males have an external sexual organ (the penis) that gets engorged with blood during sexual arousal, whereas females have an internal sexual organ (the clitoris) that also becomes engorged but remains mostly internal. This statement is correct.\n\nC. The number of nerve endings in the penis and clitoris can vary greatly among individuals, and there isn't a definitive statement that males have many times more nerve endings than females. This statement is not accurate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. All of the above (except for C, which is not accurate)."
