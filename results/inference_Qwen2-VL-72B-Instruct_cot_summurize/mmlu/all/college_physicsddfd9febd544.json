                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the proton as it moves through the electric and magnetic fields.\n\n1. **Initial Acceleration:**\n   - The proton is initially accelerated from rest through a potential difference \\( V \\). This results in the proton gaining kinetic energy and moving in the \\( +z \\)-direction.\n\n2. **Electric Field (E) in the \\( +x \\)-direction:**\n   - When the proton enters the region with an electric field \\( E \\) in the \\( +x \\)-direction, it experiences a force \\( F_E = qE \\), where \\( q \\) is the charge of the proton. Since the proton has a positive charge, the force will be in the \\( +x \\)-direction.\n\n3. **Magnetic Field (B) in the \\( +y \\)-direction:**\n   - The magnetic force \\( F_B \\) on the proton due to the magnetic field \\( B \\) can be calculated using the Lorentz force law:\n     \\[\n     F_B = qv \\times B\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( v \\) is the velocity of the proton in the \\( +z \\)-direction, and \\( B \\) is in the \\( +y \\)-direction. The cross product \\( v \\times B \\) gives a vector in the \\( +x \\)-direction because:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{z} \\times \\hat{y} = \\hat{x}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the magnetic force \\( F_B \\) also acts in the \\( +x \\)-direction.\n\n4. **Resultant Force:**\n   - Both the electric force and the magnetic force act in the \\( +x \\)-direction. Thus, the net force on the proton is in the \\( +x \\)-direction, causing it to deflect in the \\( +x \\)-direction.\n\n5. **Effect of Doubling the Potential Difference:**\n   - If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of \\( 2V \\), the initial kinetic energy of the proton would double. However, since both the electric and magnetic forces depend linearly on the charge \\( q \\) and not on the kinetic energy, doubling the potential difference does not change the direction of the forces.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the initial potential difference, the proton will always be deflected in the \\( +x \\)-direction due to the combined effect of the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. deflected in the \\( +x \\)-direction"
