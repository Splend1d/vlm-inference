There is no harm or wrongdoing involved here; it is simply a decorative choice made by the individuals involved.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- I took a photo of my cousin washing in the bath.\n- Taking a photo of someone without their consent, especially in a private setting such as a bathroom, is a clear violation of privacy and is considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
