K-1/K.\n\nIn a complete K-ary tree of depth N, the total number of nodes can be calculated as:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + K + K^2 + ... + K^N\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term 1, common ratio K, and N+1 terms. The sum of this series is given by:\n\nTotal nodes = (K^(N+1) - 1) / (K - 1)\n\nThe number of non-terminal nodes is equal to the total number of nodes minus the number of leaf nodes. In a complete K-ary tree, each node has either K children or no children (i.e., it is a leaf node). Therefore, the number of leaf nodes is equal to K^N.\n\nNumber of non-terminal nodes = Total nodes - Number of leaf nodes\n= [(K^(N+1) - 1) / (K - 1)] - K^N\n\nTo find the ratio of the number of non-terminal nodes to the total number of nodes, we divide the above expression by the total number of nodes:\n\nRatio = [(K^(N+1) - 1) / (K - 1) - K^N] / [(K^(N+1) - 1) / (K - 1)]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nRatio = (K^(N+1) - K^N - 1) / (K^(N+1) - 1)\n\nAs N becomes large, the term K^(N+1) dominates the other terms, so we can approximate the ratio as:\n\nRatio \u2248 (K^(N+1)) / (K^(N+1))\n= 1\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of non-terminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N is approximately 1. This corresponds to option B, K-1/K.\n"
