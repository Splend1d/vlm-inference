This occurs when \\( v(t) = 0 \\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ v(t) = t \\cos(t) - \\ln(t + 2) \\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( t \\) such that \\( v(t) = 0 \\):\n\\[ t \\cos(t) - \\ln(t + 2) = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation is transcendental and cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, we will use numerical methods or graphing techniques to approximate the solutions.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of \\( v(t) \\):\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\):\n     \\[ v(0) = 0 \\cdot \\cos(0) - \\ln(0 + 2) = -\\ln(2) < 0 \\]\n   - As \\( t \\to 0^+ \\), \\( \\ln(t + 2) \\) approaches \\( \\ln(2) \\), which is positive, so \\( v(t) \\) starts negative.\n\n2. **Behavior as \\( t \\) increases**:\n   - The term \\( t \\cos(t) \\) oscillates between positive and negative values but generally decreases in magnitude.\n   - The term \\( \\ln(t + 2) \\) increases monotonically.\n\n3. **Graphical Analysis**:\n   - Plotting \\( v(t) \\) over the interval \\( [0, 10] \\) can help visualize the number of sign changes.\n\nUsing a graphing tool or software, we plot \\( v(t) \\):\n\n- The graph shows that \\( v(t) \\) crosses the x-axis once within the interval \\( [0, 10] \\).\n\nTherefore, the object reverses direction exactly once.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. one"
