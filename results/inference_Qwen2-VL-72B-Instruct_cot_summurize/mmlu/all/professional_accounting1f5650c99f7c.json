The regression equation typically takes the form:\n\n\\[ R_i = \\alpha + \\beta R_m + \\epsilon \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( R_i \\) is the return of the stock.\n- \\( \\alpha \\) is the intercept term, often referred to as the stock's alpha, which represents the expected return of the stock when the market return is zero.\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the slope coefficient, representing the stock's beta, which measures the sensitivity of the stock's return to changes in the market return.\n- \\( R_m \\) is the return of the market.\n- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term, representing the portion of the stock's return that is not explained by the market return.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C because simple linear regression estimates the alpha (intercept) and beta (slope), which together describe how the stock's returns depend on the market returns."
