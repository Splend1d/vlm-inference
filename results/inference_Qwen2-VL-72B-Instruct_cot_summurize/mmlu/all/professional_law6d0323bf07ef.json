A high school student was driving in his car and listening to punk music on his car stereo system, which included a set of 12-inch subwoofers mounted in the rear. As the student drove past the high school, he turned up the volume to its highest level. A police car drove alongside the student and, hearing the loud and raucous music; the police officers arrested the student and charged him with violating the anti- noise statute. Before the student was brought to trial, the highest court in the state ruled the statute unconstitutional as vague and overbroad. As a result, the charges against the student were dropped, and his case was dismissed. Thereafter, the district attorney's office decided to prosecute the student for violating a state attempt statute. The attempt statute provided that legal impossibility was no defense. Thereupon, the student was charged with attempting to violate the anti-noise statute. At trial, the student took the stand to testifi on his own behalf. He testified that when he was arrested, he had purposely turned up the stereo to its highest level because his favorite song was playing. Will the student be found guilty of violating the attempt statute?\n\nA. Yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\nB. Yes, because dismissal of the initial charge was not a final judgment and, therefore, double jeopardy does not attach.\nC. No, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed.\nD. No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Charge and Dismissal**: The student was initially charged with violating the anti-noise statute. However, before the trial, the highest court in the state ruled the statute unconstitutional due to vagueness and overbreadth. Consequently, the charges were dropped, and the case was dismissed.\n\n2. **Attempt Statute and Legal Impossibility**: The district attorney's office then decided to prosecute the student under a state attempt statute, which provided that legal impossibility was no defense. This means that even if the underlying act (violating the anti-noise statute) was impossible due to the statute being unconstitutional, the attempt itself could still be prosecuted.\n\n3. **Double Jeopardy Considerations**: Double jeopardy protects individuals from being tried twice for the same offense. However, in this scenario, the initial charge was dismissed due to the unconstitutionality of the statute, not due to a finding of innocence or a final judgment on the merits of the case. Therefore, double jeopardy would not necessarily prevent a subsequent prosecution for attempt.\n\n4. **Unconstitutionality of the Underlying Act**: The key issue here is that the underlying act (violating the anti-noise statute) was ruled unconstitutional. Since the act itself is illegal and cannot be prosecuted, it logically follows that attempting to commit an act that is unconstitutional cannot be prosecuted either. The attempt statute cannot apply to an act that is fundamentally invalid and illegal.\n\nTherefore, the student cannot be found guilty of attempting to violate an unconstitutional statute."
