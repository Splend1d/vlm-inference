                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-score formula. The z-score is given by:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value of interest (in this case, 75 years), \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (14 years).\n\nWe know that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. This means that 70% live less than or equal to 75 years. To find the corresponding z-score for the 70th percentile, we can look up the z-score associated with a cumulative probability of 0.70 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator or software.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table, we find that the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.70 is approximately 0.5244.\n\nNow we can set up the equation using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ 0.5244 = \\frac{75 - \\mu}{14} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 0.5244 = 75 - \\mu \\]\n\\[ 7.3416 = 75 - \\mu \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 75 - 7.3416 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 67.6584 \\]\n\nSo the mean longevity is approximately 67.66 years.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 75 - 0.30(14) = 75 - 4.2 = 70.8\nB. 75 + 0.30(14) = 75 + 4.2 = 79.2\nC. 75 - 0.4756(14) = 75 - 6.6584 = 68.3416\nD. 75 - 0.5244(14) = 75 - 7.3416 = 67.6584\n\nThe correct answer is D."
