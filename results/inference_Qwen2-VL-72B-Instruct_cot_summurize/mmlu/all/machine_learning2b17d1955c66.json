Therefore, the matrix has only one linearly independent row.\n\nThe dimensionality of the null space of a matrix is equal to the number of columns minus the rank of the matrix. In this case, the matrix has 3 columns and a rank of 1 (since it has only one linearly independent row).\n\nTherefore, the dimensionality of the null space of the matrix is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSo the answer is C. 2."
