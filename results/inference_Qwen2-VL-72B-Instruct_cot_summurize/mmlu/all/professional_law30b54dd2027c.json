Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because the offense does not require any mental state.\nB. guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant's employer is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred.\n"

The mere act of committing the prohibited behavior is sufficient for conviction. Since the sale of cigarettes to a minor is considered a strict liability offense in this scenario, the fact that the defendant was unconscious due to voluntary intoxication does not negate his guilt. The law holds him responsible for the act regardless of his mental state at the time of the offense."
