The three stages of GAS are alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. In the context of Conrad's situation, the prolonged stress from studying intensively for finals could have led to a weakened immune system, making him more susceptible to illness such as the flu once the stressor (finals) was removed. This fits well with the exhaustion phase of Selye's GAS, where the body's resources are depleted after prolonged stress, leading to susceptibility to illness."
