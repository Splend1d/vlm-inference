Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The dominance of Western ideologies can be regarded as contemporary imperialism.**\n   - This is a valid reason because many non-Western countries might view the spread of Western ideologies as an imposition akin to imperialism, which could undermine their sovereignty and cultural identity.\n\nB. **Liberalism advocates the enforcement of certain values that are not shared by all political regimes.**\n   - This is also a valid reason because different regimes have varying ideological foundations and may not align with the values promoted by liberalism, such as individual freedoms and democratic governance.\n\nC. **The fear that cooperation may be recurring.**\n   - This statement is unclear and seems to lack coherence. It doesn't provide a clear rationale related to the reluctance of joining the liberalist camp. The phrase \"cooperation may be recurring\" doesn't make logical sense in this context.\n\nD. **Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favored treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security.**\n   - This is a valid reason because liberal principles often prioritize individual rights and societal security over the interests of the state or regime, which could pose a threat to authoritarian or autocratic regimes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that is **not** a valid reason for reluctance to join the liberalist camp is:\n\n**C. The fear that cooperation may be recurring.**\n\nThis option lacks clarity and does not provide a coherent rationale related to the reluctance of joining the liberalist camp."
