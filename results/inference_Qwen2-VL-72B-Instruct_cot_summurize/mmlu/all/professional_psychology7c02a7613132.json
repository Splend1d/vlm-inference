Maintaining a normal body weight\n\nWhile both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa involve disordered eating behaviors, one of the key distinguishing features is that individuals with bulimia nervosa typically maintain a normal or slightly above-normal body weight, whereas those with anorexia nervosa have a significantly low body weight. Both disorders can involve bingeing and purging behaviors, but the difference in body weight is a crucial factor in differentiating between them."
