This can happen if one version of the question leads people to give more positive or negative responses than another version, even if the underlying sentiment remains the same.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. \"The first showed 58% and the second 13% because of the lack of randomization as evidenced by the wording of the questions.\"\n- Lack of randomization refers to issues with how participants were selected for the study, not necessarily the wording of the questions. Therefore, this option does not accurately describe the situation.\n\nB. \"The first showed 13% and the second 58% because of a placebo effect due to the wording of the questions.\"\n- A placebo effect typically refers to changes in behavior or health due to the belief that a treatment will have an effect, rather than the actual treatment itself. It doesn't apply directly to the wording of survey questions.\n\nC. \"The first showed 58% and the second 13% because of the lack of a control group.\"\n- A control group is used in experiments to compare against the experimental group. In a survey context, the absence of a control group might affect the interpretation of results but would not directly explain differences in response rates due to question wording.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation for the difference in percentages between the two versions of the questionnaire is response bias caused by the wording of the questions."
