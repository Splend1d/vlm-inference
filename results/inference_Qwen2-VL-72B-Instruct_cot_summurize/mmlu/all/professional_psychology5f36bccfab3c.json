Warn the person that she is about to hear a message designed to change her beliefs.\n\nInoculating someone against a persuasive message involves preparing them for exposure to that message by making them aware of its intent and potential tactics. This approach helps build resistance by increasing their skepticism and critical thinking skills when they encounter the persuasive message. Providing counterarguments or supporting information can also be part of the inoculation process, but the initial step is typically to alert the individual to the persuasive attempt."
