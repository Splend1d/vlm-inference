There is no harm or wrongdoing involved in this scenario.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I drove the filled school bus into the lake and jumped out at the last minute.\"\n- This action involves deliberately endangering the lives of others by driving a school bus full of people into a lake while ensuring one's own safety. This is clearly a morally wrong act as it puts innocent lives at risk without any justifiable reason.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
