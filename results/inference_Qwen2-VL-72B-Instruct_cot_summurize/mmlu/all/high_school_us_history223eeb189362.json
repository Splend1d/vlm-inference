He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of the following statements best describes Eric Foner's argument about President Abraham Lincoln's views on slavery?\n\nA. President Lincoln was a consistent supporter of the abolitionist cause.\nB. President Lincoln was reluctant to be ideologically associated with advocates like Frederick Douglass.\nC. In his ambition to become president, Abraham Lincoln declared his desire to use his constitutional powers to end slavery.\nD. President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories.\n"

President Lincoln had continually changing views on slavery and abolition that did not always fit into the prevailing political categories.\n\nEric Foner's argument highlights that while Abraham Lincoln was strongly opposed to slavery, his views and actions were nuanced and evolved over time. He was not aligned with the radical abolitionist movement or the Radical Republicans, and his approach to ending slavery was influenced by his understanding of the Constitution and his role as a leader within the existing legal framework. This suggests that Lincoln's views on slavery and abolition did not neatly align with any single ideological camp and changed as circumstances and his own thinking developed."
