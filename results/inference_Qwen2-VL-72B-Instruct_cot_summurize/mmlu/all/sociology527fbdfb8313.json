This was part of an effort to introduce competition among schools and to hold them accountable for their performance. While it did not necessarily lead to more funding for students in higher education (A), nor did it delegate power and budgetary control to Local Education Authorities (LEAs) (B), and it actually increased parental choice of school (C), the most direct result was the enhancement of state oversight and regulation."
