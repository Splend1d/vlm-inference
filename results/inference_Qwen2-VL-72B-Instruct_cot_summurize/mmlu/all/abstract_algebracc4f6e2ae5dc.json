For example, the permutation \\( (1\\ 2)(3\\ 4) \\) consists of two disjoint cycles.\n- Therefore, this statement is false because not every permutation is a cycle.\n\n### Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.\n- By definition, a cycle is a specific type of permutation.\n- Hence, every cycle is indeed a permutation.\n- This statement is true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
