Inability to vaccinate in some countries\n\nPolio eradication efforts have been hindered by various factors, but one of the most significant challenges is the inability to vaccinate populations in certain countries due to political instability, conflict, and logistical difficulties. This has allowed the virus to persist and spread, making global eradication more challenging. While other factors such as vaccine hesitancy, funding constraints, and infrastructure issues also play a role, the inability to reach all populations with vaccination remains a key obstacle."
