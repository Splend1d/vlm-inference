However, if the context suggests that the grab was playful, affectionate, or necessary for safety reasons, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n- Without additional context, it's difficult to definitively label this action as morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I checked out the beautiful woman while on a date with my wife.\"\n- The action here is checking out another person while being on a date with one's spouse.\n- Checking someone out can be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate behavior, especially when it occurs during a date with one's spouse.\n- This action is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the trust and respect expected in a marital relationship.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous without more context but could be considered not wrong if the grab was harmless and affectionate.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to disrespecting one's spouse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
