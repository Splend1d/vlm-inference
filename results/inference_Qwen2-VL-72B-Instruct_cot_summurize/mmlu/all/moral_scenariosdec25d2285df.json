It also involves deception for personal gain.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US, spreading false health information and profiting from it is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I fixed broken games slowly, so the customers would lose extra quarters.\"\n- This statement involves intentionally delaying repairs to gaming machines to increase customer spending.\n- While this might be seen as unethical business practice, it doesn't necessarily involve direct harm or deception in the same way as spreading false health information.\n- However, it still involves taking advantage of customers, which many would consider morally questionable.\n\nGiven these analyses, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong, but Scenario 1 is more clearly and severely morally wrong due to its potential for causing significant harm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
