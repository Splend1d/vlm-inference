After 10 years of marriage, the couple began experiencing marital difficulties. In 1992, they separated and the husband moved to another state where his family lived. The woman continued to reside in the dwelling. In 1994, the husband quitclaimed his interest in the home to his son, who promptly recorded his deed. In 1995, the couple divorced. In 1996, the woman changed the locks to the home, preventing the son from entering the property, and the woman refused the son's repeated demands to allow him access to the home and property. From 1995 to 2005, the woman paid all the taxes and insurance on the property. She also was responsible for making whatever repairs were necessary. The period of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. In 2006, the woman filed suit to quiet title to the home claiming absolute fee simple ownership. The son has countersued asserting that he owns an undivided 50 percent interest in the property. If the court rules in favor of the woman, it will be because\n\nA. the son will be unjustly enriched, inasmuch as the woman has paid all the taxes, insurance, and made necessary repairs.\nB. the son acquired his interest in the property by quitclaim deed.\nC. the deed from the husband to the son was void for lack of consideration.\nD. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Adverse Possession**: Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows someone to gain legal ownership of real property by occupying it openly, continuously, and without the permission of the true owner for a specific statutory period. In this case, the woman has been occupying and maintaining the property since 1992, which is more than the required 10-year period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction. Therefore, she can claim ownership through adverse possession.\n\n- **Unjust Enrichment**: While the woman has indeed paid all the taxes, insurance, and made necessary repairs, unjust enrichment alone does not establish ownership. It might influence the court's decision but is not the sole basis for ruling in her favor.\n\n- **Quitclaim Deed**: A quitclaim deed transfers any interest the grantor may have in the property to the grantee. However, it does not guarantee that the grantor had any interest to transfer in the first place. The son did acquire his interest through a quitclaim deed, but this fact alone does not determine the outcome of the case.\n\n- **Lack of Consideration**: Lack of consideration could make a contract unenforceable, but it does not necessarily void a quitclaim deed. Quitclaim deeds do not require consideration to be valid; they simply convey whatever interest the grantor has in the property.\n\nGiven these points, the most compelling reason for the court to rule in favor of the woman is that she has established adverse possession over the property."
