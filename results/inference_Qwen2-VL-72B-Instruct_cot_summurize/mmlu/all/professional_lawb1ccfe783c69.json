The label states that a \"patch test\" is necessary because a small percentage of the population may be allergic to the chemicals contained in the product and susceptible to suffering scalp irritation. A Russian immigrant recently moved to the United States from Moscow. The immigrant cannot read or speak English. One day, the immigrant purchased a bottle of the shampoo from a drug store. She looked at the label warning but did not understand it. After throwing away the box cover, she used the shampoo without making a \"patch test. \" Minutes later, she began experiencing an allergic reaction and scalp irritation. This was followed by hair loss attributed to the shampoo.

However, the concept of assumption of risk can still play a role. In this scenario, the company provided a clear warning on the product label about the potential for an allergic reaction and advised consumers to perform a patch test. Since the immigrant chose to disregard this warning and use the product without performing the recommended test, she assumed the risk associated with the product. Therefore, she would most likely lose the lawsuit based on the assumption of risk doctrine."
