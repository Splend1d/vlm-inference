Therefore, it is less likely that higher education would lead to increased support for public prayer in schools.\n\nD. **Voters are less likely to support restrictions on abortion rights**: Higher education often correlates with more liberal views on social issues, including reproductive rights, making it less likely that educated individuals would support restrictive abortion laws.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that does not align with the typical impact of higher education on voting habits is:\n\n**C. Voters are more likely to support public prayer in schools**\n\nThus, the final answer is C."
