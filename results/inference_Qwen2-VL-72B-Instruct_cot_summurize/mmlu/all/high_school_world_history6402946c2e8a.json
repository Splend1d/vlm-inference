Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nWhich of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage?\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion\nB. The spread of communism throughout the continent\nC. Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers\nD.

Given the emphasis on unity and common purpose in the passage, this could be a significant barrier.\n\nB. **The spread of communism throughout the continent**: While the Cold War and ideological conflicts were certainly influential during this period, the passage does not specifically mention communism as a primary obstacle to unity.\n\nC. **Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers**: Although Cold War dynamics did impact African politics, the passage focuses more on internal issues rather than external military interventions.\n\nD. **Africa's shortage of natural resources**: The passage does not discuss natural resources as a limiting factor; instead, it emphasizes financial structures, banking institutions, and the need for common planning and endeavor.\n\nConsidering the content of the passage, which stresses the importance of unity and common purpose, the most relevant factor preventing the fulfillment of these political dreams appears to be:\n\n**A. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion**\n\nThis option aligns closely with the passage's emphasis on the need for unity and shared purpose among diverse African states."
