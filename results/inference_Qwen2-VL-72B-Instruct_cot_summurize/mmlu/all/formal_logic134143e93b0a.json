It is unclear what \\( sC \\) and \\( eJ \\) represent in this context.\n\nD. \\( Sx \\equiv Jy \\)\n   - This notation is also unconventional and does not follow standard predicate logic conventions. It is unclear what \\( Sx \\) and \\( Jy \\) represent in this context.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nB. \\( Sc \\equiv Ej \\)\n\nThis option correctly captures the biconditional relationship specified in the original statement."
