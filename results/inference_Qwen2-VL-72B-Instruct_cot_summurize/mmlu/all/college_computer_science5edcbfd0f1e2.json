Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n"

The total time spent executing these instructions is:\n\\[ 30T \\]\n\nThe total time for one complete cycle (digitization + CPU instructions) is:\n\\[ 48 \\mu s + 30T \\]\n\nFor the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, the total cycle time should not exceed the time taken to digitize all four inputs, which is 48 microseconds. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ 48 \\mu s + 30T \\leq 48 \\mu s \\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\):\n\\[ 30T \\leq 0 \\]\n\\[ T \\leq 0 \\]\n\nThis indicates that there is no positive value of \\( T \\) that satisfies the condition, suggesting that the given problem constraints might be unrealistic or misstated. However, if we consider the practical aspect and assume the problem intends to find the maximum average instruction execution time without considering the digitization time constraint, we can proceed as follows:\n\nGiven the total cycle time is dominated by the digitization time (48 microseconds), the maximum average instruction execution time \\( T \\) would be such that the CPU instructions fit within this time frame. Since the digitization time is fixed at 48 microseconds, the maximum average instruction execution time \\( T \\) would be determined by the number of instructions (30) fitting into this time frame:\n\\[ 30T = 48 \\mu s \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{48}{30} \\mu s \\]\n\\[ T = 1.6 \\mu s \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.6 \\mu s} \\]"
