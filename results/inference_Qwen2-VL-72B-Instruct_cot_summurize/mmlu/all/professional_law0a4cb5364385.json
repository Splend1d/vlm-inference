The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, \"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\" The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to \"ignore any paperwork we sent.\" The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?\n\nA. The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\nD. The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n"

                    "text": "To determine who will prevail in this scenario, let's analyze the sequence of events and the principles of contract law.\n\n1. **Initial Offer**: The company (offeror) offered to sell landscaping stones at a specified price and terms.\n2. **Notification from Offeree**: The offeree notified the offeror that they had received the offer but did not explicitly accept it.\n3. **Shipment by Offeror**: The offeror shipped the goods based on the notification.\n4. **Modified Acceptance**: The offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms.\n5. **Rejection by Offeree**: The offeree called the offeror's manager, stated they were unable to accept the offer, and instructed to ignore any paperwork sent.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Acceptance**: For a contract to be formed, there must be a clear and unambiguous acceptance of the offer on the same terms as the offer. The offeree's initial notification did not constitute acceptance since it merely acknowledged receipt of the offer without agreeing to its terms.\n  \n- **Modified Acceptance**: The offeree's modified acceptance is considered a counter-offer, which legally terminates the original offer unless the offeror accepts the new terms. Since there is no indication that the offeror accepted the modified terms, the original offer remains unaccepted.\n\n- **Rejection**: The offeree's subsequent call rejecting the offer and instructing to ignore any paperwork effectively rejects the offer. This rejection is communicated before the offeror could have reasonably acted on the modified acceptance.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these points, the offeree never validly accepted the offer on the same terms specified by the offeror. Therefore, no enforceable contract was formed.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.**"
