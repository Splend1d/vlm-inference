His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. While undergoing an ECG, the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning. The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?\n\nA. Increases cAMP concentration\nB. Increases nitric oxide concentration\nC. Inhibits potassium flux\nD. Inhibits sodium flux\n"

This is because the patient's symptoms and history suggest that he may be experiencing angina or an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that can help relieve chest pain by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels, thereby increasing blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nDrugs that increase nitric oxide concentration include nitrates, such as sublingual nitroglycerin, which is commonly used to treat angina pectoris. Nitrates work by releasing nitric oxide in the vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow to the heart.\n\nOther options:\n\n- Option A (increases cAMP concentration) refers to drugs like beta-adrenergic agonists, which are not typically used for the immediate treatment of angina.\n- Option C (inhibits potassium flux) could refer to potassium channel blockers, which are not used for treating angina.\n- Option D (inhibits sodium flux) could refer to sodium channel blockers, which are primarily used as antiarrhythmics and not for the immediate relief of angina.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate immediate treatment for this patient would be a drug that increases nitric oxide concentration, such as sublingual nitroglycerin."
