The other woman did not know that her partner had a gun in the shopping bag. After the women placed three dresses into the shopping bag, a clerk became suspicious and approached the women. The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n"

The killing was accidental and unintended.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds individuals criminally liable for any deaths that occur during the commission of certain felonies, even if the death was unintentional. However, if the women can demonstrate that the discharge of the gun was purely accidental and not a result of their actions or negligence, it might mitigate their liability under the felony murder rule. This defense would hinge on proving that the discharge of the gun was unforeseeable and not a foreseeable consequence of their actions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of the jurisdiction's laws regarding felony murder and the circumstances surrounding the incident would play a crucial role in determining the strength of this defense."
