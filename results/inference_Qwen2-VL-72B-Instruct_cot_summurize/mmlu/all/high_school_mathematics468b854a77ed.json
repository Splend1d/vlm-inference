The product of two numbers is positive if both numbers are either positive or both negative.\n\nGiven the ranges for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), let's break it down:\n\nFor \\(a\\): \\(-3 \\leq a \\leq 1\\)\n\nFor \\(b\\): \\(-2 \\leq b \\leq 4\\)\n\nThe product \\(ab\\) will be positive in two scenarios:\n1. Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive.\n2. Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:\n\n### Scenario 1: Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive\n\nFor \\(a\\), the positive range is \\(0 < a \\leq 1\\). This gives us a length of 1 unit on the number line.\n\nFor \\(b\\), the positive range is \\(0 < b \\leq 4\\). This gives us a length of 4 units on the number line.\n\nThe area representing this scenario on a coordinate plane (where the x-axis represents \\(a\\) and the y-axis represents \\(b\\)) would be a rectangle with dimensions 1 by 4, giving an area of 4 square units.\n\n### Scenario 2: Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative\n\nFor \\(a\\), the negative range is \\(-3 \\leq a < 0\\). This gives us a length of 3 units on the number line.\n\nFor \\(b\\), the negative range is \\(-2 \\leq b < 0\\). This gives us a length of 2 units on the number line.\n\nThe area representing this scenario on a coordinate plane would be a rectangle with dimensions 3 by 2, giving an area of 6 square units.\n\n### Total Area for Positive Product\n\nAdding the areas from both scenarios gives us a total area of \\(4 + 6 = 10\\) square units where the product \\(ab\\) is positive.\n\n### Total Possible Area\n\nThe total possible area on the coordinate plane, considering all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) within their given ranges, is a rectangle with dimensions 4 (from -3 to 1 for \\(a\\)) by 6 (from -2 to 4 for \\(b\\)), giving a total area of \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) square units.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n\nThe probability that the product \\(ab\\) is positive is the ratio of the area where the product is positive to the total possible area:\n\n\\[P(ab > 0) = \\frac{10}{24} = \\frac{5}{12}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\)**."
