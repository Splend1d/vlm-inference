                    "text": "To determine the energy required to ionize helium, which means removing one electron from the helium atom in its ground state, we need to consider the process step-by-step.\n\n1. **Total Energy to Remove Both Electrons**: The total energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom is given as 79.0 eV.\n\n2. **Energy Levels of Helium**: Helium has two electrons in its ground state, both occupying the 1s orbital. When one electron is removed, the remaining electron experiences a different effective nuclear charge due to the reduced electron-electron repulsion.\n\n3. **Ionization Energy for Removing One Electron**: The first ionization energy (I1) is the energy required to remove the first electron from the neutral atom. For helium, this value is known and can be directly used if available. However, since it's not provided explicitly, we can infer it based on the total energy required to remove both electrons.\n\nGiven that the total energy to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV, and considering typical atomic properties, the energy required to remove the second electron (second ionization energy, I2) is generally higher than the first ionization energy (I1). This is because the remaining electron experiences a stronger effective nuclear charge after the first electron is removed.\n\nSince the exact values for I1 and I2 are not provided, but we know the sum of these energies is 79.0 eV, we can estimate or look up standard values for helium:\n\n- First Ionization Energy (I1) for He: 24.6 eV\n- Second Ionization Energy (I2) for He: 54.4 eV\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ I1 + I2 = 24.6 \\text{ eV} + 54.4 \\text{ eV} = 79.0 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThus, the energy required to ionize helium (remove one electron) is:\n\n**A. 24.6 eV**"
