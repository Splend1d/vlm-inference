                    "text": "On August 10, a retail stationery store sent the following purchase order to a wholesaler of office supply equipment: \"Please ship immediately 24 pairs (two dozen) 3 1/2-inch, right-handed scissors at your current list price of $4 per pair. \"The wholesaler received this purchase order on August 12. The next day, the wholesaler ascertained that there were only 18 pairs of 3 1/2-inch, right- handed scissors in stock. The wholesaler, however, found that he had six pairs of 3 1/2-inch, lefthanded scissors in stock. Without noti1'ing the stationery store, the wholesaler shipped the 18 pairs of right-handed scissors, along with the six pairs of left-handed scissors, to the stationery store. The stationery store was aware that the wholesale price for the left-handed scissors was $3 per pair, or $1 less than the list price for the right-handed scissors. Was an enforceable contract formed when the wholesaler shipped the 24 pairs of scissors to the stationery store?\n\nA. Yes, because the wholesaler's shipment constituted acceptance of the offer, absent a seasonable notification by the wholesaler to the stationery store that the shipment was made for accommodation only.\nB. Yes, because the wholesaler acted in good faith in making the shipment in reliance on the stationery store's offer.\nC. No, because the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered.\nD. No, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether an enforceable contract was formed between the retail stationery store and the wholesaler, we need to analyze the situation based on the principles of contract law, particularly focusing on the acceptance of offers and the shipment of goods.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**:\n   - The stationery store sent a purchase order to the wholesaler requesting 24 pairs of 3 1/2-inch, right-handed scissors at $4 per pair.\n   - The wholesaler received the order and shipped 18 pairs of right-handed scissors and 6 pairs of left-handed scissors without notifying the stationery store.\n\n2. **Nature of Acceptance**:\n   - Generally, acceptance must be unconditional and must match the terms of the offer. If the acceptance varies from the terms of the offer, it is considered a counter-offer rather than an acceptance.\n\n3. **Shipment of Non-Conforming Goods**:\n   - The wholesaler shipped 6 pairs of left-handed scissors instead of the right-handed ones specified in the offer. This constitutes a deviation from the original terms of the offer.\n\n4. **Reasonableness and Good Faith**:\n   - The wholesaler acted in good faith by attempting to fulfill the order as closely as possible given their inventory constraints.\n   - However, the shipment of non-conforming goods does not automatically constitute acceptance under all circumstances.\n\n5. **Legal Principles**:\n   - Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), if a seller ships non-conforming goods, they must notify the buyer promptly that the shipment is being made for accommodation only. Absent such notice, the shipment may not constitute acceptance.\n   - Additionally, the UCC allows for acceptance by performance, but this acceptance must conform to the terms of the offer unless the non-conforming goods are reasonably resalable.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. No, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable.**\n\nThis option correctly reflects that while the wholesaler attempted to fulfill the order, the shipment of non-conforming goods does not automatically constitute acceptance unless the non-conforming goods are reasonably resalable. Since the left-handed scissors are different from what was ordered and might not be reasonably resalable by the stationery store, an enforceable contract was not formed."
