And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously?\n\nA. The genealogy is derived from the maternal side.\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully.\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender.\n"

Studying Islamic law indicates a serious commitment to understanding and adhering to the religious teachings.\n\nC. \"The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\"\n   - While this might reflect a cultural norm or social behavior, it does not specifically relate to religious devotion.\n\nD. \"They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender.\"\n   - This statement describes social interactions but does not directly relate to religious practices or devotion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most compelling evidence that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously is found in option B: \"They study Islamic law faithfully.\"\n\nFinal answer: B. They study Islamic law faithfully."
