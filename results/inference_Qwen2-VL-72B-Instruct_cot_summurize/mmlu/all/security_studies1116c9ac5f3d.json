Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience.\n\nWhile it's important to recognize the severity of cyber threats and respond to them promptly (option B), it's also crucial to understand that complete eradication of threats (option A) is not feasible due to the constantly evolving nature of cyber attacks. Therefore, designing resilient IT systems and fostering international cooperation and information exchange (option D) are more practical and effective strategies for enhancing cybersecurity."
