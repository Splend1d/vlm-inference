                    "text": "A citrus grower was the owner in fee of two adjacent parcels of land in a city: an orange grove and a lemon grove. The grower's title to the lemon grove was subject to an unrecorded 20-year mortgage given to the mortgagee, a bank, in 1990 to secure repayment of a loan for $100,000. Beginning in November 1993, the following events occurred:November 1993: The grower died, leaving all of her real property to her husband. The grower's will was admitted to probate. No mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank. December 1993: Having heard about the grower's death, the bank recorded its mortgage to the lemon grove. August 1994: The husband executed and delivered to his sister a mortgage deed on the orange grove, which the sister immediately recorded. The mortgage instrument contained the following recitations: \"This mortgage is secured by the orange grove and all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in. \" The husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the sister; the amount due on the debt was $100,000. February 2009: The bank brought suit against the husband to foreclose its mortgage on the lemon grove. The applicable recording statute provides in part:\"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"Judgment should be for\n\nA. the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nB. the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\nC. the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nD. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Mortgage Creation**: The original mortgage was created in 1990 between the grower and the bank, securing a loan of $100,000 on the lemon grove.\n\n2. **Death of Grower**: In November 1993, the grower died, and her real property (including both the orange grove and the lemon grove) passed to her husband through her will.\n\n3. **Recording of Mortgage**: In December 1993, the bank recorded its mortgage on the lemon grove. This recording is significant because it provides notice to the public of the mortgage's existence.\n\n4. **Subsequent Mortgage**: In August 1994, the husband executed and delivered a mortgage to his sister on the orange grove, which included a clause extending the mortgage to all other real estate he owned in the city.\n\n5. **Default and Foreclosure**: The husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to his sister, and the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings in February 2009 to enforce its mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\n6. **Applicable Recording Statute**: The recording statute states that unrecorded instruments do not affect the title or rights of a devisee or purchaser in good faith without knowledge of the unrecorded instruments. However, this statute applies to unrecorded instruments, whereas the bank's mortgage was recorded in December 1993.\n\n7. **Successors in Interest**: The principle that property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest means that the mortgage continues to bind the property even after it passes to another person. Since the mortgage was recorded before the husband inherited the property, he took the property subject to the existing mortgage.\n\nTherefore, despite the husband's lack of awareness of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove, the recorded mortgage still binds the property. Thus, judgment should be for the bank."
