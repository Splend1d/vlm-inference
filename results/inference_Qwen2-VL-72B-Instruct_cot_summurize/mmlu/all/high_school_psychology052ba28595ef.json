Hearing voices that are not actually there.\n\nHallucinations involve perceiving something through one's senses (such as hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, or feeling) that does not exist in reality. Hearing voices when no one is speaking is a common type of auditory hallucination. The other options listed may represent delusions (false beliefs), but they do not describe hallucinations."
