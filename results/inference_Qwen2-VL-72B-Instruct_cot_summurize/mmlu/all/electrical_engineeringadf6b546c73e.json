The resistance \\( R \\) of a conductor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the resistivity of the material (a constant for a given material),\n- \\( l \\) is the length of the conductor,\n- \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.\n\nThe cross-sectional area \\( A \\) of a circular conductor is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the diameter of the conductor.\n\nGiven that the initial resistance is \\( R \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ R = \\rho \\frac{l}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2} \\]\n\nNow, if the diameter \\( d \\) is halved and the length \\( l \\) is doubled, the new diameter \\( d' \\) and length \\( l' \\) are:\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{d}{2} \\]\n\\[ l' = 2l \\]\n\nThe new cross-sectional area \\( A' \\) is:\n\n\\[ A' = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d'}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\frac{d}{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{16} \\]\n\nThe new resistance \\( R' \\) is:\n\n\\[ R' = \\rho \\frac{l'}{A'} = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{16}} = \\rho \\frac{2l \\cdot 16}{\\pi d^2} = 32 \\rho \\frac{l}{\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nComparing this with the original resistance \\( R \\):\n\n\\[ R' = 32 \\rho \\frac{l}{\\pi d^2} = 32 \\cdot R \\]\n\nTherefore, the new resistance \\( R' \\) is 32 times the original resistance \\( R \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 8R \u03a9"
