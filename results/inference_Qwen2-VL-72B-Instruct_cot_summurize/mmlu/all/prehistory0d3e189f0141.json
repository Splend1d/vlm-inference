Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA, which suggests that the interbreeding between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans took place outside of Africa, after anatomically modern humans had migrated out of the continent. This is consistent with genetic evidence indicating that gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans primarily occurred in Eurasia."
