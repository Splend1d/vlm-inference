Defenders of this view might argue that these qualities give humans greater moral significance or value, thereby justifying prioritizing human interests over those of animals. However, it's important to note that this perspective is controversial and many ethicists argue against it, emphasizing the importance of animal welfare and the need to consider their suffering seriously."
