Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.\nB. Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.\nC. Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.\nD. Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.\n"

Institutions are humanly devised constraints that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behavior.\n\nInstitutional constraints can significantly influence behavior by setting the boundaries within which individuals and groups operate. These constraints include formal rules like laws and regulations, as well as informal norms and customs that shape expectations and behaviors in society. By defining what is acceptable or expected behavior, institutions guide decision-making processes and can either facilitate or hinder certain actions. For example, legal systems establish penalties for certain behaviors, thereby discouraging those actions, while cultural norms may encourage specific behaviors through social rewards or acceptance. Thus, institutions play a crucial role in shaping how individuals and organizations behave within a given context."
