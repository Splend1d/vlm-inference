It involved the transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to settled agriculture.\n\n2. **Second Agricultural Revolution**: This is often associated with the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, where technological advancements significantly increased agricultural productivity.\n\n3. **Third Agricultural Revolution**: This term is sometimes used to describe the Green Revolution in the mid-20th century, characterized by the use of high-yield varieties of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.\n\n4. **Fourth Agricultural Revolution**: This is a more recent concept, referring to the current era of digitalization and automation in agriculture, including precision farming and robotics.\n\nGiven that the birth of an urban industrial workforce in Europe is closely tied to the Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, it aligns with the period of the Second Agricultural Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Second Agricultural Revolution.**"
