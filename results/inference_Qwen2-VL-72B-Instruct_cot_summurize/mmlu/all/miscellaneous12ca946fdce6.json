However, for the sake of this estimation, let's assume an average cost of $500 per vehicle for maintenance, repair, and operation of the air conditioning system over a year.\n\n3. **Total Cost Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Number of Vehicles} \\times \\text{Cost per Vehicle}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 278,000,000 \\times 500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 139,000,000,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated cost to air condition all American automobiles for a year is approximately $139 billion.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. $10m\nB. $100m\nC. $1 billion\nD. $10 billion\n\nThe closest option to our calculated estimate is:\n\nD. $10 billion"
