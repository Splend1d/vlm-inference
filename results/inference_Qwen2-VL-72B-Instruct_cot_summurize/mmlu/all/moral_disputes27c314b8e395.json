The key here is understanding that the analogy hinges on the idea of causing unnecessary harm to sentient beings for personal pleasure or convenience.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **We try to reduce our carbon footprint.**\n   - Reducing one's carbon footprint is about environmental impact rather than direct harm to sentient beings. While it can be argued that climate change affects all life forms, including animals, this option does not directly address the specific issue of causing unnecessary harm to sentient beings for personal pleasure.\n\nB. **We donate money to Oxfam.**\n   - Donating money to Oxfam is about helping alleviate poverty and hunger among humans. This is a noble cause but does not directly relate to the specific issue of causing unnecessary harm to sentient beings for personal pleasure.\n\nC. **We not support factory farming.**\n   - Factory farming involves practices that cause significant suffering to animals (such as chickens, pigs, and cows) for the purpose of producing food. This directly aligns with the analogy Norcross is making, as it involves causing unnecessary harm to sentient beings for human pleasure or convenience.\n\nD. **We follow the Golden Rule.**\n   - The Golden Rule (\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\") is a broad ethical principle that could apply to many situations. While it might indirectly suggest not causing unnecessary harm to animals, it is too general to be the precise conclusion Norcross is drawing based on his specific analogy.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of Norcross's analogy, the most fitting conclusion is:\n\n**C. We not support factory farming.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the core issue of causing unnecessary harm to sentient beings for personal pleasure, which is the essence of Norcross's argument."
