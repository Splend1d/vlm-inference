If a temporary increase in the behavior cannot be tolerated, operant extinction would not be the appropriate treatment choice. \n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n- A. An alternative behavior cannot be identified: While identifying an alternative behavior can be beneficial, it is not a requirement for operant extinction.\n- B. The behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule: Continuous reinforcement does not preclude the use of operant extinction; in fact, behaviors maintained by continuous reinforcement may extinguish more quickly than those maintained by intermittent reinforcement.\n- D. The baseline levels of the behavior cannot be established: Establishing baseline levels is important for measuring the effectiveness of any intervention, but it is not a direct contraindication for using operant extinction."
