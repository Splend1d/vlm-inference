This action seems helpful and supportive, not harmful or morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Sometimes, when no one was looking, I would give Jeff a push on the swing.\n\nThis scenario involves an action that could potentially be harmful or dangerous, especially if it was done without Jeff's consent or if it caused him to fall off the swing. Pushing someone unexpectedly can be considered morally wrong because it may cause harm or distress.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
