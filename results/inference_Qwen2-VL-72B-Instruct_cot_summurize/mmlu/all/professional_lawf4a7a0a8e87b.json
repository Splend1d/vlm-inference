The man decided to set fire to the waste paper in a trash container. He hoped that the fire would serve as a diversion so he and his date could run out of the restaurant without paying. He set fire to the waste paper and then went back to his table. As he anxiously waited, the maitre d' grabbed the man and told him that he had seen what occurred in the bathroom. The maitre d', who had been seated in a bathroom stall, saw the man, through a crack in the door, set the fire. The maitre d' extinguished the fire, which had charred a portion of the ceiling. This jurisdiction defines arson as the malicious burning of any structure.

Arson is typically defined as the malicious burning of any structure.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. **Guilty, because he was reckless as to the restaurant's being damaged by fire.**\n   - Recklessness involves acting with disregard for the consequences. While the man may have been reckless, the key element here is malice, which implies intentional harm.\n\nB. **Guilty, because he set the fire for the purpose of committing an unlawful act.**\n   - This option aligns well with the definition of arson. The man intentionally set the fire to create a diversion, which is an unlawful act. His intention to cause damage (even if indirectly) fits the malicious intent required for arson.\n\nC. **Not guilty, because he did not intend to burn down the restaurant.**\n   - Intent to burn down the entire structure isn't necessary for arson. The man's intention to start a fire for an unlawful purpose is sufficient to meet the criteria of malice.\n\nD. **Not guilty, because the fire only charred a portion of the ceiling.**\n   - The extent of the damage does not negate the malicious intent behind setting the fire. Even minor damage can still constitute arson if it was done maliciously.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Guilty, because he set the fire for the purpose of committing an unlawful act.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the man's malicious intent and the unlawful nature of his actions, which are central to the crime of arson."
