Demand for white Ford minivans\n\nThe demand for a specific product, such as white Ford minivans, is more likely to be elastic because consumers can easily switch to similar products if the price changes. In contrast, the demand for broader categories of goods, such as all automobiles or all American-made automobiles, is less likely to be elastic because there are fewer substitutes available."
