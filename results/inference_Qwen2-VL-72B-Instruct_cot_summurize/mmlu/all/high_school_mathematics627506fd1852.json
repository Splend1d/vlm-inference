The resulting product matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix.\n\nGiven:\n- Matrix \\(A\\) is \\(2 \\times 7\\)\n- Matrix \\(B\\) is \\(7 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe product matrix \\(AB\\) will have the same number of rows as \\(A\\) (which is 2) and the same number of columns as \\(B\\) (which is 5). Therefore, the dimensions of the product matrix \\(AB\\) are \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2 \u00d7 5"
