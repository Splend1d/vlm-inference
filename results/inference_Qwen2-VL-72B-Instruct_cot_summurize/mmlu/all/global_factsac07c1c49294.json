The question asks for the percentage of people in Tunisia who believe that an increasing number of diverse populations makes their country a better place to live.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 24%\nB. 39%\nC. 54%\nD. 69%\n\nWe can infer that the percentage should be a reasonable estimate based on typical survey results regarding diversity and its perceived benefits. \n\nOption A (24%) seems quite low, suggesting only a small minority holds this view.\nOption B (39%) is moderate but still relatively low.\nOption C (54%) suggests a majority opinion, which could be plausible.\nOption D (69%) indicates a strong majority, which might also be possible depending on the specific cultural and social dynamics in Tunisia.\n\nConsidering the context and the nature of such surveys, a majority view is often more likely to be reported in positive attitudes towards diversity. Therefore, the most reasonable choice would be:\n\nC. 54%"
