This type of memory is not tied to personal experiences or specific events (which would be episodic memory), nor does it involve skills or procedures (which would be procedural memory). Eidetic memory, also known as photographic memory, is a rare ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in detail after only a few instances of exposure, which is not relevant to the given example."
