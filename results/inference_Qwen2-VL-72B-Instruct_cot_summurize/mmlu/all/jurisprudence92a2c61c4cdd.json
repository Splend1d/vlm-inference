Because Aristotle believed that man is a 'social animal'\n\nCommunitarianism emphasizes the importance of community and social bonds in shaping individual identity and values, which aligns with Aristotle's view that humans are inherently social beings who find fulfillment through participation in community life. This contrasts with Kant's emphasis on individual autonomy and moral principles that apply universally to all rational beings, independent of their social context."
