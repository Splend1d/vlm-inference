The ordinance is broad, stating only that the mayor can use his discretion in granting permits. If someone just extemporaneously gives a political speech in the park without a permit and were arrested and convicted, would this be constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because the ordinance controls.\nB. Yes, because he didn't have a permit.\nC. No, the ordinance is void on its face.\nD. No, because it is a public park.\n"

No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\nThe reason for this is that the ordinance grants the mayor unfettered discretion in deciding who may receive a permit to speak in the city park. This lack of clear standards or guidelines violates the principle of due process and equal protection under the law. Such an ordinance could be used to discriminate against speakers based on their viewpoints, which would be unconstitutional under the First Amendment's protection of free speech. Therefore, the ordinance is likely to be considered void on its face, meaning it is invalid from the outset due to its inherent flaws."
