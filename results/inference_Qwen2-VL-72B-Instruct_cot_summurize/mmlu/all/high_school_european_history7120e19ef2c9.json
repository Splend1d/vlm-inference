I have neither the desire nor the authority to judge today's generation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the generation of Hitler.\nBut we may\u2014and we must\u2014hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past. And for what it does with the memory of the past. In remembering, you will help your own people vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history. Remember: a community that does not come to terms with the dead will continue to traumatize the living.\nWe remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\nElie Wiesel, \"Reflections of a Survivor,\" 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Wiesel asserted that remembering the Holocaust\n\nA. was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history\nB. hindered the healing process for the German people\nC. would ensure that it never occurred again\nD. would allow the Jews to forgive the German people\n"

Elie Wiesel emphasizes the importance of memory in overcoming the ghosts of history and achieving salvation and redemption. Therefore, option A accurately reflects Wiesel's assertion about the necessity of remembering the Holocaust for the German people to reconcile with their history."
