Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.\nB. TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.\nC. Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.\nD. International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.\n"

International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.\n\nGlobalization, characterized by increased interconnectedness and integration of economies, societies, and cultures across borders, facilitated the expansion of transnational crime in the 1990s. This was due to several factors:\n\n1. **Improved Communication and Transportation Networks**: Globalization led to advancements in communication technologies and transportation systems, making it easier for criminals to coordinate their activities across borders and transport illicit goods.\n\n2. **Economic Liberalization**: The reduction of trade barriers and the liberalization of economies created new opportunities for criminal enterprises to engage in illegal activities such as money laundering, intellectual property theft, and trafficking.\n\n3. **Political Changes**: The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to political instability in many regions, creating power vacuums that were exploited by criminal organizations.\n\n4. **Weakened State Control**: Globalization often leads to the weakening of state control over borders and territories, allowing criminal networks to operate more freely.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C contain elements of truth, they do not fully capture the multifaceted nature of how globalization specifically enabled the expansion of transnational crime during this period."
