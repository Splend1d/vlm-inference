In this case, the goal is to study the effect of music on piecework output. Therefore, the control group should not receive any of the experimental treatments (i.e., it should not hear any specific type of music).\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A third group for which no music is played - This option provides a clear baseline because it eliminates the variable of music entirely, allowing for a direct comparison with the groups exposed to classical or light rock music.\n\nB. A third group that randomly hears either classical or light rock music each day - This option introduces variability in the type of music heard, which complicates the interpretation of results since it mixes the two experimental conditions.\n\nC. A third group that hears day-long R & B music - This option introduces a different type of music, which does not serve as a neutral baseline but rather as another experimental condition.\n\nD. A third group that hears classical music every morning and light rock every afternoon - This option combines elements of both experimental conditions, making it difficult to isolate the effect of each type of music.\n\nTherefore, the best choice for a control group in this study is:\n\nA. A third group for which no music is played"
