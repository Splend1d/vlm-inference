This is because individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they have personal control over their lives and outcomes, including their living environment. They are more likely to take proactive steps to address any accessibility issues they encounter, making adjustments or seeking solutions to ensure their living space meets their needs. In contrast, those with external forms of control may feel less empowered to make changes and more likely to attribute difficulties to external factors beyond their control."
