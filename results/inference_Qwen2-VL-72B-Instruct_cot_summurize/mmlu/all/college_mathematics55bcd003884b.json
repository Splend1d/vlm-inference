This follows from Fermat's theorem in calculus.\n- However, not all functions are differentiable everywhere. For example, consider the function \\( f(x) = |x| \\) on the interval \\([-1, 1]\\). The function has a local maximum at \\( x = 0 \\), but \\( f'(0) \\) does not exist because the derivative is undefined at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is false**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\).\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- A map (function) from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) means taking real numbers as inputs and producing rational numbers as outputs.\n- For such a function to be continuous, it must satisfy the definition of continuity for every point in its domain.\n- The set of rational numbers \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is countable, whereas the set of real numbers \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is uncountable.\n- If there were a non-constant continuous function from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), it would imply that the image of an uncountable set under this function is countable, which contradicts the intermediate value theorem. According to the intermediate value theorem, any continuous function mapping an interval to the reals must take on every value between any two values in its range. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is dense in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), any continuous function from \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) would have to be constant.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is D. False, False."
