Use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing**\n\nThis option addresses the increased risk by leveraging the expertise and experience of more seasoned auditors who can better handle complex issues and ensure that the audit is conducted thoroughly and accurately. This approach helps mitigate the risks identified during the interim audit and ensures that the year-end audit is performed with greater scrutiny and competence.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options might not be as suitable:\n\n- **A. Move detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim**: While this could potentially help identify issues earlier, it does not directly address the need for more rigorous or competent handling of the identified risks at year-end.\n\n- **B. Increase the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices**: Increasing the threshold might reduce the number of invoices reviewed but does not necessarily enhance the quality or thoroughness of the audit, especially if the errors found were significant or pervasive.\n\n- **C. Send negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive accounts receivable confirmations**: The type of confirmation (negative vs. positive) used depends on various factors such as materiality, risk, and the nature of the account balances. Changing the confirmation method alone may not sufficiently address the increased risk identified.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most appropriate response given the context of increased risk due to unexpected errors found during the interim audit."
