Since Grady rides \\(60\\%\\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \\(v + 0.6v = 1.6v\\) miles per hour.\n\nIn two hours, the distance covered by Noah is \\(2v\\) miles, and the distance covered by Grady is \\(2 \\times 1.6v = 3.2v\\) miles.\n\nWe're told that Grady rides \\(12\\) miles further than Noah in these two hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[3.2v - 2v = 12\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\):\n\n\\[1.2v = 12\\]\n\n\\[v = \\frac{12}{1.2}\\]\n\n\\[v = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, Noah rides at a speed of \\(10\\) miles per hour.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 10."
