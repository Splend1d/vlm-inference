The uncertainty in the kinetic energy due to the uncertainty in velocity can be found using error propagation. For a function \\( f(x) \\), where \\( x \\) has an uncertainty \\( \\Delta x \\), the uncertainty in \\( f(x) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta f = \\left| \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right| \\Delta x \\]\n\nIn our case, \\( f(v) = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = mv \\]\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy \\( \\Delta KE \\) due to the uncertainty in velocity \\( \\Delta v \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = mv \\cdot \\Delta v \\]\n\nSince the uncertainty in the velocity \\( \\Delta v \\) is 10% of \\( v \\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = mv \\cdot 0.1v = 0.1mv^2 \\]\n\nThis means the uncertainty in the kinetic energy is 10% of the kinetic energy itself.
