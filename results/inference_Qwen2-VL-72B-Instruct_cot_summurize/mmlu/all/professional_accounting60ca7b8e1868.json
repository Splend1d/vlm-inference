This does not directly affect current assets or liabilities.\n   - Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods increases inventory (a current asset), while reducing cost of goods sold (which affects net income and retained earnings).\n   - Since allocating the variances increases current assets (inventory) without changing current liabilities, the current ratio would increase.\n\n2. **Net Income:**\n   - Writing off the variances directly to cost of goods sold increases the cost of goods sold, thereby reducing net income.\n   - Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods means that these costs are capitalized and recognized as expenses when the products are sold. This results in lower cost of goods sold in the current period, leading to higher net income.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- The current ratio would increase because current assets (inventory) increase.\n- Net income would also increase because the cost of goods sold is reduced in the current period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Increases Increases**"
