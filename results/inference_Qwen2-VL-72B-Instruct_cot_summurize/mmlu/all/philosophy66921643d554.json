They frequently address the well-being of all sentient beings, reflecting a broader ethical concern.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and inclusive option is:\n\n**B. make take into account the interests of all sentient beings.**\n\nThis aligns with many contemporary ethical theories that advocate for the consideration of the well-being of all sentient beings, not just humans."
