                    "text": "To determine which statement correctly compares the properties of the two gases, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n### A. The average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nThe average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is given by the equation:\n\\[ \\text{KE}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{3}{2} kT \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\( T \\) is the temperature. Since both containers are at thermal equilibrium with the room, their temperatures are the same. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas molecules will be equal to that of the nitrogen gas molecules.\n\n### B. The average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas.\n\nThe force exerted by a gas on its container walls is related to the pressure of the gas. Pressure is given by:\n\\[ P = \\frac{NkT}{V} \\]\nwhere \\( N \\) is the number of molecules, \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\( T \\) is the temperature, and \\( V \\) is the volume. Without knowing the number of molecules (\\( N \\)) in each container, we cannot compare the pressures directly. Hence, we cannot conclude that the average force exerted by one gas is greater than the other based solely on the type of gas.\n\n### C. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\n\nDensity (\\( \\rho \\)) is defined as mass per unit volume:\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} \\]\nFor an ideal gas, the mass can be expressed in terms of the number of moles (\\( n \\)), molar mass (\\( M \\)), and Avogadro's number (\\( N_A \\)):\n\\[ m = nM = \\frac{N}{N_A}M \\]\nThus, the density becomes:\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{\\frac{N}{N_A}M}{V} = \\frac{NM}{VN_A} \\]\n\nGiven that the volumes of the containers are the same and assuming the number of molecules (\\( N \\)) is the same for simplicity (since we don't have specific information about the number of molecules), the density depends on the molar mass (\\( M \\)). Hydrogen has a lower molar mass (2 g/mol) compared to nitrogen (28 g/mol). Therefore, the density of hydrogen gas is indeed less than that of nitrogen gas.\n\n### D. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n\nThis statement is correct because the pressure of a gas depends on the number of molecules, temperature, and volume. Without knowing the number of molecules in each container, we cannot directly compare the pressures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct comparison of the properties of the two gases is:\n\n**C. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.**"
