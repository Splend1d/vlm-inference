We notice that the remainders repeat every three powers of 2.\nSince $87 \\div 3 = 29$, we know that $2^{87}$ has the same remainder as $2^3$ when divided by 7, which is 1.\nTherefore, $2^{87} + 3 \\equiv 1 + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\nThe remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by 7 is 4. The answer is: D"
