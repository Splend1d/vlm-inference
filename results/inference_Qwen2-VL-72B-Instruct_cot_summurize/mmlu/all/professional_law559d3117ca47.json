The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nIn corporate governance, certain proposals require approval from both classes of stockholders when they affect the rights or preferences of either class. Since the new class of preferred stock with redemption rights would come ahead of the existing preferred stock, it impacts the rights of the current preferred shareholders. Therefore, the approval of the proposal requires a majority of both the common and preferred shareholders. In this case, while the common shareholders approved the proposal (700 out of 1,000), the preferred shareholders did not (only 400 out of 1,000). Thus, the proposal is invalidly approved because it did not receive the necessary majority support from the preferred shareholders."
