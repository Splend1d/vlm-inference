Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes apply the same rules of international law\nB. It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law\nC. Fragmentation is when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law\nD. Fragmentation is when States disagree to abide by a certain rule of international law\n"

It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law.\n\nFragmentation in international law refers to the phenomenon where different branches or regimes of international law may evolve independently and sometimes in conflict with one another. This can lead to inconsistencies and contradictions within the body of international law, making it difficult to reconcile different legal norms and principles that may arise from these separate regimes."
