One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\nA. not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\nB. not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\nC. guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\nD. guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the suspect should be found guilty or not guilty, we need to analyze the situation based on the information provided and the relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Statute Analysis**: The state statute mandates that a person must refrain from using force or any weapon when being arrested by a police officer, regardless of whether they know or should know they are being arrested. This implies that the suspect has a legal obligation to comply with the arrest without resistance.\n\n2. **Lawful vs. Unlawful Arrest**: The legality of the arrest is crucial. If the arrest was unlawful (i.e., without probable cause), the suspect may have grounds for self-defense or resisting an unlawful arrest. However, if the arrest was lawful, the suspect is bound by the statute to refrain from using force.\n\n3. **Jury Belief**: The jury's belief in either the police officer's or the suspect's account will influence their decision regarding the suspect's actions.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A**: If the arrest was unlawful and the jury believes the suspect's account, the suspect might have a defense against the charge of assault because the use of force could be justified as resisting an unlawful arrest.\n  \n- **Option B**: If the arrest was lawful but the jury believes the suspect's account, the suspect would still be bound by the statute to refrain from using force, making this option incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: If the arrest was lawful, regardless of which account the jury believes, the suspect is still bound by the statute to refrain from using force, making this option correct.\n\n- **Option D**: If the arrest was unlawful, regardless of which account the jury believes, the suspect might have a defense based on resisting an unlawful arrest, making this option incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.**"
