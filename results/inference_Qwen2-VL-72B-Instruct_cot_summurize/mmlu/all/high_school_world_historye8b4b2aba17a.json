He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all. This is the Spirit that is in my heart, this is Brahman. To him I shall come when I go beyond this life, and to him will come he who has faith and doubts not.\n\u2014The Upanishads, India, c. 1000 BCE\nBased on the quotation, which statement is true of the speaker's religion?\n\nA. Salvation is based on the correct completion of rituals.\nB. There is an expectation of an afterlife.\nC. Right actions and right speech earn favor with the gods.\nD. It is a polytheistic religion.\n"

There is an expectation of an afterlife.**\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
