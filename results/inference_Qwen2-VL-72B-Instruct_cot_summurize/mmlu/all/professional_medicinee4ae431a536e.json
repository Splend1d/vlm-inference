His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?\n\nA. Avoid areas known to have bees\nB. Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside\nC. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets\nD. Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n"

Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n\nGiven the history of increasingly severe reactions to bee stings, it is important to be prepared for potential anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Self-injectable epinephrine (such as EpiPen) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and should be readily available for immediate use if needed. Additionally, the child should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation and possible desensitization therapy."
