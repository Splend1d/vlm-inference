For example, Confucianism, which has had a significant influence on both Chinese and Korean cultures, places a strong emphasis on moral virtues, social harmony, and the cultivation of wisdom. Similarly, Buddhism, another major religion in these regions, focuses on ethical living, wisdom, and the attainment of enlightenment. Taoism, another important tradition in China, also stresses the importance of living in harmony with the natural order and cultivating wisdom."
