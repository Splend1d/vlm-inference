He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication\nB. Alcohol withdrawal\nC. Fat emboli\nD. Sepsis\n"

Fat emboli.\n\nFat emboli can occur as a complication of long bone fractures, such as the one this patient sustained in his right femur. The symptoms described, including agitation, confusion, hypertension, and neurologic findings like tremulousness, are consistent with fat embolism syndrome. This condition occurs when fat globules enter the bloodstream and travel to various organs, including the brain, leading to symptoms that can mimic those of other conditions like sepsis or medication adverse effects.\n\nWhile the other options could also cause similar symptoms, the history of a recent long bone fracture makes fat emboli the most likely diagnosis in this context."
