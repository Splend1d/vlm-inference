HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus.\nC. Whilst HM recognises the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, it also purports that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite.\nD. All of the above\n"

All of the above\n\nExplanation:\n- Option A is correct because both Historical Materialism (HM) and realism acknowledge the existence of objective realities within society.\n- Option B is correct because HM shares some similarities with other theories like realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it uniquely emphasizes class conflict within capitalism.\n- Option C is correct because HM does recognize the role of the state in the international system, but it argues that states primarily serve the interests of the ruling class.\n\nTherefore, all the statements accurately describe the relationship between HM and realism."
