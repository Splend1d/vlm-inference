The options provided suggest that the confidence interval should be symmetric around zero if the intercept estimate is close to zero, which is typical for many models.\n\nWithout the actual data, it's impossible to definitively choose the correct answer. However, based on the symmetry and typical range of confidence intervals, option B appears to be the most reasonable choice because it is centered around zero and has a wider range than the others, which might be expected for a 95% confidence interval.\n\nSo, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nB. (-4.16,4.16)\n\nPlease note that without the actual data and calculations, this is an educated guess based on the typical characteristics of confidence intervals."
