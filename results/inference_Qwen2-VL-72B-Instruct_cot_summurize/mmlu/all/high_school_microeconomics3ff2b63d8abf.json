Increase price because demand is inelastic.\n\nWhen the demand price elasticity is less than 1 (in this case, 0.78), it indicates that demand is inelastic. This means that a change in price will result in a proportionally smaller change in quantity demanded. Therefore, if a business increases its prices, the total revenue will likely increase because the percentage increase in price will outweigh the percentage decrease in quantity demanded. Conversely, decreasing prices would not be as effective in increasing revenue because the quantity demanded would not increase enough to compensate for the lower price."
