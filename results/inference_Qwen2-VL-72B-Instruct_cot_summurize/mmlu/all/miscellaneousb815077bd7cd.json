It is important to vaccinate dogs against parvovirus as part of their routine veterinary care. Cats, hamsters, and birds are not typically vaccinated for parvovirus because they are not susceptible to the canine parvovirus. However, cats can contract feline parvovirus (also known as feline panleukopenia), which is a different virus and requires a separate vaccine."
