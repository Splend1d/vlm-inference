Therefore, the policies that would most likely lead to such an increase are those that stimulate aggregate demand.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: A decrease in taxes and a lower discount rate**\n- Decrease in taxes increases consumption.\n- Lower discount rate encourages lending and investment.\nBoth these actions would increase aggregate demand, making this a strong candidate.\n\n**Option B: An increase in government spending and an increase in taxes**\n- Increase in government spending increases aggregate demand.\n- Increase in taxes decreases consumption.\nThe net effect depends on the magnitude of each change, but generally, an increase in taxes would offset some of the stimulus from increased government spending.\n\n**Option C: A decrease in taxes and selling bonds in an open market operation**\n- Decrease in taxes increases consumption.\n- Selling bonds in an open market operation reduces the money supply, which could decrease interest rates and potentially affect investment and consumption negatively.\nThis combination might not be as effective in increasing aggregate demand as Option A.\n\n**Option D: An increase in government spending and an increase in the discount rate**\n- Increase in government spending increases aggregate demand.\n- Increase in the discount rate discourages lending and reduces investment.\nAgain, the net effect depends on the magnitude of each change, but the increase in the discount rate would offset some of the stimulus from increased government spending.\n\nConsidering the goal is to increase aggregate demand significantly, **Option A (a decrease in taxes and a lower discount rate)** is the most likely combination of policies to have brought the economy to its current state with a higher real GDP than the full employment level."
