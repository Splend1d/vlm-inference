The government increases taxes and decreases spending.\n\nWhen the economy is experiencing an inflationary gap, it means that aggregate demand exceeds the economy's productive capacity, leading to rising prices. To address this issue, contractionary fiscal policy is needed to reduce aggregate demand. Increasing taxes and decreasing spending both help to reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy, thereby reducing demand and helping to control inflation."
