The resident then refused to pay for the repairs due to the contractor's non-compliance with the licensing fee.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.**\n   - This option suggests that despite the contract being void due to the violation of law (the licensing fee), the homeowner would still have to pay the reasonable value of the work done. This could be based on the principle of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit, where the homeowner benefits from the work and should compensate the contractor for the value received.\n\nB. **Although the contract violates the law, the court will find that public policy does not bar enforcement of the contract, because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue.**\n   - This option implies that even though the contract technically violates the law, public policy considerations might allow its enforcement since the licensing fee's primary purpose is revenue generation rather than ensuring safety or quality standards. However, this reasoning is less common in legal practice as contracts violating licensing laws are typically considered void.\n\nC. **Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.**\n   - This option states that since the contract violates the law (due to the licensing fee requirement), it is void and unenforceable. This is a straightforward application of the law, where contracts that violate statutory requirements are generally not enforced.\n\nD. **Because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue, the court will find that the contract does not violate the law but will allow the contractor to recover his costs only.**\n   - This option suggests that the contract is not void because the licensing fee's purpose is revenue generation. However, it also limits the contractor's recovery to just their costs, not necessarily the full amount billed. This is an unusual interpretation and less likely given the clear statutory violation.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most likely ruling by the court would be:\n\n**C. Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.**\n\nThis option aligns with the general legal principle that contracts violating statutory requirements are void and unenforceable."
