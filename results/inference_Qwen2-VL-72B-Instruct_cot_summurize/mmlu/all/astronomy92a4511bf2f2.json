From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.\n\nThe age of the Earth is determined primarily through radiometric dating techniques, which involve measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes in rocks and meteorites. This method provides a reliable way to estimate the age of the Earth, which is approximately 4.54 billion years old."
