                    "text": "To determine whether the pedestrian would prevail in a lawsuit against the boy for recovering damages due to his injury, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Reasonable Belief and Intervening Action**:\n   - The pedestrian intervened based on a reasonable belief that the boy was about to injure his brother. This belief was mistaken but reasonable given the circumstances.\n\n2. **Accidental Fall and Injury**:\n   - The boy stumbled and accidentally knocked the pedestrian to the ground, resulting in the pedestrian breaking his arm.\n\n3. **Legal Principles**:\n   - **Assumption of Risk**: This defense is applicable when the plaintiff voluntarily engages in an activity knowing the risks involved. However, in this case, the pedestrian did not voluntarily engage in a risky activity; he intervened to prevent what he perceived as a fight.\n   - **Negligence**: The pedestrian's injury occurred due to an accidental stumble by the boy. To hold the boy liable, it must be shown that the boy acted negligently (i.e., failed to act with reasonable care).\n   - **Transferred Intent**: This doctrine applies when the defendant intends to harm one person but unintentionally harms another. It does not seem relevant here since there was no intent to harm anyone.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Prevail, because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure his brother**:\n   - This belief does not directly impact the liability of the boy for the pedestrian's injury. Reasonable belief does not establish negligence or intent on the part of the boy.\n\nB. **Prevail, based upon the doctrine of transferred intent**:\n   - Transferred intent is not applicable here since there was no intent to harm anyone.\n\nC. **Not prevail, because the pedestrian assumed the risk**:\n   - The pedestrian did not assume any inherent risk by intervening. He acted out of concern for preventing potential harm, which is not inherently risky behavior.\n\nD. **Not prevail, unless the boy was negligent**:\n   - This is the most accurate statement. For the pedestrian to prevail, he must show that the boy was negligent. Negligence requires a failure to exercise reasonable care, which led to the pedestrian's injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.**"
