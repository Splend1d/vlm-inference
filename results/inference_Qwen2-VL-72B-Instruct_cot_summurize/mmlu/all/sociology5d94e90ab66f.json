They also suggest that no single theory can claim superiority over others, advocating for a more relativistic approach to knowledge. Furthermore, they emphasize the need for new theoretical frameworks to understand the complexities of contemporary society. Therefore, options A, B, and C all capture aspects of post-modernist thought."
