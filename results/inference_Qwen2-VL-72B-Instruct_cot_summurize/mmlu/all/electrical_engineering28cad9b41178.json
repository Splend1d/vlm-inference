Both A and B.\n\nLow-frequency supply is indeed necessary for direct core type induction furnaces due to two main reasons:\n\n1. **Severe Stirring Action**: At higher frequencies, the electromagnetic forces can cause excessive stirring in the molten metal, which can lead to turbulence and potentially damage the furnace lining or affect the quality of the molten material.\n\n2. **Magnetic Coupling**: The magnetic coupling between the primary (induction coil) and secondary (molten metal) circuits is more efficient at lower frequencies. This means that the energy transfer from the coil to the molten metal is more effective, leading to better heating efficiency.\n\nTherefore, both points A and B are valid reasons why low-frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces."
