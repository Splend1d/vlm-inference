So, if \\( W \\) represents the number of white cars and \\( B \\) represents the number of blue cars, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{B}{W} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( W = 15 \\), we can substitute this value into the equation to solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{B}{15} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nCross-multiply to solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ 3B = 5 \\times 15 \\]\n\\[ 3B = 75 \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{75}{3} \\]\n\\[ B = 25 \\]\n\nSo, the company will make 25 blue cars. The correct answer is D. 25."
