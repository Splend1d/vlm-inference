The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nC. permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.\nD. permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.\n"

The prosecutor's request to examine the defendant's arms for needle marks is aimed at challenging the defendant's credibility regarding his claim of sobriety. If the defendant has needle marks, it could undermine his credibility and suggest that he may still be using heroin, which would directly contradict his testimony.\n\nWhile the defendant does have a privilege against self-incrimination, this privilege generally applies to compelled testimonial evidence rather than physical evidence. By testifying, the defendant has opened the door to questions related to his credibility and the truthfulness of his statements. Therefore, the prosecutor's request is permissible as it pertains to the defendant's credibility and the truthfulness of his claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the privilege against self-incrimination typically does not extend to physical evidence like needle marks.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the examination of the defendant's arms might carry some risk of prejudice, the relevance of the evidence to the defendant's credibility likely outweighs any potential prejudice.\n\nOption D is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While the defendant has indeed waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand, the primary reason the request is permissible here is due to its relevance to the defendant's credibility rather than just the waiver itself."
