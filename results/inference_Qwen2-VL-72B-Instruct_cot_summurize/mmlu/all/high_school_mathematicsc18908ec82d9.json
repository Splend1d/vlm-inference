This means that the quadratic equation formed by setting \\(y_1 = y_2\\) must have exactly one solution, which implies its discriminant must be zero.\n\nSetting \\(y_1 = y_2\\), we get:\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\\]\n\nRearranging terms gives us:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 7 - b\\). For this equation to have exactly one solution, its discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) must be equal to zero. The discriminant is given by \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\nSubstituting the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) into the formula for the discriminant, we get:\n\n\\[\\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[16 - 4(7 - b) = 0\\]\n\\[16 - 28 + 4b = 0\\]\n\\[4b = 12\\]\n\\[b = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(b\\) that makes the parabola and the line intersect at only one point is \\(3\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 3."
