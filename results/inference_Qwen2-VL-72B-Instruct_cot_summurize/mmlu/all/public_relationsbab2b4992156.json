This step is crucial because it determines how the new information will be understood and integrated into one's cognitive framework, which can then lead to changes in behavior. The other options listed (coorientation, opinion change, and reaction formation) are related to different aspects of social interaction and psychological processes but do not directly describe the step between gaining information and changing behavior according to working theories in psychology."
