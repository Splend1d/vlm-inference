Note that when we differentiate the left side, we get a series similar to the one we're interested in evaluating:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dr} S = \\frac{d}{dr} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kr^{k-1}.\\]\n\nDifferentiating the right side gives us:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dr} \\frac{1}{1-r} = \\frac{1}{(1-r)^2}.\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} kr^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-r)^2}.\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\) into this equation gives us the sum we want to find:\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{k-1} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = 4.\\]\n\nHowever, notice that our original series is slightly different because it starts from \\(k=1\\) and has \\(k\\) in the numerator without the exponent being reduced by 1. To adjust for this, we need to multiply the result by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (since each term in our original series is effectively half of what we calculated due to the exponent difference):\n\\[4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2.\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series is 2, which corresponds to option C."
