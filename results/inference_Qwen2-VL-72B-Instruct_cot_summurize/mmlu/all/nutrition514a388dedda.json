All of the options given are correct\n\nThe doubly labelled water (DLW) technique is a highly accurate method for measuring total energy expenditure and thus can be used to identify under-reporting of usual intake. However, it has several disadvantages:\n\nA. It uses a sophisticated analytical technique: The DLW method requires specialized equipment and expertise to measure the isotopic ratios in urine or breath samples, making it expensive and not widely accessible.\n\nB. It provides a marker for energy intake only: While DLW accurately measures total energy expenditure, it does not provide information on the specific types or amounts of macronutrients or micronutrients consumed.\n\nC. Mis-reporting of low energy content foods would not be identified: Since DLW measures total energy expenditure rather than specific food intakes, it may not detect misreporting of foods that have low energy content but could still be important for nutritional assessment.\n\nTherefore, all the options listed are indeed disadvantages of using the doubly labelled water technique to identify under-reporting of usual intake."
