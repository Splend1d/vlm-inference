This process is known as social comparison, where people evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others. In this context, high-anxiety participants likely felt more comfortable or justified in their anxiety when surrounded by others who were similarly anxious, thus explaining their preference to affiliate with high-anxiety peers."
