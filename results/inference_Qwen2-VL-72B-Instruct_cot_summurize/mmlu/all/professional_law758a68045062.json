                    "text": "A family had been traveling cross-country on a camping trip when they decided to pull into Yellowstone National Park. During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire. While these helicopters were fighting the blaze from above, the smoke \u0080\u00a2 surrounding one of the helicopters became so intense that the pilot lost all visibility. At the same time, an operator of a small private plane saw the blaze and recklessly descended into the smoke. In the pilot's attempt to veer out of the intense smoke, his helicopter collided with the operator's low- flying plane, causing the aircrafts to crash. Both the pilot and the operator were killed in the resulting explosion. In a wrongful death action brought by the pilot's estate against the son and the father, the judgment should be for\n\nA. the pilot's estate, because the son was negligent in failing to properly extinguish the campfire.\nB. the pilot's estate, because the father is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his child.\nC. the father and the son, because the operator's reckless operation of his aircraft would be viewed as a superseding cause terminating the defendant's liability.\nD. the father and the son, because the son was only 12 years old and, therefore, cannot be deemed to have acted negligently.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the wrongful death action brought by the pilot's estate against the son and the father involves several legal considerations, including negligence, vicarious liability, and the concept of a superseding cause.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Negligence:**\n   - The son was instructed to put out the campfire but failed to do so adequately, leading to the fire spreading and causing a forest fire. This failure to properly extinguish the fire can be considered negligence on the part of the son.\n   \n2. **Vicarious Liability:**\n   - The father could be held vicariously liable for the actions of his minor child (the son) if it can be shown that the son was acting under the father's supervision or instruction at the time of the incident.\n\n3. **Superseding Cause:**\n   - The reckless operation of the small private plane by its operator could be argued as a superseding cause, which is an intervening event that breaks the chain of causation between the original negligent act (failure to extinguish the fire) and the ultimate harm (the helicopter crash).\n\n4. **Age of the Son:**\n   - The son's age (12 years old) does not automatically exempt him from liability. Minors can be held liable for negligence if they are capable of understanding the nature of their actions and the potential consequences.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the circumstances, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. the pilot's estate, because the father is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of his child.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the negligence of the son in failing to properly extinguish the campfire and holds the father responsible for the actions of his minor child under the principle of vicarious liability."
