It uses sequence numbers and timestamps to ensure that messages are fresh and have not been replayed. Therefore, TLS can protect against an attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n\n2. **An attacker impersonating the server:**\n   - In the given scenario, the client checked the server\u2019s certificate during the TLS handshake. This certificate verification ensures that the server is who it claims to be, assuming the certificate is valid and trusted by the client. Thus, TLS can protect against an attacker impersonating the server.\n\nGiven these points, both types of attacks (replay and impersonation) are protected against by TLS under the assumptions provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
