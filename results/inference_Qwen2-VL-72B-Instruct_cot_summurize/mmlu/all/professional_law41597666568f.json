The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable in the face of the claim by the two non-selling sisters that they own 100% of the property pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a joint tenancy, each tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the entire property, and there is a right of survivorship. However, a joint tenancy can be severed by any of the joint tenants conveying their interest to another party. When this happens, the conveyed interest becomes a tenancy in common, and the right of survivorship no longer applies to that portion of the property.\n\nIn this case, when one of the sisters conveyed her one-third interest to a third party, she effectively severed her interest from the joint tenancy. As a result, the third party held a one-third interest as a tenant in common, which could then be passed on by will to her son. Therefore, the son's ownership interest is enforceable despite the claims of the two non-selling sisters."
