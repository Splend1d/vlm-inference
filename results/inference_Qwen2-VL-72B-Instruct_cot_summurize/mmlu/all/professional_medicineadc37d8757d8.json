His pulse is 130/min, respirations are 8/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. The trachea is at the midline. Heart sounds are not audible. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Echocardiography\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Pericardiocentesis\n"

The patient's presentation with hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and absent heart sounds suggests cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves draining fluid from the pericardial sac, which can relieve the pressure on the heart and improve hemodynamics. A chest x-ray, echocardiography, or bronchoscopy may also be useful in evaluating the patient's condition, but they should not delay the urgent treatment of cardiac tamponade."
