                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of haemolytic anaemia.\n- This statement is incorrect. Pale stools and dark urine are more characteristic of obstructive jaundice, where bile flow is blocked. In haemolytic anaemia, the breakdown of red blood cells leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, which typically does not cause pale stools.\n\nB. Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\n- This statement is incorrect. Bilirubin is actually a byproduct of the breakdown of haemoglobin from old or damaged red blood cells. It is not used in the synthesis of new red blood cells.\n\nC. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n- This statement is correct. Pruritus (itching) can be a symptom of obstructive jaundice due to the accumulation of bile acids in the skin.\n\nD. Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional.\n- This statement is incorrect. Blood samples from any individual, especially those who might have conditions that increase the risk of infectious diseases (such as intravenous drug users), should always be handled with appropriate precautions to prevent the spread of infections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice."
