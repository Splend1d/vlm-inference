All of the above.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt, in their book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" argue that the disinvitation of certain speakers from college campuses can lead to several negative outcomes. They suggest that such actions can be seen as a form of mental filtering, where individuals or groups avoid exposure to ideas they find uncomfortable or challenging. This can contribute to intellectual homogeneity, where a narrow range of viewpoints is represented and discussed. Additionally, they argue that it encourages students to focus on negative aspects of a speaker's history or views while disregarding any positive contributions or complexities. Therefore, all three points (A, B, and C) are part of their argument."
