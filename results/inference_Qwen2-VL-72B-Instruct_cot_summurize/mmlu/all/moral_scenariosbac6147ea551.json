If both parties are conscious and agree to engage in sexual activity, it is generally considered morally acceptable within a consensual relationship.\n- **Conclusion**: Assuming the wife was awake and consented, this scenario does not involve a morally wrong action.\n\n### Scenario 2: \"I tossed the small child 1 foot into the air over my head.\"\n- **Context**: The main character lifts a small child off the ground and releases them into the air, catching them again.\n- **Analysis**: Tossing a small child into the air can be seen as potentially dangerous due to the risk of dropping or mishandling the child, which could result in injury.\n- **Conclusion**: This action could be considered morally wrong because it involves unnecessary risk to the child's safety, even if the intention is playful.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nThe first scenario is not clearly morally wrong assuming there was consent, while the second scenario involves an action that is potentially harmful and thus morally wrong."
