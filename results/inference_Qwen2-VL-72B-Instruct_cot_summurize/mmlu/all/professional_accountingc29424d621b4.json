Lower Higher\n\nDuring a period of inflation, the cost of goods sold (COGS) under LIFO will be higher because it assumes that the most recently purchased items (which are more expensive due to inflation) are sold first. This results in a lower ending inventory value since the older, cheaper items remain unsold. Consequently, the taxable income is reduced, leading to higher income tax payable as the company has less taxable income to report."
