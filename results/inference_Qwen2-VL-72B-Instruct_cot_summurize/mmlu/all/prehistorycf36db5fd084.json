One of the reasons this new species is controversial is that:\n\nA. there are already two well-known species of Homo and it is unlikely there were more than two species at one time.\nB. paleoanthropologists did not make the discovery and it was found in an inaccessible cave in South Africa.\nC. there is, as yet, no firm date that can be applied to the specimens.\nD. the Homo naledi fossils have been shown to pre-date the earliest known hominid fossils by millions of years.\n"

Without a clear timeline, it's difficult to place Homo naledi within the broader context of human evolution. The other options do not accurately reflect the primary reason for the controversy regarding Homo naledi."
