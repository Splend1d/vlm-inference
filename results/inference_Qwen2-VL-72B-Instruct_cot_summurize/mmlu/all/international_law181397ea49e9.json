Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n\nIndividuals do have some degree of international legal personality, which allows them to be subjects of international law in certain contexts. However, this is generally more limited compared to states or international organizations. For example, individuals may have rights under human rights treaties, and they can be parties to international arbitration proceedings. Nonetheless, their ability to directly participate in international relations or bring claims against states in international courts is typically constrained."
