It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.\n\nIn polling, the margin of error indicates the range within which the true value of the population parameter (in this case, the percentage of high school students who express fear about going to school) is expected to fall with a certain level of confidence. A margin of error of 5% means that if the poll found 43% of students expressing fear, we can be reasonably confident that the actual percentage of all high school students who feel this way is somewhere between 38% and 48%. This range accounts for sampling variability and statistical uncertainty."
