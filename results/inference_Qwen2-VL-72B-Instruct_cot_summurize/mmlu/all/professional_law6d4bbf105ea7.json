The contractor who installed the shutters did so by drilling screws and brackets into the exterior window frames and the shutters. The man later agreed to sell the home to a buyer. The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the buyer did not inquire about them, and the buyer did not conduct a walkthrough inspection of the home before the closing. The man conveyed the home to the buyer by warranty deed. After the sale closed, the buyer noticed that the shutters and brackets had been removed from the home and that the window frames had been repaired and repainted. The buyer demanded that the man return the shutters and pay the cost of reinstallation, claiming that the shutters had been conveyed to him with the sale of the home. When the man refused, the buyer sued. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.\nB. No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.\nC. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\nD. Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the buyer is likely to prevail in this situation, we need to consider several legal principles related to real estate transactions, particularly concerning fixtures.\n\n1. **Fixtures**: Generally, items that are permanently attached to the property and intended to be permanent improvements are considered fixtures and pass with the property unless specifically excluded in the sales agreement. In this case, the shutters were custom-made and installed using screws and brackets, indicating they were intended to be permanent.\n\n2. **Sales Agreement**: The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, which means there was no explicit exclusion of the shutters from the sale. This silence can imply that the shutters were included as part of the sale unless they were clearly personal property.\n\n3. **Warranty Deed**: A warranty deed typically includes an implied covenant that the property is conveyed free of encumbrances and defects. If the shutters were considered fixtures and were removed before the sale, it could be argued that the property was not conveyed in the condition expected by the buyer, potentially violating the covenant of the deed.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** (\"No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.\") is incorrect because the absence of mention does not necessarily exclude the shutters if they are considered fixtures.\n- **Option B** (\"No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.\") is irrelevant to the legal determination of whether the shutters were conveyed with the property.\n- **Option C** (\"Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\") is correct because the shutters were installed in a manner that suggests they were intended to be permanent improvements to the property, making them fixtures.\n- **Option D** (\"Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.\") is also correct because the removal of the shutters could be seen as a defect or encumbrance that violates the implied covenant of the warranty deed.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the legal principle that the shutters, being fixtures, should have been conveyed with the property unless explicitly excluded in the sales agreement."
