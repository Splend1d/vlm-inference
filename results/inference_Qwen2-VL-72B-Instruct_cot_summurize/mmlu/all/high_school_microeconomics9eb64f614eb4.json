Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nIn monopolistic competition, firms have some degree of market power due to product differentiation, which allows them to charge prices above marginal cost (MC). However, in the long run, new firms can enter the market, driving economic profits to zero. Therefore, firms must spend money on advertising and product differentiation to maintain their market share and profitability. The other options are not necessarily true of monopolistic competition."
