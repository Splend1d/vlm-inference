This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Supremacy Clause**: The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws. If there is a conflict between a federal law and a state law, the federal law prevails.\n\n2. **Congressional Power Over Interstate Commerce**: Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution. This includes the authority to regulate activities related to mining and extraction of minerals if they involve interstate commerce.\n\n3. **Federal Statute Prohibiting State Tax**: The federal statute enacted by Congress explicitly forbids any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Since pitchblende is a mineral that can be involved in interstate commerce (e.g., through transportation or sale across state lines), Congress has the authority to regulate it.\n\n4. **Conflict Between Federal and State Law**: The state's extraction tax on pitchblende directly conflicts with the federal statute prohibiting such taxes. Therefore, according to the Supremacy Clause, the federal law would override the state law.\n\nThus, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely invalid due to the supremacy of federal law over state law in matters of interstate commerce."
