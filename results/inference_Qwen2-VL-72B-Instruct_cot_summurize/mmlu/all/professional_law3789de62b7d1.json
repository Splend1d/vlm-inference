It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n"

There is also a separate tax on itinerant commercial photographers who use the streets and sidewalks, with a credit provided if they have paid the studio tax.\n\n2. **Legal Principles**:\n   - **License Tax**: A nondiscriminatory license tax is generally constitutional as it serves a legitimate regulatory purpose.\n   - **Interstate Commerce**: Taxes that unduly burden interstate commerce are unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n   - **Discriminatory Tax**: Taxes that discriminate against certain businesses or individuals may be unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The $200 tax is applied uniformly to all commercial photographic studios within the city, suggesting it is not discriminatory.\n   - The tax does not appear to target interstate commerce specifically; rather, it applies to local businesses operating within the city.\n   - The tax seems to serve a regulatory purpose, which is typically within the power of the state.\n\nGiven these points, the tax appears to be a nondiscriminatory license tax aimed at regulating local businesses. Therefore, the court is most likely to find the tax constitutional.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax."
