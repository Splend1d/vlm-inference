William Domhoff.\n3. **The policy-formation process**: This refers to how policies are created and implemented.\n4. **The candidate-selection process**: This involves how candidates are chosen for political office.\n\nGiven that Domhoff's work often focuses on power structures and decision-making within the United States, it is likely that he would have discussed processes related to ideology, policy formation, and candidate selection. The term \"exploitation process\" does not align with his typical focus areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. the exploitation process**"
