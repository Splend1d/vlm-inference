The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026.The attack yesterday\u2026has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas\u2026.As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

The internment of Japanese-Americans\n\nThe excerpt describes the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan on December 7, 1941, which led to the United States entering World War II. The immediate consequence of this event was the internment of Japanese-Americans, as the government feared they might be disloyal and pose a security risk. The internment began shortly after the attack and continued until the end of the war."
