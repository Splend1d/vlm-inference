                    "text": "To determine the truthfulness of these statements, let's analyze each one individually:\n\n### Statement 1: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.\n- **Kernel Definition**: The kernel of a homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\) between two groups \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) is defined as the set of all elements in \\( G \\) that map to the identity element in \\( H \\). Formally, it is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\ker(\\phi) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid \\phi(g) = e_H \\}\n  \\]\n  where \\( e_H \\) is the identity element in \\( H \\).\n\n- **Empty Kernel**: For a homomorphism to have an empty kernel means there are no elements in \\( G \\) that map to the identity in \\( H \\), except possibly the identity element itself (if \\( G \\) has an identity element).\n\n- **Example**: Consider the trivial homomorphism from any group \\( G \\) to the trivial group \\( \\{e\\} \\), which maps every element of \\( G \\) to the identity element \\( e \\). This homomorphism has an empty kernel because no non-identity element of \\( G \\) maps to the identity element of \\( \\{e\\} \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n### Statement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\n- **Nontrivial Homomorphism**: A nontrivial homomorphism is one that is not the trivial homomorphism (which maps everything to the identity).\n\n- **Finite Group to Infinite Group**: Consider a finite group \\( G \\) and an infinite group \\( H \\). A nontrivial homomorphism \\( \\phi: G \\rightarrow H \\) can exist if at least one non-identity element of \\( G \\) does not map to the identity of \\( H \\).\n\n- **Example**: Let \\( G \\) be the cyclic group of order 2, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{0, 1\\} \\), and let \\( H \\) be the infinite cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Define a homomorphism \\( \\phi: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that \\( \\phi(0) = 0 \\) and \\( \\phi(1) = 1 \\). This is a nontrivial homomorphism since \\( 1 \\neq 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 2** is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
