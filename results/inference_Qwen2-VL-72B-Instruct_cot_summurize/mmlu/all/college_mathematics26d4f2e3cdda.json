This is because any non-identity element generates the entire group.\n\nLet's examine each integer in the given range:\n\n1. **Prime numbers:**\n   - \\( n = 3 \\): Prime, so there is only one group up to isomorphism.\n   - \\( n = 5 \\): Prime, so there is only one group up to isomorphism.\n   - \\( n = 7 \\): Prime, so there is only one group up to isomorphism.\n   - \\( n = 11 \\): Prime, so there is only one group up to isomorphism.\n\n2. **Non-prime numbers:**\n   - \\( n = 4 \\): The groups are \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\) (cyclic) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) (Klein four-group). There are two non-isomorphic groups.\n   - \\( n = 6 \\): The groups are \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) (cyclic) and \\( S_3 \\) (symmetric group on three elements). There are two non-isomorphic groups.\n   - \\( n = 8 \\): The groups include \\( \\mathbb{Z}_8 \\), \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), and \\( D_4 \\) (dihedral group of order 8). There are at least four non-isomorphic groups.\n   - \\( n = 9 \\): The groups are \\( \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). There are two non-isomorphic groups.\n   - \\( n = 10 \\): The groups are \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{10} \\) (cyclic) and \\( D_5 \\) (dihedral group of order 10). There are two non-isomorphic groups.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the integers \\( n \\) for which there is only one group up to isomorphism are the prime numbers in the given range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B.
