National program of child immunization\n\nA national program of child immunization can lead to a healthier population, which in turn can result in a more productive workforce. This can contribute to a permanent increase in a nation's productive capacity as it ensures that future generations are less likely to suffer from preventable diseases, allowing them to contribute more effectively to the economy.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. A decline in the birth rate: While this might have various economic impacts, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in productive capacity. It could potentially lead to a smaller workforce in the long term, which might affect productivity negatively.\n\nB. Declining adult literacy rates: Lower literacy rates generally correlate with reduced productivity and innovation, which would likely decrease a nation's productive capacity rather than increase it.\n\nC. Widespread relocation of manufacturing firms to low-wage nations: This typically leads to job losses and a decline in domestic production, which would reduce a nation's productive capacity rather than increase it."
