His teachings would generally align with refraining from excessive or uncontrolled behavior, including laughing without restraint, attending lectures without serious intent, and engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage. However, it's important to note that Epictetus' specific advice might vary depending on the context and interpretation of his works."
