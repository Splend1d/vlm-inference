The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting.

In this context, the dependent variable is what the experiment aims to observe or measure as an outcome of manipulating the independent variables.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated - This is an independent variable because it is something that the experimenter manipulates (either $10 or $20).\n\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts - This is also an independent variable because it is another factor that the experimenter controls (same room vs. different room).\n\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall - This is the dependent variable because it is the outcome that the experimenter is measuring to see the effect of the independent variables.\n\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts - This is an independent variable because it is controlled by the experimenter (15 minutes vs. 30 minutes).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
