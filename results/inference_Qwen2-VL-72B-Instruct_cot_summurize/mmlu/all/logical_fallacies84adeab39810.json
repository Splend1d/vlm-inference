This fallacy does not directly correspond to any of the options provided in your list. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest one would be:\n\nD. Hasty Generalization\n\nThis is because appealing to novelty often involves making a broad conclusion based on the mere fact that something is new, without sufficient evidence or consideration of other factors. It's important to note that \"_Ad novitatem_\" is not a standard term for a fallacy in formal logic, but rather a descriptive phrase that might be used informally. The more commonly recognized fallacy related to novelty is \"appeal to novelty,\" which is not listed among your options."
