This design is particularly suited for studying age-related changes because it can provide insights into how intelligence evolves within the same group of people across different stages of life. Cross-sectional and cross-sequential designs compare different age groups at one point in time, which can introduce cohort effects and make it difficult to isolate age-related changes. Analogue designs typically involve laboratory simulations or analogues of real-world situations and are less suitable for studying long-term developmental trends."
