It has an all-or-none quality: it either happens, or it does not.\n\nThis is because the firing of a neuron, also known as an action potential, follows the all-or-none principle. Once the neuron's membrane potential reaches a certain threshold due to depolarization, an action potential is generated and propagated down the axon. If the threshold is not reached, no action potential occurs. The strength of the action potential remains constant throughout its propagation, regardless of the distance traveled."
