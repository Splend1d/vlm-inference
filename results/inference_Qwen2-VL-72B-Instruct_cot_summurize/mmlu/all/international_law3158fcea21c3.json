GA Resolutions are considered as material source, in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law\n\nThe resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) are not legally binding on member states in the same way that treaties are. However, they can be influential in shaping international norms and practices. They are often used to express the collective will of the international community on various issues and can contribute to the development of customary international law when they reflect widespread and consistent state practice accompanied by opinio juris (the belief that such practice is legally required). Therefore, while UNGA resolutions themselves are not directly binding, they can be considered a material source that may enunciate or reflect statements of customary international law."
