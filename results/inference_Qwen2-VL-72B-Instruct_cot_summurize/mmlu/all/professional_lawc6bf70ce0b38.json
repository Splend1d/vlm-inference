Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand.

Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\nB. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\nC. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\nD. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.\n"

Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\n\nThis option aligns with the rules of evidence regarding the use of depositions at trial. Under these rules, a party can introduce relevant portions of a deposition testimony during the trial. However, if the opposing party requests it, the party introducing the deposition must also include any additional parts of the deposition that are necessary to provide context and ensure fairness. This prevents taking the deposition out of context and ensures that the jury receives a complete understanding of the testimony."
