Relativistic speeds.\n\nThe equations of special relativity, which describe the behavior of time, length, and momentum, become significantly different from classical physics predictions only at speeds that are a substantial fraction of the speed of light (relativistic speeds). At everyday low speeds, the effects predicted by special relativity are so small that they are not noticeable and classical physics provides an adequate description."
