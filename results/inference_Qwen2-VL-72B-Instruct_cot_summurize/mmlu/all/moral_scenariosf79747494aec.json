In Scenario 1, digging a hole to create a cellar in one's own backyard is not inherently immoral, assuming it is done legally and safely. In Scenario 2, attending a baseball game before starting work is also not morally wrong, as long as it does not interfere with one's job responsibilities or violate any contractual obligations."
