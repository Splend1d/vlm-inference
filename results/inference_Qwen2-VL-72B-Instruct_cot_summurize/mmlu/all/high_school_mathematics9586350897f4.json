This makes the triangle an isosceles right triangle, where the two legs are equal in length.\n\nLet's denote the length of each leg as \\(a\\). In an isosceles right triangle, the relationship between the hypotenuse (\\(c\\)) and a leg (\\(a\\)) can be described by the Pythagorean theorem: \\(c^2 = a^2 + a^2\\).\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse \\(c = 10\\) inches, we have:\n\\[10^2 = a^2 + a^2\\]\n\\[100 = 2a^2\\]\n\\[a^2 = 50\\]\n\\[a = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). For this isosceles right triangle, both the base and height are equal to \\(a\\), so:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times a = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (5\\sqrt{2}) \\times (5\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 25 square inches, which corresponds to option D."
