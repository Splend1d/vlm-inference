Factors that can lead to an increase in LRAS include improvements in technology, increases in the labor force, and increases in the capital stock. Among the options provided:\n\n- **A. An increase in the real interest rate**: This could potentially reduce investment if it becomes more expensive to borrow money, which would not directly increase LRAS.\n  \n- **B. Increased investment in capital**: This directly contributes to increasing the economy's productive capacity over time, leading to higher LRAS.\n  \n- **C. An increase in aggregate demand**: While this can affect short-run aggregate supply (SRAS), it does not directly impact LRAS in the long run.\n  \n- **D. An increase in the unemployment rate**: This would typically indicate underutilization of labor resources, which would not increase LRAS.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Increased investment in capital."
