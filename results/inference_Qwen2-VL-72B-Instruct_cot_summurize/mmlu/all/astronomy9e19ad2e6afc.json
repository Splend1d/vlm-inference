The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.\n\nThe 1:2:4 resonance refers to the orbital periods of Jupiter's innermost large moons: Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Io orbits Jupiter twice for every one orbit of Europa, and Europa orbits twice for every one orbit of Ganymede. This gravitational interaction causes tidal forces that flex Io, generating significant amounts of heat through friction within its interior. This heat leads to Io's high level of volcanic activity, making it the most geologically active body in the Solar System."
