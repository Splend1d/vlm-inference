Since the points (1,2) and (7,4) are opposite vertices of the square, the distance between these two points will be the diagonal of the square.\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) on a Cartesian plane can be found using the distance formula:\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given points into the formula gives us:\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nThis is the length of the diagonal of the square. However, we need the side length to find the area. In a square, the relationship between the side length \\(s\\) and the diagonal \\(d\\) is given by \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, we can solve for \\(s\\) as follows:\n\\[s = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{40}{2}} = \\sqrt{20}\\]\n\nNow that we have the side length, we can find the area \\(A\\) of the square, which is given by \\(A = s^2\\):\n\\[A = (\\sqrt{20})^2 = 20\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 20, which corresponds to option A."
