This could include behaviors that cause distress to the individual or interfere with their daily functioning.\n\nB. **Sociological**: Sociologically, deviance refers to behavior that violates social norms and expectations. If society generally views a particular sexual behavior as unusual or unacceptable, it may be considered deviant.\n\nC. **Statistical**: Statistically, deviance is often defined based on how common or rare a behavior is within a population. If a behavior is extremely uncommon, it can be statistically considered deviant.\n\nGiven these definitions:\n- Psychological: The behavior described (needing to touch a woman's shoe to reach orgasm) could be seen as a paraphilia, which is a type of sexual disorder in psychology.\n- Sociological: This behavior is likely to be viewed as deviant because it does not align with societal norms regarding sexual practices.\n- Statistical: Since this specific behavior is likely very rare, it would be statistically deviant.\n\nTherefore, both sociological and statistical definitions would consider this behavior as deviant.\n\nThe final answer is D. b and c."
