The Indus Valley cities often had a citadel or fortified area located on the western side.\n\nB. **The \"upper cities\" were encompassed by monumental walls.**\n   - This is also true. The upper cities, typically the citadels, were surrounded by large defensive walls.\n\nC. **The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed.**\n   - This statement is NOT true. The Indus Valley cities were known for their well-planned urban layouts with grid systems and organized residential blocks, not haphazard additions.\n\nD. **The bricks used in the houses were a consistent size and shape.**\n   - This is true. One of the notable features of Indus Valley architecture was the use of standardized brick sizes.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true of the main Indus Valley cities is:\n\n**C. The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed.**"
