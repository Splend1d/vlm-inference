Conversely, if a moral code is recognized by the society, it implies that there is some level of acceptance or adherence among the population, though not necessarily a high proportion.\n\nTherefore, both conditions seem interrelated and potentially necessary for a moral code to have currency in a society.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both a and b."
