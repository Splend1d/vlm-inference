There is no history of trauma. The lesion transilluminates well, and no inguinal nodes are palpable. Findings from a testicular scan are normal. The most appropriate management includes\n\nA. injection with a sclerosing agent\nB. needle aspiration\nC. needle biopsy\nD. surgical repair\n"

This is because the symptoms described are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid around the testicle. Needle aspiration is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to drain the fluid and relieve the swelling. Injection with a sclerosing agent or surgical repair may be considered if the hydrocele recurs or if there are complications. Needle biopsy is not typically indicated for a hydrocele."
