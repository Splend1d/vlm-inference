Genetic drift\n\nWhen a small population of birds is blown to an isolated island and establishes a colony, the gene pool of this new population will be influenced by genetic drift. Genetic drift occurs when allele frequencies change due to random sampling effects in small populations. This can lead to significant changes in the genetic makeup of the population over time, even if there is no natural selection acting on those alleles."
