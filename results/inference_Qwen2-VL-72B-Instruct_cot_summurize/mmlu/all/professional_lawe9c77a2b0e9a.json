This rule was established to prevent the creation of perpetuities and to ensure that the grantee has full ownership rights during their lifetime.\n\nIn this scenario, the son initially held a life estate with a remainder interest to his heirs. However, when the son entered into a real estate agreement to sell the property in fee simple absolute, he effectively conveyed both the life estate and the remainder interest to the buyer. The Rule in Shelley's Case would apply here, meaning that the son's conveyance divested the remainder interest from his heirs and transferred it to the buyer along with the life estate. Therefore, the son could convey a fee simple absolute to the buyer, and the buyer's refusal to perform based on the belief that the son could not convey a fee simple is incorrect.\n\nThus, in a suit for specific performance, the son would succeed because he did indeed have the ability to convey a fee simple absolute to the buyer."
