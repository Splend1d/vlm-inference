The growing rat is a good model for assessing protein quality in human nutrition.\n\nThis statement is accurate because rats have been widely used as a model organism to study protein quality due to their similar digestive and metabolic processes compared to humans. However, it's important to note that while rats can provide valuable insights, they may not perfectly replicate human responses to different proteins. Therefore, while the growing rat is a good model, it might not be the absolute best method for assessing protein quality for human nutrition, as other factors and additional studies might be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation."
