They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the criminal responsibility of each of the three men, we need to analyze their actions and intentions in light of the legal definitions of conspiracy and attempted murder.\n\n1. **Conspiracy**: A conspiracy occurs when two or more persons agree to commit a crime. An overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is typically required for conviction.\n\n2. **Attempted Murder**: This involves taking a substantial step towards committing murder that goes beyond mere preparation but falls short of completing the crime.\n\nLet's break down the actions of each individual:\n\n- **The Man and His Brother**:\n  - They agreed to murder the neighbor.\n  - They obtained strychnine.\n  - They attempted to poison the neighbor by offering him the poison.\n  \n  These actions clearly constitute both conspiracy (agreement and overt act) and attempted murder (substantial step towards committing murder).\n\n- **The Friend**:\n  - He participated in the planning and provided advice on obtaining strychnine.\n  - However, he refused to participate in the actual poisoning attempt.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, merely providing advice or participating in the planning phase can be sufficient to establish conspiracy if there is an overt act by others in furtherance of the agreement. The friend\u2019s refusal to participate in the poisoning does not absolve him from conspiracy charges since he was involved in the planning stages.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement of criminal responsibility is:\n\n**D. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is guilty of conspiracy due to his involvement in the planning and provision of advice."
