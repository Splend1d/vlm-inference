This implies that the firm cannot influence the market prices of either its output or the wages it pays.\n\n2. **Technological Innovation Impact**:\n   - The technological innovation increases the firm's marginal physical product (MPP) of labor. This means each worker can produce more output than before.\n   - Since the firm is a price taker, the market price of its output remains constant.\n\n3. **Impact on Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)**:\n   - MRP = Marginal Physical Product (MPP) * Price of Output.\n   - With the increase in MPP and the price of output remaining constant, the MRP also increases.\n\n4. **Firm's Hiring Decision**:\n   - In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms hire workers up to the point where the MRP equals the wage rate (W).\n   - Since the MRP has increased due to the technological innovation, the firm will find it profitable to hire more workers until the new, higher MRP equals the unchanged wage rate.\n\n5. **Impact on Wages**:\n   - Because the firm is a price taker in the labor market, it cannot unilaterally change the wage rate. The wage rate is determined by the market supply and demand for labor, which has not changed due to the innovation affecting only one firm.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages**\n\nThis conclusion follows from the fact that the firm will hire more workers due to the increased MRP, but it cannot change the market-determined wage rate."
