It is essential for the proper functioning of enzymes involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which are critical for regulating mood, behavior, and cognitive functions. Iron deficiency can lead to alterations in these neurotransmitter systems, potentially affecting socio-emotional development. While iron does play a role in myelination and dopamine production, its broader impact on neurochemistry is more directly linked to the observed effects on socio-emotional development."
