It is unlikely that significant evolutionary changes have occurred within such a short timeframe.\n\nB. **Women can now run faster than men.**\n   - This statement is not supported by current data or trends. Men still generally hold faster records in running events compared to women.\n\nC. **Women have started training at an earlier age.**\n   - Starting training at an earlier age allows athletes to develop their skills and physical abilities over a longer period, which can lead to better performance outcomes.\n\nD. **More women are now engaged in sport.**\n   - Increased participation in sports means there is a larger pool of talent from which high-performing athletes can emerge. More engagement also leads to more competitive environments, driving improvements in performance.\n\nGiven these analyses, both options C and D seem plausible. However, option D encompasses a broader societal change that includes increased opportunities and support for women in sports, which likely contributes significantly to improved performances.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for the rapid improvement in women's world record performances is:\n\n**D. More women are now engaged in sport.**"
