It is responsible for the secretion of saliva from this gland. The other options listed are incorrect because:\n\nA. Taste buds on the posterior third of the tongue are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (the ninth cranial nerve).\nB. Muscles of the soft palate are innervated by the vagus nerve (the tenth cranial nerve).\nC. Muscles of the lower lip are innervated by branches of the facial nerve, but not specifically by the seventh cranial nerve itself; rather, it's part of its motor function to the muscles of facial expression."
