Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) from its presence in food is less than its Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)\n\nThe safety of a food additive is typically determined by comparing the Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) of the additive to its Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). The ADI is the amount of an additive that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. If the EDI is less than the ADI, it suggests that the additive is being used within safe limits.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D are also important considerations in evaluating the safety of a food additive, they do not directly address the regulatory criterion used to determine safety, which is the comparison between EDI and ADI."
