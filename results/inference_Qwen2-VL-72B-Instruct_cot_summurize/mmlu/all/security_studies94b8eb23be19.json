Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state.\n\nThis statement stands out because it involves the use of force and expulsion, which is generally considered a more extreme and potentially violent measure compared to the other options that involve more institutional or political strategies. The other statements describe methods of cultural preservation, political strategy, and secession, which are typically non-violent or less directly confrontational in nature."
