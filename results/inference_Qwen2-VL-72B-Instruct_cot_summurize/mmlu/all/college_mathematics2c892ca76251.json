We know that:\n\n- The number of subsets of \\( X \\) containing exactly 3 elements is given by \\( \\binom{n}{3} \\).\n- The number of subsets of \\( X \\) containing exactly 2 elements is given by \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements:\n\n\\[ \\binom{n}{3} = \\binom{n}{2} + 14 \\]\n\nWe can express these binomial coefficients in terms of factorials:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} + 14 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 14 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 6 to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[ n(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84 \\]\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n\\[ n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 3n^2 - 3n + 84 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ n^3 - 6n^2 + 5n - 84 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation. To find the integer solution for \\( n \\), we can try factoring or using the rational root theorem. By inspection or trial and error, we find that \\( n = 7 \\) is a solution:\n\n\\[ 7^3 - 6(7)^2 + 5(7) - 84 = 343 - 294 + 35 - 84 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of subsets of \\( X \\) containing exactly 4 elements, which is given by \\( \\binom{n}{4} \\):\n\n\\[ \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets of \\( X \\) containing exactly 4 elements is 35.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 35."
