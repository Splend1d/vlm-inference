Plugging \\(x = 0\\) into the original equation gives us the corresponding \\(y\\)-value:\n\\[y = 0 + e^0 = 1\\]\n\nSo, the point of tangency is \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line, we can write the equation of the tangent line as:\n\\[y - 1 = 2(x - 0)\\]\n\\[y = 2x + 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(y = 2x + 1\\)"
