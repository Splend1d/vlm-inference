We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?\n\nA. The Spanish-American War\nB. The Mexican War\nC. World War I\nD. World War II\n"

However, it was not as prolonged or as contentious as the Vietnam War.\n\nC. **World War I**: This war saw significant domestic dissent, especially among pacifists and those opposed to U.S. involvement in European conflicts. There were notable anti-war movements and political divisions.\n\nD. **World War II**: This war had widespread support in the United States due to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the clear threat posed by Axis powers. There was minimal political discord compared to other wars.\n\nGiven these analyses, the period that most closely resembles the political discord during the Vietnam War is:\n\n**C. World War I**\n\nBoth periods involved significant domestic opposition and political divisions over the country's involvement in foreign conflicts."
