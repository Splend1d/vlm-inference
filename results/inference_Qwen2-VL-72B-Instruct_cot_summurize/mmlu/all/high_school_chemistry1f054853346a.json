                    "text": "To determine the correct representation of the concentrations of the ions in a solution of sulfurous acid (H2SO3), we need to consider the dissociation steps of H2SO3 in water.\n\nSulfurous acid (H2SO3) is a weak diprotic acid that dissociates in two steps:\n\n1. First dissociation:\n\\[ \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+(aq) + \\text{HSO}_3^-(aq) \\]\n\n2. Second dissociation:\n\\[ \\text{HSO}_3^-(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+(aq) + \\text{SO}_3^{2-}(aq) \\]\n\nSince H2SO3 is a weak acid, the first dissociation step will be more significant than the second one. This means that the concentration of HSO3- will be higher than that of SO32-. Additionally, because it is a weak acid, not all molecules will dissociate, so there will still be some undissociated H2SO3 present.\n\nTherefore, the concentration order should be:\n\\[ [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] > [\\text{HSO}_3^-] > [\\text{SO}_3^{2-}] \\]\n\nThis matches option B:\n\\[ [\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3] > [\\text{HSO}_3^-] > [\\text{SO}_3^{2-}] \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]"
