                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling exactly three prime numbers and three composite numbers out of six dice.\n\nFirst, let's identify the prime and composite numbers on a 6-sided die:\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5 (3 primes)\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6 (2 composites)\n\nThe total number of outcomes when rolling one die is 6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each event:\n\n1. **Probability of rolling a prime number**: Since there are 3 prime numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, the probability is \\(P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Probability of rolling a composite number**: Since there are 2 composite numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, the probability is \\(P(\\text{composite}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of getting exactly three primes and three composites in any order when rolling six dice. This can be calculated using combinations and probabilities.\n\nThe number of ways to choose which three dice will show prime numbers out of six dice is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to show prime numbers is \\(C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20\\).\n\nThe probability of any specific arrangement of 3 primes and 3 composites occurring is \\((\\frac{1}{2})^3 \\times (\\frac{1}{3})^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{1}{216}\\).\n\nTherefore, the total probability of getting exactly three primes and three composites in any order is the product of the number of ways to arrange them and the probability of any specific arrangement, which is \\(20 \\times \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\)**."
