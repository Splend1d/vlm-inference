The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the manufacturer made a clear offer to sell ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets at a specified price ($1,000 per truck). The retailer responded with an unequivocal acceptance of the offer by stating, \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" This exchange demonstrates mutual agreement on the essential terms of the contract, including quantity, quality, and price.\n\nThe absence of a specified delivery date does not necessarily invalidate the contract. Contracts can be formed without specifying every detail, and additional terms such as delivery dates can often be inferred or negotiated after the formation of the contract. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the retailer's acceptance of the offer via email constitutes a valid acceptance, and there is no requirement for a follow-up phone call to confirm the contract.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the doctrine of avoidable consequences (also known as the duty to mitigate damages) pertains to the actions taken by the injured party after a breach has occurred to minimize their losses. It does not determine whether a contract existed in the first place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: There is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract."
