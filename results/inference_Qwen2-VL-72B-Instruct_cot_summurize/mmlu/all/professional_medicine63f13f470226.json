At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?\n\nA. Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells\nB. Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface\nC. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms\nD. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms\n"

The specific finding that the neutrophils fail to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus points to a defect in the ability of these white blood cells to kill ingested microorganisms.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms\n\nThis suggests a condition such as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), where there is a genetic defect in the respiratory burst mechanism of phagocytic cells, leading to impaired microbial killing."
