Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth\n\nSeismic waves generated by earthquakes or other sources travel through the Earth's interior at different speeds depending on the density and composition of the materials they pass through. By analyzing these waves, scientists can infer details about the structure of the Earth's core, mantle, and lower crust. This method provides significant insights into the internal structure of the Earth that cannot be obtained through direct sampling or observation."
