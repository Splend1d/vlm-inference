If the vacation is planned with appropriate medical support and precautions, it might not be inherently wrong.\n- Without more details, assuming the vacation is planned responsibly, this action may not be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
