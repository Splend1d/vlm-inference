If a client can no longer afford your fee due to a change in their financial circumstances, it's crucial to explore all possible options to ensure they continue to receive the necessary support and care. This may involve offering a reduced fee, referring them to a sliding scale therapist, or connecting them with community resources that offer affordable mental health services. The goal should be to maintain continuity of care and support the client's mental health needs within their current financial constraints."
