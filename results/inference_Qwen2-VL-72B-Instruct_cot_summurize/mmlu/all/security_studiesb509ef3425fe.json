Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action.\nB. Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nC. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\nD. Global inequality does not present a significant threat to global security.\n"

Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nGlobal inequality can indeed pose a significant threat to global security. When large segments of the population feel marginalized and excluded from the benefits of globalization, it can lead to social unrest, radicalization, and even violent conflict. This sense of injustice and desperation can fuel revolutionary movements and terrorist activities, as individuals and groups seek to challenge the status quo and demand change. Therefore, addressing global inequality is crucial for maintaining stability and security on a global scale."
