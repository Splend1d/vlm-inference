The correct number sentence is:\n\nB. 8 \u00d7 t = 56\n\nThis equation represents the total number of tennis balls (56) being equal to the number of buckets (8) multiplied by the number of tennis balls in each bucket (t). To solve for t, you would divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8 \\times t}{8} = \\frac{56}{8} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 7 \\]\n\nSo, there are 7 tennis balls in each bucket."
