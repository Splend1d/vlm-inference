True, False\n\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means the model captures the random noise or outliers in the training data instead of the underlying patterns which would generalize better to unseen data.\n\nStatement 1: \"Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small.\" - This statement is true. With a smaller dataset, there's less information for the model to learn from, making it easier for the model to memorize the noise and details in the training data rather than learning the generalizable patterns.\n\nStatement 2: \"Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.\" - This statement is false. A smaller hypothesis space typically means fewer possible models to choose from, which can actually reduce the risk of overfitting because the model has fewer ways to fit the noise in the data. Overfitting is more likely with a larger hypothesis space where the model has more flexibility to fit the noise in the training data."
