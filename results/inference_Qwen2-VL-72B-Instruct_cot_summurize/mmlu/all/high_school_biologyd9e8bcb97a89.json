Lamarck.\n\nLysenko's belief that environmental conditions could directly influence the traits of organisms and be passed on to subsequent generations aligns with the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck proposed the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, which suggests that an organism can pass on traits it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This contrasts with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, which emphasizes that traits are inherited through genetic variation and that those best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce."
