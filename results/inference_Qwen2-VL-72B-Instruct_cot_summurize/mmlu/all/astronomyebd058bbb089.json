Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nB. **Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions**: Differentiated asteroids have undergone internal differentiation, where heavier materials like metals sink to the core. If such an asteroid were shattered, the resulting fragments could contain high metal content. This makes sense as a potential source.\n\nC. **Chunks of rock chipped off the planet Mars**: While Mars has a metallic core, the surface rocks would likely not be predominantly metallic. Thus, this option is less likely.\n\nD. **Leftover chunks of rock from the earliest period in the formation of the solar system**: Early solar system material might include various compositions, but it doesn't specifically suggest a high metal content without further differentiation processes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**B. Chunks of large differentiated asteroids that were shattered by collisions.**"
