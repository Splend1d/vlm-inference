Price falls as firms enter the industry.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, if the current price is above the minimum average total cost (ATC), it indicates that firms are earning economic profits. This situation attracts new firms to enter the market because they see an opportunity to make profits. As more firms enter, the supply in the market increases, leading to a decrease in the market price. This process continues until the price falls to the level where it equals the minimum ATC, at which point firms are earning only normal profits and there is no incentive for further entry or exit. Thus, in the long run, the price will fall due to the entry of new firms."
