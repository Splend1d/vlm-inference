However, from the first premise \\( E \\supset \\neg F \\), we know that if \\( E \\) is true, then \\( F \\) must be false. Therefore, this option contradicts the first premise and cannot be an immediate consequence.\n\n### Option B: \\( F \\supset G \\)\nThis option suggests that if \\( F \\) is true, then \\( G \\) must be true. The second premise \\( \\neg F \\supset G \\) does not directly support this because it only states that if \\( F \\) is false, then \\( G \\) is true. There is no direct implication from \\( F \\) being true to \\( G \\) being true based on the given premises. Hence, this option is not an immediate consequence.\n\n### Option C: \\( G \\supset E \\)\nThis option suggests that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( E \\) must be true. None of the given premises provide any information about the relationship between \\( G \\) and \\( E \\). Therefore, this option cannot be concluded as an immediate consequence.\n\n### Option D: \\( \\neg\\neg F \\)\nThis option suggests that \\( F \\) is true. Let's analyze this step by step using the given premises:\n\n1. From the third premise \\( \\neg G \\), we know \\( G \\) is false.\n2. Using the second premise \\( \\neg F \\supset G \\), since \\( G \\) is false, \\( \\neg F \\) must also be false (because if \\( \\neg F \\) were true, \\( G \\) would have to be true, which contradicts our knowledge that \\( G \\) is false).\n3. If \\( \\neg F \\) is false, then \\( F \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\neg\\neg F \\) (which means \\( F \\)) is indeed an immediate consequence of the given premises.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is **Option D: \\( \\neg\\neg F \\)**."
