Since there are 4 cups in a quart, we can convert 3 quarts to cups:\n\n\\[3 \\text{ quarts} = 3 \\times 4 \\text{ cups} = 12 \\text{ cups}\\]\n\nNow, we have the ratio of 2 cups to 12 cups. To express this as a fraction, we put the number of cups on top (the numerator) and the total number of cups on the bottom (the denominator):\n\n\\[\\frac{2 \\text{ cups}}{12 \\text{ cups}}\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n\\[\\frac{2 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts as a fraction in simplest form is:\n\nD. 1 over 6"
