By grouping together customers with similar needs, it provides a commercially viable method of serving these customers.\n\nMarket segmentation is carried out to divide a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. The main goal is to identify groups of buyers who have similar needs and respond similarly to marketing actions. This allows companies to tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to better meet the specific needs of each segment, thereby improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales."
