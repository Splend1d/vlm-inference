The statute will help racial minorities living in the state obtain gainful employment.\nB. The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.\nC. If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.\nD.

If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that states have the authority to regulate their own internal affairs and use their own resources as they see fit. By using state funds for construction projects, the state is exercising its power to allocate those funds in a way that benefits its own citizens, which can be seen as a legitimate exercise of state sovereignty. This reasoning aligns with the idea that states have some leeway in regulating their own economic activities when they are not directly interfering with interstate commerce but rather engaging in their own governmental functions."
