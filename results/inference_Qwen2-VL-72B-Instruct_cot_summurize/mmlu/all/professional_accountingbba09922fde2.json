This typically leads to an increase in the average collection period, which is the average number of days it takes for a company to receive payment after a sale has been made on credit. While this might potentially lead to increased sales (option C) as customers may be more inclined to purchase with the extended payment terms, it does not directly equate to lower bad debt losses (option B) or higher profits (option D) without additional context about how these changes affect overall cash flow, customer behavior, and cost of financing."
