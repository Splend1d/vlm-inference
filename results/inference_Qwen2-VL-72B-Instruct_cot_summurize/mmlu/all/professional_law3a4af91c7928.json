To prove negligent design by the manufacturer, the driver offers the portion of the transcript from a prior trial in which an expert witness testified that in his opinion the car was unsafe as designed. The testimony could qualify under the hearsay exception for former testimony\n\nA. only if the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding.\nB. whether or not the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding.\nC. if this exception has been held incompatible with the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\nD. if the manufacturer had an opportunity to cross-examine the expert at the former preceding.\n"

This ensures that the testimony was subject to adversarial testing, which is a key aspect of the hearsay exception for former testimony."
