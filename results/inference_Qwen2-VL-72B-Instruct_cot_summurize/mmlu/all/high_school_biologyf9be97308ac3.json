It increases the number of lymphocytes with receptors that can recognize and bind to the antigen.\n\nVaccination works by introducing an antigen, often a weakened or dead form of a pathogen, into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce lymphocytes (specifically B cells and T cells) that have receptors capable of recognizing and binding to that antigen. These lymphocytes then multiply, creating a population of memory cells that can quickly respond if the actual pathogen is encountered in the future. This process enhances the body's ability to fight off infections more effectively than it could without prior exposure through vaccination."
