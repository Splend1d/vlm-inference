Increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions.\n\nThis approach is based on the Contact Hypothesis, which suggests that under certain conditions, direct contact between members of different groups can reduce prejudice and hostility. These conditions typically include equal status between the groups, common goals, and support from authorities or significant others. By increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions, students are more likely to form positive relationships and reduce their biases against one another."
