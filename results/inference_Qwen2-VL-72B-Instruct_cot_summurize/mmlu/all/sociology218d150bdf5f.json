According to Bordo, the modern ideal of femininity includes being thin, self-assured, and independent, which can lead to extreme measures to achieve this ideal, including disordered eating behaviors. Additionally, the cultural values of achievement and control can contribute to the development of anorexia, as individuals may feel pressure to maintain a certain body image or weight as a measure of success or self-control."
