However, their need for essential nutrients remains the same or may even increase. Therefore, it is important for older adults to focus on consuming foods that are rich in nutrients relative to their calorie content, which is known as nutrient-dense foods. This approach helps them meet their nutritional needs without consuming excessive calories, which can contribute to weight gain and related health issues."
