Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not. At least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB. Based on this observation, which of the following scenarios is most likely?\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\nB. Archaea and Bacteria diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Eukarya.\nC.

This implies that the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya shared these transcription factors before they diverged from Bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario based on this observation is:\n\nA.
