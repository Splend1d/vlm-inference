                    "text": "To determine the importance of peace research during the 1980s, let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.**\n   - This suggests that peace research was closely tied to political systems and had direct policy implications. It implies that researchers were expected to provide actionable solutions.\n\nB. **Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.**\n   - This indicates that peace research faced significant pressure to address pressing issues and deliver policy recommendations quickly, unlike traditional International Relations (IR) studies which might have been more theoretical or less focused on immediate policy outcomes.\n\nC. **There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.**\n   - This option suggests that while there was some separation from direct policy-making, European security studies became more politically relevant due to the peace movement's influence. It highlights the growing importance of security issues within the broader context of peace movements.\n\nD. **The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.**\n   - This implies that peace research was heavily influenced by political theory but remained somewhat disconnected from other theoretical developments in various disciplines.\n\nGiven the context of the 1980s, characterized by heightened tensions during the Cold War and the rise of peace movements, it is likely that peace research was both highly relevant and under pressure to produce practical solutions. Therefore, the most fitting answer seems to be:\n\n**B. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.**\n\nThis option best captures the urgency and practical focus of peace research during that period."
