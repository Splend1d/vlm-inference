Kantianism\n\nThe concept of using someone as a mere means, rather than an end in themselves, is a central tenet of Immanuel Kant's ethical theory, known as Kantianism or deontological ethics. According to Kant, it is morally wrong to treat people merely as a means to an end; they must always be treated as ends in themselves, with inherent dignity and worth. This principle is encapsulated in his categorical imperative, which includes the formulation that one should \"act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.\""
