The student met the woman when he was assigned to her care during her 2-week hospitalization for treatment of major depressive disorder. He has not treated or seen the patient since she was discharged from the hospital. He is attracted to this former patient and would be interested in dating her. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation?\n\nA. He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care\nB. He can date her because she is no longer his patient\nC. He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her\nD. He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient\n"

He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient\n\nProfessional boundaries are crucial in healthcare settings, especially in mental health care, where the power dynamics and potential for emotional vulnerability are heightened. Even though the medical student was not a licensed physician at the time of treating the patient, ethical guidelines generally discourage romantic relationships between healthcare providers and patients they have treated, regardless of the provider's status. This is to protect the patient's well-being and maintain professional integrity."
