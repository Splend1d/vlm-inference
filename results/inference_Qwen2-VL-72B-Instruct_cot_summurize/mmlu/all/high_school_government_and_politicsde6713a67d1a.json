Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than are those under the age of 21.\n- This statement is generally true. Older voters tend to have higher turnout rates compared to younger voters.\n\nB. A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout.\n- This statement is not accurate.
