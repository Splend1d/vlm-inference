Then \\( (ax)^M = ax^Ma \\).\n  \n- For \\( (xa)^M \\):\n  - Let \\( w = xa \\). Then \\( (xa)^M = x(a(xa))^Ma \\).\n  - By the recursive definition, \\( (xa)^M = x(ax^Ma)a \\).\n\nComparing \\( ax^Ma \\) and \\( x(ax^Ma)a \\), we see that they are not necessarily equal unless specific conditions hold. Therefore, \\( (ax)^M = (xa)^M \\) does not generally hold true.\n\n### Option C: \\( (xy)^M = y^Mx^M \\)\n\nUsing the recursive definition:\n- For \\( (xy)^M \\):\n  - Let \\( w = xy \\). Then \\( (xy)^M = xy^My^Mx^M \\).\n\nThis does not match \\( y^Mx^M \\) directly. Thus, \\( (xy)^M = y^Mx^M \\) does not generally hold true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we find that only Option A is true based on the recursive definition provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. \\( a^M = a \\)**"
