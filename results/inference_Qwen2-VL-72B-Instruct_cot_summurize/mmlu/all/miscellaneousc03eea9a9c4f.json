Acid rain, which contains acidic compounds like sulfuric and nitric acids, can react with calcium carbonate to form soluble compounds that can dissolve and erode the marble surface. This makes marble structures, such as tombstones, particularly vulnerable to acid precipitation compared to materials like granite, slate, or gabbro, which are more resistant to chemical weathering."
