The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\n\nThe key point here is that the mortgage was established prior to the creation of the tenancy in common upon the father's death. Since the mortgage was already in place, it does not create a fiduciary duty between the siblings regarding the mortgage itself. The son's role as a creditor is separate from his role as a co-tenant in common with his sisters. Therefore, the mortgage does not impose a fiduciary duty on the son towards his sisters concerning the mortgage."
