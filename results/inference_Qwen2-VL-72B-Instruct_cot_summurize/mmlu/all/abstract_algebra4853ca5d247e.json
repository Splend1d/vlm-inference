Consider the group \\((\\mathbb{Z}_4, +)\\) where the operation is addition modulo 4. Let \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 3\\). Here, \\(a \\neq b\\), but \\(a^2 = 1^2 = 1\\) and \\(b^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). Thus, \\(a^2 = b^2\\), which contradicts the statement.\n\n### Statement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nThis statement is **true**. A dihedral group \\(D_n\\) consists of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon, including both rotations and reflections. The set of rotations alone forms a cyclic subgroup generated by a single rotation (usually denoted as \\(r\\)), where \\(r^n = e\\) (the identity element), and all other rotations can be expressed as powers of \\(r\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
