However, if we consider the closest interpretation, it would be:\n\n\\[ (\\exists x)(Ax \\land (\\exists y)(Py \\land Cy \\land Nxy)) \\]\n\nThis matches most closely with option B, but with a slight adjustment in the structure to correctly represent the original statement.\n\nGiven the available options, the best fit is:\n\nB. \\( (\\exists x)[(Cx \\land Px) \\land (\\exists y)(Ay \\land Nxy)] \\)\n\nHowever, this is not an exact match. The correct logical representation should be:\n\n\\[ (\\exists x)(Ax \\land (\\exists y)(Py \\land Cy \\land Nxy)) \\]\n\nSince this exact form isn't listed among the options, the closest approximation provided is option B."
