However, it might not be as severe as taking someone else's property.\n- In many workplaces, honesty about work completion is important, but the severity of the wrongdoing can vary based on the specific circumstances.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 clearly involves a moral wrongdoing (stealing).\n- Scenario 2 may involve a moral wrongdoing (dishonesty), but it is less severe compared to stealing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
