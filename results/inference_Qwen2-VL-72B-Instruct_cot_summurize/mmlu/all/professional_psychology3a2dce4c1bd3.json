The exact risk can vary depending on the specific family history and other factors, but generally, if one parent has schizophrenia, the child's risk is around 10-13%, and if a sibling has it, the risk is around 8-14%. However, these numbers can be influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, option B (0.42) is the closest to the typical range reported in studies."
