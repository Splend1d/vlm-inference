Identifying attributes of objects\n\nBefore teaching a lesson on categorizing geometric objects by type of shape, children must be able to identify attributes of objects. This foundational skill enables them to recognize and differentiate between various shapes based on their properties such as sides, angles, and overall form. Once they can identify these attributes, they will be better equipped to sort and categorize the shapes effectively during the lesson."
