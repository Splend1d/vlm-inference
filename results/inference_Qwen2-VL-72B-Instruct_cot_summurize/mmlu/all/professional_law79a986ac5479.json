The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"

No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\n\nThe statement made by the perpetrator to the witness can be considered admissible as it directly relates to the material facts of the case. It shows that the perpetrator knew the child and was aware of the family's financial status, which supports the prosecution's argument regarding the motive for the kidnapping. If the accused takes the stand and denies these facts, the statement can also be used to impeach their credibility. Therefore, the court is unlikely to sustain the defense's objection based on the relevance and probative value of the statement."
