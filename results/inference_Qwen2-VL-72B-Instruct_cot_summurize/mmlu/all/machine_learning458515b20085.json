This means that any local minimum is also a global minimum. Therefore, any of the gradient descent methods\u2014Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, or Batch Gradient Descent\u2014with appropriate hyperparameters and initialization will converge to the global optimum. The choice between these methods might depend on other factors such as computational efficiency, memory constraints, and convergence speed, but all are capable of finding the global optimum in this scenario."
