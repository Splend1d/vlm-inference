Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.\nB. guilty, because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability.\nC. not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.\nD. not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n"

Strict liability crimes do not require proof of a specific mental state or intent; the mere act of committing the prohibited behavior is sufficient for conviction. Therefore, regardless of whether the defendant knew about the law or intended to violate it, she would still be found guilty if prosecuted for purchasing the shotgun while being under the statutory age."
