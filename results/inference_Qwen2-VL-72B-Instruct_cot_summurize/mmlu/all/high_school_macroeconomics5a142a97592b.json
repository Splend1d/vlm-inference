Net exports were positive.\n- A trade deficit means that imports exceed exports. Therefore, net exports (exports minus imports) would be negative, not positive.\n\nB. Americans consumed more than they produced.\n- A trade deficit often indicates that domestic consumption is higher than domestic production, as the country is importing more goods and services to meet its needs.\n\nC. America's government spent more than it took in.\n- While this could be true, it is not directly related to the trade deficit. The trade deficit specifically refers to the balance between imports and exports, not the government's budget.\n\nD. $603 billion worth of capital flowed out of America.\n- This statement is incorrect because a trade deficit implies that the country is importing more than it is exporting, which means that foreign countries are financing the excess imports through investments or loans. Thus, capital flows into the country rather than out.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\nB. Americans consumed more than they produced."
