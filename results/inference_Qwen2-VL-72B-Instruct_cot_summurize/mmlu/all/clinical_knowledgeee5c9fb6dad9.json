Shampoos often contain ingredients that can be too harsh and drying for the skin, leading to dryness, irritation, and potential damage to the skin's natural barrier. Soap or body washes are generally better suited for cleansing the skin because they are designed to maintain the skin's moisture balance while cleaning."
