In females (XX), one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated early in embryonic development to balance gene expression with males (XY).\n\nB. **The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.**\n   - This is incorrect. The inactivation is random and varies from cell to cell. It is not the same chromosome in every cell.\n\nC. **A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.**\n   - This is correct. Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) have an extra X chromosome, which results in one Barr body due to the inactivation of one of the X chromosomes.\n\nD. **Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.**\n   - This is correct. Barr bodies are regions of heterochromatin that are heavily methylated, making them inactive.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct about Barr bodies is:\n\n**B. The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.**"
