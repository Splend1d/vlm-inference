Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants\n\nQuasi-species viruses, like influenza and HIV, are characterized by their ability to exist as a cloud of closely related but genetically distinct variants. This diversity arises from high mutation rates during viral replication, leading to a population of viruses that can rapidly adapt to changing environments or host immune responses."
