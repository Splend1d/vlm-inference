Virtue ethics focuses on the development of good moral character and virtues, rather than on the consequences of actions or adherence to absolute duties. In this context, Nathan is emphasizing the importance of cultivating a virtuous disposition towards the environment, even if nonhuman or nonsentient beings do not have direct moral standing."
