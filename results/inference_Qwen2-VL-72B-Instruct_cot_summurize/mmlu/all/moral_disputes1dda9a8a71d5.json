However, Sinnott-Armstrong's argument focuses on the lack of a moral principle to support the intuition that it is wrong, rather than concluding that it is permissible.\n\n2. **Option B: We know that particularism is true.**\n   - Particularism is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of context and specific details in making moral judgments, rather than relying on general principles. While Sinnott-Armstrong might be suggesting that particularism could be relevant here, this option does not directly address the status of wasteful driving itself.\n\n3. **Option C: We do not know whether wasteful driving is wrong.**\n   - This option aligns with Sinnott-Armstrong's argument. If there is no moral principle to back up the intuition that wasteful driving is wrong, then we lack sufficient grounds to definitively say it is wrong. This uncertainty is consistent with Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s stance.\n\n4. **Option D: We know that wasteful driving is not wrong.**\n   - Similar to Option A, this option suggests certainty about the non-wrongness of wasteful driving. Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s argument does not lead to such a definitive conclusion; it merely points out the absence of a supporting moral principle.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. We do not know whether wasteful driving is wrong.**"
