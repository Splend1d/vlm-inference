This action is generally seen as a caring and responsible behavior aimed at preventing harm. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The antiques dealer gave you too much money for the trade.\n- You took the extra money back.\n\nIn this scenario, you are returning excess money that was mistakenly given to you. This action aligns with honesty and integrity, which are valued moral principles. Thus, this action is also not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both actions are considered morally right or not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
