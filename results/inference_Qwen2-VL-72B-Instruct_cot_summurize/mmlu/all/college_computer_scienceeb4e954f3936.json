Therefore, the grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\n### Bottom-Up Parsing (Statement III)\nBottom-up parsing starts with the input string and tries to reduce it to the start symbol by applying reverse productions.\n\nFor the string \\( x \\):\n- Start with \\( x \\), use \\( x \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nFor the string \\( (x) \\):\n- Start with \\( (x) \\), use \\( (x) \\rightarrow (S) \\), then \\( (S) \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nBoth strings can be parsed using bottom-up parsing without any issues. Therefore, the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Statement I (The grammar is ambiguous) is false.\n- Statement II (The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing) is true.\n- Statement III (The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing) is true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II and III only"
