United States - Magic Johnson is well-known for playing in the NBA, primarily with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nB. Sweden - There is no record of Magic Johnson playing professionally in Sweden.\n\nC. Israel - There is no record of Magic Johnson playing professionally in Israel.\n\nD. Turkey - There is no record of Magic Johnson playing professionally in Turkey.\n\nGiven that Magic Johnson had a long and prominent career in the NBA, it is most likely that he continued to be associated with the United States during the 1999 season, even if he was not actively playing due to his retirement from the NBA in 1996 (he briefly returned in 1996 but retired again shortly after).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. United States"
