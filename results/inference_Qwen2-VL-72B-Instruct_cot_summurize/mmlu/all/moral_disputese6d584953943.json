Therefore, the principle that corresponds to this aim is practical guidance. Moral theories are developed to help individuals make ethical decisions and navigate complex moral dilemmas. While explanatory power (the ability to explain why certain actions are right or wrong) and parsimony (simplicity and efficiency) are important considerations in developing moral theories, they are not the primary focus of the practical aim of moral theory."
