The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she \"was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?\"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.\nB. objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.\nC. unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.\nD. unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.\n"

In this case, the question about the husband's alleged affair is not directly relevant to the issue of whether the defendant was negligent in causing the accident. Instead, it introduces potentially inflammatory information that could prejudice the jury against the plaintiff (the wife) by suggesting that her marriage was not as happy as she claimed, thereby undermining her claim for loss of society and companionship. Therefore, the judge should rule that the question is objectionable due to its prejudicial nature."
