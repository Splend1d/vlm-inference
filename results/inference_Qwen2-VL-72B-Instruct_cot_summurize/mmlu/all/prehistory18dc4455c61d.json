Plants that use the C4 photosynthetic pathway (such as maize, sugarcane, and some grasses) have higher \u03b413C values compared to those using the C3 pathway (which includes most other plants like wheat, rice, and many fruits and vegetables). Animals that consume C4 plants will also reflect these higher \u03b413C values in their tissues.\n\nTherefore, by examining the \u03b413C values in human bones, researchers can infer whether an individual's diet was based more on C4 plants (often associated with meat consumption due to grazing animals) or C3 plants (more commonly found in vegetable-based diets). This method does not directly distinguish between specific foods like dairy or honey but rather between broad categories of plant types which indirectly relate to meat versus vegetable consumption."
