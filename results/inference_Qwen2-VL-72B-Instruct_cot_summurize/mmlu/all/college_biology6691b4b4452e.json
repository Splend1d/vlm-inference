They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nEnzymes facilitate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. This allows the reaction to occur at a faster rate without altering the equilibrium constant or the temperature of the reaction mixture. The maximal rate of the reaction (V_max) can also be increased by increasing the concentration of enzyme, but the primary mechanism by which enzymes speed up reactions is by reducing the activation energy barrier."
