Protons and neutrons possess spin angular momentum only.\n\nProtons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons, do not have orbital angular momentum within the nucleus because they do not orbit each other in the way that electrons orbit the nucleus in an atom. Instead, they have intrinsic spin angular momentum, which is a quantum mechanical property related to their internal structure."
