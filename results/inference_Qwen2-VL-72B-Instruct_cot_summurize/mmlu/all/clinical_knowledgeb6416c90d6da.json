When drugs are withdrawn from a sealed vial, fragments of the rubber bung can be cut out by the needle.\n\n'Coring' refers to the phenomenon where a fragment of the rubber stopper or bung of a vial is cut out by the needle when withdrawing medication. This can contaminate the dose and potentially cause problems if the fragment is injected into the patient. It's important for healthcare professionals to use proper technique to avoid coring, such as using a filter needle or ensuring the needle is not inserted too far into the vial."
