Mill believes that suppressing speech assumes that those doing the censoring are infallible and know what is right and wrong for everyone else. He advocates for free speech because it allows for the competition of ideas, which ultimately leads to truth being discovered and understood more fully. Therefore, censoring speech that is possibly true would imply that one has absolute certainty about the truth, which Mill considers an unrealistic and arrogant position."
