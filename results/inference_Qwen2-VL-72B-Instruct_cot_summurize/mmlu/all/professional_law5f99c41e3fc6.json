On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:\"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. \"The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed \"$75,000,\" instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer regarding the agreement's price term and its legal effect, we need to analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The collector made an offer to sell the stamp collection for $75,000 (due to the secretary's mistake). The cousin accepted this offer on December 5.\n\n2. **Mistake in Offer**: The offer stated $75,000 instead of the intended $78,000. This is a unilateral mistake made by the collector due to the secretary's error.\n\n3. **Legal Effect of Mistake**:\n   - **Unilateral Mistake**: Generally, a unilateral mistake (made by one party) does not allow the mistaken party to avoid the contract unless the other party knew or should have known about the mistake.\n   - **Reformation**: Courts may reform contracts to reflect the true intentions of the parties if there is clear evidence of a mutual understanding different from what was written.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.**\n   - This option suggests that the contract stands at $75,000, which is the price stated in the offer and accepted by the cousin. However, it does not address the possibility of reformation due to the mistake.\n\nB. **The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.**\n   - This option incorrectly assumes that the contract reflects the intended price ($78,000), which was not communicated in the offer.\n\nC. **The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.**\n   - This option correctly identifies that the written contract states $75,000 but acknowledges that the court might reform the contract to $78,000 based on evidence of the collector's intent.\n\nD. **The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.**\n   - This option incorrectly characterizes the situation as a mutual mistake, which would require both parties to be mistaken about a material fact. Here, only the collector was mistaken.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.**\n\nThis option correctly reflects the potential for judicial intervention to correct the mistake in the written contract."
