The plaintiff claims that while he was cleaning the machine, two wires came into contact with each other and caused the machine to turn on. At trial, the manufacturer has offered evidence that it was unreasonably expensive to design the machine so that the wires could not come into contact. In rebuttal, the plaintiff offers evidence that after this action was filed, the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact. Is evidence of this change in design admissible?\n\nA. No, because the change in design may have been unrelated to this type of accident.\nB. No, under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer.\nC. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\nD. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\n"

No, under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer.\n\nIn legal proceedings, evidence of subsequent remedial measures, such as changes in design or safety improvements made after an incident, is generally inadmissible. This rule is intended to encourage companies to improve their products and take corrective actions without fear that such actions will be used against them in court as admissions of guilt or negligence. The rationale behind this rule is to promote public safety by not discouraging companies from making necessary safety improvements."
