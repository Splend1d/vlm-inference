Closed winding: This term is not commonly used in the context of DC machine windings. Typically, windings in electrical machines are either open or closed based on their connection to the external circuit.\n\nB. Lap winding: Lap winding is one type of armature winding used in DC machines. It is characterized by its parallel paths and is suitable for low voltage and high current applications.\n\nC. Wave winding: Wave winding is another type of armature winding used in DC machines. It is characterized by its series connections and is suitable for high voltage and low current applications.\n\nD. Open type winding: This term is also not commonly used in the context of DC machine windings. Typically, windings are either lap or wave, depending on the specific requirements of the machine.\n\nGiven that both lap and wave windings are types of windings used in DC machines, but not all DC machines use both types, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Lap winding\nC. Wave winding\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the winding that is necessary in all DC machines, and both lap and wave windings are used depending on the application, neither B nor C alone can be considered universally necessary. Therefore, the best answer considering the necessity across all DC machines would be:\n\n**None of the above (A, B, C, D)**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that different DC machines may require different types of windings depending on their design and operational requirements."
