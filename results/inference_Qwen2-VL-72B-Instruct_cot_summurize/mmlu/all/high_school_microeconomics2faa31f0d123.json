In the short run, a firm should continue operating as long as its price covers its average variable cost (AVC). If it does not, the firm should shut down to minimize losses.\n\nLet's calculate the average variable cost (AVC):\n- AVC = Total variable costs / Number of pools cleaned = $80 / 9 \u2248 $8.89\n\nSince the price ($10) is greater than the AVC ($8.89), Jason should continue cleaning the pools because he is covering his variable costs and contributing towards his fixed costs, even though he is still making an overall economic loss.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10."
