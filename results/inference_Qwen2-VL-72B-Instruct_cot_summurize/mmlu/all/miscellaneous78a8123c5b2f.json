We continue counting each subsequent day until we reach January 1st.\n\nLet's count the days from December 25th (Saturday) to January 1st:\n\n- December 25th: Saturday\n- December 26th: Sunday\n- December 27th: Monday\n- December 28th: Tuesday\n- December 29th: Wednesday\n- December 30th: Thursday\n- December 31st: Friday\n- January 1st: Saturday\n\nTherefore, if Christmas Day is on a Saturday, then New Year's Day will fall on a Saturday as well.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD.
