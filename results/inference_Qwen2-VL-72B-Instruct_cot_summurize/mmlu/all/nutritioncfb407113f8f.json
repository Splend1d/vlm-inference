                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true regarding the diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis in North America and Western Europe:\n\nA. **Women over age 80 with osteopenia have above average bone mineral density for their age**\n   - This statement is incorrect because osteopenia is defined by having a bone mineral density (BMD) that is lower than normal but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. Therefore, women with osteopenia do not have above-average BMD.\n\nB. **Fewer than 10% of women over age 50 have osteopenia**\n   - This statement is likely false. According to various studies, osteopenia is quite common among older women. The prevalence of osteopenia in women over age 50 is typically higher than 10%.\n\nC. **Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis**\n   - This statement is also likely false. As people age, the risk of developing osteopenia or osteoporosis increases significantly. By age 80, a majority of women would typically have either osteopenia or osteoporosis.\n\nD. **Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls**\n   - This statement is correct. Osteoporosis is defined by a bone mineral density that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean peak bone mass (young adult reference range). This definition is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls.**"
