The number of time steps required to execute programs depends on various factors such as instruction complexity, pipeline design, and other architectural considerations. It cannot be generalized that horizontal architectures always require more time steps than vertical architectures.\n\nII. **Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.**\n   - This statement is true. In horizontal microarchitectures, microinstructions are typically unencoded, meaning they use explicit fields to represent different operations and operands directly within the microinstruction word.\n\nIII. **Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.**\n   - This statement is also true. Horizontal microinstructions often contain a single opcode field and multiple fields for specifying operands, allowing for parallel execution of multiple operations within a single microinstruction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III only**"
