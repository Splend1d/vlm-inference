Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.\nB. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nC. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nD. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.\n"

Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.\n\nThis option reflects the policy implication that hierarchical forms of transnational criminal organizations (TNCs) can be effectively combatted through targeted measures aimed at disrupting their financial flows and dismantling their leadership structures. By focusing on these aspects, law enforcement agencies can reduce the overall threat posed by such organizations to the legitimate economy."
