They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a \"no\" or \"yes\" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said \"yes.\" This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?\n\nA. No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.\nB. No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.\nC. Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.\nD. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.\n"

Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.\n\nIn this scenario, the detective's tactic of asking the suspect if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child can be considered a form of psychological manipulation or coercion. This approach may have exploited the suspect's emotional state and religious beliefs to elicit a confession. Such tactics can undermine the voluntariness of the confession, as they may have placed undue pressure on the suspect to confess, thereby rendering the confession involuntary.\n\nIt is important to note that while the suspect was informed of his Miranda rights and did not explicitly ask for an attorney, the use of religious deception during the interrogation process raises significant concerns about the voluntariness of the confession. Courts typically scrutinize confessions obtained through such methods closely to ensure that they were freely and voluntarily given without any form of coercion or undue influence."
