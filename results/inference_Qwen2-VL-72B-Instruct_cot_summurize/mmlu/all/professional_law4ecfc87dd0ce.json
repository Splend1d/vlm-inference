The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?\n\nA. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\nB. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.\nC. Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.\nD. Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n"

However, the fact that a practice is customary does not necessarily mean it is reasonable or non-negligent. The jury must consider whether the ship's owner exercised due care in light of all the circumstances, including the potential risks associated with leaving hatches open.\n\nThe court should deny the motion for summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to trial. The jury should be instructed that while the custom is relevant to the issue of negligence, it is not conclusive. The jury will need to weigh all the evidence, including the custom, to determine whether the ship's owner breached its duty of care to the longshoreman."
