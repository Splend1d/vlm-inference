The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the appellate court will affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home, we need to consider several legal principles and doctrines.\n\n1. **Murderer's Disentitlement Doctrine**: This doctrine generally prevents a murderer from benefiting financially from their crime. However, this principle typically applies to inheritance laws and does not directly affect property rights held during the murderer's lifetime.\n\n2. **Bigamy**: If the man was indeed a bigamist (married to two women simultaneously), it raises questions about the validity of his marriage to the second woman. A bigamous marriage is usually considered void, which could impact the validity of the property title.\n\n3. **Tenants by the Entirety**: In many jurisdictions, spouses can hold property as \"tenants by the entirety,\" which means they have equal ownership rights and neither can sell or transfer the property without the other's consent. However, if the marriage is invalid due to bigamy, the tenancy by the entirety may be invalid as well.\n\n4. **Quiet Title Action**: The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to resolve disputes over property ownership. The court's decision would depend on the specific laws and precedents in the jurisdiction regarding such actions.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- Option A suggests that the murderer cannot benefit from his crime, which aligns with the murderer's disentitlement doctrine but doesn't address the specific issue of property rights held during the murderer's lifetime.\n  \n- Option B argues that the man was a bigamist and therefore could not take good title to the property, implying that the entire property should revert to the decedent from the date of purchase. This option seems most aligned with the potential invalidity of the marriage due to bigamy.\n\n- Option C proposes that the court will recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common, which contradicts the idea of tenants by the entirety and does not address the bigamy issue.\n\n- Option D states that there is no rule of law giving the victim or her estate additional rights beyond what she had before the homicide, which overlooks the potential invalidation of the marriage due to bigamy.\n\nConsidering the potential invalidity of the marriage due to bigamy and the implications for the property title, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**B. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.**\n\nThis option addresses both the bigamy issue and the potential invalidation of the tenancy by the entirety, leading to the conclusion that the decedent's estate should be awarded full title to the property."
