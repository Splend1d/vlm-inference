You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\n\nKant's categorical imperative is a central concept in his moral philosophy, which suggests that one should only act in ways that could be universalized, meaning that if everyone acted in the same way, it would still be morally acceptable. This principle emphasizes treating people with respect and dignity, and considering the consequences of one's actions on others."
