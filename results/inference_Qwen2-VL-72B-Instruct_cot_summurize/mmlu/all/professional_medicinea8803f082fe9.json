No treatment is needed at this time\n\nMild genu varum (bowlegs) in a 2-year-old child is often a normal developmental stage and typically resolves on its own as the child grows. It is common for children to have some degree of bowlegs until around the age of 3, after which their legs usually straighten out. Therefore, no specific treatment such as increased vitamin D intake, a special exercise program, or surgical correction is necessary at this time. Regular monitoring by a pediatrician during routine check-ups is advisable to ensure that the condition progresses normally. If the bowing persists beyond the expected age or worsens, further evaluation may be warranted."
