Intersexual selection occurs when one sex (usually the female) chooses a mate based on certain traits that the other sex (usually the male) possesses. These traits can include physical characteristics such as size, coloration, or elaborate displays, which may signal genetic fitness or the ability to provide resources. Over time, this selective pressure can lead to exaggerated differences between the sexes, contributing to sexual dimorphism."
