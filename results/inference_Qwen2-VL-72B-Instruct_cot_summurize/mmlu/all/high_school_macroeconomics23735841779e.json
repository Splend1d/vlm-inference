This can result in lower prices for consumers and encourage domestic producers to become more efficient in order to compete with foreign producers. The reduction or elimination of tariffs typically leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, as markets tend to operate closer to their natural equilibrium without artificial barriers. Therefore, allocative efficiency is improved."
