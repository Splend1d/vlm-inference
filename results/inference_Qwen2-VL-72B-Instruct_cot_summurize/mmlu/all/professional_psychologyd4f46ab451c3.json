Discuss the possibility that the patient consult with another therapist.\n\nWhen a patient expresses dissatisfaction with therapy after a significant period and multiple attempts to adjust treatment goals and strategies, it may be beneficial for the psychologist to explore whether a different therapeutic approach or perspective might better meet the patient's needs. This could involve discussing the possibility of the patient consulting with another therapist who might offer a fresh perspective or a different therapeutic modality. It is important to handle this transition sensitively and collaboratively with the patient to ensure continuity of care and support during the change."
