Should the state court hear the case?\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\nB. No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\nC.

Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nHere's why: \n\nUnder the principle of \"federal question jurisdiction,\" federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law. However, this does not mean that state courts are barred from hearing such cases. In fact, state courts are generally required to hear and decide cases involving federal questions unless there is a specific statutory or constitutional prohibition. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that state courts must apply federal law when deciding cases that involve federal issues, and they cannot refuse to hear such cases simply because they arise under federal law.\n\nIn this scenario, the federal statute allows for claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, which includes state courts. Therefore, the state court should hear the case, as it has the authority to do so and cannot discriminate against cases arising under federal law."
