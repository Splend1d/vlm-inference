The Bandung Conference, which he addressed in 1955, was a significant event where leaders from Asian and African nations came together to promote economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by any nation. This conference was part of the broader Non-Aligned Movement, which aimed to stay out of the Cold War alliances."
