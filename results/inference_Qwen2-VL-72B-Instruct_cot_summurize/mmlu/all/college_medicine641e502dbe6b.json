Steroid\n\nThe description provided indicates that the hormone is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings, which is characteristic of steroid hormones. Steroids are lipophilic molecules that can pass through cell membranes and act on intracellular receptors, often leading to changes in gene expression and thus increasing the amount of nucleic acid in the cell. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this hormone is steroid."
