He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n"

The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\n- This is incorrect because the Emancipation Proclamation did not lead to a swift conclusion of the war. The Civil War continued for several years after the proclamation.\n\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\n- This is also incorrect. The Emancipation Proclamation actually helped prevent Great Britain from recognizing the Confederacy, but it did not cause them to join the Union.\n\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\n- This is partially correct but does not fully capture the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation on the war aims of the United States.\n\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n- This is correct. The Emancipation Proclamation shifted the focus of the war from solely preserving the Union to also include the abolition of slavery.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union."
