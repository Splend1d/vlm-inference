It helps prevent the spread of illness to coworkers and maintains personal health.\n- Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I wore a mask to the store because I didn't want to be caught taking merchandise.\"\n- Wearing a mask to avoid being caught while committing theft is clearly morally wrong. Theft is illegal and unethical.\n- Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
