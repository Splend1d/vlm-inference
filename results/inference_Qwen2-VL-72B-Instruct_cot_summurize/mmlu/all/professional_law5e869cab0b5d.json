The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\n\nThe mantle of authority test is used to determine whether a private party's actions can be attributed to the state for purposes of constitutional analysis. This test requires a significant connection between the state and the private party's actions. In this scenario, while the state owns the land and receives rent from both the mall and the grocery store, the state does not appear to be directly involved in the decision to prevent picketers from entering the mall or striking inside. Therefore, it is unlikely that the court would find sufficient state action to hold the store and the mall owners liable under the First and Fourteenth Amendments based on the information provided."
