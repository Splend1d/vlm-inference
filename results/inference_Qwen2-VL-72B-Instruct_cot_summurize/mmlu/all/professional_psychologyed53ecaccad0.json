This build-up can lead to brain damage and other health problems if not managed properly. The mental retardation associated with PKU is preventable by following a special low-phenylalanine diet, which restricts the intake of foods high in phenylalanine, such as dairy products, meat, fish, and some grains. Early detection through newborn screening and adherence to the diet are crucial for preventing the complications of PKU."
