After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

                    "text": "The best defense for the defendants in this scenario would be:\n\n**D. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.**\n\nHere's why: \n\nIn jurisdictions that follow the agency theory of felony murder, the felony murder rule applies only when the death is caused by an agent of the defendants (i.e., one of the defendants themselves or someone acting on their behalf). If the death results from the actions of a third party who is not an agent of the defendants, then the felony murder rule does not apply.\n\nGiven that it is impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for fracturing the victim's skull, if the jurisdiction follows the agency theory, the defendants could argue that since it cannot be proven which defendant caused the fatal injury, the felony murder charge should not apply. This defense hinges on the inability to establish which defendant was the direct agent causing the death.\n\nLet's briefly discuss the other options:\n\n- **A. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement:** This defense would not be effective because the inherent danger of the felony (assault) is already established, and the death occurred during the commission of that felony.\n\n- **B. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule:** This defense would also not be effective because under this rule, the felony murder charge can still apply even if the death was caused by a third party, as long as the death occurred during the commission of the felony.\n\n- **C. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory:** This defense would not be effective either because under the proximate cause theory, the felony murder rule applies if the death is a foreseeable result of the felony, regardless of who directly caused the death.\n\nTherefore, the most effective defense for the defendants in this situation would be to argue that the jurisdiction follows the agency theory, as it requires proof of which defendant was the direct agent causing the death."
