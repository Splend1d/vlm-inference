                    "text": "The lattice enthalpy of an ionic substance is determined by the strength of the electrostatic forces between its ions. These forces are influenced by the charges on the ions and the distance between them.\n\n1. **Charge**: The higher the charge on the ions, the stronger the electrostatic attraction and thus the greater the lattice enthalpy.\n2. **Size**: Smaller ions result in shorter distances between the centers of the ions, leading to stronger electrostatic forces and a higher lattice enthalpy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **MgO (Magnesium Oxide)**: Contains Mg\u00b2\u207a and O\u00b2\u207b ions. Both ions have a +2 or -2 charge, resulting in a strong electrostatic attraction.\n- **MgS (Magnesium Sulfide)**: Contains Mg\u00b2\u207a and S\u00b2\u207b ions. Similar to MgO, both ions have a +2 or -2 charge, but sulfur is larger than oxygen, so the distance between the ions is slightly greater, reducing the lattice enthalpy compared to MgO.\n- **NaF (Sodium Fluoride)**: Contains Na\u207a and F\u207b ions. Both ions have a +1 or -1 charge, resulting in weaker electrostatic attraction compared to MgO and MgS.\n- **NaCl (Sodium Chloride)**: Contains Na\u207a and Cl\u207b ions. Similar to NaF, both ions have a +1 or -1 charge, but chlorine is larger than fluorine, so the distance between the ions is greater, further reducing the lattice enthalpy compared to NaF.\n\nGiven these considerations, **MgO** has the highest lattice enthalpy because it contains ions with the highest charges (+2 and -2) and relatively small sizes, leading to the strongest electrostatic forces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. MgO**"
