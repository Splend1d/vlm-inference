If the situation was genuinely humorous and the friend was not truly upset, it might not be morally wrong.\n- If the friend was genuinely upset and the laughter was at their expense, it would be considered morally wrong.\n- Without more context, it's difficult to definitively say if this action is morally wrong, but it could be seen as insensitive.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the lack of consent.\n- Scenario 2 may or may not be morally wrong depending on context, but it could be seen as insensitive.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**"
