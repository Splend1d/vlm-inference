Battery typically requires only a general intent to cause harm or offensive contact, and being intoxicated does not negate this intent. The husband's state of intoxication does not change the fact that he intentionally fired the gun at his wife, even if he did not intend to cause serious injury or death due to believing the gun was unloaded."
