Let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. NO2(g)**: The oxidation state of nitrogen increases from +2 to +4, which means it is being oxidized, not reduced.\n- **B. N2(g)**: The oxidation state of nitrogen decreases from +2 to 0, which means it is being reduced.\n- **C. NO3-(aq)**: The oxidation state of nitrogen increases from +2 to +5, which means it is being oxidized, not reduced.\n- **D. NO2-(aq)**: The oxidation state of nitrogen increases from +2 to +3, which means it is being oxidized, not reduced.\n\nTherefore, the only option where NO(g) is reduced (its oxidation state decreases) is:\n\n**B.
