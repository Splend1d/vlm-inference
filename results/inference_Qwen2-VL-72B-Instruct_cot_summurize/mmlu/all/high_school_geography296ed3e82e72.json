A universalizing religion is one that seeks to appeal to all people, regardless of their original beliefs, and aims to spread its teachings globally.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Islam and Judaism:\n- Islam is a universalizing religion as it seeks to convert people from all backgrounds.\n- Judaism is not considered a universalizing religion because it primarily focuses on the Jewish community and does not actively seek converts.\n\nB. Judaism and Buddhism:\n- Judaism is not a universalizing religion (as explained above).\n- Buddhism can be considered a universalizing religion as it has spread widely and accepts converts from any background.\n\nC. Hinduism and Buddhism:\n- Hinduism is not typically considered a universalizing religion because it is closely tied to the culture and traditions of India and does not actively seek converts outside of this context.\n- Buddhism is a universalizing religion (as explained above).\n\nD. Christianity and Buddhism:\n- Christianity is a universalizing religion as it actively seeks to convert people from all backgrounds and has spread globally.\n- Buddhism is also a universalizing religion (as explained above).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Christianity and Buddhism"
