The price of crude oil, a raw material for gasoline, rises.\n\nWhen the price of a raw material like crude oil increases, it raises the cost of production for gasoline. This shift in the supply curve to the left (due to higher costs) leads to a new equilibrium with a higher price and lower quantity of gasoline supplied. Therefore, an increase in the price of crude oil is most likely to increase the price of gasoline."
