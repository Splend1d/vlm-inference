The soil was highly acidic and aerobic, which offers excellent preservation for organic artifacts.\nB. The soil was waterlogged and provided conditions that allowed for the preservation of organic material.\nC. The wooden spears were placed in a cache of artifacts in plain sight, where archaeologists would eventually find them.\nD. The wooden spears were covered with dried blood mixed with charcoal and mud, which allows for the preservation of wood.\n"

The soil was waterlogged and provided conditions that allowed for the preservation of organic material.\n\nWaterlogged soils create anaerobic (oxygen-poor) conditions that inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi that typically decompose organic materials like wood. This anaerobic environment helps preserve organic artifacts over long periods, making it possible to recover nearly intact wooden spears from such an ancient site."
