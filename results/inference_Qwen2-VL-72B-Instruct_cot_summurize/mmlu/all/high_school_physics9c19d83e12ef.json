Since the pipe is horizontal, there is no change in elevation, so we can simplify Bernoulli's equation to:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_2^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P_1 \\) is the pressure at Point 1,\n- \\( P_2 \\) is the pressure at Point 2,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid,\n- \\( V_1 \\) is the velocity at Point 1,\n- \\( V_2 \\) is the velocity at Point 2.\n\nGiven that the flow rate is constant, we can use the continuity equation to relate the velocities at Points 1 and 2:\n\n\\[ Q = A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the flow rate,\n- \\( A_1 \\) is the cross-sectional area at Point 1,\n- \\( A_2 \\) is the cross-sectional area at Point 2.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of a circular pipe is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nSince the diameter at Point 1 is \\( d \\), the radius \\( r_1 \\) is \\( \\frac{d}{2} \\).
