This disclosure informs users of the financial statements that they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is important for understanding the limitations of the financial information provided. The accountant does not necessarily need to withdraw from the engagement or insist on adjustments to conform with GAAP, nor is it typical to request justification for the use of another basis of accounting in the management representation letter. Instead, the focus is on ensuring that the users of the financial statements are aware of the basis used."
