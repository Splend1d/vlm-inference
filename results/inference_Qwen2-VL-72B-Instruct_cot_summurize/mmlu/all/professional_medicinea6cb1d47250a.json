Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\n\nSetting the alpha level at 0.01 instead of 0.05 means that the threshold for statistical significance is stricter. This reduces the probability of making a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis), also known as a false positive. Therefore, if a finding is deemed statistically significant at this lower alpha level, it can be reported with greater confidence because it has passed a more stringent test of significance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that reducing the alpha level also decreases the study's power, increases the likelihood of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis), and makes it less likely to find statistically significant results. So options B, C, and D are not correct in this context."
