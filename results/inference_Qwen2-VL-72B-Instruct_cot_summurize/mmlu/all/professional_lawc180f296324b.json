By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nB. The mother was under an implied duty to act in good faith to reasonably cooperate with the photographer in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nC. An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nD. The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract.\n"

However, contracts typically do not assume such risks without explicit terms addressing them. Therefore, this statement might not be entirely accurate.\n\nB. **The mother was under an implied duty to act in good faith to reasonably cooperate with the photographer in arranging for the taking of the photographs.**\n   - This statement is generally accurate because it reflects the principle of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which often includes reasonable cooperation between parties.\n\nC. **An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.**\n   - This statement is also accurate because cooperation is often an implied condition in contracts where one party's performance depends on the other's cooperation.\n\nD. **The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract.**\n   - This statement is accurate because if one party breaches their duty to cooperate, the other party may be excused from their obligations and have grounds for legal action.\n\nGiven the analysis, the least accurate statement is:\n\n**A. By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.**\n\nThis statement inaccurately suggests that the photographer assumed all risks related to the mother's cooperation without any mention of such terms in the contract."
