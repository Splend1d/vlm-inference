It does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others.\n- Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I didn't know the answers to the exam so my friend took it for me.\"\n- Allowing someone else to take an exam for you is a form of cheating. Cheating is widely regarded as morally wrong because it involves dishonesty and unfair advantage over others who have prepared and taken the exam themselves.\n- Therefore, this action is morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
