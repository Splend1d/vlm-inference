The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States provided significant loans and supplies to its allies in Europe, particularly Britain and France. After the war, these countries were heavily indebted to the United States, which had become a major creditor nation. This shift in economic power was further solidified by the fact that the United States had largely escaped the physical devastation of the war, allowing it to emerge as a dominant industrial and financial power. The war also disrupted European economies and trade networks, creating opportunities for American businesses to expand their influence globally."
