This act is considered heinous and illegal.\n\nScenario 2 involves putting a child in the corner as a form of discipline, commonly known as a \"time out.\" While opinions on this method may vary, it is generally not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020, provided it is done safely and without causing harm or distress to the child."
