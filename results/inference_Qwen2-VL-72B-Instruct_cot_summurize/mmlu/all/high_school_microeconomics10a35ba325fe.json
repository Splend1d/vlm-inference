Bob and Nancy each receive a \"$1 off\" coupon in the mail, but Bob redeems it while Nancy does not.\n\nPrice discrimination occurs when different customers are charged different prices for the same product or service, often based on their willingness or ability to pay. In option B, both Bob and Nancy have the opportunity to redeem the same discount, so there is no differential pricing based on their characteristics or behavior; it simply comes down to whether they choose to use the coupon or not. The other options illustrate scenarios where different prices are charged to different customers under similar circumstances, which is indicative of price discrimination."
