The absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus intensity required for an individual to detect a sensation 50% of the time. In this case, the study aims to determine the smallest amount of salt (one gram) that most people can taste in one quart of water, which aligns with the definition of an absolute threshold."
