Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Amniotic fluid embolism\nB. Intracerebral hemorrhage\nC. Myocardial infarction\nD. Status asmaticus\n"

Amniotic fluid embolism\n\nAmniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but severe complication that can occur during pregnancy or childbirth. It involves the sudden entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation, leading to anaphylactic-like reactions, cardiovascular collapse, and potentially fatal complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The symptoms described\u2014acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, loss of consciousness, and undetectable pulse and blood pressure\u2014are consistent with AFE. The subsequent bleeding from various sites suggests DIC, which is commonly associated with AFE."
