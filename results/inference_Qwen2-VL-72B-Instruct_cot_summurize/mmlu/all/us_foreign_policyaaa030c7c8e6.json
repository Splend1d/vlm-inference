Bush decided not to pursue Saddam Hussein's forces into Iraq despite having the opportunity to do so. The primary reasons for this decision were the limited mandate provided by the United Nations, which was focused on liberating Kuwait, and the desire to avoid a protracted conflict that could have destabilized the region further and potentially led to significant American casualties. Additionally, there were concerns about the potential for a power vacuum in Iraq and the broader geopolitical implications of removing Saddam Hussein from power."
