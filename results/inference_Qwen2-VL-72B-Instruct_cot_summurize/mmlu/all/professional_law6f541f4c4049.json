The driver of the other car sued the company. The company, in its defense, claimed that the employee's use of the vehicle was unauthorized. At trial, the company calls the employee's boss. The boss offers to testify that the employee called him five minutes after the accident and stated, \"I hope you won't be sore, because I took the company car without permission. \"The court should rule that this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible, because the employee was not unavailable.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.\n"

This means that if a statement is made by someone who is a party to the lawsuit (or their agent or employee acting within the scope of their employment), and the statement is against their own interest, it can be used as evidence against them. In this case, the employee's statement to their boss about taking the company car without permission is an admission that could be used against the company in the lawsuit. Therefore, the court should rule that this evidence is admissible as an admission."
