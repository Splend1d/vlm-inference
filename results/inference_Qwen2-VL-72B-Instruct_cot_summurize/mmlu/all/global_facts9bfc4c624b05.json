However, a significant portion of the population often holds positive views on diversity, especially in countries with large populations and diverse demographics like India.\n\nConsidering this, the higher percentages (C and D) seem more plausible than the lower ones (A and B). Between C and D, D (68%) seems particularly high for such a nuanced opinion, making C (53%) a more reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. 53%"
