According to this theory, the Earth has been shaped by sudden and catastrophic events, such as floods, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes, rather than by gradual processes over long periods of time. Cuvier believed that these catastrophes had caused mass extinctions of species, which were then replaced by new species that evolved from survivors of the previous catastrophe. This theory was later replaced by the theory of uniformitarianism, which holds that the Earth has been shaped by gradual processes acting over long periods of time."
