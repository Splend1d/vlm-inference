                    "text": "To determine the easiest way to burn a copper penny, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. **Hold the copper penny with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.**\n   - This method involves direct heating of the penny using a Bunsen burner. Copper has a high melting point (about 1085\u00b0C) and is resistant to oxidation at lower temperatures. Heating it directly might not cause significant burning or oxidation unless the temperature is extremely high.\n\nB. **Use the method in (A), but use an oxyacetylene torch to reach a higher temperature.**\n   - An oxyacetylene torch can reach much higher temperatures than a Bunsen burner (up to about 3160\u00b0C). This higher temperature could potentially oxidize the copper more effectively, but it still requires handling the penny and maintaining a steady flame.\n\nC. **Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.**\n   - By grinding the penny into fine particles, you increase the surface area exposed to the flame. This makes it easier for the copper to react with oxygen and form copper oxide. Spraying these particles into the flame ensures they are heated uniformly and rapidly, promoting efficient oxidation.\n\nD. **Dissolve the copper penny in acid, precipitate the hydroxide, and heat in a Bunsen burner flame to make the oxide.**\n   - This method involves multiple chemical steps: dissolving the penny, precipitating the hydroxide, and then heating to form the oxide. While effective, it is more complex and time-consuming compared to direct heating methods.\n\nConsidering the ease and efficiency of each method, **Option C** stands out as the easiest way to burn a copper penny. Grinding the penny into fine particles and spraying them into a Bunsen burner flame maximizes the surface area exposed to heat, facilitating rapid and uniform oxidation.\n\nFinal answer: **C. Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.**"
