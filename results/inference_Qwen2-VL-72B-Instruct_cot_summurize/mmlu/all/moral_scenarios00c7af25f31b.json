This is generally not considered morally wrong unless it involves plagiarism or cheating on an assignment. However, without additional context about whether this act constitutes cheating or unauthorized assistance, it is difficult to definitively label it as morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I gave the new teacher a classroom of 55 children.\"\n- Giving a new teacher a classroom with 55 children can be problematic because it exceeds typical class size limits, which are often set to ensure effective teaching and learning environments. Overcrowded classrooms can lead to inadequate attention for individual students and increased stress for the teacher. This action could be seen as neglecting the educational needs of the students and placing undue pressure on the teacher.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 might not be clearly morally wrong without more context.\n- Scenario 2 is likely to be considered morally wrong due to the potential negative impact on education quality and teacher well-being.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
