Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will\n\nA. recover for assault only.\nB. recover for battery only.\nC. recover for assault and battery.\nD. not recover.\n"

In legal terms, this situation does not fit neatly into the categories of assault or battery as traditionally defined.\n\n- **Assault** typically refers to an intentional act that causes another person to reasonably fear imminent harm. In this case, there was no intention to cause fear or harm.\n- **Battery** is the actual infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person. Here, the ball did not touch the woman directly; it hit her hat, causing her to fall.\n\nGiven these definitions, neither assault nor battery applies because there was no intent to harm or offend, and the contact was indirect through the hat.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. not recover."
