Let's break down each option:\n\nA. **Such a policy actually implies that the protected culture is inferior.**\n   - This option contradicts Carens' argument by suggesting that the policy implies inferiority rather than superiority. It doesn't align with the idea that exclusion doesn't imply superiority.\n\nB. **The exclusion may simply reflect an attachment to what is one's own (rather than a belief in superiority).**\n   - This option supports Carens' argument by suggesting that the reason for exclusion could be due to a natural inclination to protect one's own culture or people, without implying any sense of superiority.\n\nC. **Superiority and inferiority are inherently subjective concepts.**\n   - While this statement is true, it doesn't directly address why a policy of exclusion doesn't imply superiority. It speaks more about the nature of these concepts rather than the specific context of exclusion policies.\n\nD. **Only superior cultures have freedom of movement.**\n   - This option introduces a new concept that isn't relevant to Carens' argument. It doesn't explain why a policy of exclusion doesn't imply superiority.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. The exclusion may simply reflect an attachment to what is one's own (rather than a belief in superiority).**\n\nThis option directly addresses Carens' point by providing a plausible alternative reason for exclusion policies that doesn't involve claims of superiority."
