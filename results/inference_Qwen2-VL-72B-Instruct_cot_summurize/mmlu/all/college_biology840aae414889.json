The first signal peptide directs the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the second signal peptide or a modification of the protein helps target it to the plasma membrane. This process involves multiple steps including translocation across the ER membrane, processing in the Golgi apparatus, and finally transport to the plasma membrane."
