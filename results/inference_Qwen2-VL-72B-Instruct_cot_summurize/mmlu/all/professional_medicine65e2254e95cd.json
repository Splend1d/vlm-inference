Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen\nC. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nD.

                    "text": "To calculate the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, we need to determine the proportion of true positive results among all individuals who actually have the disease. Sensitivity is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives + False Negatives}} \\]\n\nIn this context:\n- True Positives (TP) are the number of men correctly identified as having prostate cancer by the test.\n- False Negatives (FN) are the number of men who have prostate cancer but were not identified by the test.\n\nGiven information:\n- 100 men underwent biopsy because their serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration was greater than 5 ng/mL.\n- Out of these 100 men, 90 had prostate cancer and 5 had chronic prostatitis.\n- Therefore, 90 out of 100 men with PSA > 5 ng/mL had prostate cancer, which means they are true positives.\n\nTo find the false negatives, we need to know how many men with prostate cancer did not have a PSA level above 5 ng/mL. This requires knowing the number of men with PSA levels \u2264 5 ng/mL who also had prostate cancer.\n\nThus, the necessary information to calculate the sensitivity includes:\n- The number of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL who underwent biopsy and were found to have prostate cancer (false negatives).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL"
