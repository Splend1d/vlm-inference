A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?\n\nA. No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the proposed state law would be constitutional, we need to consider both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Equal Protection Clause:**\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states treat similarly situated individuals equally under the law. If the proposed law allows the city's school board to sell a vacant public school building to the church at a price below its fair market value without competitive bidding, while other potential buyers must bid competitively, it could be seen as discriminatory and thus potentially unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Establishment Clause:**\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or showing preferential treatment to one religion over another. Selling a public school building to a church at a below-market price could be viewed as providing a financial benefit to a religious institution, which might be seen as an impermissible endorsement of religion.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A:** This option suggests that the law would be unconstitutional due to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. While there is merit to this argument, it does not address the Establishment Clause issue.\n  \n- **Option B:** This option correctly identifies that the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances could be seen as an establishment of religion, which is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This is a strong argument against the constitutionality of the proposed law.\n\n- **Option C:** This option incorrectly asserts that surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause. This is not accurate; government actions involving religious institutions are still subject to scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.\n\n- **Option D:** This option argues that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church. However, selling a public asset to a religious institution at a below-market price can be seen as a substantial support, especially if no other bidders have the same opportunity.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.**"
