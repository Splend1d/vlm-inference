These changes likely led to habitat loss and altered food sources, which could have contributed to the extinction of many ape species. The other options listed are not accurate reasons for the extinctions at the end of the Miocene. Humans did not exist at that time, the asteroid impact mentioned (the Chicxulub impact) occurred much earlier at the end of the Cretaceous period, and dinosaurs had already gone extinct by the Miocene."
