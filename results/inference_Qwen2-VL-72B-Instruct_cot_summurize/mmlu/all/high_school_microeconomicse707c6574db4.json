The demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer, it is likely to increase the desirability and perceived health benefits of this product. As a result, more consumers will want to purchase multigrained bread at any given price, leading to an increase in demand. This increase in demand is represented by a shift of the demand curve to the right. With the demand curve shifting to the right, if the supply remains unchanged, the equilibrium price of multigrained bread will increase due to higher demand."
