This relationship is given by Wien's displacement law: \u03bb_max = b / T, where \u03bb_max is the wavelength of maximum emission, T is the absolute temperature, and b is a constant (approximately 2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 m\u00b7K).\n\nGiven that the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5778 K:\n\n- Using Wien's displacement law: \n  \\[\n  \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.898 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m\u00b7K}}{5778 \\text{ K}} \\approx 5.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}\n  \\]\n  \nThis corresponds to a wavelength in the yellow-green part of the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the color of light most intense in the solar radiation curve is:\n\n**C. yellow-green**"
