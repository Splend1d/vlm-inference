In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.\nB. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.\nC. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\nD. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.\n"

All of these options.\n\nThe Ideal Policy framework suggests that for coercive diplomacy to be successful, several conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Military Superiority and Capability**: The coercer must be militarily superior and capable of imposing significant costs on the opponent, thereby making the threat credible (Option A).\n\n2. **Credibility of Threats**: Merely having the capability is not enough; the threat must also be credible. This involves setting clear deadlines for compliance (Option B) and ensuring that the opponent believes the coercer is willing to follow through with the threat.\n\n3. **Assurance Against New Demands**: To prevent the opponent from fearing future demands, assurances must be provided, which can enhance the likelihood of compliance (Option C).\n\n4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis for the Adversary**: The threat should be designed to make non-compliance too costly for the adversary, both in terms of immediate consequences and potential long-term implications (Option D).\n\nTherefore, all of the options listed contribute to explaining the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy according to the Ideal Policy framework."
