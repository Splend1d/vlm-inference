Persia was brought into the Arabian orbit over the course of the period.\n\nThe period between 600 and 1450 C.E. saw significant changes in the Middle East, including the rise of Islam and the expansion of the Islamic caliphates. By the end of this period, Persia (modern-day Iran) had been incorporated into the Islamic world, which had its origins in Arabia. The spread of Islam and the establishment of Muslim rule across Persia marked a shift in political and cultural influence, effectively bringing Persia into the Arabian orbit."
