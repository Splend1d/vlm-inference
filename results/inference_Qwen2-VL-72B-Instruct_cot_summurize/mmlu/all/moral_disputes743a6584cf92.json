This aligns with Carens's argument that liberal egalitarianism supports more inclusive immigration policies.\n\nB. **Liberal egalitarianism, contrary to appearances, entails that only closed border immigration policies are acceptable.**\n   - This option contradicts Carens's stance. He argues against closed borders and supports more openness, so this cannot be his main conclusion.\n\nC. **Egalitarianism is founded on sentiments of envy and is therefore unjustified.**\n   - This option does not reflect Carens's views. He does not argue that egalitarianism is based on envy or that it is unjustified.\n\nD. **Liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed.**\n   - This option implies that Carens believes liberal egalitarian arguments against anticosmopolitanism (which typically advocates for closed borders) are unsuccessful. However, Carens actually supports liberal egalitarian arguments for more openness, indicating that he believes these objections do succeed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate reflection of Carens's main conclusion is:\n\n**A. Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.**"
