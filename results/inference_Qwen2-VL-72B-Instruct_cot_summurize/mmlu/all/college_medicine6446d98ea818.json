Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\n**Option B: 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019**\n- This sequence has deletions (missing several nucleotides), but there is no clear indication of a point mutation. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\n**Option C: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019**\n- This sequence has a point mutation (the second A changed to T) and a deletion (missing the third nucleotide, C). Therefore, it fits the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\n**Option D: 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019**\n- This sequence has a deletion (missing the fourth nucleotide, T) but no point mutation. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of having both a point mutation and a deletion.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019**"
