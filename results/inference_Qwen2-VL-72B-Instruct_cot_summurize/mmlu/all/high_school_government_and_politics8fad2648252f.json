Arizona case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1966, established that individuals in police custody must be informed of their rights under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects against self-incrimination. This decision was based on the incorporation of the Fifth Amendment's protections through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies these protections to state governments as well as the federal government. The ruling requires law enforcement officers to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney before any custodial interrogation takes place."
