The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of additional disposable income that is saved.\n\nGiven:\n- Current disposable income = $10000\n- Consumption spending = $8000\n- For every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial savings:\n\\[ \\text{Initial Savings} = \\text{Disposable Income} - \\text{Consumption Spending} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Initial Savings} = 10000 - 8000 = 2000 \\]\n\nNext, consider an increase in disposable income by $100. According to the given information, for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10.\n\nThus, if disposable income increases by $100, consumption will increase by:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Consumption} = 100 - 10 = 90 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the MPC and MPS:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPC} = \\frac{\\text{Increase in Consumption}}{\\text{Increase in Disposable Income}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{MPC} = \\frac{90}{100} = 0.90 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{MPS} = \\frac{\\text{Increase in Saving}}{\\text{Increase in Disposable Income}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{MPS} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 0.10.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. the marginal propensity to save is .10."
