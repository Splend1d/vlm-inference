Has an uncertain relationship with skeletal health because research studies are confounded by associated lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and alcohol consumption\n\nThe relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and skeletal health is complex and not fully understood. While some studies suggest that higher intake of fruits and vegetables may be beneficial for bone health due to their high content of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, other studies have found mixed or no significant associations. This uncertainty can be attributed to the influence of various confounding factors, including lifestyle habits like smoking, physical activity levels, and alcohol consumption, which can impact both dietary choices and bone health outcomes. Therefore, more research is needed to clarify the specific role of fruit and vegetable consumption in maintaining or improving skeletal health."
