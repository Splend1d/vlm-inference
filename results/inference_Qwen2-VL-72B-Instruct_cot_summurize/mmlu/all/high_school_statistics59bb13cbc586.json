A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out from the mean (average), which means there is greater variability or heterogeneity in the data. Conversely, a lower standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean, suggesting less variability and greater homogeneity.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Bee's class has a standard deviation of 11.2, while Mr. Em's class has a standard deviation of 5.6. Since 5.6 is less than 11.2, it can be concluded that Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous (less variable) than Mr. Bee's class."
