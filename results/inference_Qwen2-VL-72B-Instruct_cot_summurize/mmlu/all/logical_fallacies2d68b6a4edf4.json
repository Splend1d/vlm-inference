The Dean means there is only one student out of every hundred people on campus (which would imply a very small student population).\n2. The Dean means that approximately 1% of the total population on campus are students (which would imply a much larger student population).\n\nGiven this ambiguity, the Dean is using a word (\"one in a hundred\") in a way that can lead to misunderstanding or misinterpretation. This aligns with the definition of equivocation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Equivocation**"
