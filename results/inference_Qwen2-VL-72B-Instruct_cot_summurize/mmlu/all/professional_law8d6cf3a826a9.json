The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?\n\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\nB. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.\nC. Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\nD. Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.\n"

Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the court should deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence. The issue revolves around whether the son, as the landowner, breached his duty of care to the grandfather, who is a visitor to the property. The traditional rules of landowner liability typically involve assessing whether the landowner exercised reasonable care under the circumstances. \n\nThe fact that the grandfather was aware of the grandson's habit of leaving toys around could be relevant to determining whether the son had a duty to warn or if the grandfather assumed some level of risk. However, these are factual questions that need to be evaluated by a jury, considering all the evidence presented.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate course of action is to allow the jury to decide whether the son was negligent in not warning the grandfather about the potential hazard posed by the toys."
