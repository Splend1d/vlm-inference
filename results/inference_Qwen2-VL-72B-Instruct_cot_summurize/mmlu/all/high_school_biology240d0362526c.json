It can be positive, negative, or zero.\n   - Pure water has a water potential of 0.\n\n2. **Initial Condition of Pure Water:**\n   - Since the beaker contains pure water, its water potential is 0. This means options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the water potential is either negative or positive, which is not true for pure water.\n\n3. **Initial Condition of the Potato:**\n   - Potatoes contain cells with cell walls and cell membranes that regulate the movement of water. When a potato is placed in pure water, it will initially have a higher solute concentration inside its cells compared to the pure water outside.\n   - This higher solute concentration results in a lower water potential within the potato cells compared to pure water. Therefore, the water potential of the potato is negative relative to pure water.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The water potential of the potato is negative.**"
