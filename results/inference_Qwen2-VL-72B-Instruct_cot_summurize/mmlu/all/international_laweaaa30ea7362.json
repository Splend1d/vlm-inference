Among these criteria, the most prominent ones included:\n\n- **Respect for Existing Borders**: The commission emphasized that the borders of the existing republics should be respected and not altered through force or coercion.\n- **Peaceful Secession**: The process of secession should be peaceful and not involve the use of force.\n- **Commitment to Human Rights and Democracy**: New states were expected to demonstrate a commitment to upholding human rights and democratic principles.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy\n\nThis criterion was crucial as it aimed to ensure that the newly formed states would adhere to international standards of governance and respect for individual freedoms."
