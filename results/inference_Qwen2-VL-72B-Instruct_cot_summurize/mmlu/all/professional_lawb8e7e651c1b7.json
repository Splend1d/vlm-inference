The boat owner was navigating his craft toward shore when heavy rain and wind gusts began to rock the boat. Unable to reach his own slip, the boat owner docked his boat on a pier owned by a resident who lived in a nearby house. The resident objected to the boat owner's entry onto his private property. The boat owner explained that due to the storm it would be highly dangerous to be at sea. He requested permission to temporarily dock his boat until the storm subsided. The resident refused and cut the rope tying the boat to the dock. As a result, the boat drifted out to sea. The boat was battered by the rocky waves and high winds. Trying to prevent the boat from capsizing, the boat owner fell and broke his leg. The boat was extensively damaged in the storm, as well. The boat owner has sued the resident, seeking to recover damages for his personal injury, as well as damage to the boat. The boat owner should\n\nA. recover for the damage to the boat, but not recover for his personal injury.\nB. recover for his personal injury, but not recover for the damage to the boat.\nC. recover both for damage to the boat and for his personal injury.\nD. not recover for either damage to the boat or his personal injury.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the boat owner should recover damages for the boat and/or his personal injury, we need to consider several legal principles, including trespass, necessity, and tort law.\n\n1. **Trespass**: The boat owner entered the resident's private property without permission, which is generally considered trespassing. However, there may be exceptions under certain circumstances.\n\n2. **Necessity**: The boat owner claimed that docking his boat was necessary due to the storm, which could be seen as an emergency situation. In some jurisdictions, the doctrine of necessity allows individuals to enter private property without permission if it is necessary to avoid imminent danger or harm.\n\n3. **Tort Law**: If the resident's actions (cutting the rope) directly caused the boat to drift out to sea and led to the boat owner's injuries and damage to the boat, the resident might be liable for those damages under tort law.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Damage to the Boat**: The resident's action of cutting the rope directly contributed to the boat drifting out to sea and getting damaged. Therefore, the boat owner might have grounds to recover damages for the boat.\n\n- **Personal Injury**: Similarly, the resident's action indirectly caused the boat owner to fall and break his leg while trying to prevent the boat from capsizing. Thus, the boat owner might also have grounds to recover damages for his personal injury.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Recover both for damage to the boat and for his personal injury.**\n\nThis conclusion takes into account the necessity defense for the initial trespass and the direct causation of damages resulting from the resident's actions."
