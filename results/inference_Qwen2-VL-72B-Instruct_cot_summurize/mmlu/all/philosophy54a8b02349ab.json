In his framework, he introduced several concepts to measure and compare pleasures and pains. The \"fecundity\" of a pleasure or pain refers to its likelihood of producing additional pleasures or pains of the same kind. This concept is part of his calculus for measuring utility, which includes other factors such as intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity (nearness), and purity (the absence of pain following pleasure)."
