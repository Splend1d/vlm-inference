The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: \"It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. \"If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.\nB. not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.\nC. prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.\nD. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.\n"

However, when the information involves matters of public concern, such as political protests and commentary on public figures, there is often a higher threshold for establishing an invasion of privacy claim. \n\nIn this scenario, the professor is a public figure due to their involvement in high-profile political activities and their employment at a state university. Public figures have less protection under privacy laws because their actions and statements are considered matters of public interest. Additionally, the coverage of the protest and the subsequent commentary by the news anchor fall under the category of newsworthy events, which are generally protected under the First Amendment.\n\nThe anchorman's commentary, while critical, does not appear to contain false information or defamatory statements about the professor. It is an expression of opinion, which is also protected under free speech principles. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the professor would not prevail in an invasion of privacy claim because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest."
