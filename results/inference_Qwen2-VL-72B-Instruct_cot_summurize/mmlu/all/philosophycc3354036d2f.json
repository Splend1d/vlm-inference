This leads to the conclusion that individuals are free to define their own values and morality, which can result in the idea that \"anything is permissible\" because there are no external constraints or absolute moral standards. However, it's important to note that Sartre also emphasized personal responsibility and the weight of individual choices in defining one's essence and existence."
