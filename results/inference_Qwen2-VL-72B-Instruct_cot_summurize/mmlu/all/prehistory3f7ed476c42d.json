Here's how each of the options relates to this issue:\n\nA. **Negative impacts on agriculture**: Many animal species play crucial roles in pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling, which are essential for agricultural productivity. The loss of these species could lead to reduced crop yields and increased reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nB. **Negative impacts on water quality**: Animals such as beavers, otters, and certain fish species help maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems by controlling erosion, improving water flow, and filtering pollutants. Their extinction could lead to degraded water quality, affecting both human use and other wildlife.\n\nC. **Negative impacts on human health**: Biodiversity loss can affect human health in several ways. For example, declines in pollinators can reduce the availability of nutritious foods, while the loss of natural predators can lead to outbreaks of disease-carrying pests. Additionally, many medical treatments are derived from or inspired by compounds found in nature, so biodiversity loss could limit future medical discoveries.\n\nTherefore, the extinction of animal species has the potential to negatively impact agriculture, water quality, and human health, making option D the most comprehensive answer."
