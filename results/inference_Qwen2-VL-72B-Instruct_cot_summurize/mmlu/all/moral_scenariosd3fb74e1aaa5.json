Physical violence is not acceptable behavior.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using a public urinal is a normal and socially accepted practice. It is not considered morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances that make it inappropriate, such as not maintaining hygiene or using it in an improper manner. Assuming typical use, it would be considered not wrong."
