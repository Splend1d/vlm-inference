The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?\n\nA. No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC. Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\nD. Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n"

Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n\nIn this scenario, the absence of a merger clause in the written agreement means that the parties' prior negotiations and agreements can potentially be considered by the court. A merger clause typically states that the written agreement supersedes all prior understandings or agreements between the parties. Without such a clause, the court may allow evidence of the earlier oral agreement regarding the price of $100,000 to be admitted, as it could be relevant to the interpretation of the contract terms or to determine the true intentions of the parties."
