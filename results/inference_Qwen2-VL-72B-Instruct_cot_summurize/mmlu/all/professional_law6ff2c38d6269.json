The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.\nC. unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.\n"

                    "text": "The proposed bill imposing a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices raises significant constitutional questions. Let's analyze each option provided:\n\nA. **Constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n\nThis argument suggests that since the tax applies uniformly to all types of birth control devices, it does not discriminate among different groups and therefore does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. However, this reasoning overlooks the potential impact on fundamental rights.\n\nB. **Constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.**\n\nThis statement acknowledges that the tax might be motivated by controversial policy reasons but argues that such motivations alone do not render the tax unconstitutional if it serves a legitimate governmental purpose (raising revenue). This is a valid point, as courts generally defer to the legislature's judgment regarding the means chosen to achieve a legitimate end.\n\nC. **Unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.**\n\nThis argument suggests that the tax could be unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because it affects interstate and foreign commerce. However, the Commerce Clause typically concerns federal regulation of commerce, not state taxation. If the tax is imposed at the federal level, it would likely be within Congress's power to regulate commerce.\n\nD. **Unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.**\n\nThis argument is the most compelling. The Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right to privacy, which includes the right to make decisions about contraception. A tax specifically targeting birth control devices could be seen as infringing upon this fundamental right. For such a tax to be constitutional, it would need to serve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The stated purpose of raising revenue and spurring population growth may not be sufficient to meet this standard.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate assessment is:\n\n**D. Unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.**"
