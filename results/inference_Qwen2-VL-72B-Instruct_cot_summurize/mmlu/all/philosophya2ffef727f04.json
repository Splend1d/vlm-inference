Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding.\nD. Life was meaningful for most people.\n\nClarence Darrow was known for his humanistic and often skeptical views on life and society. He was a prominent lawyer and orator who often spoke about the struggles of life and the importance of individual freedom and justice. Given his public statements and writings, it is reasonable to infer that he believed in the value of life despite its hardships.\n\nConsidering this context, the most fitting option would be:\n\nB. Life was hard but worthwhile."
