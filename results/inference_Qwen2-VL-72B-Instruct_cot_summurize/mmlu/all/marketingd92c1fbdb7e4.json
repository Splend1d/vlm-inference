Intangibility, perishability, variability, inseparability, and a lack of ownership.\n\nThese are the five main characteristics that distinguish services from goods in marketing theory:\n\n1. **Intangibility**: Services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before they are purchased.\n2. **Perishability**: Services cannot be stored for later use; they must be consumed at the time they are produced.\n3. **Variability**: The quality of services can vary greatly depending on who provides them and when they are provided.\n4. **Inseparability**: The production and consumption of services occur simultaneously; the customer is often involved in the production process.\n5. **Lack of Ownership**: Unlike goods, services do not result in the transfer of ownership to the consumer.\n\nOptions A, B, and D contain incorrect terms such as \"value,\" \"profitability,\" and \"relationship,\" which are not considered primary characteristics of services."
