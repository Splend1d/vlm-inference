Arsenic-doped silicon\n\nAn n-type semiconductor is created by doping a pure semiconductor (such as silicon) with an impurity that has more valence electrons than the host material. Arsenic, which has five valence electrons, is commonly used to dope silicon and create an n-type semiconductor. The extra electron from arsenic becomes a free electron in the material, allowing it to conduct electricity better."
