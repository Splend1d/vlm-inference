However, if Macedo is known to support policies that align with either liberal or conservative ideologies, we could infer his stance based on those principles.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details, I cannot provide a definitive answer. If you have additional context or information about Macedo's views on immigration, please share it so I can give a more accurate response."
