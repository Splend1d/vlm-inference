Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **States should give special weight to their own citizens.**\n   - This statement suggests prioritizing the interests of citizens over non-citizens. Macedo might disagree if he believes in more open or inclusive immigration policies.\n\nB. **Immigration policies can have powerful economic effects.**\n   - This statement is generally accepted by most economists and policymakers as true. It is unlikely that Macedo would disagree with this factual observation.\n\nC. **Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.**\n   - If Macedo values self-determination and the right of states to control their borders, he would likely disagree with this statement, as it dismisses the moral relevance of self-governance in the immigration debate.\n\nD. **There are reasons to think U.S. immigration policy has had detrimental effects on income distribution among citizens.**\n   - This statement implies that immigration policy may negatively impact income distribution. Macedo might disagree if he believes that immigration has overall positive economic impacts or if he thinks the negative effects are overstated.\n\nGiven these analyses, the statement Macedo would most likely disagree with is:\n\n**C. Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.**\n\nThis statement directly challenges the idea that states have a moral right to control their borders and manage immigration according to their own governance principles, which Macedo might strongly support."
