Hart's concept of law, the internal point of view is crucial for distinguishing social rules that have the status of law from mere group habits or customs. According to Hart, a rule has the status of law when it is backed by the internal point of view, which means that members of society recognize the rule as a standard of behavior that they ought to follow. This recognition is what sets legal rules apart from mere social practices or customs."
