She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Abruptio placentae\nB. Fetal chromosome abnormality\nC. Hyperthyroidism\nD. Preterm labor and delivery\n"

Preterm labor and delivery\n\nThe patient's history includes a previous preterm delivery at 34 weeks' gestation, which increases her risk for preterm labor and delivery in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, the presence of a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy also increases the risk of preterm labor and delivery. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nOption A (abruptio placentae) is not necessarily more likely in this patient based on the information provided. Option B (fetal chromosome abnormality) is not necessarily more likely in this patient based on the information provided. Option C (hyperthyroidism) is not necessarily more likely in this patient based on the information provided."
