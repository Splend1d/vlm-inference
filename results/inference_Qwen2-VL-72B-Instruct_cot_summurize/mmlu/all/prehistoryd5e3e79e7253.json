The creation of such art requires advanced cognitive skills, including abstract thinking, planning, and artistic expression. These activities demonstrate a significant leap in intellectual capabilities.\n\nB. **new stone-tool technologies**: While advancements in stone-tool technology show innovation and technical skill, they primarily reflect practical problem-solving rather than broader intellectual developments like creativity or abstract thought.\n\nC. **acquisition of non-local raw materials**: This indicates trade or travel over long distances, which shows organizational skills and possibly social networks but does not directly reflect intellectual advancements in the same way as art does.\n\nD. **changes in settlement patterns**: Changes in how people settle can indicate social and economic developments, but these do not necessarily reflect intellectual advancements in the same direct manner as artistic expressions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most compelling evidence for advances in the human intellect during the Upper Paleolithic is:\n\n**A. parietal and mobiliary art**\n\nThis choice best demonstrates the complex cognitive abilities and creative expression that signify significant intellectual development."
