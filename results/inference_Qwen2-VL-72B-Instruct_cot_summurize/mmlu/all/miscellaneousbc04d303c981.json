This leads to a situation where the private market does not account for the full social cost of production.\n\nAs a result, producers will continue to produce more of the good because they do not have to pay for the full cost of the negative externality. This results in an overproduction of the good from a societal perspective, as the market fails to consider the additional costs imposed on society by the negative externality. The socially optimal level of output would be lower, taking into account the full social cost, including the negative externality."
