When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\nA. Behaviorist\nB. Psychoanalytic\nC. Cognitive behavioral\nD. Humanistic\n"

This framework focuses on the role of unconscious processes, early childhood experiences, and unresolved conflicts from the past in shaping current behavior. In this case, the officer's abusive relationship with his father, who shares physical characteristics with the individuals he disproportionately tickets, could be seen as an unresolved conflict influencing his actions unconsciously. The psychoanalytic approach would explore these underlying dynamics to understand and potentially resolve the bias."
