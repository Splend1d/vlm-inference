She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\nC. The purpose. of the parking ordinance was tofacilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks,not to protect against accidents like the onethat occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer'scar.\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured ifthe construction company had properly maintained the crane.\n"

The purpose of the parking ordinance was to facilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks, not to protect against accidents like the one that occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer's car.\n\nNegligence per se is a legal doctrine that applies when a person violates a statute or regulation designed to protect a certain class of individuals from a specific type of harm. For the doctrine to apply, the plaintiff must be part of the protected class, and the harm suffered must be of the type the statute was intended to prevent.\n\nIn this case, the parking ordinance was likely enacted to ensure that fire hydrants are accessible to firefighters in case of emergencies, not to prevent accidents involving falling objects from construction sites. Therefore, the lawyer can argue that the ordinance was not intended to protect pedestrians from the specific type of harm they suffered (injuries from a construction accident), thus undermining the applicability of the negligence per se doctrine."
