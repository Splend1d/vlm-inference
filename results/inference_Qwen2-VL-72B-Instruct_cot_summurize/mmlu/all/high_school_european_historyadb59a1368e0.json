The passage describes the reaction to the announcement of mobilization for war on August 2, 1914.\n2. The author mentions running to the district mayor's office and reading the announcement quickly.\n3. The author states, \"Dead tired but exhilarated,\" indicating a strong emotional response.\n4. When the author reports back to Georges Clemenceau, he says, \"It's singing, sir!\" which suggests a positive and enthusiastic atmosphere.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate inference is:\n\nD. mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris\n\nThis option aligns with the author's description of being \"exhilarated\" and the city \"singing,\" indicating a positive and enthusiastic reaction."
