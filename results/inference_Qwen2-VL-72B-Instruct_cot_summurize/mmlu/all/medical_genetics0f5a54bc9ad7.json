Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nEnzyme assays are commonly used in the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders, such as Tay-Sachs disease, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down a specific type of fat molecule called GM2 ganglioside. When this enzyme is deficient, the GM2 ganglioside accumulates in nerve cells, leading to the symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nWhile enzyme assays can also be used in the diagnosis of other genetic conditions, they are particularly useful in identifying carriers of Tay-Sachs disease because the enzyme deficiency is easily detectable through a simple blood test. Carriers of Tay-Sachs disease have one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene that codes for hexosaminidase A, resulting in reduced enzyme activity. Enzyme assays can measure the level of enzyme activity in a sample, allowing for the identification of carriers who may be at risk of having affected children."
