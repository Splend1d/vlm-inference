Cognitivism.\n\nCognitivism in ethics holds that moral judgments are truth-apt, meaning they can be objectively true or false. This perspective supports the idea that there are universal moral truths, including human rights, which can be recognized and upheld across different cultures and societies. Ethical relativism, on the other hand, suggests that moral standards are relative to cultural norms and individual beliefs, which can lead to the undermining of universally recognized human rights. Cognitivism provides a framework for arguing that certain moral principles, such as those encapsulated in human rights, are not merely subjective but have objective validity, thus countering the relativist position."
