Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?\n\nA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome\nB. Acute tubular necrosis\nC. Cerebral edema\nD. Cerebral hemorrhage\n"

                    "text": "The patient described in the scenario has several findings that suggest she may have experienced a drug overdose, specifically involving opiates and cocaine. The physical examination findings of erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs, along with elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, suggest rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle fibers break down and release their contents into the bloodstream.\n\nRhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury due to the release of myoglobin from damaged muscle cells. Myoglobin is a protein found in muscle tissue that can be toxic to the kidneys when it is filtered through the glomeruli and precipitates in the renal tubules, leading to obstruction and damage. The presence of pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes on microscopic examination of the urine further supports the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis and potential acute kidney injury.\n\nGiven these findings, the patient is at increased risk for:\n\nB. Acute tubular necrosis\n\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a common form of acute kidney injury that can result from rhabdomyolysis. It occurs when there is damage to the tubular cells of the kidneys, leading to impaired filtration and excretion of waste products. ATN can manifest within hours to days after the initial insult, making it a likely complication within the next 24 hours for this patient.\n\nWhile the other conditions listed (acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral edema, and cerebral hemorrhage) can also occur in certain contexts related to drug overdose or severe metabolic disturbances, they are less directly linked to the specific findings of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury in this case."
