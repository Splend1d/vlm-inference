This typically results in the creation of a month-to-month tenancy or a periodic tenancy.\n\nGiven this context, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would be:\n\nB. the widow had not given the student requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when a lease expires and the tenant continues to occupy the property with the landlord's consent (by accepting rent), a new tenancy is created, usually on a month-to-month basis. To terminate such a periodic tenancy, the landlord must provide proper notice according to local laws, which often requires a specific amount of advance notice (e.g., 30 days).\n\nTherefore, if the widow had not provided the required notice to terminate the periodic tenancy, the student could argue that he should not be evicted because the proper procedures were not followed."
