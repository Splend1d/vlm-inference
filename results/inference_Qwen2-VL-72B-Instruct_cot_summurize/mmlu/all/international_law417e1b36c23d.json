The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State, even in the case that this conduct was unauthorized or ultra vires.\n\nAccording to the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), Article 4 states: \"The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.\"\n\nThis means that the actions of any state organ, regardless of its level within the government hierarchy or whether it acts within or beyond its authority, can be attributed to the state itself under international law. This principle ensures that states cannot avoid responsibility by claiming that certain actions were taken without proper authorization or were beyond the powers of the acting organ."
