The use of metals in South America dates back to the pre-Columbian era.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 1200 B.P. (Before Present) corresponds to approximately 800 AD.\nB. 3100 B.P. corresponds to approximately 1100 BC.\nC. 5100 B.P. corresponds to approximately 3100 BC.\nD. 6200 B.P. corresponds to approximately 4200 BC.\n\nThe earliest known evidence of metalworking in South America comes from the Andean region, particularly in Peru. The first evidence of copper metallurgy in this region dates back to around 3100 BC, which aligns with option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 5100 B.P."
