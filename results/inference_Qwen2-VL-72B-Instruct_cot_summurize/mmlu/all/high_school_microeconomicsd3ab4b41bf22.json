Non-excludability means that it is difficult or impossible to prevent people from using the good, even if they do not pay for it. Non-rivalry means that one person's use of the good does not diminish another person's ability to use it.\n\nThe volunteer fire department in your community is an example of a public good because it is non-excludable (everyone in the community benefits from its services) and non-rivalrous (one person's use of the fire department's services does not prevent others from using them). Private violin lessons, a $1 ticket for admission to a museum, and a bag of potato chips are all excludable and rivalrous, so they are not public goods."
