However, it does not typically apply to issues of alienage and eligibility for state benefits like loans or scholarships.\n\n2. **Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment**: This clause prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. When a state law discriminates based on alienage, it is subject to strict scrutiny. The state must show that the classification is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest and that the means chosen are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A**: The candidate will not win based on the Privileges or Immunities Clause because this clause does not generally address issues of alienage and state benefits.\n\n- **Option B**: Classifications based on alienage are indeed subject to strict scrutiny. However, the candidate will not necessarily win just because the classification is inherently suspect; the state still has an opportunity to demonstrate a compelling interest.\n\n- **Option C**: The candidate will not lose simply because the statute promotes a compelling state interest. The state must also show that the means used (denying loans to non-citizens) are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\n- **Option D**: While alienage classifications are not per se unconstitutional, they are subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the candidate might have a strong case if the state cannot demonstrate a compelling interest and narrow tailoring.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Option B: win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the classification based on alienage triggers strict scrutiny, which gives the candidate a strong basis for challenging the statute's constitutionality."
