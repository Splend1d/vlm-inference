Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will\n\nA. win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.\nB. win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.\nC. lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Easement by Estoppel**: An easement by estoppel arises when one party relies on a representation or conduct of another party to their detriment. In this case, there is no indication that the developer made any representations to the woman about having the right to use the private road, nor is there evidence that the woman relied on such representations to her detriment.\n\n2. **Implied Easement Appurtenant**: An implied easement appurtenant typically arises when a property is divided and the use of the easement is necessary for the enjoyment of one of the divided parcels. However, the private road was constructed solely for the benefit of the owners within the residential subdivision, not for the benefit of the homeowner's property. Therefore, an implied easement appurtenant would not apply here.\n\n3. **Necessity of Access**: The fact that the woman's property does not adjoin a public road does not automatically grant her an easement over the private road. The necessity of access alone is not sufficient to create an easement without some form of legal entitlement or agreement.\n\n4. **Legal Right to Travel Over the Private Road**: The private road was constructed for the exclusive use of the owners within the residential subdivision. There is no indication that the developer granted any rights to the homeowner or subsequent owners of Parcel 2 to use the private road. Therefore, the woman has no legal right to travel over the private road based on the information provided.\n\nGiven these points, the woman will likely lose in an action brought by the teacher to enjoin the use of the private road, as she has no legal right to travel over it."
