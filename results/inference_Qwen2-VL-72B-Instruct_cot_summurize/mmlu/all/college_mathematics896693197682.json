For example, consider the elements 2 and 6 in this ring. Both are nonzero, but their product is 12, which is congruent to 0 modulo 11. Therefore, the product of these two nonzero elements is zero in this ring.\n\nThe other rings listed do not have this property:\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers: This ring is an integral domain, meaning that the product of two nonzero elements cannot be zero.\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]: This ring also does not have zero divisors, as the product of two nonzero functions will always be nonzero somewhere in the interval [0, 1].\nD. The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}: This ring is also an integral domain, so the product of two nonzero elements cannot be zero."
