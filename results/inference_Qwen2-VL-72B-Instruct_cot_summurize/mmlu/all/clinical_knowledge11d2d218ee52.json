The biceps reflex is mediated by the C5 and C6 spinal nerve roots.\n\nB. If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent.\n- This statement is also correct. In clinical assessments, if a reflex is not elicited upon tapping the tendon, it is typically documented as absent.\n\nC. The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa.\n- This statement is incorrect. The triceps tendon should be struck just above the elbow, not in the antecubital fossa.\n\nD. Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion.\n- This statement is incorrect. Brisk finger jerks are more indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion rather than a lower motor neuron lesion.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are A and B."
