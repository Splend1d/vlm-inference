In other words, for any non-zero element \\( g \\) in the group, there is no positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( ng = 0 \\).\n\n**Proof**:\n- Consider a free abelian group \\( G \\) with a basis \\( B = \\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n\\} \\). Any element \\( g \\in G \\) can be written uniquely as \\( g = k_1 b_1 + k_2 b_2 + \\cdots + k_n b_n \\), where \\( k_i \\) are integers.\n- Suppose \\( g \\) is a torsion element, i.e., there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( ng = 0 \\). Then, \\( n(k_1 b_1 + k_2 b_2 + \\cdots + k_n b_n) = 0 \\).\n- Since \\( B \\) is a basis, the only way this equation holds is if all \\( k_i \\) are zero. Hence, \\( g = 0 \\), which contradicts the assumption that \\( g \\) is non-zero.\n- Therefore, every non-zero element in a free abelian group cannot be torsion, making the group torsion-free.\n\nSo, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\n- **Definition of Finitely Generated**: An abelian group is finitely generated if there exists a finite set of generators such that every element of the group can be expressed as a linear combination of these generators with integer coefficients.\n- **Definition of Torsion-Free**: As defined earlier.\n\n**Counterexample**:\n- Consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}^{\\oplus 2} \\) (the direct sum of two copies of the integers), which is finitely generated and torsion-free but not free.\n- This group is generated by two elements, say \\( (1, 0) \\) and \\( (0, 1) \\), but it is not free because it does not have a basis in the sense that every element can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements. For example, the element \\( (1, 1) \\) can be expressed both as \\( (1, 0) + (0, 1) \\) and as \\( 2(1/2, 1/2) \\), showing that uniqueness fails.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**."
