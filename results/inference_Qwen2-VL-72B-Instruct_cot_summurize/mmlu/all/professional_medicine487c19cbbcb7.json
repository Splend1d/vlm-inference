The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer intravenous antibiotics\nB. Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management\nC. Obtain CT scan of the head\nD. Obtain echocardiography\n"

Administer intravenous antibiotics\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of increasing lethargy, fever, and elevated white blood cell count with a shift to the left (presence of band neutrophils), there is a strong suspicion of infection. The presence of a systolic click on cardiac examination could suggest endocarditis, which is a serious infection that requires prompt treatment.\n\nSince the patient is noncommunicative and there is no immediate access to their medical history or guardians, it is crucial to take action based on the available clinical findings. Intravenous antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible to address the potential infection, while efforts continue to locate the caregiver and gather more information about the patient's medical history and current medications.\n\nWaiting for contact with the caregiver (option B) could delay necessary treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. A CT scan of the head (option C) might be indicated if there were neurological symptoms suggesting a central nervous system process, but the primary concern here is the systemic infection. Echocardiography (option D) could be useful to evaluate for endocarditis, but it does not address the immediate need for antimicrobial therapy.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous antibiotics."
