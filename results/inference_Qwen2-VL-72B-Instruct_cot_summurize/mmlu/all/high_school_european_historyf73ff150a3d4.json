While the edict mentions restoring the Catholic Church, it does not make any claims about it being the \"one true Church.\"\n\nD. **that the Catholic Church caused too much trouble and hindrance in France**\n   - This option is incorrect because the passage does not blame the Catholic Church specifically for causing trouble and hindrance. Instead, it aims to resolve past conflicts and allow peaceful coexistence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct inference is:\n\n**B. that the Catholic Church should exist in France**"
