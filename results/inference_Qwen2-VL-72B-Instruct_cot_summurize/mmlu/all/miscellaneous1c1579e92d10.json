As the air descends, it is compressed by the increasing atmospheric pressure at lower elevations. This compression causes the air to warm up, a process known as adiabatic warming. The warming occurs without the addition or removal of heat from external sources, hence the term \"adiabatic.\" This warming can lead to an increase in the air's capacity to hold moisture, but it does not directly cause the air to increase in moisture content or form large amounts of dew."
