Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_2}{M_1}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are the rates of effusion of the two gases, and \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are their respective molar masses.\n\nGiven that helium (He) effuses 5.33 times faster than the unknown gas, we can set up the equation with helium's molar mass (\\( M_{He} = 4 \\text{ g/mol} \\)) and solve for the molar mass of the unknown gas (\\( M_x \\)):\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_{He}}{r_x} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_x}{M_{He}}} \\]\n\\[ 5.33 = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_x}{4}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ 5.33^2 = \\frac{M_x}{4} \\]\n\\[ 28.4089 = \\frac{M_x}{4} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ M_x = 28.4089 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ M_x = 113.6356 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\nNow, let's compare this calculated molar mass with the molar masses of the given options:\n\n- A. CO2: Carbon dioxide has a molar mass of approximately 44 g/mol.\n- B. CH4: Methane has a molar mass of approximately 16 g/mol.\n- C. C5H12: Pentane has a molar mass of approximately 72 g/mol.\n- D. C8H18: Octane has a molar mass of approximately 114 g/mol.\n\nThe molar mass closest to our calculated value of 113.6356 g/mol is that of octane (C8H18), which has a molar mass of approximately 114 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the unknown gas is most likely:\n\nD.
