He suggests that one should not make decisions based on the total amount of pain but rather focus on individual cases. This implies that Taurek does not believe in summing up pain across different people.\n\n2. **Lewis's Argument**: David Lewis also discusses the issue of aggregating pain. He argues against the idea that the total amount of pain matters more than the distribution of pain among individuals.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **All felt at a single time**:\n   - Neither Taurek nor Lewis explicitly mentions that pain must be felt simultaneously for it to be summed up. Their arguments focus more on the distribution across individuals rather than the timing.\n\nB. **All felt by a single person**:\n   - This aligns with Taurek\u2019s argument that pain should not be aggregated across different individuals. If pain is felt by a single person, it avoids the issue of aggregating pain across multiple individuals.\n\nC. **All be caused by a single source**:\n   - Neither Taurek nor Lewis focuses on the cause of pain as a condition for aggregation. Their discussions center around whether pain can be summed up across different individuals, regardless of its source.\n\nD. **All of the above**:\n   - Since only option B aligns with Taurek and Lewis's arguments, this option cannot be correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. all felt by a single person.**"
