As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a complex interplay of criminal law principles, particularly regarding accomplice liability and causation. Here\u2019s an analysis of each option:\n\nA. **Murder**: Murder typically requires intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm. The girlfriend did not have this intent; she merely changed her mind about participating in the robbery and left the scene before the crime occurred. Therefore, she cannot be held liable for murder.\n\nB. **Involuntary manslaughter**: Involuntary manslaughter generally involves unintentional but criminally negligent behavior that results in someone's death. The girlfriend's act of leaving the keys in the car with the motor running could be seen as reckless, but it is a stretch to directly link her actions to the pedestrian's death without further evidence of negligence or foreseeability.\n\nC. **Voluntary manslaughter**: Voluntary manslaughter involves intentional killing in the heat of passion or under circumstances of provocation. This does not apply here because the girlfriend did not participate in the actual robbery or the subsequent events leading to the pedestrian's death.\n\nD. **No crime**: Given that the girlfriend had no direct involvement in the robbery itself or the subsequent accident, and considering she abandoned her role in the crime before it was committed, it is reasonable to conclude that she should not be held criminally responsible for the pedestrian's death.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most appropriate answer is D. No crime."
