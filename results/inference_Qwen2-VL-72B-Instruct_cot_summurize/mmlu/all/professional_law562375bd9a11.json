The defense medical expert did an independent medical examination and reviewed all medical records. The expert testified that the accident did not cause the injuries because the medical records proved a long history of prior treatment for the same symptoms. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but awarded only $10 in damages. On post-trial motions, the plaintiff argued that the expert's testimony was inadmissible hearsay because he based it on prior treating physicians' records, and the prior doctors were not available for cross-examination. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what is the correct ruling?\n\nA. Testimony regarding the plaintiff's condition prior to the accident is irrelevant and the testimony is inadmissible.\nB. The Federal Rules of Evidence allow the admission of hearsay statements that were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\nC. Medical testimony that is relevant to the issues can never by excluded from the defendant's case because it is always reliable.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible hearsay because there was a constitutional right under these facts to cross-examine the doctors who wrote the prior records.\n"

The Federal Rules of Evidence allow the admission of hearsay statements that were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, certain types of hearsay are admissible if they fall within recognized exceptions. One such exception is for statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment (Rule 803(4)). This rule allows the admission of statements made by patients to healthcare providers for the purpose of obtaining medical care, as well as statements made by healthcare providers in medical records for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. These statements are considered reliable because they are typically made in circumstances where the declarant has no motive to lie.\n\nIn this scenario, the defense medical expert relied on medical records created by prior treating physicians for the purpose of diagnosing and treating the plaintiff's condition. Therefore, the expert's testimony based on those records would generally be admissible under Rule 803(4) as an exception to the hearsay rule."
