High LPC leaders, who tend to have a more relationship-oriented style, perform better in moderately favorable situations where they can balance task completion with maintaining good relationships. In contrast, low LPC leaders, who are more task-oriented, tend to be more effective in either very favorable or very unfavorable situations."
