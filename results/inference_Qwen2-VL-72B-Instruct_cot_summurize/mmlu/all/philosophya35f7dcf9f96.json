Bentham's ethical theory is grounded in empirical observation and the principle of utility, rather than divine command or theological considerations.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. \"we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God\u2019s will.\"\n- This option suggests that moral judgments should be made independently of religious considerations. Bentham would likely agree with this, as his utilitarian ethics prioritize the consequences of actions over adherence to divine commands.\n\nB. \"we must first know whether something conforms to God\u2019s will before we can know that it is right.\"\n- This option implies that moral correctness is derived from conformity to God's will. Bentham would disagree with this, as his ethics are based on the principle of utility, not divine command.\n\nC. \"God exists, but does not concern himself with matters of morality.\"\n- While Bentham did not explicitly deny the existence of God, his ethical framework does not rely on the existence or actions of a deity. His focus is on human well-being and the consequences of actions.\n\nD. \"God does not exist.\"\n- Bentham did not explicitly state that God does not exist. His philosophical work primarily focuses on ethics and law without delving deeply into the existence of God.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate representation of Bentham's views on the relationship between morality and theology is:\n\n**A. we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God\u2019s will.**\n\nThis aligns with Bentham's utilitarian approach, where moral judgments are based on the outcomes of actions rather than their conformity to divine will."
