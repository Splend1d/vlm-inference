This theory explains behaviors that aim to satisfy physiological needs such as hunger, thirst, and other basic biological requirements.\n\nLet's analyze each option in the context of drive-reduction theory:\n\nA. **Jerome grabs water from the water station to quench his thirst.**\n   - This behavior directly addresses the need to reduce the drive of thirst, which aligns well with drive-reduction theory.\n\nB. **Ernest gobbles a few cookies on his way to class because he did not have time for lunch.**\n   - This behavior addresses the need to reduce the drive of hunger, which also aligns with drive-reduction theory.\n\nC. **Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast.**\n   - This behavior involves avoiding an action (eating) due to the absence of a physiological need (hunger), which can be seen as maintaining homeostasis by not increasing the drive further. It still fits within the framework of drive-reduction theory.\n\nD. **Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.**\n   - This behavior does not align with drive-reduction theory because Kezia is engaging in an action (eating more food) despite already being full, which increases rather than reduces her internal drive of satiety.\n\nTherefore, the behavior described in option D would not be reasonably explained by drive-reduction theories.\n\n**Final answer: D. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway.**"
