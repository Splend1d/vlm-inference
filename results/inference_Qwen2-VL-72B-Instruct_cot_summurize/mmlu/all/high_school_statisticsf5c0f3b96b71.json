Attempt to contact the 32 who did not respond and get the information from them.\n\nThis approach helps ensure that the sample remains representative of the entire population of recent graduates. If only the respondents are used (Option A or B), there could be response bias, which might skew the results. Replacing non-respondents with another random sample (Option D) may introduce additional bias because the new sample might not be truly representative of the original group. Therefore, attempting to follow up with the non-respondents is the most appropriate action to minimize bias and improve the accuracy of the survey results."
