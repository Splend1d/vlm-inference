It might be unusual or messy, but it doesn't cause harm to others.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I left the toxic material on the little cabinet where the tall children could reach it.\"\n- Leaving toxic material within reach of children is dangerous and can potentially cause harm. This action is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the health and safety of the children.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
