It is common practice in many camping situations.\n- However, it is important to ensure that the logs are not protected or part of a conservation effort. Assuming no such restrictions apply, this action is typically not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: My dog begged me for a treat so I gave him some peanut butter.**\n- Peanut butter can be toxic to dogs because it contains xylitol, which is harmful to them. Feeding a dog peanut butter could potentially harm the dog.\n- Therefore, giving a dog peanut butter would be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
