II, III, and V only.\n\nFor a firm to successfully carry out price discrimination, it must have market power (II), buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable (III), and the firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products (V). A downward sloping demand curve (I) is typical in most markets and does not preclude price discrimination. Motives beyond profit maximization (IV) are not necessary for price discrimination; in fact, price discrimination is often used as a strategy to increase profits."
