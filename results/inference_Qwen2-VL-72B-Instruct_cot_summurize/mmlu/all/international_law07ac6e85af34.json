The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws.\n\nThe contiguous zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of a coastal state, extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. Within this zone, the coastal state has the authority to exercise control over certain matters such as preventing and punishing infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations. This allows the coastal state to enforce its laws more effectively in areas close to its shores but outside its territorial sea."
