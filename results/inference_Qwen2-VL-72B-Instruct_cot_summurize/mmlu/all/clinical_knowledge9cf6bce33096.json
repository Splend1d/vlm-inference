                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm\" - This statement is not entirely accurate. While a pulsatile mass in the abdomen can be indicative of an aortic aneurysm, it is not always the case. Other conditions such as an arteriovenous malformation or a pulsating tumor could also present with a pulsatile mass.\n\nB. \"An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion\" - This statement is generally true. When percussing over an enlarged kidney, the sound produced is typically dull, indicating the presence of solid tissue rather than air-filled structures like the lungs.\n\nC. \"A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst\" - This statement is misleading. A large pelvic mass that disappears after urethral catheterization is more likely to be a distended bladder rather than an ovarian cyst. Ovarian cysts do not typically resolve with catheterization.\n\nD. \"An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon\" - This statement is not accurate. An indentible mass refers to a mass that can be indented or compressed, which is characteristic of a soft, compressible structure. Faecal loading of the colon would typically present as a firm, non-indentible mass.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion"
