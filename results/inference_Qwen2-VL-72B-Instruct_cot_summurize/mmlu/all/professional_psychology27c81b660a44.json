Professional judgment allows the psychologist to consider the context, the nature of the intervention, and the intended outcomes, ensuring that the evaluation measures what it is supposed to measure. This approach helps in selecting the most relevant and appropriate tests or combinations of tests to assess the program's impact accurately."
