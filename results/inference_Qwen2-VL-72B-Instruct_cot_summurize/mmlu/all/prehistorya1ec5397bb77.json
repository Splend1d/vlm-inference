The founding of the Minos dynasty and the invasion of the Mycenaeans:\n- The founding of the Minos dynasty is not a well-defined event with a specific date.\n- The invasion of the Mycenaeans occurred after the decline of Minoan civilization.\n\nB. An earthquake and a volcanic eruption:\n- The peak of Minoan civilization was indeed bracketed by significant natural disasters. The first major event was likely an earthquake around 1700 BC, which caused widespread destruction.\n- The second event was the massive volcanic eruption of Thera (Santorini) around 1628 BC, which had catastrophic effects on Crete.\n\nC. The discovery of bronze on the island, and the replacement of bronze by iron:\n- While the use of bronze was significant during the Minoan period, the transition to iron occurred much later and does not directly bracket the peak of Minoan civilization.\n\nD. The invasion of Troy, and the surrender to the Romans:\n- The Trojan War is traditionally dated to around 1200 BC, long after the peak of Minoan civilization.\n- The Roman conquest of Greece occurred even later, around 146 BC.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. An earthquake and a volcanic eruption"
