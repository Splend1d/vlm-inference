It encompasses various strategies such as compellence (forcing an adversary to take a specific action), deterrence (preventing an adversary from taking an unwanted action), and pre-emptive use of force (acting before an adversary can). While it may not always be the dominant approach, coercive diplomacy remains a significant aspect of contemporary security studies and international relations."
