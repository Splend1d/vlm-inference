When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Cardiac stress scintigraphy\nB. Adjusting her medication regimen\nC. Warfarin therapy\nD. Transesophageal echocardiography\n"

The patient's symptoms of dizziness upon standing, along with her low blood pressure and pulse, suggest that she may be experiencing orthostatic hypotension. This can be caused by certain medications, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors, which can lower blood pressure. Adjusting her medication regimen may help alleviate her symptoms. Cardiac stress scintigraphy, warfarin therapy, and transesophageal echocardiography are not indicated based on the information provided."
