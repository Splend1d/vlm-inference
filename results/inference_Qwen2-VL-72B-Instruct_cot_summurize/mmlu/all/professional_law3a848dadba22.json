                    "text": "A man was prosecuted for the alleged murder of his estranged wife. At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife. The defendant had an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government claimed that it was showing motive by proving the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years and therefore his bad relationship with his wife. The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of 10 women regarding defendant's various sexual contacts with them over prior years. The defendant appealed the murder conviction, claiming that the women's testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. Will the appeals court likely reverse the conviction and order a new trial?\n\nA. Yes, the trial was unfair in presenting testimony of women going back over 20 years; it would have been proper to admit such testimony only as to the five years preceding the crime.\nB. Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse.\nC. No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.\nD. No, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show a pattern of \"transferred intent\" that proved the defendant's great hostility to his wife, and his need to eliminate her from his life so that he could go back to having a wild life.\n"

Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse.\n\nThe key issue here revolves around the admissibility of evidence concerning the defendant's past behavior, specifically his extramarital affairs. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 404(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character. However, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nIn this case, the prosecution argued that the testimony of the women was relevant to show the defendant's motive due to his proclivity for extra-marital affairs and thus his bad relationship with his wife. However, the testimony did not demonstrate any recent or ongoing conflicts between the defendant and his wife, nor did it show any violent tendencies or specific intentions to harm her. The remoteness in time (over 20 years) and the lack of direct connection to the crime make the testimony more prejudicial than probative.\n\nGiven these considerations, the appeals court is likely to find that the admission of such testimony was improper and prejudicial, thereby depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B."
