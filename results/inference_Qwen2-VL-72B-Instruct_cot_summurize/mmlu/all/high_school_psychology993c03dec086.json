Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve\n\nThis sequence accurately describes the pathway of visual information transmission in the human eye. Light-sensitive photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light into electrical signals, which are then processed by bipolar cells. The bipolar cells relay this information to ganglion cells, which compile the data and transmit it via the optic nerve to the brain for further processing."
