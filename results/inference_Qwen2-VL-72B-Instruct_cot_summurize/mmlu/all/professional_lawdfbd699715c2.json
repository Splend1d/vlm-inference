The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\n\nHere\u2019s why: \n\nWhen a case is removed from state court to federal court, the federal court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the case. In this scenario, the case was removed based on federal-question jurisdiction, which arises when a plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, the removal was motivated by the plaintiff's attorney's desire to avoid a particular judge rather than a genuine issue of federal law.\n\nThe employer's attorney has timely moved to remand, which means they are requesting that the case be sent back to state court. If the federal court finds that the removal was improper or that there is no valid basis for federal jurisdiction (such as if the federal claims are not substantial or if the removal was done in bad faith), it will likely grant the motion to remand and send the entire case back to state court.\n\nOption B (remanding only the state claims) would not be appropriate because the entire case was removed together, and the federal court does not have the discretion to selectively remand parts of the case without addressing the validity of the removal itself.\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the legal principles governing removal and remand. The presence of federal claims alone does not justify retention if the removal was improper, and concerns about judicial bias should be addressed through other mechanisms, such as recusal requests, rather than influencing the decision on remand.\n\nTherefore, the most likely action for the federal court is to remand the entire case back to state court."
