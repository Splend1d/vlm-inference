Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \\(w\\) and the length as \\(l\\). According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so \\(l = 2w\\).\n\nGiven that the diagonal (\\(d\\)) is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\), we can set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[d^2 = l^2 + w^2\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[(5\\sqrt{5})^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[125 = 4w^2 + w^2\\]\n\\[125 = 5w^2\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[w^2 = 25\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[w = 5\\]\n\nSince \\(l = 2w\\), then:\n\n\\[l = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\]\n\nNow, to find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the length by the width:\n\n\\[Area = l \\times w = 10 \\times 5 = 50\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 50."
