This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nWhich of the following best expresses Carter's approach to foreign policy in the passage above?\n\nA. Isolationism\nB. Appeasement\nC. Containment\nD. A call for war\n"

Containment\n\nIn the passage, Jimmy Carter outlines his approach to foreign policy during the 1980s, emphasizing the need to address the challenges posed by the Soviet Union's military expansion, the hostage crisis in Iran, and the situation in Afghanistan. He calls for meeting these threats to peace \"squarely and courageously,\" indicating a proactive stance rather than isolationism or appeasement. The term \"containment\" refers to the strategy of preventing the spread of communism, which aligns with Carter's emphasis on addressing the Soviet Union's actions and supporting the independence of other nations. Therefore, the best expression of Carter's approach to foreign policy in the passage is containment."
