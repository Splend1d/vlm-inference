They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe two political issues that most concerned the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s were\n\nA.

This indicates that the war was a major concern for many Americans during the 1960s, including those involved in the Counterculture Movement.\n\n2. **Civil Rights Movement**: The 1960s were marked by intense activism around civil rights, with significant events such as the March on Washington and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Counterculture Movement was closely aligned with civil rights activism, advocating for equality and social justice.\n\nGiven these points, the two political issues that most concerned the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s were:\n\n- U.S. involvement in Vietnam\n- The civil rights movement\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement**"
