The COP is defined as the ratio of the heat delivered to the work input:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{\\text{Heat Delivered}}{\\text{Work Input}} \\]\n\nFor a reversible heat pump operating between two temperatures \\( T_{\\text{high}} \\) and \\( T_{\\text{low}} \\), the maximum COP (COP_{\\text{max}}) can be calculated using the Carnot efficiency formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP}_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{high}}}{T_{\\text{high}} - T_{\\text{low}}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_{\\text{high}} = 27^\\circ C + 273 = 300 K \\)\n- \\( T_{\\text{low}} = 7^\\circ C + 273 = 280 K \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the COP formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP}_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{300}{300 - 280} = \\frac{300}{20} = 15 \\]\n\nThe heat delivered indoors is given as 15,000 J. Using the COP formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{COP} = \\frac{15,000 \\text{ J}}{\\text{Work Input}} \\]\n\nSince this is the maximum COP, we set it equal to the COP_{\\text{max}}:\n\n\\[ 15 = \\frac{15,000 \\text{ J}}{\\text{Work Input}} \\]\n\nSolving for the Work Input:\n\n\\[ \\text{Work Input} = \\frac{15,000 \\text{ J}}{15} = 1,000 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately 1,000 J.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1,000 J."
