Muscle contains more water than fat\n\nBioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) works by passing a small electrical current through the body and measuring the resistance to that current. Water is a good conductor of electricity, while fat is not. Since muscle tissue has a higher water content compared to fat, it allows the electrical current to pass through more easily, resulting in lower impedance. This difference in impedance between muscle and fat helps in estimating body composition."
