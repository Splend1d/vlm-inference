The multiplier effect occurs because an initial expenditure leads to further rounds of spending throughout the economy.\n\nThe formula for calculating the total increase in GDP due to an initial expenditure is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Expenditure}}{1 - \\text{Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Initial Expenditure = $1\n- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) = 0.75\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \\frac{1}{0.25} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase is $4.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. $4"
