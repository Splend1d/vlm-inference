The Olmec civilization, which flourished in ancient Mesoamerica from approximately 1500 BCE to 400 BCE, is known for its monumental architecture and large stone sculptures, including colossal stone heads. These structures were likely used for both ceremonial and political purposes, reflecting the power and influence of the Olmec elite."
