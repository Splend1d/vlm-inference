This technique involves fusing two different cells without allowing their nuclei to merge, thus creating a cell with multiple nuclei but a shared cytoplasm. This would allow for the observation of protein movement across the plasma membrane as described in the scenario.\n\nB. **Producing a hybrid cell**: A hybrid cell (or hybridoma) is created by fusing two cells and allowing their nuclei to merge, resulting in a single nucleus with combined genetic material. While this can be useful for producing monoclonal antibodies, it does not directly fit the description of observing protein movement in a fused plasma membrane without nuclear fusion.\n\nC. **Isolating an immortal variant cell from culture and using it to create a cell line**: This technique involves selecting a cell that has become immortal (capable of unlimited division) and culturing it to produce a continuous cell line. While useful for long-term studies, it does not involve the fusion of two different cell types as described in the scenario.\n\nD. **Inserting a tumor-inducing virus into a normal cell to initiate transformation**: This technique involves using a virus to transform a normal cell into a cancerous cell. It does not relate to the fusion of two different cell types or the observation of protein movement in a fused plasma membrane.\n\nGiven the context of the question, the most appropriate technique that aligns with the described observations is:\n\n**A. Producing a heterokaryon**\n\nThis technique allows for the fusion of two different cells while maintaining their distinct nuclei, enabling the study of protein movement across a shared plasma membrane."
