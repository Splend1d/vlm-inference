Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. an individual's genome\n\nThis is because changes in an individual's genome can lead to variations in traits that may be advantageous or disadvantageous in a given environment, thus influencing the individual's likelihood of survival and reproduction. Over time, if these advantageous traits become more common in the population, they can lead to changes in the population's gene frequency."
