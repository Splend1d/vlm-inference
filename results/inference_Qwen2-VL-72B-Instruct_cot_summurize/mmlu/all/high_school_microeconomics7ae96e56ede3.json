Marginal product of labor is rising.\n\nWhen the total product of labor is rising at an increasing rate, it indicates that each additional unit of labor is contributing more to the total output than the previous unit. This is characteristic of the stage where the marginal product of labor is increasing. As the marginal product of labor increases, it means that adding more labor leads to a greater increase in total output compared to the previous addition of labor."
