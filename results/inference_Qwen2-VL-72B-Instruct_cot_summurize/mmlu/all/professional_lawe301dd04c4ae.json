They were not members of a recognized religious organization; instead, they requested an exemption based on their personal spiritual beliefs against immunization. Will the courts declare the existing exemption to be invalid?\n\nA. Yes, it will be invalidated because it cannot override the state's interest in having its school students immunized.\nB. No, it will not be invalidated \u0080\u0093 it is a fair exemption that the state has chosen to provide for religious groups.\nC. Yes, it will be invalidated because when an exemption is provided it may not unfairly discriminate and favor one type of religion or religious belief over another.\nD. No, it won't be invalidated because it is a valid exercise of the state's right to protect the privacy of its citizens.\n"

Yes, it will be invalidated because when an exemption is provided it may not unfairly discriminate and favor one type of religion or religious belief over another.\n\nPublic Health Law 2122(a) provides an exemption for immunizations based on membership in a recognized religious organization with beliefs opposed to immunizations. However, this law does not extend the same exemption to individuals who hold personal spiritual beliefs against immunizations but are not members of a recognized religious organization. This could be seen as discriminatory, as it favors certain religious groups over others and potentially violates principles of equal protection under the law. Therefore, the courts might declare the existing exemption to be invalid due to concerns about unfair discrimination."
