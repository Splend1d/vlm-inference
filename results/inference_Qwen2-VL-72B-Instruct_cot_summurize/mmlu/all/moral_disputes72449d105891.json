This contradicts the principle of justice, where punishment should only be applied to those who have been proven guilty.\n\nD. **It must be intentionally administered by human beings other than the offender.**\n   - This aligns with the concept of legal punishment, as it typically involves an authority figure or judicial system administering the punishment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that does not fit the definition of \"legal punishment\" is:\n\n**C. It must not necessarily be of an actual or supposed offender.**\n\nThis option contradicts the fundamental principle that punishment should be reserved for those who have committed an offense."
