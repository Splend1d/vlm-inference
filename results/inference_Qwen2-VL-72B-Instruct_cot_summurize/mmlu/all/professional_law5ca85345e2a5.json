Equal protection problem\n\nWhen certain fundamental rights are denied to some individuals but not others, it raises concerns about the equal protection clause of the law. This principle ensures that all individuals are treated equally under the law and that no one is denied their rights without just cause. Therefore, denying fundamental rights to some individuals while granting them to others would be considered an equal protection problem."
