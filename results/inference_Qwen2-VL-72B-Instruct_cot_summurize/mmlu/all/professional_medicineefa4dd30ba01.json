He says he has tried repeatedly to abstain from cocaine use but lives in a part of town where there are heavy drug sales. He did not like his hospital outpatient group but liked his single session at Cocaine Anonymous. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a thin man with good muscle strength and no focal neurologic deficits. The patient is using insurance coverage through his wife but does not wish for his diagnosis to be disclosed to anyone. He is on probation after a conviction for aggravated robbery 3 years ago. There is also a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery. After listening to his requests and weighing your obligations, you should disclose this patient's diagnosis only to which of the following?\n\nA. His Cocaine Anonymous sponsor\nB. His probation officer\nC. His wife\nD. Insurance company\n"

Given the information provided:\n\n- **His Cocaine Anonymous sponsor:** There is no indication that disclosing the diagnosis to the sponsor is necessary or legally required.\n- **His probation officer:** While the patient is on probation, there is no immediate indication that his medical condition directly impacts his probation status or poses a risk to public safety that would require disclosure to the probation officer.\n- **His wife:** The patient specifically requested that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. Unless there is an imminent risk to her safety or well-being, respecting his confidentiality is important.\n- **Insurance company:** Insurance companies typically require information about diagnoses and treatments for billing purposes. However, the patient's request for confidentiality should be honored if possible.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate action would be to respect the patient's wishes regarding confidentiality unless there is a compelling reason to disclose the information. Therefore, none of the options listed (A, B, C, D) should be chosen without further justification based on legal or ethical obligations.\n\nHowever, if we must choose one option based on the given context and standard practices in healthcare, the most likely candidate for disclosure would be:\n\n**D. Insurance company**\n\nThis is because insurance companies often require diagnostic information for billing and coverage purposes. It is important to note that this disclosure should be made in accordance with privacy laws such as HIPAA in the United States, ensuring that the minimum necessary information is shared and that the patient's confidentiality is protected as much as possible."
