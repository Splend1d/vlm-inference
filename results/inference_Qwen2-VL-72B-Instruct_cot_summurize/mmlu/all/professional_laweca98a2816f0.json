Annoyed by the taunts, the player started an argument with the umpire. When the umpire told the player to be quiet and go back to his team's bench, the player became enraged and savagely attacked the umpire, hitting him in the head with a bat. The spectator who had taunted the player was overcome by humiliation and horror at what occurred, because he was a good friend of the umpire. The spectator suffered no physical injury, but experienced severe nervous shock and brooded over the incident for months. If the spectator asserts an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the baseball player, the spectator will\n\nA. win, because the player's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. win, because he was present and witnessed the attack.\nC. lose, because he was partly responsible for causing the attack to occur.\nD. lose, because the umpire was not an immediate family member of the spectator.\n"

In this scenario, the baseball player's actions\u2014attacking the umpire with a bat\u2014are clearly extreme and outrageous, satisfying this criterion.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D may seem relevant, they do not directly address the core requirement of the IIED claim, which is the extreme and outrageous nature of the defendant's conduct. Being present and witnessing the attack (option B), being partly responsible for causing the attack (option C), or the relationship between the spectator and the umpire (option D) are not the primary determinants of whether the spectator can succeed in an IIED claim. The key factor is the severity and outrageousness of the defendant's behavior."
