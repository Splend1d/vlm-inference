The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered \"embarrassment and humiliation\" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\nC. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n"

No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n\nIn a breach of contract case, the damages typically sought are those that compensate for the economic loss suffered due to the breach. Emotional distress or humiliation, while potentially compensable in other types of legal actions such as torts, are generally not recognized as damages in breach of contract cases unless they can be directly tied to economic harm. Additionally, the unauthorized collection of personal data alone does not necessarily establish an economic loss without further evidence of how it has financially harmed the plaintiff or the class members. Therefore, the court is unlikely to recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract based on the damages claimed."
