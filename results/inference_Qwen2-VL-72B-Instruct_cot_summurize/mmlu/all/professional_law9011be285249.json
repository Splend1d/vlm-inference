Let's break down each potential charge:\n\n1. **Embezzlement**: This is already mentioned as a crime the man has been committing.\n\n2. **Solicitation**: This refers to the act of asking or encouraging someone else to commit a crime. In this case, the man asked a professional killer to kill the woman, which constitutes solicitation to commit murder.\n\n3. **Conspiracy**: This involves an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. Here, the man and the professional killer agreed to commit murder, making it a conspiracy to commit murder.\n\n4. **Murder**: This is the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought. Although the man did not personally carry out the killing, he hired someone to do so, making him guilty of murder under the principle of accomplice liability.\n\nGiven these points, the man can be charged with:\n\n- Embezzlement (already mentioned)\n- Solicitation to commit murder\n- Conspiracy to commit murder\n- Murder\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.**\n\nThis option includes all the relevant charges applicable to the man's actions in the given scenario."
