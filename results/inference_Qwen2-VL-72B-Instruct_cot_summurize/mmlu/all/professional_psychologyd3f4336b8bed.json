Social learning\n\nThe research you described, where parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children, aligns with social learning theory. This theory suggests that children learn gender roles through observation and imitation of others, particularly their parents, and through reinforcement for behaviors that are considered appropriate for their gender. In this case, the parents' behavior (playing roughly with boys and being protective of girls) serves as a model for the children to imitate and reinforces gender-typical behaviors."
