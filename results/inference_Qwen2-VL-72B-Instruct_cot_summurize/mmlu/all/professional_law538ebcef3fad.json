The prosecutor has called the friend's mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n"

Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Statement Against Penal Interest**: The friend's statement to his mother is an admission of involvement in a crime, which is inherently against his penal interest. Such statements are generally considered reliable because they are made when the declarant has no incentive to lie.\n\n2. **Confrontation Clause**: Under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to confront witnesses against them. However, this right does not apply to non-testimonial statements. Statements made in the course of everyday life, such as the friend's admission to his mother, are typically considered non-testimonial.\n\n3. **Corroboration**: While corroboration can be important in some contexts, it is not required for a statement against penal interest to be admissible. The reliability of the statement itself is what matters most.\n\nTherefore, the statement by the friend to his mother is admissible as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause."
