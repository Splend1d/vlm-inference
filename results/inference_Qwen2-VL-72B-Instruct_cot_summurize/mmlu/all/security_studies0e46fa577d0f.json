It sees capitalism as a system where the means of production are owned by a small group of capitalists, leading to the exploitation of workers who do not own the means of production. Here\u2019s how each option aligns with this perspective:\n\nA. HM regards capitalism as producing extreme insecurity in its disempowerment of the worker or laborer, from whom the ability to control labor or output is removed by the capitalist.\n- This is accurate. According to HM, capitalism leads to alienation and exploitation of workers, who have little control over their work conditions or the products of their labor.\n\nB. HM regards the assertion by liberalists and realists that the capitalist economic sphere is non-political to be a misrepresentation, serving the interests of the unelected capitalist elite.\n- This is also correct. HM argues that the capitalist economy is inherently political because it serves the interests of the capitalist class, which holds significant power and influence over society.\n\nC. HM regards the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value as a by-product of labor to be exploitation of those laborers by which the value was originally produced.\n- This is true as well. Marx argued that capitalists extract surplus value from workers by paying them less than the value they produce, thus exploiting their labor.\n\nTherefore, all three statements accurately reflect the HM perspective on capitalism."
