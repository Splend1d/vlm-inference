The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has lead to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\nD.

Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has led to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\n\nHistorical Materialism (HM) has faced challenges in gaining acceptance within mainstream security studies, particularly during the Cold War era when Marxist approaches were often viewed with suspicion or outright hostility in Western academic circles. However, in the post-Cold War period, with the broadening of the security studies agenda to include non-traditional security threats and a more interdisciplinary approach, HM has found greater acceptance and inclusion as a valid perspective for analyzing security issues."
