The Gulf Stream brings warm waters to Great Britain, raising the temperature of winds that blow onto the island.\nB. Hot springs throughout the country raise the temperature of the surrounding land and air.\nC. Mountain ranges in the north of Great Britain act as a barrier to cold winds blowing from the Arctic.\nD. Small landmasses generate their own local climate and are largely unaffected by latitude.\n"

The Gulf Stream brings warm waters to Great Britain, raising the temperature of winds that blow onto the island.\n\nThis is the correct answer because the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, flows near the western coast of Great Britain, warming the surrounding waters and influencing the climate by moderating temperatures and making it milder compared to other regions at similar latitudes."
