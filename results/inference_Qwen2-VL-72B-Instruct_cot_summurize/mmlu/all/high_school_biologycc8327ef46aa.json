There is one round of cell division, whereas in mitosis there are two rounds of cell division.\n- This statement is incorrect. In fact, meiosis involves two rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II), while mitosis involves only one round of cell division.\n\nB. Separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division, whereas in mitosis separation of sister chromatids occurs during the first division.\n- This statement is correct. In meiosis, sister chromatids separate during meiosis II, while in mitosis, sister chromatids separate during anaphase of mitosis.\n\nC. Chromosomes are replicated during interphase, whereas in mitosis chromosomes are replicated during prophase.\n- This statement is incorrect. In both meiosis and mitosis, chromosome replication occurs during interphase.\n\nD. Spindle fibers form during prophase, whereas in mitosis the spindle fibers form during metaphase.\n- This statement is incorrect. In both meiosis and mitosis, spindle fibers form during prophase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
