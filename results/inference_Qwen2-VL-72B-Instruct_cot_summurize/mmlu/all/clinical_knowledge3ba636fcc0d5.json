Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. While nail pitting (small depressions or pits in the nails) is not diagnostic of psoriatic arthritis on its own, it is a common feature associated with psoriasis and can be a clue to the presence of psoriatic arthritis.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. The absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis - This statement is incorrect because psoriatic arthritis can occur in individuals who do not have visible skin plaques at the time of diagnosis.\n\nB. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker - There is no specific blood test that confirms the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosis typically relies on clinical features, physical examination, imaging studies, and sometimes laboratory tests to rule out other conditions.\n\nC. Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints - Tophi are deposits of uric acid crystals that form in gout, another type of inflammatory arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis does not typically present with tophi.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis."
