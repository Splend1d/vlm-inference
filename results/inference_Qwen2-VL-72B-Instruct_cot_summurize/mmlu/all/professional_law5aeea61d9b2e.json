The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD. Yes, because the surgeon's personal- jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n"

Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\n\nIn the context of federal courts, an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. This doctrine allows for appeals of certain decisions that, although not final judgments, conclusively determine a disputed issue, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the case, and would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. A decision on personal jurisdiction fits this description because if the appellate court finds that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, it can terminate the action without waiting for a final judgment. Therefore, the appellate court should hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal."
