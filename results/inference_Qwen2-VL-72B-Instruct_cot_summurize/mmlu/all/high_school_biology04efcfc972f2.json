It increases crop yields and soil fertility and minimizes pathogen infection and pest infestation.\n\nCrop rotation helps maintain soil health by alternating crops that have different nutrient requirements, which can prevent soil depletion. Additionally, rotating crops can disrupt the life cycles of pests and pathogens, reducing their populations and minimizing the risk of disease outbreaks. This practice also promotes biodiversity, which can further enhance ecosystem health and productivity."
