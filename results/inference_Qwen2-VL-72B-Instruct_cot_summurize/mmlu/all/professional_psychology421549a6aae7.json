They have increased cognitive flexibility.\n\nResearch on second-language acquisition has indicated that children who learn a second language often exhibit enhanced cognitive flexibility, which refers to their ability to switch between different concepts or tasks more efficiently. This cognitive advantage can manifest in various ways, such as improved problem-solving skills, multitasking abilities, and enhanced executive function. While there may be initial delays in language-specific skills during the early stages of second-language acquisition, these delays are typically temporary and do not indicate long-term cognitive deficits. In fact, bilingualism is generally associated with positive cognitive outcomes rather than delays in development."
