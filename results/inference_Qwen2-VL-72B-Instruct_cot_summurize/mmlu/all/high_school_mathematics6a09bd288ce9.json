From our equation, we see that the center of the circle is at \\((3, -1)\\) and the radius squared (\\(r^2\\)) is 20.\n\nThus, the radius \\(r = \\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nSince the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. The diameter of the circle is twice its radius, so the side length of the square is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nThe area of the square is the side length squared:\n\\[Area = (2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\times 20 = 80\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 80."
