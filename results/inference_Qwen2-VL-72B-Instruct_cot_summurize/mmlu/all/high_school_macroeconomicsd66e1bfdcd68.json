It is calculated by dividing 72 by the annual growth rate.\n\n\\[ \\text{Years to Double} = \\frac{72}{\\text{Annual Growth Rate}} \\]\n\nGiven an annual growth rate of 10%:\n\n\\[ \\text{Years to Double} = \\frac{72}{10} = 7.2 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSince the options provided are whole numbers, the closest answer is:\n\nD. 7 years."
