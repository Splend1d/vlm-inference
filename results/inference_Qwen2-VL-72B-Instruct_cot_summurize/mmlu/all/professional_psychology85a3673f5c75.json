After several sessions with the boy and his family, you receive a letter from the school principal requesting information about the boy's condition, and a signed release from the boy's parents is included with the letter. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. refuse to release the records to anyone but a licensed psychologist.\nB. refuse to release the records to anyone but the boy\u2019s parents.\nC. release only that information you believe to be relevant to the school\u2019s concerns.\nD. release photocopies of your complete file on the boy and his family.\n"
