This means that the present value of the future cash inflows from the project exceeds the initial investment. The NPV calculation discounts future cash flows back to their present value using an appropriate discount rate, which reflects the opportunity cost and risk associated with the investment. If the NPV is greater than zero, it indicates that the project is expected to generate a return above the required rate of return, making it a worthwhile investment."
