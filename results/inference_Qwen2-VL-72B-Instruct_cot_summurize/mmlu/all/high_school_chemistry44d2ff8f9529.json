Since there are two chromium atoms, the total charge from chromium is \\( 2x \\).\n   - The sum of the oxidation states must equal the overall charge of the ion:\n     \\[\n     2x + (-14) = -2\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     2x = -2 + 14\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2x = 12\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 6\n     \\]\n\n   Therefore, the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion is +6.\n\n3. **Determine the Change in Oxidation State When Forming Cr3+:**\n   - In the dichromate ion, chromium has an oxidation state of +6.\n   - In Cr3+, chromium has an oxidation state of +3.\n   - To go from +6 to +3, the oxidation state decreases, which means chromium is being reduced.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 6+, reduction**"
