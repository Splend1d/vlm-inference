It involves elements from different cultural practices, making it an example of syncretism.\n\nB. **Foreign cuisine changed to suit American tastes**: This refers to the adaptation of dishes from other cultures to fit American preferences. This process often involves blending traditional recipes with local ingredients or flavors, which is a form of syncretism.\n\nC. **Hasidic Judaism**: Hasidic Judaism is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that emphasizes joy and spirituality. While it has its own unique practices and traditions, it does not typically involve the blending of different religious or cultural elements. Therefore, it is not an example of syncretism.\n\nD. **Catholicism in Louisiana**: The Catholicism practiced in Louisiana incorporates elements from African, Native American, and French cultures, especially evident in practices like Voodoo and Mardi Gras. This blending of different cultural and religious practices is an example of syncretism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Hasidic Judaism**"
