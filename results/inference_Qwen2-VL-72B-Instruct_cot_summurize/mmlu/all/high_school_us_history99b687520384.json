It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

While it had an impact on American society, it occurred before Douglass's time and did not directly influence his activism.\n\n2. **Second Great Awakening (early 19th century)**: This movement also focused on religious revival but expanded to include social reforms such as abolitionism, women's rights, and temperance. Douglass was deeply involved in the abolitionist movement, which was a significant part of the Second Great Awakening.\n\n3. **Manifest Destiny**: This was a belief in the 19th century that the United States was destined to expand across North America. While Douglass was critical of the expansion of slavery into new territories, Manifest Destiny itself was not a primary influence on his activism.\n\n4. **Popular Sovereignty**: This was a political concept that allowed settlers in new territories to decide whether to allow slavery. Douglass opposed slavery and would not have been influenced positively by this concept.\n\nGiven the context of Douglass's work and the passage provided, which emphasizes the role of religion and moral conviction in the fight against slavery, the most likely answer is:\n\n**B. Second Great Awakening**\n\nThe Second Great Awakening was a period of intense religious revival that also fueled social reform movements, including the abolition of slavery, which was a central focus of Douglass's activism."
