An agile organization typically focuses on flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement in its processes, structures, and culture to respond quickly to changes in the market or customer needs. The other options (multi-skilling in human resources, organizational structure, and project-based culture) are more directly related to the characteristics of an agile organization."
