When the defendant was approached by an FBI investigator, the defendant stated that her invitation to the procurement officer to spend his vacation in the defendant's mountain cabin was a favor to a friend, unrelated to his government office. The defendant also said to the investigator that she would reveal some \"hot\" information on a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator's promise to \"stop worrying about a little vacation.\" a little vacation.\" Is the investigator's testimony about the defendant's offer to give information admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the defendant made the offer in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation.\nC. Yes, as a matter observed and reported by the investigator pursuant to a duty imposed by law.\nD. Yes, as a statement of an opposing party.\n"
