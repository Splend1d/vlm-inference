His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, \u03b2hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin\nB. Penicillin G\nC. Rifampin\nD. Vancomycin\n"

Vancomycin\n\nThe description of the clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggests an infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is indicated by the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters, yellow \u03b2-hemolytic colonies on culture, and the mecA gene detected by PCR. MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins, but it is typically susceptible to vancomycin. Therefore, vancomycin is the appropriate choice for treating this infection."
