Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Conversion disorder\nB. Histrionic personality disorder\nC. Occult medical disorder\nD. Somatic symptom disorder\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is:\n\nD. Somatic symptom disorder\n\nSomatic symptom disorder is characterized by one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life, excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns, and a high level of health-related anxiety. The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, varying physical symptoms without definitive causes, dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of symptoms, and multiple hospitalizations are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nWhile conversion disorder (A) involves experiencing symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological condition but cannot be explained by a neurological or other medical condition, it typically does not involve the wide range of symptoms and repeated hospitalizations described here.\n\nHistrionic personality disorder (B) involves a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior, but it is primarily a personality disorder and does not specifically explain the somatic symptoms and hospitalizations.\n\nAn occult medical disorder (C) would imply there is an underlying medical cause that has not yet been discovered, but given the extensive diagnostic studies and consultations, this seems less likely than somatic symptom disorder.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting diagnosis based on the provided information is somatic symptom disorder."
