Moore in his work \"Principia Ethica,\" is the error of defining \"good\" in terms of natural properties or characteristics. Moore argues that \"good\" is a simple, non-natural property that cannot be reduced to any naturalistic description. This fallacy involves mistakenly treating moral properties as if they were natural properties."
