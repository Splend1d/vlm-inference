The test of significance and confidence interval approaches will always give the same conclusions\n\nWhile both the test of significance (hypothesis testing) and confidence intervals can be used to draw inferences about population parameters, they do not always lead to the same conclusions. The two methods approach the problem from different perspectives: hypothesis testing focuses on rejecting or failing to reject a null hypothesis based on a predetermined significance level, whereas constructing a confidence interval provides an estimated range of values for an unknown parameter with a certain level of confidence. There can be scenarios where the conclusions differ, especially when dealing with small sample sizes or when the significance level and confidence level are not directly comparable."
