The commission's findings highlighted several issues, including instances where euthanasia was performed without proper consent or reporting.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- Option A suggests that laws permitting euthanasia can and have been abused. This is supported by the commission's findings, which indicated that there were cases where euthanasia was performed improperly.\n  \n- Option B suggests that doctors who perform euthanasia may not report doing so. This is also supported by the commission's findings, which revealed underreporting of euthanasia cases.\n\nSince both points (A and B) are supported by the discussion of the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both A and B"
