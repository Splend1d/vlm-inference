At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD. The frequency of the action potential increases.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. The frequency of the action potential increases.\n\nWhen an axon receives multiple strong stimuli, it does not change the strength of individual action potentials; rather, it increases the frequency at which these action potentials occur. Each action potential remains all-or-none and reaches the same peak voltage (around +30 to +40 mV), but more action potentials can be generated in a given time frame if the stimuli are frequent enough and above the threshold for firing. This increased frequency allows for faster or more intense signaling to downstream neurons or effectors."
