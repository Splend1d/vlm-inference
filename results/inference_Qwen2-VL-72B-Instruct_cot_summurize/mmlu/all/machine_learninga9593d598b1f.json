We need to calculate the number of independent parameters required for each node based on its parents.\n\n1. **Node W**:\n   - W has no parents.\n   - The probability distribution for W is simply \\( P(W) \\).\n   - This requires 2 parameters (for \\( P(W=0) \\) and \\( P(W=1) \\), assuming binary variables).\n\n2. **Node P**:\n   - P has one parent, W.\n   - The probability distribution for P given W is \\( P(P|W) \\).\n   - For each value of W (2 possibilities), there are 2 parameters (for \\( P(P=0|W) \\) and \\( P(P=1|W) \\)).\n   - Total parameters for P = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\n3. **Node U**:\n   - U has two parents, H and P.\n   - The probability distribution for U given H and P is \\( P(U|H,P) \\).\n   - For each combination of values of H and P (2 * 2 = 4 combinations), there are 2 parameters (for \\( P(U=0|H,P) \\) and \\( P(U=1|H,P) \\)).\n   - Total parameters for U = 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n4. **Node H**:\n   - H has no parents.\n   - The probability distribution for H is simply \\( P(H) \\).\n   - This requires 2 parameters (for \\( P(H=0) \\) and \\( P(H=1) \\)).\n\nSumming up all the parameters:\n- Parameters for W = 2\n- Parameters for P = 4\n- Parameters for U = 8\n- Parameters for H = 2\n\nTotal independent parameters = 2 + 4 + 8 + 2 = 16\n\nHowever, since probabilities must sum to 1, we can reduce this count by 1 for each node because one parameter in each distribution is redundant (it can be calculated as 1 minus the sum of the other parameters).\n\nReducing by 1 for each node:\n- Reduced parameters for W = 2 - 1 = 1\n- Reduced parameters for P = 4 - 1 = 3\n- Reduced parameters for U = 8 - 1 = 7\n- Reduced parameters for H = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nTotal reduced independent parameters = 1 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 12\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match to our calculation is:\n\nC. 7\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 7."
