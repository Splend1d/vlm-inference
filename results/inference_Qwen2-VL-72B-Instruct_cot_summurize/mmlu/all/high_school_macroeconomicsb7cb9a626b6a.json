U.S. GDP falls and Brazil's GDP rises.\n\nWhen an American firm moves a manufacturing plant from the United States to Brazil, it means that production activities that were previously contributing to the U.S. economy will now be contributing to Brazil's economy. This shift results in a decrease in the value of goods and services produced within the United States, leading to a fall in U.S. GDP. Conversely, the production activities that have moved to Brazil will increase the value of goods and services produced within Brazil, resulting in a rise in Brazil's GDP."
