                    "text": "A 40-year-old female secretary comes to the office because of a 2-month history of fatigue, and generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Fibromyalgia\nB. Myasthenia gravis\nC. Polymyositis\nD. Scleroderma\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is C. Polymyositis.\n\nPolymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles of the limbs, and sometimes accompanied by muscle pain or tenderness. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, generalized aching, and weakness in the proximal muscles of all four extremities, along with the elevated creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, are consistent with polymyositis. The skin changes on the hands could be indicative of dermatomyositis, which is closely related to polymyositis and often presents with similar symptoms.\n\nFibromyalgia (option A) typically presents with widespread pain and tenderness at specific points on the body, but it does not usually cause the significant muscle weakness described in this case.\n\nMyasthenia gravis (option B) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly affecting the muscles of the eyes, face, neck, and limbs. However, it is less likely to present with the muscle enzyme elevations seen in this patient.\n\nScleroderma (option D) is a connective tissue disease that can affect the skin and internal organs, causing thickening and tightening of the skin, especially on the fingers and face. While it can cause muscle weakness and joint pain, the primary symptoms and the pattern of skin involvement do not match the description provided as closely as those of polymyositis.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, polymyositis is the most probable diagnosis. Further testing, such as electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
