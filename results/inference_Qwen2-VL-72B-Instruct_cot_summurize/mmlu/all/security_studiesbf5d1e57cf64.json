However, peace studies did expand its scope over time, incorporating various aspects such as environmental peace, gender perspectives, and economic dimensions. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nD. \"Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict.\"\n- This statement is accurate as peace studies aimed to move beyond traditional state-centric approaches to conflict.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century is:\n\nC. \"By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\""
