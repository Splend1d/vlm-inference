It promotes self-care and hygiene.\n- There is no indication that this action caused harm or was done irresponsibly.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When my mother cut herself badly while washing dishes, I shrieked.\"\n- Shrieking when someone gets hurt can be seen as a natural reaction, especially if the injury is severe.\n- While it might not be the most helpful response, it is not inherently morally wrong. It could be interpreted as an expression of concern or shock rather than malicious intent.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 also does not involve a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
