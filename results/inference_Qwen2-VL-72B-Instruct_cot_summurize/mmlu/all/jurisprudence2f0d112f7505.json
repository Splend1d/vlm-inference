A presupposition that facilitates our understanding of the legal system.\n\nHans Kelsen's Grundnorm is a foundational concept in his Pure Theory of Law, which posits that every legal system must have an underlying norm or principle that serves as its ultimate basis. This Grundnorm is not itself a legal norm but rather a presupposition that allows us to understand the hierarchy and validity of other norms within the legal system. It is not derived from any higher law or moral principle but is instead an analytical tool for understanding the structure of legal systems."
