If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\n\nNozick argues that justice in holdings is achieved through a process of just acquisition, just transfer, and rectification for any injustices that occur. According to him, as long as each individual's current holdings have been acquired or transferred justly, or any past injustices have been rectified, the overall distribution of holdings is just. This perspective emphasizes the importance of the process rather than the outcome, suggesting that a just process will lead to a just state of affairs regardless of the distribution of wealth at any given moment."
