Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism, in the context of US foreign policy, often refers to the belief that the United States has a unique role in the world due to its history, values, and democratic ideals. This belief can manifest in both isolationist and internationalist strategies depending on how it is interpreted.\n\nIsolationism, which advocates for minimal involvement in global affairs, can be seen as a way to protect and preserve American exceptionalism by avoiding entanglements that might dilute or compromise its unique identity and values.\n\nInternationalism, on the other hand, promotes active engagement in global affairs, often with the aim of spreading American values and promoting democracy around the world. This approach also stems from the belief in American exceptionalism, but it sees the US as having a duty to lead and influence the international community positively.\n\nThus, while the tactics differ, both isolationist and internationalist strategies can be understood as different expressions of the same underlying belief in American exceptionalism and its role in the world."
