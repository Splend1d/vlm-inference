This is because the firm will continue to increase production as long as the additional revenue from selling one more unit exceeds the additional cost of producing that unit. However, because a monopoly firm has market power and can set prices above marginal cost, the price (P) will be greater than marginal revenue (MR). Additionally, because a monopoly firm is not subject to competition, it can earn economic profits in the long run, which means that price (P) will also be greater than average total cost (ATC). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. P > ATC > MR = MC"
