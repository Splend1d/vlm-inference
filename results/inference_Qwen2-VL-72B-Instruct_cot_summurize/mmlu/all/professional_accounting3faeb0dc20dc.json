The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP.\n\nThis is because the omission of required disclosures would violate Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which is a fundamental requirement for the preparation of financial statements. An accountant has a professional obligation to ensure that the financial statements comply with GAAP, and accepting an engagement where this is not possible would compromise their integrity and professional standards."
