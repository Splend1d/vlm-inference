City residents have recently complained that the surfers are creating a public nuisance by littering the beaches, harassing sunbathers, and injuring swimmers with their surfboards. As a consequence, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting all surfing on its beaches. The newly enacted ordinance further prohibited the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. An out of state surfboard manufacturer had planned to sell a new line of fiberglass surfboards in the city in the upcoming year. This is now precluded by the recently adopted measure. If the manufacturer seeks to enjoin application of the city ordinance, which of the following is the WEAKEST defense for the city?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy.\nB. The manufacturer's case is moot.\nC. The manufacturer lacks standing.\nD. The case is not ripe.\n"

In this context, the out-of-state surfboard manufacturer clearly has a direct interest in the outcome of the ordinance since it directly affects their ability to sell their products within the city. Therefore, arguing that the manufacturer lacks standing would likely be the weakest defense because the manufacturer can demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury resulting from the ordinance, which is a key requirement for establishing standing."
