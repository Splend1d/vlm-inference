Breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens.\n\nBreast milk is rich in maternal antibodies, which can help protect infants from infections and diseases, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract. These antibodies are transferred from the mother to the infant through breastfeeding and provide passive immunity during the early stages of life when the infant's own immune system is still developing."
