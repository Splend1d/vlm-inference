                    "text": "To determine how Bailey Co. should report the insurance transaction in the current year's financial statements, we need to understand the transition from the cash basis to the accrual basis.\n\nUnder the cash basis, Bailey recorded the entire $240,000 as an expense when the payment was made in January of the prior year. Under the accrual basis, expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred, not necessarily when paid. Therefore, the cost of the insurance policy should be spread evenly over the four years it covers.\n\nThe annual expense for the insurance policy is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Annual Expense} = \\frac{\\$240,000}{4 \\text{ years}} = \\$60,000 \\text{ per year} \\]\n\nSince the policy was purchased in January of the prior year, one full year has already passed by the time Bailey switches to the accrual basis. This means that two years' worth of expense ($120,000) has been recognized under the cash basis but needs to be adjusted to reflect the accrual basis.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n- **Year 1 (prior year)**: $60,000 expense recognized under both cash and accrual bases.\n- **Year 2 (current year)**: $60,000 expense should be recognized under the accrual basis.\n\nHowever, since Bailey has already expensed $240,000 under the cash basis, there is an overstatement of $180,000 in expenses that needs to be corrected. This overstatement can be corrected by debiting Prepaid Insurance (an asset account) and crediting Retained Earnings.\n\nAdditionally, for the current year, Bailey should recognize the appropriate expense for the second year of the policy.\n\nThus, the correct entries for the current year would be:\n\n1. **Adjustment for Overstated Expenses**:\n   - Debit Prepaid Insurance $180,000\n   - Credit Retained Earnings $180,000\n\n2. **Recognition of Current Year Expense**:\n   - Debit Insurance Expense $60,000\n   - Credit Prepaid Insurance $60,000\n\nCombining these entries, the net effect on the financial statements for the current year would be:\n\n- A $60,000 debit to Insurance Expense\n- A $120,000 debit to Prepaid Asset (Prepaid Insurance)\n- A $180,000 credit to Retained Earnings\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset, and $180,000 credit to retained earnings."
