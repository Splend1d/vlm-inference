As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, \"I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. \" The son replied, \"You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. \"At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, \"Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?\" The son replied, \"Yes, Father. \" The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly.

                    "text": "To determine whether the son will succeed in recovering the new car from the executor of the father's estate, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in contract law, specifically focusing on the concept of consideration.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Promise to Refrain from Illegal Drugs and Drinking Alcohol:**\n   - The son promised not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol during his basic training. This promise is a form of forbearance, which can serve as consideration in a contract.\n\n2. **Father's Promise to Buy a New Car:**\n   - The father promised to buy the son a new car if the son refrained from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol during basic training. This promise is a conditional gift, contingent upon the son fulfilling his promise.\n\n3. **Consideration:**\n   - For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration on both sides. Consideration refers to something of value exchanged between parties. Here, the son's promise to refrain from illegal drugs and drinking alcohol serves as consideration for the father's promise to buy the car.\n\n4. **Death of the Father:**\n   - The father's death does not necessarily invalidate the contract. If the contract was valid before the father's death, the executor of the estate is typically bound to fulfill the terms of the contract.\n\n5. **Executor's Position:**\n   - The executor of the father's estate claims not to feel compelled to give the son the car. However, the executor's personal feelings do not affect the legal obligations under the contract.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the son fulfilled his part of the agreement by refraining from illegal drugs and drinking alcohol during basic training, and considering that the father's promise was based on this condition, the son has provided sufficient consideration for the contract to be enforceable. Therefore, the executor of the father's estate should honor the father's promise.\n\n**Final Answer: B. succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.**"
