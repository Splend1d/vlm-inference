Neutron activation analysis involves bombarding a sample with neutrons to induce radioactivity, which can then be measured to identify and quantify elements present in the sample. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) involves bombarding a sample with X-rays and measuring the resulting fluorescence to determine the elemental composition of the sample."
