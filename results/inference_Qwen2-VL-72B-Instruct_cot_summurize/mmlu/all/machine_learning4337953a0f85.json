Weinberger.\n- DenseNets are designed to improve the utilization of features through dense connections between layers, which can lead to increased memory usage due to the storage of intermediate feature maps.\n- ResNets, on the other hand, use skip connections that allow gradients to flow through the network more easily but generally have fewer parameters and thus require less memory compared to DenseNets.\n\nGiven this information, Statement 2 is **True**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
