The interaction seems positive and beneficial for both parties.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I helped him in academics by typing his written paper.\"\n- This scenario describes someone helping another person by typing their written paper.\n- If the paper was intended to be submitted as the student's own work, then typing it could be considered academic dishonesty, which is generally viewed as morally wrong in educational settings.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve any morally wrong actions.\n- Scenario 2 potentially involves academic dishonesty, which is considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
