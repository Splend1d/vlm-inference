The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter, the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of wear and tear. As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area. When the millionaire saw the contractor removing the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that the investor discontinue the repair work. After the investor refused, the millionaire brought an action to enjoin the investor from continuing the work. The most likely result will be a decision for\n\nA. the millionaire, because the investor does not have rights in the walkway.\nB. the millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building do not extend to the walkway.\nC. the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\nD. the investor, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n"

This can create an easement by implication, where the use of the walkway is necessary for the enjoyment of the dental building. Since the warranty deed did not explicitly exclude the walkway, it is reasonable to infer that the easement was intended to continue with the sale of the dental building.\n\n2. **Implied Right to Repair**: If the investor has an easement over the walkway, they also have the implied right to maintain and repair it. This is essential to ensure that the easement remains functional and safe for use by those who benefit from it.\n\n3. **Tort Liability**: While protecting oneself from tort liability (such as negligence) is important, it is not the primary legal basis for the investor's right to repair the walkway. The easement and the right to maintain it are more fundamental legal principles at play here.\n\nTherefore, the investor would likely prevail in court due to having an easement in the walkway and the implied right to keep it in repair."
