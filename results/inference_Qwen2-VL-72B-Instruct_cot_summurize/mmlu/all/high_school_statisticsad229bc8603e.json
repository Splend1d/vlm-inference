Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC.

The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because the law of large numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the observed frequency of an event approaches its theoretical probability. However, this does not imply that individual events become more or less likely based on past outcomes. Each die roll is independent of the others.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because the concept of conditional probability applies when there is some dependency between events. In the case of a fair die, each roll is independent, so the outcome of one roll does not affect the outcome of the next roll.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because dice do not have memories. Each roll of a fair die is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one roll does not influence the outcome of subsequent rolls.\n\n- **Option D** is correct because for a fair six-sided die, the probability of rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6) is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = 0.5\\). This probability remains constant regardless of previous outcomes."
