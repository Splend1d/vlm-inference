Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?\n\nA. Foramen lacerum\nB. Foramen ovale\nC. Foramen rotundum\nD. Foramen spinosum\n"

The symptoms described\u2014loss of sensation over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin, and loss of sensation over the right side of the tongue\u2014are consistent with damage to the trigeminal nerve, particularly its mandibular branch (V3).
