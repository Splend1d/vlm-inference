It does not harm anyone or violate any significant social norms.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character blows cigarette smoke towards a child's face.\n\nThis action is widely considered morally wrong because exposing children to secondhand smoke is harmful to their health. It violates societal norms regarding the protection of children and their well-being.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
