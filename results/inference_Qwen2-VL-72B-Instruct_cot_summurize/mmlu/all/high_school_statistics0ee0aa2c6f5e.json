The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nFor the man:\n- Mean height (\u03bc) = 70 inches\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = 4 inches\n- Height (x) = 74 inches\n\nThe z-score for the man is calculated as:\n\\[ z_{\\text{man}} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{74 - 70}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nFor the woman:\n- Mean height (\u03bc) = 66 inches\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3) = 3 inches\n- Height (x) = 70 inches\n\nThe z-score for the woman is calculated as:\n\\[ z_{\\text{woman}} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{70 - 66}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.33 \\]\n\nComparing the z-scores:\n- The man's height is 1 standard deviation above the mean height of all men.\n- The woman's height is approximately 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women.\n\nTherefore, the woman is more unusually tall within her respective sex compared to the man.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men."
