The damages typically include the amount necessary to discharge the encumbrance, which would be the principal amount of the mortgage plus any interest accrued up to the point of payment. This ensures that the farmer is made whole by being reimbursed for the costs incurred to clear the title defect created by the outstanding mortgage."
