It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nThe situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?\n\nA. American revolutionaries in the 1770s\nB. Slaves in the antebellum South\nC. Populist farmers in the 1890s\nD. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\n"

                    "text": "To determine the situation faced by the young women in the passage and find the most directly comparable scenario among the given options, let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **American revolutionaries in the 1770s**: These individuals were fighting for independence from British rule. While they faced hardships, their primary struggle was political and military, not primarily economic or related to daily survival.\n\nB. **Slaves in the antebellum South**: Slaves faced extreme oppression and exploitation, with no freedom or rights. Their situation involved forced labor and severe living conditions. However, the passage describes women who are free but face extreme poverty and hunger, which is different from the legal status of slaves.\n\nC. **Populist farmers in the 1890s**: These farmers were struggling economically due to low crop prices, debt, and the power of large corporations. They faced economic hardship but generally had more control over their lives compared to the women described in the passage.\n\nD. **Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s**: During the Great Depression, many workers, including those in the auto industry, faced unemployment, low wages, and poor working conditions. This situation is closer to the economic struggles described in the passage, where the women are working for very low pay and barely surviving.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, which describes women working in extremely poor conditions and facing severe economic hardship, the most directly comparable situation is:\n\n**D. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s**\n\nThese workers also faced significant economic challenges and poor working conditions, making their situation similar to that of the young women described by Jacob Riis."
