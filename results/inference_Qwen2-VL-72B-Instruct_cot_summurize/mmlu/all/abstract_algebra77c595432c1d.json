                    "text": "To determine the truthfulness of these statements, we need to consider the properties of groups and their elements, particularly focusing on the concept of orders of elements in a group.\n\n### Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nAn element \\( g \\) in a group \\( G \\) has order \\( n \\) if \\( g^n = e \\) (where \\( e \\) is the identity element), and \\( n \\) is the smallest positive integer for which this holds true. \n\nFor an element \\( g \\) of order 15, its powers will also have specific orders:\n- \\( g^1 \\) has order 15.\n- \\( g^2 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 2)} = \\frac{15}{1} = 15 \\).\n- \\( g^3 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 3)} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\).\n- \\( g^4 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 4)} = \\frac{15}{1} = 15 \\).\n- \\( g^5 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 5)} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\).\n- \\( g^6 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 6)} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\).\n- \\( g^7 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 7)} = \\frac{15}{1} = 15 \\).\n- \\( g^8 \\) has order \\( \\frac{15}{\\gcd(15, 8)} = \\frac{15}{1} = 15 \\).\n\nFrom this, we see that there are exactly 8 distinct elements of order 15 generated by \\( g \\): \\( g^1, g^2, g^4, g^7, g^8, g^{11}, g^{13}, g^{14} \\). Therefore, if a group contains an element of order 15, it indeed must contain at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\n### Statement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nIf a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it implies that there are additional elements beyond those generated by a single element of order 15. However, having more than 8 elements of order 15 does not necessarily imply that the number of such elements must be at least 16. It could be any number greater than 8, but not necessarily reaching or exceeding 16.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false because it makes a stronger claim about the minimum number of elements of order 15 than what can be definitively concluded from the given information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
