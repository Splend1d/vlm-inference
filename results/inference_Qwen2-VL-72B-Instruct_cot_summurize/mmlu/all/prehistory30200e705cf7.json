Epic poetry typically emerges from significant events rather than being the cause of them.\n\nB. **to identify and cultivate talented leaders**: This is plausible because warfare can be an effective way to test and develop leadership skills. The Inca Empire was highly organized and valued strong leadership, so engaging in wars could indeed help identify and train capable leaders.\n\nC. **to kill off a certain percentage of the young male population, thus preventing revolution**: This seems unlikely as a primary motive for warfare. While reducing the population might have some indirect effects on social stability, it is not a common or direct reason for initiating wars.\n\nD. **to appease the gods of war**: Many ancient civilizations engaged in warfare to honor or appease deities associated with war. The Incas had a complex religious system, and it is possible that they fought wars to please their gods.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical and historically supported reason is:\n\n**B. to identify and cultivate talented leaders.**\n\nThis aligns well with the known practices of the Inca Empire, where leadership and military prowess were highly valued."
