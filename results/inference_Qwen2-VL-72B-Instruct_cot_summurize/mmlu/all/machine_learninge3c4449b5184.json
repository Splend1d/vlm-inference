This corresponds to option C for the Gaussian part: `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4`.\n\nFor the $10 \\times 10$ uniform matrix where each entry is i.i.d. sampled from $U[-1,1)$, we can use the `torch.rand` function to generate a matrix of uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1, and then scale and shift these values to fall within the desired range.\n\nFor the uniform matrix:\n- We want a range from -1 to 1.\n\nThe correct way to generate this matrix is by using `torch.rand` to get a matrix of values between 0 and 1, scaling by 2 (to get a range of 0 to 2), and then shifting by subtracting 1 (to center the range around 0). This corresponds to option C for the uniform part: `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. `5 + torch.randn(10,5) * 4` ; `2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1`"
