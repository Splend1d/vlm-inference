According to Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), it is not the event itself that causes our emotional and behavioral reactions, but rather our beliefs about the event. These beliefs mediate between the event and our reaction, meaning they explain how the event leads to our specific response. Therefore, in this context, our beliefs act as a mediator variable."
