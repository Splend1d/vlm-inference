The entire consumption function would shift upward.\n\nWhen households become more optimistic about the future, they are likely to increase their current consumption because they expect higher future incomes or better economic conditions. This optimism leads to an increase in consumption at every level of income, which shifts the entire consumption function upward. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) might also change, but the primary effect described here is the shift in the consumption function."
