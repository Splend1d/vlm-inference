The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD.

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a lease agreement that has transitioned into a month-to-month tenancy due to the tenant continuing to pay rent and the landlord accepting it after the expiration of the initial lease term. At common law, when a lease expires but the tenant remains in possession and continues to pay rent, and the landlord accepts such payments, this typically creates a new tenancy at will or a periodic tenancy (often month-to-month).\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.**\n   - This option is not applicable because the artist has been paying rent regularly.\n\nB. **Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.**\n   - This option is not relevant because there is no indication that the artist has underpaid rent based on fair market value.\n\nC. **Recovery of double the rent prorated on a month-to-month basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.**\n   - This option is not standard under common law. There is no general provision for doubling the rent in such situations.\n\nD. **Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.**\n   - This option is also not accurate. Once the lease term ends and a new tenancy is created by the acceptance of rent, the landlord cannot hold the tenant responsible for the full original lease term unless there is a specific agreement to that effect.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided directly aligns with the typical remedies available under common law for the situation described. However, if we must choose the closest option, it would be:\n\n**D. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.**\n\nThis is because, under common law, once a new tenancy is established, the landlord can terminate the tenancy with proper notice, which might require the tenant to vacate immediately or face legal action for non-compliance. However, holding the tenant responsible for three years' rent is not a standard remedy and would depend on specific contractual terms or local laws."
