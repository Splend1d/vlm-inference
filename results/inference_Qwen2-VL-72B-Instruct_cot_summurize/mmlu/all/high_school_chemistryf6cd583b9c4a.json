Bases, by definition, accept protons (H+) or donate hydroxide ions (OH-) in aqueous solutions.\n\nB. **Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Both strong and weak bases can create solutions where OH- ions are present. The difference lies in the extent to which they dissociate in water.\n\nC. **Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.**\n   - This statement is partially correct but not universally true for all bases. Strong bases do dissociate completely in water, leading to high conductivity due to the presence of many ions. However, some weak bases can also be good conductors if they are present in high concentrations or if they have a high degree of ionization.\n\nD. **For weak bases, the concentration of the OH-ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. In the case of weak bases, the concentration of OH- ions is typically less than the concentration of the undissociated base because weak bases only partially dissociate in water.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement that applies to all bases is:\n\n**A. All bases donate OH- ions into solution.**\n\nThis is because all bases, whether strong or weak, will donate OH- ions when dissolved in water, although the extent of donation varies between strong and weak bases."
