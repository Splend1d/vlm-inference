They are more commonly associated with acidic conditions rather than reduction processes.\n\n2. **Na (s)**: Sodium metal is highly reactive and can react violently with water, releasing hydrogen gas and producing heat. This makes it potentially dangerous and unsuitable for many applications where safety is a concern.\n\n3. **Ca2+ (aq)**: Calcium ions in solution do not act as reducing agents. They are typically involved in ionic bonding and not in redox reactions.\n\n4. **Mg (s)**: Magnesium metal is a strong reducing agent and is safer to handle compared to sodium. It reacts with water but less violently than sodium, making it a more practical choice for reduction reactions.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Magnesium (Mg) solid** is the most reasonable and safe substitute for silver metal amalgam in reducing substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nFinal answer: **D. Mg(s)**"
