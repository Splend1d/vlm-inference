It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

Disgust for barbarian peoples:**\n   - The passage does not explicitly express disgust for the barbarian peoples. Instead, it focuses on the benefits of their conflicts for Rome.\n\n   **B. Concern about barbarian attacks:**\n   - There is no direct indication of concern about barbarian attacks. The passage rather emphasizes the advantage of having these tribes fight among themselves.\n\n   **C. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy:**\n   - Stoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes self-control and fortitude in the face of adversity. The passage does not provide any information about the personal philosophies or attitudes of the aristocracy regarding Stoicism.\n\n   **D. Maintenance of large armies:**\n   - The passage does not discuss the size or maintenance of Roman armies. It focuses on the benefits of tribal conflicts occurring without Roman involvement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The passage highlights the strategic benefit for Rome when its enemies are engaged in internal conflicts, suggesting a preference for these tribes to be divided and weakened rather than united against Rome.\n\nTherefore, the views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of B. Concern about barbarian attacks."
