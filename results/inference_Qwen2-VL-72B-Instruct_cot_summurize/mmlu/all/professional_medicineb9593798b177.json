Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?\n\nA. Digoxin\nB. Enalapril\nC. Lidocaine\nD. Metoprolol\n"

Digoxin\n\nIn this scenario, the patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which is causing symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The initial treatment with intravenous metoprolol helped slow the heart rate temporarily, but the patient's pulse has since increased again.\n\nDigoxin is a medication commonly used to control the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node. It can help reduce the heart rate and improve symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, digoxin would be an appropriate choice to administer intravenously in this case to decrease the patient's pulse.\n\nEnalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor typically used for hypertension and heart failure, not primarily for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug used for ventricular arrhythmias, not atrial fibrillation. Metoprolol has already been tried and did not sustain the desired effect, so it would not be the best choice at this point."
