One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals is best illustrated by Voltaire's quote, let's analyze the content and context of the quote.\n\nVoltaire's response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake reflects his critical view of natural disasters and their impact on human life. He questions the cruelty of nature and the suffering caused by such events, particularly highlighting the destruction of lives and property. He also mentions the potential irony of the Inquisition's palace surviving the disaster, suggesting a critique of religious persecution.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.**\n   - While Voltaire was knowledgeable and interested in science, this quote does not specifically discuss scientific achievements or contributions to human understanding of the universe.\n\nB. **They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.**\n   - The quote itself is a letter, but it doesn't emphasize the method of communication (salons or pamphlets) as a key point.\n\nC. **Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.**\n   - Voltaire's quote critiques religious persecution and suggests that natural disasters should teach people not to persecute each other. However, it does not explicitly state that he or other Enlightenment thinkers rejected religion entirely or adopted atheism.\n\nD. **Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.**\n   - This option aligns well with Voltaire's critique of the Lisbon earthquake and its implications. He uses the disaster to argue for a more tolerant and less persecutory society, reflecting a broader Enlightenment belief in using reason and scientific understanding to improve societal conditions.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals illustrated by Voltaire's quote is:\n\n**D. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.**"
