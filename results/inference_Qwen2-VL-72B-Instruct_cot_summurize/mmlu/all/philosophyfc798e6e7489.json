He challenges the idea by suggesting that there are many other things that could be considered holy (A), and he also implies that prosecuting wrongdoers might not always be holy (B). Additionally, Socrates questions whether there is a universal agreement on what constitutes \"wrongdoing\" (C). Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is D, which includes all three objections."
