No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine whether the creditor can recover the $2,000 from the buyer, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Statute of Limitations**: The debtor's $2,000 debt to the creditor was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. This means that the creditor cannot enforce the original debt through legal action against the debtor.\n\n2. **Buyer's Promise**: The buyer agreed in writing to pay the $2,000 to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\" This creates a new contractual obligation between the buyer and the creditor.\n\n3. **Enforceability of Third-Party Beneficiary Contracts**: Generally, if a contract explicitly states that it is made for the benefit of a third party (in this case, the creditor), that third party may enforce the contract against the promisor (the buyer).\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the creditor cannot recover the money because it would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcing stale claims. However, the buyer's promise is a new contract independent of the original debt, so this argument does not hold.\n\n- **Option B** implies that the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves. This could be relevant if there were specific defenses or issues with the contract between the buyer and the debtor, but no such defenses are mentioned in the scenario provided.\n\n- **Option C** states that the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything. This aligns with the principle that a new contract can create obligations independent of prior debts.\n\n- **Option D** suggests that the buyer's promise revived the uncollectible debt. Revival of a debt typically requires a new acknowledgment or payment on the part of the debtor, not a third party like the buyer. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.**\n\nThus, the creditor can recover the $2,000 from the buyer based on the new contractual obligation created by the buyer's promise."
