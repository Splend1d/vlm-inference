Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law\n\nTreaties and customary law are both sources of international law but operate differently. While treaties are formal agreements between states, customary law emerges from the consistent practice of states accompanied by the belief that such practice is legally obligatory (opinio juris). \n\nTreaties can relate to customary law in several ways:\n1. **Codification**: A treaty can codify existing customary law by formally recording and agreeing upon rules that were previously developed through state practice.\n2. **Crystallisation**: A treaty can crystallise customary law by solidifying or fixing the content of an emerging norm, making it more definite and binding.\n3. **Emergence**: Over time, consistent state practice in accordance with treaty provisions can lead to the development of new customary international law.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately reflects the relationship between treaties and customary law."
