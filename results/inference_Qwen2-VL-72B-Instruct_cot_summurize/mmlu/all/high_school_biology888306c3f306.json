The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n\nThis statement suggests that mutations are occurring regularly and contributing to genetic diversity, which would imply that the frequency of mutations is not low but rather consistent and contributes to the variability observed in populations. The other options (A, B, and C) all describe mechanisms that could contribute to the apparent low frequency of mutations by either hiding them (recessive alleles), removing them (undesirable traits or drastic changes), or preventing their expression."
