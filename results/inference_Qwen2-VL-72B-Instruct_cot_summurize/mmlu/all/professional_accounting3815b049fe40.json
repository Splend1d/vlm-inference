The JIT approach usually involves a large number of suppliers while traditional approaches usually involve only a small number of suppliers.\nB. The JIT approach requires centralized purchasing while traditional approaches encourage purchasing decisions by production employees.\nC. The JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system.\nD.

The JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) manufacturing aims to reduce waste within manufacturing systems by producing goods only as they are needed, leading to lower inventory levels. In contrast, traditional manufacturing approaches often maintain higher inventory levels to ensure that materials are available when needed, which can lead to increased storage costs and potential obsolescence."
