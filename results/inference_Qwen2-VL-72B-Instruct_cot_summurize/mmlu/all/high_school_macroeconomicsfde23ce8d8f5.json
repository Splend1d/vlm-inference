The FED sells government securities in the secondary market.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve (FED) sells government securities in the secondary market, it decreases the money supply. This is because when the FED sells securities, it takes money out of circulation as buyers pay for these securities with cash or by transferring funds from their bank accounts. This action reduces the amount of money available in the banking system and thus decreases the overall money supply."
