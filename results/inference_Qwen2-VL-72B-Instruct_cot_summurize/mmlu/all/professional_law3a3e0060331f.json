At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n"

Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Relevance and Purpose**: The diary serves as a record of observations made by the plaintiff regarding the air pollution, which is directly relevant to her claim of health injuries caused by the industrial facility.\n\n2. **Refreshing Recollection**: Even though reviewing the diary did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection, the diary can still be used as evidence. The purpose of refreshing recollection is to help the witness recall events more clearly, but if the witness cannot recall even after being refreshed, the diary itself can still be admitted as evidence.\n\n3. **Admissibility**: Under the rules of evidence, particularly in jurisdictions following the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), diaries and similar records kept contemporaneously with the events they describe are often admissible as business records or personal memoranda. They are considered reliable because they were created close in time to the events they document.\n\n4. **Options for Admission**: The plaintiff should be allowed to either read from the diary into evidence or have the diary itself admitted as an exhibit. This allows the jury to consider the information contained within the diary as part of their assessment of the case.\n\nTherefore, the diary is admissible, and the plaintiff has the option of presenting it through reading or as an exhibit."
