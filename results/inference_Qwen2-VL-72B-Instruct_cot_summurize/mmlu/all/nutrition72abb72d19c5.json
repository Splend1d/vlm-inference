The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area\n\nThis option accurately describes how the absorptive area of the human intestine is significantly increased through structural features such as folds (plicae circulares), villi, and microvilli. These structures greatly enhance the surface area available for nutrient absorption."
