In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is\n\nA. admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.\nB. admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.\nC. inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\nD. inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.\n"

Under these circumstances, the accountant's testimony can be considered secondary evidence. Secondary evidence is typically allowed when the original document is lost, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable through no fault of the party presenting the secondary evidence. The accountant's testimony about the terms of the contract serves as a substitute for the original document, making it admissible under the rules of evidence."
