However, if the son is not seriously ill and the statement is made to manipulate the system or gain undue advantage, it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 could potentially be morally wrong if the son is not seriously ill and the statement is made to deceive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
