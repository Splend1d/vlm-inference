While the President does have significant influence over the bureaucracy through appointments and executive orders, Congress also has substantial power over the bureaucracy. Congress has the authority to create, fund, and oversee federal agencies and can use its legislative powers to shape bureaucratic policies and procedures. Additionally, Congress can conduct investigations and hold hearings to scrutinize the actions of the bureaucracy. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the power dynamics between Congress and the presidency regarding the bureaucracy are complex and interdependent rather than one being definitively less powerful than the other."
