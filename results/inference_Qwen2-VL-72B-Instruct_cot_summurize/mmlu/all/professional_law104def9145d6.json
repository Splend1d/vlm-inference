At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification.\nB. admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.\n"

Admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.\n\nThe corrections officer's testimony about the defendant's hair color when he was first brought to jail can be relevant to clarify the discrepancy between the eyewitness descriptions and the defendant's appearance at trial. This information can help establish that the defendant matches the description given by the eyewitnesses despite his current shaven head. It is not hearsay because it is based on the officer's personal observation and not a statement made by someone else. It is also not opinion testimony but rather a factual observation."
