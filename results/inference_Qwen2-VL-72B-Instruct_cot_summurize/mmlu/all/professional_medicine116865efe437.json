Microscopic examination of the stool\n\nGiven the symptoms of nausea, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash, along with an elevated eosinophil count, it suggests a parasitic infection, possibly by Strongyloides stercoralis or other intestinal parasites. Microscopic examination of the stool can help identify the presence of parasite eggs, larvae, or ova, which would confirm the diagnosis."
