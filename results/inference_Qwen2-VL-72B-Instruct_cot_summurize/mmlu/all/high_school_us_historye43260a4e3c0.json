Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson\nC. Ronald Reagan\nD. Barack Obama\n"

Roosevelt**: FDR was known for implementing the New Deal during the Great Depression, which involved significant government intervention and higher taxes to fund social programs and infrastructure projects. This approach contrasts with Coolidge's emphasis on limited government and low taxes.\n\nB. **Lyndon B. Johnson**: LBJ expanded the role of the federal government through the Great Society programs, which included increased spending on social welfare, education, and healthcare. This expansion of government and associated tax increases would likely conflict with Coolidge's views.\n\nC. **Ronald Reagan**: Reagan is often associated with conservative economic policies, including tax cuts and a reduction in government spending. His philosophy aligned closely with Coolidge's emphasis on limited government and protecting individual property rights from excessive taxation.\n\nD. **Barack Obama**: Obama's administration focused on expanding healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act and increasing taxes on higher-income earners to fund social programs. This approach involves more government intervention and higher taxes, which would not align well with Coolidge's views.\n\nGiven this analysis, the president most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments about limited government and low taxes is:\n\n**C. Ronald Reagan**"
