Therefore, \\( a_1 = a_2 = a \\).\n   - Substitute \\( a \\) into both equations:\n     \\[\n     mg - T = ma\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     T = ma\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine Equations:**\n   - Add the two equations:\n     \\[\n     mg - T + T = ma + ma\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     mg = 2ma\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a = \\frac{g}{2}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the acceleration of the books is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{B. } \\frac{g}{2}}\n\\]"
