In this case, the baby duck initially responds to the large object being tossed over its head by running for cover due to fear or perceived danger. However, after multiple repetitions where no harm occurs, the duck learns that the object does not pose a threat and stops reacting to it. This decrease in response to the repeated stimulus is characteristic of habituation."
