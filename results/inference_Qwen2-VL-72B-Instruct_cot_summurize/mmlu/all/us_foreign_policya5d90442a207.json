The Kosovo War (1998-1999) was notable for being the first conflict where airpower played a decisive role without any significant ground invasion. NATO conducted an extensive bombing campaign against Serbia, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the establishment of international protection for Kosovo Albanians.\n\nD. **It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'**:\n   - While smart weapons were used in the Kosovo War, they were not first employed there. Smart weapons had been used in previous conflicts, including the Gulf War in 1991.\n\nTherefore, the unique aspect of the NATO intervention in Kosovo was that it was the first war won by airpower alone.\n\nFinal answer: C. It was the first war won by airpower alone."
