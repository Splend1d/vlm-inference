This can make U.S. exports less competitive on the global market because foreign buyers would have to pay more for the same products. As a result, demand for the U.S. dollar may decrease as fewer foreign buyers are willing to purchase U.S. exports. Conversely, imports into the U.S. become relatively cheaper, which could increase the demand for foreign currencies to buy these imports.\n\nThe decreased demand for the U.S. dollar and increased demand for foreign currencies typically lead to a depreciation of the dollar's value relative to other currencies. This is because the supply of dollars increases (as exporters sell more dollars to buy foreign currencies) while the demand for dollars decreases (as importers need fewer dollars to buy foreign goods). The net effect is a lower exchange rate for the dollar, meaning it takes more dollars to buy a unit of foreign currency."
