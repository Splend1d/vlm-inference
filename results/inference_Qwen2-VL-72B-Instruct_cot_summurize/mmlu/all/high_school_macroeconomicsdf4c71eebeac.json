Real GDP decreases: A decrease in real GDP usually indicates a contraction in the economy, which can lead to reduced investment demand as businesses may be less inclined to invest during uncertain times.\n\nB. The cost of acquiring and maintaining capital equipment rises: Higher costs associated with capital equipment would generally discourage investment, as it becomes more expensive for businesses to invest in new machinery or infrastructure.\n\nD. The real rate of interest rises: An increase in the real rate of interest makes borrowing more expensive, which can reduce investment demand as businesses may find it less attractive to finance new projects through loans."
