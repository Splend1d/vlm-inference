That's all right: when I come to India and somebody says, \"Oh, Mr. Schumacher, I don't believe in appropriate technology\", I just look him straight in the face and say, \"Oh, that's splendid.

Equivocation**\n\nEquivocation occurs when a word or phrase is used with multiple meanings in an argument, leading to confusion or misinterpretation. In this case, Schumacher uses the term \"appropriate technology\" in a way that shifts its meaning to imply that if someone does not believe in \"appropriate technology,\" they must believe in \"inappropriate technology.\" This creates a false dichotomy and misleads the listener into thinking there are only two options, when in reality, the term \"appropriate technology\" could be interpreted differently by different people."
