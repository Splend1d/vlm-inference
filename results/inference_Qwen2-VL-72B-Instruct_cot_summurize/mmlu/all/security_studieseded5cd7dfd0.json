Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.\nB. Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.\nC. Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\nD. Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.\n"

Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\n\nRealism and social constructivism are two distinct theoretical approaches in the field of international relations (IR). Realism focuses on power politics and the distribution of power among states, emphasizing material factors such as military capabilities and economic strength. It assumes that states act rationally to maximize their own security and interests, often leading to a competitive and conflictual international system.\n\nOn the other hand, social constructivism emphasizes the role of ideas, norms, and identities in shaping state behavior and the structure of the international system. It argues that the social interactions and shared understandings between actors create the meaning and significance of actions, leading to the formation of collective identities and norms that guide state behavior. Social constructivists believe that the international system is not just a product of material forces but also of intersubjective meanings and shared beliefs.\n\nTherefore, while realism is grounded in the notion of causality and material factors, social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings and the construction of shared understandings."
