The market price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in the industry as a whole. For an individual firm in this type of market, the price it receives for its product is constant regardless of how much it produces. This implies that:\n\n- **Total Revenue (TR)** is calculated as Price (P) times Quantity (Q), so TR = P * Q. Since the price is constant, total revenue increases linearly with quantity produced.\n- **Marginal Revenue (MR)** is the change in total revenue from selling one additional unit. In perfect competition, MR is equal to the market price because each additional unit sold adds exactly the price of that unit to total revenue.\n- **Average Revenue (AR)** is total revenue divided by quantity, which is also equal to the market price because AR = TR/Q = P*Q/Q = P.\n\nTherefore, in a perfectly competitive industry, average revenue (AR) equals marginal revenue (MR), making option D the correct statement."
