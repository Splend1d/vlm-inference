The prosecutor now seeks to have the expert testify that in her opinion, based on years of experience with drug dealers, the defendant's statement about the apples was code for his having drugs for sale. Should the expert's opinion be admitted?\n\nA. No, because an expert must base his or her opinion on scientific or technical data, not merely on experience.\nB. No, because the opinion is based on the criminal actions of others engaged in drug dealing, and thus is substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\nC. Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.\nD. Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using \"apples\" as a code word to refer to drugs.\n"

Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal proceedings, expert testimony can be admissible if it helps the jury understand complex or technical information that is relevant to the case. In this scenario, the drug enforcement agent's opinion about the meaning of the defendant's statement is based on her specialized knowledge and experience in the field of drug dealing. This expertise can provide valuable context to the jury, helping them interpret the defendant's words and understand whether they were likely referring to drugs rather than actual apples. Therefore, the expert's opinion should be admitted as it assists the trier of fact in understanding the evidence."
