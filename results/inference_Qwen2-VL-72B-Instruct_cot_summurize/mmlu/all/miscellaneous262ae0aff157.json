This would result in lower returns because more feed would be required to achieve the same weight gain, leading to higher costs per unit of output.\n\nB. **Poor record keeping**: While poor record keeping could lead to inaccuracies in reported returns, it does not directly explain a change in actual returns unless there was a systematic error in recording both years' data differently.\n\nC. **Lower market prices**: If the market prices for hog products have decreased, the revenue generated from selling the hogs would be lower, resulting in lower returns even if the feed efficiency remained constant.\n\nD. **Lower purchase prices**: Lower purchase prices for feed would actually increase returns because the cost of production would decrease, leading to higher profits per unit of feed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible explanation for the decrease in returns from $151 to $130 per $100 of feed is:\n\n**C. Lower market prices**\n\nThis is because lower market prices would directly impact the revenue received from selling the hogs, thereby reducing the overall return on investment in feed."
