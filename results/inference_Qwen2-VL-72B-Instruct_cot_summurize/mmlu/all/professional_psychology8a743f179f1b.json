This approach advocates for counselors to be attuned to the specific meanings and interpretations that clients bring from their own cultural backgrounds, rather than applying broad generalizations or stereotypes about cultural groups. Emic approaches prioritize the subjective experiences and personal narratives of clients, aiming to provide culturally sensitive and responsive care."
