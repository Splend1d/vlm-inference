E - The letter \"E\" does not have a vertical axis of symmetry because it cannot be folded along any vertical line to make both sides match.\n\nC. I - The letter \"I\" has a vertical axis of symmetry because it is symmetrical when folded vertically down the middle.\n\nD. O - The letter \"O\" has a vertical axis of symmetry because it is perfectly round and symmetrical in all directions.\n\nTherefore, the vowel that does NOT have a vertical axis of symmetry is:\n\nB.
