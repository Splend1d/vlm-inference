The mantle's composition and structure can influence heat transfer and convection, but it is not the primary source of a magnetic field.\n\nC. **A molten metallic core only**: A molten metallic core is crucial because it allows for the movement of electrically conductive material, which is essential for generating a magnetic field through the dynamo effect. However, this alone is not enough.\n\nD. **Both a molten metallic core and reasonably fast rotation**: This combination is necessary. The molten metallic core provides the electrically conductive material needed for the dynamo effect, and the reasonably fast rotation helps drive the convection currents within the core that generate the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Both a molten metallic core and reasonably fast rotation**"
