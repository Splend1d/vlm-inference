In terms of the standard normal distribution, this translates to:\nP(Z > (3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.60\n\nFrom the second condition (70% last less than 6 years), we can write:\nP(X < 6) = 0.70\n\nThis means that the probability of a part lasting less than 6 years is 70%. In terms of the standard normal distribution, this translates to:\nP(Z < (6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3) = 0.70\n\nWe can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the corresponding Z-scores for these probabilities. The Z-score for P(Z > z) = 0.60 is approximately -0.25 (since it's the inverse of P(Z < z) = 0.40). Similarly, the Z-score for P(Z < z) = 0.70 is approximately 0.52.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n(3 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = -0.25\n(6 - \u03bc)/\u03c3 = 0.52\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nLet's solve for \u03bc and \u03c3:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n3 - \u03bc = -0.25\u03c3\n\u03bc = 3 + 0.25\u03c3\n\nSubstitute \u03bc in the second equation:\n(6 - (3 + 0.25\u03c3))/\u03c3 = 0.52\n(3 - 0.25\u03c3)/\u03c3 = 0.52\n3 - 0.25\u03c3 = 0.52\u03c3\n3 = 0.77\u03c3\n\u03c3 = 3 / 0.77 \u2248 3.896\n\nNow substitute \u03c3 back into one of the original equations to find \u03bc:\n\u03bc = 3 + 0.25 * 3.896 \u2248 3 + 0.974 \u2248 3.974\n\nThe closest match to our calculated values is option B:\nB. \u03bc = 3.977, \u03c3 = 3.861"
