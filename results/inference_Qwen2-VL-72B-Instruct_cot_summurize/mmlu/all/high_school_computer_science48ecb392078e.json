Each place can hold any of the 16 possible digits (0 through F).\n\nThe largest two-digit hexadecimal number would be FF. To convert this to base-10, we calculate its value as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{FF}_{16} = F \\times 16^1 + F \\times 16^0 \\]\n\\[ = 15 \\times 16 + 15 \\times 1 \\]\n\\[ = 240 + 15 \\]\n\\[ = 255 \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number is 255.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 255."
