Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.\nIsabella Beeton, Book of Household Management, 1861\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the subject of Beeton's book was\n\nA. the role of women in army regiments\nB. the running of a school for domestic servants\nC. the running of a school for girls\nD. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the main subject**: The passage discusses the importance of a \"mistress of the house\" and compares her role to that of a commander or leader. It emphasizes the impact of her actions on the entire household.\n\n2. **Understand the context**: The passage mentions that the \"happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family\" depend on the woman's knowledge of household duties.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: The role of women in army regiments. This is not relevant because the passage focuses on the domestic sphere rather than military roles.\n   - **Option B**: The running of a school for domestic servants. While the passage does discuss household management, it centers on the role of the mistress of the house herself, not on teaching others.\n   - **Option C**: The running of a school for girls. This is also not directly related to the passage, which is about the practical management of a household by a woman.\n   - **Option D**: The role of a woman in running her own domestic household. This aligns perfectly with the passage, which discusses the importance of a woman's role in managing her home and ensuring the well-being of her family.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate inference is:\n\nThe subject of Beeton's book was the role of a woman in running her own domestic household.\n\nFinal answer: **D. the role of a woman in running her own domestic household**."
