One such adaptation is replacing broad leaves with spines or thorns, which reduces the surface area available for transpiration and helps conserve water. This is commonly seen in succulents and cacti. The other options listed (numerous stomata, thin cuticles, and large surface-to-volume ratios) would actually increase water loss rather than minimize it."
