No, the statute violates the First Amendment right to publish protected commercial speech.\n\nThe First Amendment protects freedom of speech and press, which includes the dissemination of information, even if it pertains to controversial topics like abortion. Commercial speech, which is speech that proposes a commercial transaction, is also generally protected under the First Amendment, although it receives less protection than non-commercial speech. However, restrictions on commercial speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and must leave open ample alternative channels for communication. In this case, the statute appears to be overly broad and may not meet these requirements, thus violating the First Amendment rights of the individual."
