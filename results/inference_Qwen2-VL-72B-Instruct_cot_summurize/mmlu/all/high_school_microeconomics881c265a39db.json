When the price of a good decreases, consumers tend to buy more of it because it becomes relatively cheaper compared to other goods (substitution effect). Additionally, a lower price increases the purchasing power of consumers' income, allowing them to buy more of the good (income effect). These two effects together contribute to the downward slope of the demand curve."
