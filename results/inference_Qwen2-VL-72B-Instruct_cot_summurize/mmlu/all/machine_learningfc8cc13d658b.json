This function is monotonically increasing because it always increases or stays constant as \\( x \\) increases.\n- **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function is defined as \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\). This function is also monotonically increasing because it always increases as \\( x \\) increases.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Both RELUs and sigmoids are monotonic functions.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n### Statement 2: Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\n- **Gradient Descent**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function in machine learning models, including neural networks. However, it does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum, especially in non-convex problems like those encountered in deep learning.\n- **Global Optimum vs. Local Optima**: In complex, high-dimensional spaces typical of neural networks, gradient descent can often get stuck in local optima rather than finding the global optimum.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Neural networks trained with gradient descent do not necessarily converge to the global optimum; they may converge to a local optimum instead.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
