While there might be some evidence or studies indicating this trend in certain contexts, it is unlikely to be universally true for every single country without exception. Therefore, this statement is likely false.\n\n2. **In the United States, women\u2019s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men.**\n   - This statement implies that over time, women in the United States have become happier not only in an absolute sense but also compared to men. Research on gender differences in happiness trends can vary, and while some studies may show improvements in women's happiness, it would be difficult to assert this as a definitive fact without specific data supporting it. Thus, this statement could be either true or false depending on the most recent and comprehensive research findings.\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n\n- The first statement is likely false.\n- The second statement could be true or false, but without more specific information, we cannot definitively say it is true.\n\nTherefore, the best choice based on the given options is:\n\n**D. False, False**"
