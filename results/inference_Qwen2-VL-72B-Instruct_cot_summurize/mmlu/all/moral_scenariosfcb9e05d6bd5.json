In Scenario 1, showing an ID to a cashier is a routine and expected action, typically done for identification or age verification purposes. In Scenario 2, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley can be seen as a self-protective measure, especially if one feels threatened or unsafe. Neither scenario involves harm to others or violation of ethical principles."
