The cost per uniform is $46, and the school is buying 12 uniforms. So, the equation should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = (\\text{Cost per Uniform}) \\times (\\text{Number of Uniforms}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 46 \\times 12 \\]\n\nNow, let's break down $46 into $40 and $6 for easier calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = (40 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 12) \\]\n\nThis matches option C:\n\n\\[ (40 \\times 12) + (6 \\times 12) = 480 + 72 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
