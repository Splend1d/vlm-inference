C, C++\n\nBuffer overflow errors are more commonly associated with languages like C and C++, which provide low-level memory manipulation capabilities but do not have built-in mechanisms to prevent buffer overflows. Developers must manually manage memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. Languages like Python, Ruby, and others that are higher-level and have automatic memory management features are less prone to such issues."
