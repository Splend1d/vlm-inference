The retina's photoreceptors (rods and cones) transduce light energy into electrical signals, whereas the cochlea's hair cells transduce mechanical energy (sound vibrations) into electrical signals. This fundamental difference in the type of energy they convert is crucial for their respective roles in vision and hearing."
