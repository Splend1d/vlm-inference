The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate. However, the attorney does have a photograph that shows a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church. Bystanders are seen to be throwing rice at the couple and they seem to be responding by smiling and bowing down. The attorney was given the photograph by the man. He found it in his mother's effects following her death. The man believes that the bride in the picture is his mother. He cannot identify the groom.

In this scenario, the photograph showing a couple dressed in wedding clothes with bystanders throwing rice suggests a wedding ceremony. However, for the photograph to be admissible as evidence, a witness must confirm that the image accurately represents what happened and that the individuals in the photo are indeed the man's mother and the businessman. This authentication process ensures the reliability and relevance of the photograph as evidence in court."
