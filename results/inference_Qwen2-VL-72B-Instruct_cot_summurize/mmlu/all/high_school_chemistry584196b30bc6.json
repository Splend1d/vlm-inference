The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n"

Let's break down the information given:\n\n- Initial temperature of the liquid sample: \\( T_{\\text{sample, initial}} = 100^\\circ C \\)\n- Mass of the liquid sample: \\( m_{\\text{sample}} = 25 \\text{ g} \\)\n- Initial temperature of the water: \\( T_{\\text{water, initial}} = 22^\\circ C \\)\n- Mass of the water: \\( m_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\text{ g} \\)\n- Final temperature of the mixture: \\( T_{\\text{final}} = 35^\\circ C \\)\n\nWe need to determine which statement is correct based on these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Heat Transfer Principle**:\n   - Heat flows from the hotter substance (the liquid sample) to the cooler substance (the water).\n   - The heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water.\n\n2. **Temperature Changes**:\n   - Change in temperature for the sample: \\( \\Delta T_{\\text{sample}} = 35^\\circ C - 100^\\circ C = -65^\\circ C \\)\n   - Change in temperature for the water: \\( \\Delta T_{\\text{water}} = 35^\\circ C - 22^\\circ C = 13^\\circ C \\)\n\n3. **Heat Energy Calculation**:\n   - Heat lost by the sample: \\( Q_{\\text{lost}} = m_{\\text{sample}} \\cdot c_{\\text{sample}} \\cdot \\Delta T_{\\text{sample}} \\)\n   - Heat gained by the water: \\( Q_{\\text{gained}} = m_{\\text{water}} \\cdot c_{\\text{water}} \\cdot \\Delta T_{\\text{water}} \\)\n\nSince the system is isolated, the heat lost by the sample must equal the heat gained by the water:\n\\[ Q_{\\text{lost}} = Q_{\\text{gained}} \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n   - The sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**B. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.**"
