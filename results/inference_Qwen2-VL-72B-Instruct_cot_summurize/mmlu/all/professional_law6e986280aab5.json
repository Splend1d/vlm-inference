During the jury trial, eyewitnesses gave conflicting testimony on the arrest. At the close of evidence, the protester moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the court denied. The court instructed the jury that the protester\u00d5s burden of proof was clear and convincing evidence, rather than the correct burden of preponderance of the evidence. The jury returned a verdict for the officer, and the court entered judgment accordingly. What is the protester\u00d5s best option for challenging the judgment?\n\nA. Seek a new trial, because the jury instruction affected the protester\u00d5s substantial rights.\nB. Seek a new trial, because the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.\nC. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury did not have legally sufficient evidence to find for the officer.\nD. Seek judgment as a matter of law, because the jury\u00d5s findings were clearly erroneous.\n"

Seek a new trial, because the jury instruction affected the protester's substantial rights.\n\nThis option is most appropriate because the court incorrectly instructed the jury on the burden of proof, which is a significant legal error that could have influenced the jury's decision. The burden of proof in a civil case is typically \"preponderance of the evidence,\" meaning it is more likely than not that the claim is true. By instructing the jury with the higher standard of \"clear and convincing evidence,\" the court erred, potentially affecting the outcome of the case. This kind of error can justify a motion for a new trial based on the grounds that the incorrect instruction affected the protester's substantial rights."
