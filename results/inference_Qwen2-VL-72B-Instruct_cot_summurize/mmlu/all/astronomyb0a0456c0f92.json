Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials.\n\nOrbital resonance refers to a gravitational interaction between two orbiting bodies that causes a pattern of motion where the orbital periods are in a simple integer ratio. This can lead to phenomena such as the 2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune and Pluto, Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt, and gaps in Saturn's rings. However, the breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials is not directly caused by orbital resonance but rather by tidal forces exerted by the planet on the moon."
