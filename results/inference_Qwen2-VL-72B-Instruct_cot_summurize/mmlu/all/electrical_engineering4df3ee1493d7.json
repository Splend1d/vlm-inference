                    "text": "To determine the range of firing angle control for a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit with a resistance \\( R \\) and a counter EMF \\( E \\), we need to consider the conditions under which the thyristor (or SCR) will conduct.\n\nThe source voltage is given by:\n\\[ V(t) = 400 \\sin(314t) \\]\n\nThe counter EMF is given by:\n\\[ E = 200 \\text{ V} \\]\n\nFor the thyristor to conduct, the applied voltage must be greater than the counter EMF. The thyristor starts conducting when the applied voltage exceeds the counter EMF and stops conducting when the applied voltage falls below the counter EMF.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle at which the applied voltage equals the counter EMF:\n\n\\[ 400 \\sin(\\alpha) = 200 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\alpha \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac{200}{400} = 0.5 \\]\n\\[ \\alpha = \\arcsin(0.5) \\]\n\\[ \\alpha = 30^\\circ \\]\n\nThis means that the thyristor starts conducting at \\( 30^\\circ \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the angle at which the applied voltage again equals the counter EMF but in the negative cycle:\n\n\\[ 400 \\sin(\\beta) = -200 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\beta \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{-200}{400} = -0.5 \\]\n\\[ \\beta = \\arcsin(-0.5) \\]\n\\[ \\beta = -30^\\circ \\]\n\nHowever, since we are considering angles in the positive direction from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, we add 360\u00b0 to -30\u00b0:\n\n\\[ \\beta = -30^\\circ + 360^\\circ = 330^\\circ \\]\n\nThis means that the thyristor stops conducting at \\( 330^\\circ \\).\n\nTherefore, the thyristor conducts between \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 330^\\circ \\). However, the question asks for the range of firing angle control, which is typically considered within the first half-cycle (0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0) because the thyristor can only be fired once per cycle.\n\nThus, the range of firing angle control is from \\( 30^\\circ \\) to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0."
