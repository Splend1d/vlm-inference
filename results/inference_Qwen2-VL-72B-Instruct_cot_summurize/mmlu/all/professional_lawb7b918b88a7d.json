Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\n\nThe customer's actions were taken to protect another person from imminent harm, which is generally considered a privileged act under the law. The use of reasonable force in such circumstances is typically justified, especially when it prevents a potentially serious injury or crime. Therefore, the customer would likely be protected from liability for any injuries sustained by the woman during this intervention."
