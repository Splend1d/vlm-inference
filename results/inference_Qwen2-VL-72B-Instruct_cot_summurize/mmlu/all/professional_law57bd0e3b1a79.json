                    "text": "On June 1, an owner of a business that built mobile homes was visited by a representative of a company that manufactured propane tanks. Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a negotiation between a mobile home builder and a propane tank manufacturer regarding the purchase of propane tanks. To determine the legal rights of the parties, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the principles of contract law.\n\n1. **Initial Offer**: The representative offered to sell propane tanks at $50 each.\n2. **Counteroffer**: The owner responded with a counteroffer on June 3, specifying the purchase of 1,000 tanks at $45,000 (implying a 10% discount).\n3. **Acceptance**: The company delivered the tanks on June 30, which can be considered an acceptance of the terms of the counteroffer unless there is evidence to the contrary.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**: \"The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\"\n- This option suggests that the June 3 memo effectively integrated all terms of the agreement. However, the memo included a new term (the 10% discount) that was not part of the original offer. This makes it a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.\n\n**Option B**: \"The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\"\n- This option implies that silence from the company regarding the discount means acceptance. In contract law, silence generally does not constitute acceptance. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C**: \"The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\"\n- This option correctly identifies that the inclusion of the discount term in the June 3 memo constitutes a material alteration of the original offer. Material alterations require express acceptance by the offeree. Since the company did not explicitly accept the discounted price, the original offer stands.\n\n**Option D**: \"The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\"\n- This option correctly states that the original offer remains valid unless the counteroffer is accepted. Since the company did not accept the discounted price, the original offer of $50 per tank stands.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement of the legal rights of the parties is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.**"
