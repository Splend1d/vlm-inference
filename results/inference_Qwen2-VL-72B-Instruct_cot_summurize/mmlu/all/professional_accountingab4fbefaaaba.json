Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A** is incorrect because in periods of rising prices, the LIFO method typically results in a higher cost of sales and lower taxable income compared to the FIFO method, not the other way around. This is because LIFO assumes that the last items purchased (the most recently acquired goods) are sold first, leaving older, cheaper inventory on hand.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because once a taxpayer receives permission to use the LIFO method, they do not need to seek permission annually to continue using it.\n- **Option C** is incorrect because if a company uses the LIFO method for tax purposes, it must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n- **Option D** is correct because under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is considered to be composed of the oldest (earliest acquired) goods, while the most recent purchases are assumed to have been sold."
