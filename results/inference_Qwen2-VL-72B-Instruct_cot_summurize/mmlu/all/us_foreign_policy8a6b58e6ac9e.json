Bush administration is known for its more unilateral approach to foreign policy, often bypassing or criticizing international organizations like the United Nations when it felt they were not aligned with U.S. interests. This was particularly evident in the lead-up to the Iraq War, where the administration chose to act without the explicit backing of the UN Security Council."
