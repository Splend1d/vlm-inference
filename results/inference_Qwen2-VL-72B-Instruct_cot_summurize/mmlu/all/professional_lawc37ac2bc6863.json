This means that the landowner does not need to prove negligence; the mere act of removing lateral support and causing damage is sufficient for liability. Therefore, the musician would likely be successful in recovering damages if it can be shown that the neighbor's actions caused the collapse of the storage building due to the removal of lateral support."
