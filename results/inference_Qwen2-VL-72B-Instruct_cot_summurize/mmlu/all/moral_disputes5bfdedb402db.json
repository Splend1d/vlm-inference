                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of Reiman's critique of van den Haag's arguments in favor of the death penalty:\n\nA. **are incompatible with the right to retaliation**: This option suggests that Reiman believes van den Haag's arguments do not align with the concept of retaliation as a justification for the death penalty. However, without specific information on Reiman's stance on this point, it's hard to conclude definitively.\n\nB. **prove that torture is morally impermissible**: This option implies that Reiman sees van den Haag's arguments as leading to the conclusion that torture is morally wrong. This seems unlikely because van den Haag's arguments typically focus on the death penalty rather than torture.\n\nC. **should be accepted**: If Reiman were to argue that van den Haag's arguments should be accepted, it would mean that Reiman agrees with van den Haag's position on the death penalty. Given that Reiman is known for his opposition to the death penalty, this option is unlikely.\n\nD. **follow common sense**: This option suggests that Reiman views van den Haag's arguments as being aligned with common sense. While Reiman may acknowledge that some aspects of van den Haag's arguments resonate with common sense, he ultimately disagrees with the overall conclusion supporting the death penalty.\n\nGiven the context and Reiman's known opposition to the death penalty, the most plausible interpretation is that Reiman does not fully accept van den Haag's arguments but acknowledges that they might seem reasonable or intuitive to many people.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**D. follow common sense**"
