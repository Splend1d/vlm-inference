This privilege applies even when the client is accused of a crime. In this scenario, the mayor's attorney has refused to produce private bank records that were delivered by the mayor, invoking the attorney-client privilege. The court should respect this privilege and not compel production, as doing so would violate the confidentiality protected by the attorney-client privilege."
