The treaty was a result of the First Opium War (1839-1842) between the Qing dynasty of China and the British Empire. This war was primarily caused by the British desire to continue trading opium in China despite its prohibition by the Chinese government.\n\nGiven this historical context:\n\nA. The Boxer Rebellion occurred much later, from 1899 to 1901.\nB. There was no significant treaty between China and colonial India during this period.\nC. The elimination of British Corn Laws happened in 1846 and was unrelated to the Opium Wars.\nD. The British forcing the Chinese to participate in the opium trade directly led to the conflict that resulted in the Treaty of Nanjing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the British forcing the Chinese to participate in the opium trade"
