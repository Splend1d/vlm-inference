The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis.
