However, when a tire on the woman's car suddenly blew out, she lost control of her car and crashed, injuring a pedestrian. The pedestrian later sued the man, because the woman had no insurance or assets. Will the pedestrian be likely to prevail in that action?\n\nA. No, because the man did not cause the injury.\nB. No, because the man was driving very carefully.\nC. Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\nD. Yes, because the man was exceeding the speed limit. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the man and the woman were participating together in an illegal drag race, which is inherently a dangerous activity. Even though the man did not directly cause the accident, his involvement in the race could be seen as contributing to the overall dangerous situation that led to the pedestrian's injury. Therefore, the pedestrian may have grounds to sue the man based on the principle that both parties were engaged in a joint dangerous activity."
