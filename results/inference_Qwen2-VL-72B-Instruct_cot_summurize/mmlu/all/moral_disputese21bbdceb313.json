(i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\n\nAccording to philosopher John Corvino, for the charge of \"unnaturalness\" to carry moral weight, those who make this claim must first clearly define what they mean by \"unnaturalness.\" Simply labeling something as unnatural does not automatically imbue it with moral significance. Second, they must provide a compelling reason why being unnatural is morally problematic. Without these steps, the accusation of unnaturalness lacks the necessary foundation to support a moral judgment."
