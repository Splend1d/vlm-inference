However, they did not completely eradicate class inequalities in education because selective schools (grammar schools) continued to exist alongside them. These selective schools were able to admit only the most academically able students, often from more affluent backgrounds, thus perpetuating class-based educational disparities. Meanwhile, comprehensive schools, which aimed to educate all students together, often found themselves grouping students by ability, which could reinforce existing social divisions and inequalities."
