                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that the advertised size of a television usually refers to the diagonal measurement of the screen. Given that the ratio of the length (horizontal) to the height (vertical) of the television screen is 5:3, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the actual horizontal length when the diagonal is given as 48 inches.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The horizontal length as \\( L \\)\n- The vertical height as \\( H \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the ratio of \\( L \\) to \\( H \\) is 5:3. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{L}{H} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3}H \\]\n\nThe diagonal \\( D \\) of the screen forms a right triangle with the horizontal and vertical sides. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ D^2 = L^2 + H^2 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( D = 48 \\) inches, we substitute \\( L \\) in terms of \\( H \\):\n\\[ 48^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}H\\right)^2 + H^2 \\]\n\\[ 2304 = \\frac{25}{9}H^2 + H^2 \\]\n\\[ 2304 = \\frac{25H^2 + 9H^2}{9} \\]\n\\[ 2304 = \\frac{34H^2}{9} \\]\n\\[ 2304 \\times 9 = 34H^2 \\]\n\\[ 20736 = 34H^2 \\]\n\\[ H^2 = \\frac{20736}{34} \\]\n\\[ H^2 = 610 \\]\n\\[ H = \\sqrt{610} \\approx 24.69 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, we find \\( L \\):\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3}H \\]\n\\[ L = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 24.69 \\]\n\\[ L \\approx 41.15 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nThe difference between the diagonal and the horizontal length is:\n\\[ 48 - 41.15 \\approx 6.85 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest inch, the difference is approximately 7 inches.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 7."
