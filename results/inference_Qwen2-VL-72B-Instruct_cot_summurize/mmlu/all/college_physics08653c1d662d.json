However, this is not necessarily true; the magnetic field can exist just outside the superconductor as long as it is expelled from the interior.\n\nB. **B is perpendicular to the surface:** If \\( B \\) were perpendicular to the surface, it would have a non-zero normal component, which contradicts the fact that the magnetic field inside the superconductor is zero.\n\nC. **B is tangential to the surface:** Since the magnetic field inside the superconductor is zero, the normal component of \\( B \\) just outside the superconductor must also be zero. Therefore, the magnetic field must be purely tangential to the surface.\n\nD. **B is time independent:** There is no information provided about whether the magnetic field is changing with time or not. This condition cannot be inferred solely from the given information.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. B is tangential to the surface.**"
