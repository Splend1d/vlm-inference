The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\nB. Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\nC. Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\nD. Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.\n"

Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the key differences between the two approaches. Critical Security Studies adopts a post-structuralist and constructivist perspective, viewing security as a social construct influenced by societal norms and discourses. In contrast, the Copenhagen School, while acknowledging some aspects of constructivism, primarily employs a more positivist approach, focusing on empirical evidence and objective analysis of security threats and responses."
