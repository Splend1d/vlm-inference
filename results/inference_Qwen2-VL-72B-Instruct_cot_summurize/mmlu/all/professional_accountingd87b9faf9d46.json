This means that the asset will be reported on the balance sheet at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. It will also be classified as a current asset if it is expected to be sold within one year or the company's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. Additionally, depreciation on the asset ceases from the date it is classified as held for sale. Therefore, options A, B, and C are correct. Option D is incorrect because the asset will not be valued at historical cost but rather at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell."
