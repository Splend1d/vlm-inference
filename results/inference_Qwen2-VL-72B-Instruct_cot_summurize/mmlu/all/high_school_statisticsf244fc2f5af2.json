This means we're looking for the z-score corresponding to the upper 20% of the distribution. In a standard normal distribution table, this corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.8 (since the total area under the curve is 1, and we're looking for the point where 80% of the data falls below it).\n\nLooking up the z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.8 in a standard normal distribution table gives us approximately \\(z = 0.84\\).\n\nNow, we plug this z-score into the z-score formula to solve for \\(X\\):\n\\[ 0.84 = \\frac{(X - 600)}{15} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\):\n\\[ X = 0.84 \\times 15 + 600 \\]\n\\[ X = 12.6 + 600 \\]\n\\[ X = 612.6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 612.6."
