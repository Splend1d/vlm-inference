If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nSarah's previous five times are: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nAfter her sixth attempt, the median time becomes 92 seconds. This means that when all six times are arranged in ascending order, the third and fourth numbers (since there are now six numbers) must be such that their average is 92.\n\nLet's denote her sixth time as \\( x \\). When we add \\( x \\) to the list, we have six numbers, so the median will be the average of the third and fourth numbers in the sorted list.\n\nIf \\( x \\) is less than or equal to 88, then the third number would still be 88, and the fourth number would be 94. Their average would be:\n\\[ \\frac{88 + 94}{2} = 91 \\]\n\nThis is not 92, so \\( x \\) cannot be less than or equal to 88.\n\nIf \\( x \\) is greater than 88 but less than 94, then the third number would be \\( x \\), and the fourth number would be 94. Their average would be:\n\\[ \\frac{x + 94}{2} = 92 \\]\n\\[ x + 94 = 184 \\]\n\\[ x = 90 \\]\n\nSo, if \\( x \\) is between 88 and 94, it must be 90 to make the median 92.\n\nIf \\( x \\) is greater than or equal to 94, then the third number would be 94, and the fourth number would be \\( x \\). Their average would be:\n\\[ \\frac{94 + x}{2} = 92 \\]\n\\[ 94 + x = 184 \\]\n\\[ x = 90 \\]\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that \\( x \\) is greater than or equal to 94, because 90 is not greater than 94.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for \\( x \\) that makes the median 92 is 90.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 90."
