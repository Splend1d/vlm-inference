They help researchers determine whether observed differences or relationships in the sample data are likely to exist in the larger population. To determine if the difference between the mean scores of an experimental group and a control group is statistically significant, a researcher would typically use inferential statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), or other appropriate statistical methods. These tests can provide a p-value that indicates the probability that the observed difference occurred by chance, allowing the researcher to conclude whether the difference is statistically significant."
