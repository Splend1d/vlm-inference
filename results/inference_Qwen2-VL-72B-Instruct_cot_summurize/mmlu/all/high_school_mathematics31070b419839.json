So, we have:\n\n\\[ 12 = \\frac{\\text{Sum of 7 numbers} + \\text{8th number}}{8} \\]\n\nSubstituting the sum of the 7 numbers (105) into this equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 12 = \\frac{105 + \\text{8th number}}{8} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8 to solve for the 8th number:\n\n\\[ 96 = 105 + \\text{8th number} \\]\n\nSubtracting 105 from both sides gives us the value of the 8th number:\n\n\\[ \\text{8th number} = 96 - 105 = -9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the 8th number is -9, which corresponds to option B."
