These processes are largely carried out by enzymes, which are proteins. The types and amounts of proteins produced in a cell are determined by its genetic material (DNA), which dictates the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequently the translation into specific proteins. Therefore, metabolism is influenced by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material."
