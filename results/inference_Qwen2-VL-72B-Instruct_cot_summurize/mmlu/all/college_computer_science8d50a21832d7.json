The total number of values that can be represented with \\( n \\) flits in a ternary system is given by:\n\n\\[ 3^n \\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 3^n \\geq 256 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the powers of 3 until we exceed 256:\n\n1. \\( 3^1 = 3 \\)\n2. \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n4. \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n5. \\( 3^5 = 243 \\)\n6. \\( 3^6 = 729 \\)\n\nSince \\( 3^5 = 243 \\) is less than 256 and \\( 3^6 = 729 \\) is greater than 256, we need at least 6 flits to represent at least 256 different values.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 6"
