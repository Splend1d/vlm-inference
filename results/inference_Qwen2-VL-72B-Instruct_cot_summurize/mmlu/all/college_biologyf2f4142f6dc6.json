A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions\n\nWhen a person hyperventilates, they breathe faster and more deeply than normal, which leads to a rapid removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the body. This decrease in CO2 levels causes a shift in the chemical equilibrium of the blood, leading to a reduction in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). The result is respiratory alkalosis, characterized by a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a lower concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood."
