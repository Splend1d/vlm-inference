Ruled by autonomous dynasties:\n- Mayan city-states were indeed ruled by autonomous dynasties. Each city-state had its own ruling family.\n\nB. Similar in their political organization to Egyptian communities:\n- The political organization of Mayan city-states was quite different from that of ancient Egypt. While both had hierarchical structures, the specifics and dynamics of their governance were distinct.\n\nC. Supported by large agricultural hinterlands:\n- Mayan city-states were supported by extensive agricultural systems, including terraced fields and irrigation networks, which sustained their populations.\n\nD. Much smaller in population than Mohenjo-daro:\n- Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, with an estimated population of around 40,000 to 50,000 people. Some major Mayan cities, like Tikal or Teotihuacan, had populations that could be comparable or even larger.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Similar in their political organization to Egyptian communities."
