The purchases during the month are:\n\n- May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each = $116.00\n- May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each = $440.00\n\nTotal cost of units available for sale = Initial inventory + Purchases\n= $1250 + $116 + $440\n= $1806\n\nTotal units available for sale = Initial units + Purchased units\n= 200 + 20 + 80\n= 300 units\n\nWeighted average cost per unit = Total cost of units available for sale / Total units available for sale\n= $1806 / 300\n= $6.02\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) for the 10 units sold on May 14 = 10 units * Weighted average cost per unit\n= 10 * $6.02\n= $60.20\n\nTherefore, Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May is $60.20, which corresponds to option A."
