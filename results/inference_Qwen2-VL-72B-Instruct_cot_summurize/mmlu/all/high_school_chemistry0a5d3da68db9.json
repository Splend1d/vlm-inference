Since it involves reactants in different phases (solid and gas), it is classified as a heterogeneous reaction.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) \u2192 4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n- All reactants and products are gases, so this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nB. C2H5OH(aq) + O2(aq) \u2192 HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(aq)\n- All reactants and products are in aqueous solution, so this is also a homogeneous reaction.\n\nD.
