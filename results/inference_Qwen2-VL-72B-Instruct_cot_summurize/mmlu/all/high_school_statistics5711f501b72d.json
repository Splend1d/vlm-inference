We can use these z-scores to find the corresponding customer ranges using the formula:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + Z\\sigma \\]\n\nWhere \\(X\\) is the value at a given percentile, \\(Z\\) is the z-score for that percentile, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the 25th percentile (\\(Z = -0.674\\)):\n\\[ X_{25} = 3250 + (-0.674) \\times 320 \\]\n\\[ X_{25} = 3250 - 215.68 \\]\n\\[ X_{25} \\approx 3034.32 \\]\n\nFor the 75th percentile (\\(Z = 0.674\\)):\n\\[ X_{75} = 3250 + 0.674 \\times 320 \\]\n\\[ X_{75} = 3250 + 215.68 \\]\n\\[ X_{75} \\approx 3465.68 \\]\n\nTherefore, the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is approximately (3,034, 3,466).\n\nThe correct answer is A.
