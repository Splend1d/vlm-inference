This prohibition was enacted to prevent motorists from evading radar or speed checkpoints on county and state highways. A neighboring state has no such regulation in effect. By the same token, Congress has taken no action on the matter. A resident of the neighboring state has installed a radar detection device in his automobile. While driving to visit his mother he is arrested and charged with violating the aforementioned state statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. As applied to the resident, the state prohibition against the use of radar detection devices is likely to be held\n\nA. constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.\nB. constitutional, because the commerce clause does not invalidate a state regulation relating to interstate commerce unless Congress takes express action to do so.\nC. unconstitutional, because the state statute fails to give credit to the law of a neighboring state.\nD. unconstitutional, because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.\n"

States have the authority to regulate activities within their borders to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, which is known as the police power. As long as the statute is reasonably related to achieving this legitimate state interest and does not discriminate against out-of-state residents or unduly burden interstate commerce without a compelling justification, it is likely to be deemed constitutional."
