Five years into the lease, the team threatened to leave the stadium and move to another city. The city sued the team in federal court, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the team from breaching its lease and leaving. In its answer, the team included a counterclaim seeking $10 million in damages for losses caused by the city's alleged failure to properly maintain the stadium, as the lease required. The team demanded a jury trial on the counterclaim. The city moved to try its claim for a permanent injunction before the trial on the team's counterclaim. The team objected and moved that the jury trial of its counterclaim be held before the trial of the city's injunction claim. How should the court rule on the parties' motions?\n\nA. The court should first hold a jury trial of the team's counterclaim, and then a nonjury trial of the issues remaining in the city's claim.\nB. The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim without giving binding effect to its findings or conclusions in the later jury trial of the team's counterclaim.\nC. The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.\nD. The court should schedule a jury trial of both the city's claim and the team's counterclaim.\n"

The court should first hold a nonjury trial of the city's claim, and then a jury trial of the issues remaining in the team's counterclaim.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Nature of the Claims**: The city is seeking a permanent injunction, which is an equitable remedy typically decided by the judge (nonjury trial). The team's counterclaim seeks monetary damages, which is a legal remedy typically decided by a jury.\n\n2. **Procedural Order**: Generally, courts will decide equitable claims (such as injunctions) before legal claims (such as damages). This is because the resolution of the equitable claim might make the legal claim unnecessary or alter its scope.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Fairness**: By first addressing the city's request for an injunction, the court can potentially resolve the dispute more efficiently. If the injunction is granted, it may render the counterclaim moot or significantly affect its outcome. Conversely, if the injunction is denied, the counterclaim can proceed without unnecessary delay.\n\n4. **Separate Trials**: Holding separate trials for equitable and legal claims is common practice in many jurisdictions to ensure that each type of relief is considered appropriately under the law.\n\nTherefore, the court should first conduct a nonjury trial on the city's claim for a permanent injunction, followed by a jury trial on the team's counterclaim for monetary damages."
