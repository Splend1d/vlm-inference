For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII.

This does not inherently increase compilation time significantly compared to direct representation. The primary difference in performance is more likely to be observed during runtime rather than compile time.\n\nII. **Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.**\n   - Direct representation means storing the actual data on the stack, which allows for faster access because accessing stack variables is generally quicker than accessing heap variables through pointers. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nIII. **When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.**\n   - With indirect representation, the actual data is stored on the heap, and the size of the pointer remains constant regardless of the size of the data it points to. This means that if the size of a private component changes, you do not need to recompile as many modules because the size of the pointer does not change. Thus, this statement is also true.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III only**"
