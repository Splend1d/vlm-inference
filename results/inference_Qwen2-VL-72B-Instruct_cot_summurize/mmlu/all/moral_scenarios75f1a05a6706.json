The main character acted swiftly to prevent harm to their step-sister, demonstrating concern and responsibility.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I framed a small child for shoplifting.\"\n- Framing someone, especially a child, for a crime they did not commit is morally wrong. It involves deceit, injustice, and potentially causing significant harm to the child's reputation and well-being.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
