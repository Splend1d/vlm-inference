By Lagrange's theorem, \\( \\langle g \\rangle \\) must have subgroups of each of these orders.\n- Specifically:\n  - The subgroup of order 1 is trivial and contains only the identity element.\n  - The subgroup of order 2 can be found by considering \\( g^5 \\), since \\( (g^5)^2 = g^{10} = e \\).\n  - The subgroup of order 5 can be found by considering \\( g^2 \\), since \\( (g^2)^5 = g^{10} = e \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Let \\( a \\) be an element of order 2 and \\( b \\) be an element of order 3.\n- The orders of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) imply that \\( a^2 = e \\) and \\( b^3 = e \\).\n- To find an element of order 6, consider the product \\( ab \\). We need to check whether \\( (ab)^6 = e \\) and \\( (ab)^k \\neq e \\) for all \\( k < 6 \\).\n- In general, the order of the product \\( ab \\) depends on the commutativity of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n  - If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute (\\( ab = ba \\)), then \\( (ab)^6 = a^6b^6 = (a^2)^3(b^3)^2 = e \\cdot e = e \\).\n  - However, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do not commute, the situation becomes more complex. For example, in the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\), which has elements of orders 2 and 3 but no element of order 6.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is false** because the existence of elements of orders 2 and 3 does not necessarily guarantee the existence of an element of order 6 without additional information about the group structure or commutativity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
