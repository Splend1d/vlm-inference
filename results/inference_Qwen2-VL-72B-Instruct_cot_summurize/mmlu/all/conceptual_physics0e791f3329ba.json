Work is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force applied and \\( d \\) is the distance over which the force is applied. In this case, the force needed to lift the crate is equal to its weight, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ F = m \\cdot g \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the crate and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ F = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 980 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d = 980 \\, \\text{N} \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} = 1960 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNext, we'll find the power (P), which is the work done per unit time:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W}{t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the time taken.\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1960 \\, \\text{J}}{4 \\, \\text{s}} = 490 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nTherefore, the power required to raise the crate is approximately 490 watts. The closest answer choice is:\n\nB. 500 W"
