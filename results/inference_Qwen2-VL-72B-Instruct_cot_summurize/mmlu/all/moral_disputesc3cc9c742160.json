However, Callahan does not specifically mention the methodology of the survey as a point of contention.\n\nB. **other studies have found contrary results.**\n   - This implies that there are conflicting findings from other studies. If Callahan had mentioned other studies with different results, this would be relevant. However, he does not reference any other studies directly.\n\nC. **even if the finding is true, it is irrelevant to the moral status of euthanasia.**\n   - This suggests that regardless of the factual accuracy of the findings, they do not impact the ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia. This aligns well with Callahan\u2019s argument, which seems to focus on the broader moral implications rather than just the practical outcomes.\n\nD. **the findings are suspect because the study was performed by advocates of euthanasia.**\n   - This implies a bias in the study due to the affiliation of the researchers. While this could be a valid concern, Callahan does not explicitly raise this issue about potential bias.\n\nGiven the context provided, the most fitting response to Callahan's argument is:\n\n**C. even if the finding is true, it is irrelevant to the moral status of euthanasia.**\n\nThis option best captures the essence of Callahan's argument, focusing on the irrelevance of the practical findings to the broader moral debate around euthanasia."
