It is more about personal responsibility and consideration for others.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I encouraged the politician to sleep on my proposal.\"\n\n- Encouraging someone to think carefully about a decision before making it is generally considered responsible and thoughtful advice.\n- This action does not involve any harm or unethical behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
