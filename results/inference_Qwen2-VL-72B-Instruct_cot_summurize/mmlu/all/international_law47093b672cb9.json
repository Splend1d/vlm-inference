A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected.\n\nIn the context of international law, an \"injured State\" refers to a state that has been harmed by the internationally wrongful act of another state. This harm can be direct or indirect, and it must be established that the obligation breached was owed to the injured state either individually or as part of a group of states, and that the injured state was particularly affected by the breach."
