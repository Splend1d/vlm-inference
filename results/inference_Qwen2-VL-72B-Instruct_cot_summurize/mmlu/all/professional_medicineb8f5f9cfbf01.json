Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?\n\nA. CT scan of the neck\nB. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\nC. Radionuclide thyroid scan\nD. Thyroidectomy\n"

This procedure involves using a thin needle to extract cells from the nodule for microscopic examination, which can help determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule"
