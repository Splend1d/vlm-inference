This is known as impeachment. However, such statements are generally not considered substantive evidence, meaning they cannot be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement itself. Instead, they are used to show inconsistencies in the witness's testimony, thereby casting doubt on their reliability.\n\nTherefore, if the plaintiff requests it, the trial judge should instruct the jury that the prior statement made by the bystander can only be used to assess the credibility of the bystander's current testimony and not as direct evidence of what happened at the time of the accident."
