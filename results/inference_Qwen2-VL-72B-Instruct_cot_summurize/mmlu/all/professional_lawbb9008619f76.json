He landed the plane safely in a large yard behind a home located in a relatively remote area. Unfortunately, when he disembarked from the plane, he was attacked and injured by two large dogs kept by the homeowner to discourage trespassers. The homeowner, who had seen the plane land, had ordered the dogs to attack. Several months earlier, the homeowner had posted large signs around the perimeter of the yard warning of the dogs. Does the pilot have a viable claim against the homeowner for battery?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner had provided adequate warning.\nB. No, because the pilot was a trespasser.\nC. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n"

Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\n\nThe privilege of necessity allows an individual to enter another person's property without permission if it is necessary to avoid imminent harm or danger. In this case, the pilot was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble, which qualifies as an emergency situation. Therefore, the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity to justify his entry onto the homeowner's property, despite the warning signs. This would likely provide a defense against any claim that the homeowner might assert based on trespassing."
