The first major migration to Canada was French settlers who established New France.\n\nB. Canada's second major migration stream originated in the British Isles.\n- This is also correct. After the French, many immigrants came from the British Isles, particularly after the American Revolution.\n\nC. Canada's third major migration stream came from Latin America.\n- This is likely incorrect. While there have been migrations from Latin America to Canada, it is not historically recognized as one of the primary or early major migration streams. Major migrations to Canada after the British Isles include those from other European countries, Asia, and Africa.\n\nD. The first major migration wave to the United States originated in Europe.\n- This is correct. The first major migration wave to what would become the United States was primarily from Europe, including the British, Dutch, and others.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\nC. Canada's third major migration stream came from Latin America."
