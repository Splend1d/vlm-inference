                    "text": "To determine how much more electrical energy the United States would need to generate if everyone drove electric cars, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Current Energy Consumption for Transportation**: The U.S. transportation sector currently consumes a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of gasoline and diesel.\n\n2. **Energy Efficiency of Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: EVs are generally more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This means that less energy is required per mile traveled with an EV compared to an ICEV.\n\n3. **Total Miles Driven**: The total number of miles driven annually by all vehicles in the U.S. needs to be considered.\n\n4. **Energy Conversion Efficiency**: The efficiency of converting electricity into usable energy in EVs also plays a role.\n\nLet's break down the calculation step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Estimate Current Energy Consumption for Transportation\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), as of 2021:\n- The U.S. transportation sector consumed approximately 14 million barrels of oil per day.\n- Each barrel of oil contains about 5.8 million BTUs (British Thermal Units).\n\nConverting this to joules:\n\\[ 14 \\text{ million barrels/day} \\times 5.8 \\text{ million BTU/barrel} \\times 1055 \\text{ J/BTU} = 8.6 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ J/day} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Annual Energy Consumption\n\nAssuming 365 days in a year:\n\\[ 8.6 \\times 10^{17} \\text{ J/day} \\times 365 \\text{ days/year} = 3.1 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Efficiency Comparison\n\nEVs are typically around 3 times more efficient than ICEVs. Therefore, the energy required to travel the same distance in an EV is roughly one-third of what it would be in an ICEV.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Required Electrical Energy\n\nIf everyone switched to EVs, the annual energy consumption would be:\n\\[ \\frac{3.1 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year}}{3} = 1.03 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Additional Electrical Energy Needed\n\nCurrently, the U.S. generates about \\( 1 \\times 10^{20} \\) J/year of electrical energy. If everyone switched to EVs, the additional electrical energy needed would be:\n\\[ 1.03 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year} - 1 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year} = 0.03 \\times 10^{20} \\text{ J/year} \\]\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\\[ 3 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ J/year} \\]\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. \\( 2 \\times 10^{19} \\) J\nB. \\( 2 \\times 10^{21} \\) J\nC. \\( 2 \\times 10^{23} \\) J\nD. \\( 2 \\times 10^{25} \\) J\n\nThe closest option to \\( 3 \\times 10^{18} \\) J is:\nA. \\( 2 \\times 10^{19} \\) J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. \\( 2 \\times 10^{19} \\) J**"
