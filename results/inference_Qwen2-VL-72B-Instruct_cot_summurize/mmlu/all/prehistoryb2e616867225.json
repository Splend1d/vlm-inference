As humans began to store grains and other foodstuffs, rodents such as mice and rats became more prevalent. Cats, being natural predators of these pests, were attracted to human settlements where they could find ample food sources. Over time, this interaction led to the domestication of cats as they became more accustomed to living near humans and providing pest control services."
