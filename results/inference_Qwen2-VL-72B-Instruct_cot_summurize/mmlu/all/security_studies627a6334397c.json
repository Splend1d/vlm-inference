Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\nB. Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\nC. Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\nD. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n"

It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n\nHistorical materialism, a theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, posits that the material conditions of society, particularly its mode of production, shape social, political, and ideological structures. This perspective has often been aligned with critiques of capitalism and imperialism, making it relevant to the global justice movement, which seeks to address inequalities and injustices arising from global economic systems. The Occupy protests, among other movements, have drawn upon historical materialist ideas to challenge neoliberal policies and advocate for more equitable social and economic arrangements."
