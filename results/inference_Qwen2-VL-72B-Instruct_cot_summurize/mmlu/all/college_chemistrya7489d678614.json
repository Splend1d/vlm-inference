                    "text": "To determine which reaction is most likely to occur based on oxidation-reduction (redox) potential, we need to consider the standard reduction potentials of the elements involved. The standard reduction potential indicates the tendency of an element to gain electrons and be reduced. A higher reduction potential means that the substance is more likely to be reduced.\n\nHere are the standard reduction potentials for some common metals:\n\n- Sodium (Na): -2.71 V\n- Aluminum (Al): -1.66 V\n- Zinc (Zn): -0.76 V\n- Silver (Ag): +0.80 V\n- Lead (Pb): -0.13 V\n- Calcium (Ca): -2.87 V\n- Lithium (Li): -3.04 V\n\nNow let's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq)\n- Reduction: Na+ \u2192 Na (E\u00b0 = -2.71 V)\n- Oxidation: Al \u2192 Al3+ (E\u00b0 = -1.66 V)\n- Since Na has a lower reduction potential than Al, this reaction is not favorable.\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\n- Reduction: Ag+ \u2192 Ag (E\u00b0 = +0.80 V)\n- Oxidation: Zn \u2192 Zn2+ (E\u00b0 = -0.76 V)\n- Since Ag has a higher reduction potential than Zn, this reaction is favorable.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n- Reduction: Ca2+ \u2192 Ca (E\u00b0 = -2.87 V)\n- Oxidation: Pb \u2192 Pb2+ (E\u00b0 = -0.13 V)\n- Since Ca has a lower reduction potential than Pb, this reaction is not favorable.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq)\n- Reduction: Li+ \u2192 Li (E\u00b0 = -3.04 V)\n- Oxidation: Pb \u2192 Pb2+ (E\u00b0 = -0.13 V)\n- Since Li has a lower reduction potential than Pb, this reaction is not favorable.\n\nBased on the analysis, the reaction that is most likely to occur is:\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)"
