According to Stoicism, what happens outside of our control (such as the death of loved ones) should not disturb our peace of mind. Instead, we should focus on our own virtue and reactions to such events. Therefore, Epictetus would argue that a virtuous man should remain undisturbed by the loss of his wife and children, understanding that such events are beyond his control and focusing on what he can control\u2014his own thoughts and actions."
