This process is more likely to occur between genes that are located farther apart on the same chromosome. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Gene 1 is located on chromosome A; gene 2 is located far away but on the same chromosome.\n\nThis is because the farther apart two genes are on a chromosome, the higher the probability that a crossover event will occur between them during meiosis."
