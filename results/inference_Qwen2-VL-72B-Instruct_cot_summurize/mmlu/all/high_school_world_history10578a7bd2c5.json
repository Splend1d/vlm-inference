One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option based on the information provided in the passage:\n\nA. **They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.**\n   - The passage mentions that \"ten horses\" stand around the king's pavilion. However, there is no specific mention of the origin of these horses, so we cannot definitively conclude that they came from the Mongols.\n\nB. **The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.**\n   - The passage describes how people greet the king: \"When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads.\" This does not resemble the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow (kneeling and touching the ground with the forehead), so this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.**\n   - The passage states that \"The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.\" While it mentions adornments, there is no specific indication that these items came from India.\n\nD. **The people in his court wore silk robes.**\n   - The passage clearly states that \"All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.\" Silk is a material commonly associated with trade routes connecting Africa and Asia, particularly through the Silk Road. Therefore, this provides direct evidence of trade engagement with Asia.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate evidence that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia is:\n\n**D. The people in his court wore silk robes.**"
