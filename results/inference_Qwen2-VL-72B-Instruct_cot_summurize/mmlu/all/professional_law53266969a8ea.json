                    "text": "A farm and an orchard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the orchard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the orchard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher \u0080\u0094farmer deed nor the farmer \u0080\u0094 investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the farm. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that both the farm and the orchard abut a public highway and that ingress and egress are afforded the investor by that highway. In an appropriate action by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, she should\n\nA. lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.\nB. lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.\nC. win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.\nD. win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.\n"

Constructive notice is a legal concept that holds that a person is presumed to have knowledge of something if it is recorded in public records, even if they did not actually know about it. Since the easement was recorded, the farmer is deemed to have known about it, and therefore, the easement remains valid despite the fact that neither the deed from the rancher to the farmer nor the deed from the farmer to the investor mentioned the easement. The investor, as the current owner of the orchard, would be entitled to the benefit of the easement appurtenant to the orchard."
