Liquids tend to be miscible if they have similar intermolecular forces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. H2O (water) and CH3OH (methanol)\n- Water is highly polar due to its hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n- Methanol is also polar because it contains an -OH group that can form hydrogen bonds.\n- Both molecules have strong hydrogen bonding capabilities, making them miscible.\n\nB. C6H6 (benzene) and C5H12 (pentane)\n- Benzene is a nonpolar aromatic compound.\n- Pentane is a nonpolar alkane.\n- Both are nonpolar and have similar intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces), making them miscible.\n\nC. C10H22 (decane) and CH2CH2CH2OH (1-propanol)\n- Decane is a nonpolar alkane.\n- 1-Propanol is polar due to its -OH group.\n- The polar nature of 1-propanol and the nonpolar nature of decane make them less likely to mix well, indicating they might be immiscible or partially miscible.\n\nD. CH3CH2NH2 (ethylamine) and CH3CH2CH2OH (1-butanol)\n- Ethylamine is polar due to the presence of the amine group (-NH2).\n- 1-Butanol is also polar due to its -OH group.\n- Both molecules have polar groups that can form hydrogen bonds, making them miscible.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pair of liquids most likely to be immiscible is:\n\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH"
