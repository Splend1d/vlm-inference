Innate immunity is the first line of defense and does not rely on memory or specificity, whereas adaptive immunity involves memory and specificity.\n\nB. **Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity.**\n   - This statement is correct. Adaptive immunity takes longer to activate compared to innate immunity because it involves the recognition of specific antigens and the activation of B and T lymphocytes.\n\nC. **Innate immunity activates a humoral response.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Innate immunity does not activate a humoral response; rather, it relies on physical barriers, inflammation, and nonspecific immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils. The humoral response is part of the adaptive immune system, involving antibodies produced by B cells.\n\nD. **Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells.**\n   - This statement is correct. Dendritic cells are indeed antigen-presenting cells that play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response by presenting antigens to T cells.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct is:\n\n**C. Innate immunity activates a humoral response.**"
