We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe sentiments expressed in the excerpt above about political parties are most similar to those expressed by\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which historical figure's sentiments align most closely with those expressed in the Populist Party Platform of 1892, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **George McGovern, Democratic Party, 1972**: McGovern was known for his liberal policies and opposition to the Vietnam War. His platform focused heavily on social issues and anti-war sentiments, which does not directly align with the Populist Party's focus on economic grievances and corruption within political parties.\n\nB. **Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912**: Roosevelt ran as a Progressive, advocating for reforms against big business and monopolies. While he did criticize corruption and advocated for the \"common man,\" his platform was more focused on regulatory reforms rather than the outright condemnation of both major political parties as seen in the Populist Party Platform.\n\nC. **Andrew Jackson, Democratic Party, 1829**: Jackson was known for his populist appeal and his efforts to democratize politics by expanding suffrage. However, he was part of the Democratic Party and did not express the same level of disdain for both major political parties as the Populist Party did.\n\nD. **H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996**: Perot ran as an independent candidate and later formed the Reform Party. He criticized the major political parties for being corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of the American people, much like the Populist Party did in 1892. His platform emphasized fiscal responsibility and reducing the influence of special interests, which aligns well with the Populist Party's critique of political corruption and the need for reform.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiments expressed in the Populist Party Platform of 1892 are most similar to those expressed by:\n\n**D. H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996**"
