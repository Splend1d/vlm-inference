Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Tax Increase (A and D):**\n   - **Fiscal Policy:** Increasing taxes typically reduces disposable income, leading to decreased consumer spending.\n   - **Loanable Funds Market:** Higher taxes reduce the amount of disposable income available for savings, potentially decreasing the supply of loanable funds.\n   - **Interest Rate:** With less supply of loanable funds, interest rates might rise as lenders demand higher returns for their reduced savings.\n   - **Market for U.S. Dollar:** Higher taxes could lead to lower economic growth, potentially reducing demand for the U.S. dollar.\n\n2. **Tax Cut (B and C):**\n   - **Fiscal Policy:** Cutting taxes increases disposable income, stimulating consumer spending and investment.\n   - **Loanable Funds Market:** Lower taxes can increase disposable income, potentially increasing the supply of loanable funds if more is saved.\n   - **Interest Rate:** Increased supply of loanable funds could lead to lower interest rates as there is more money available for lending.\n   - **Market for U.S. Dollar:** Increased economic activity due to tax cuts could boost demand for the U.S. dollar.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A:** Tax increase, Demand rises, Falling, Demand falls\n  - This option suggests that a tax increase leads to increased demand in the loanable funds market, falling interest rates, and decreased demand for the U.S. dollar. This doesn't align well with the typical effects of a tax increase.\n\n- **Option B:** Tax cut, Supply rises, rising, Demand rises\n  - This option suggests that a tax cut increases the supply of loanable funds, leads to rising interest rates, and increases demand for the U.S. dollar. The rising interest rates part seems counterintuitive given an increase in supply.\n\n- **Option C:** Tax cut, Demand rises, rising, Demand rises\n  - This option suggests that a tax cut increases demand in the loanable funds market, leads to rising interest rates, and increases demand for the U.S. dollar. The rising interest rates part again seems counterintuitive given an increase in demand.\n\n- **Option D:** Tax increase, Supply falls, Falling, Demand rises\n  - This option suggests that a tax increase decreases the supply of loanable funds, leads to falling interest rates, and increases demand for the U.S. dollar. The falling interest rates part doesn't align well with a decrease in supply.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most logical choice considering the need to stimulate the economy during a recessionary gap and manage the budget deficit is **Option B**: Tax cut, Supply rises, rising, Demand rises. This option correctly identifies that a tax cut can increase the supply of loanable funds, although it incorrectly predicts rising interest rates. However, given the context and the other options, this is the closest fit."
