To be effective, they need materials with:\n\nA. High thermal conductivity: This allows the heat to move quickly through the material and away from the component it is cooling.\n\nB. Large surface area: A larger surface area increases the amount of heat that can be dissipated into the surrounding air.\n\nC. High melting point: This ensures that the material can withstand the high temperatures without degrading or melting.\n\nTherefore, all of these properties are important for an effective heat sink."
