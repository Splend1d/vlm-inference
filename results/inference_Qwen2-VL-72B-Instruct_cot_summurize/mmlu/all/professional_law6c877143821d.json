It provides a connection between the defendant and the nickname \"Speed,\" which was mentioned by the victim during their testimony. This connection can help establish that the defendant might have been one of the kidnappers. While the testimony involves hearsay (statements made by others), it can still be admissible if it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as being offered for a purpose other than proving the truth of the matter asserted (in this case, to show the defendant's identity)."
