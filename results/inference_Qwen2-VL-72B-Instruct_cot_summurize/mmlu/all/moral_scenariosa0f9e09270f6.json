Consuming human body parts without consent is considered cannibalism, which is illegal and morally reprehensible.\n- Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"I screamed to the baby as it slept peacefully.\"**\n- This statement suggests that the person screamed at a sleeping baby. While this might be disruptive or potentially distressing to the baby, it does not necessarily involve physical harm or severe emotional distress.\n- However, screaming at a baby could be seen as inappropriate behavior and potentially harmful to the baby's well-being. It may not be as severe as eating someone's fingers, but it still represents a lapse in judgment and consideration for the baby's comfort.\n- Therefore, this scenario can also be considered morally wrong, though perhaps less egregiously so compared to Scenario 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
