It was developed in the 1940s and 1950s by psychologists such as Kurt Lewin and Ronald Lippitt. The term \"T-group\" stands for \"training group.\"\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. A group whose aim is transformational change - This is somewhat accurate, as T-group training aims to facilitate personal and interpersonal transformation.\n\nB. A group brought together to deliver training programmes - This is not entirely accurate, as T-group training is more about the participants' experiences and interactions rather than delivering specific training programs.\n\nC. Team training for the purposes of advancing technology - This is incorrect, as T-group training is not focused on technological advancement but rather on personal and interpersonal development.\n\nD. Team building activities involving learning - This is partially correct, as T-group training does involve team building and learning through interaction, but it is more focused on personal growth and understanding group dynamics.\n\nThe most accurate answer would be a combination of A and D, but since we have to choose one, **A. A group whose aim is transformational change** is the closest to the essence of T-group training."
