It grants Congress the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers that Congress has been delegated.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The Supreme Court allowing a lower court ruling to stand by refusing to hear an appeal does not involve Congress or the use of legislative powers. This action pertains to the judicial branch.\n\nB. A congressional committee preventing the full chamber from voting on legislation by delaying its report involves the legislative process but does not directly relate to the use of the elastic clause. It is more about procedural tactics within Congress.\n\nC. Congress passing legislation establishing a national speed limit could be seen as an exercise of the elastic clause because it involves creating a law that is necessary and proper for regulating interstate commerce, which is an enumerated power of Congress.\n\nD. A member of the House of Representatives introducing a bill to increase federal income tax rates relates to the taxing power of Congress, which is an enumerated power, but it does not directly illustrate the use of the elastic clause.\n\nTherefore, the option that best illustrates a use of the elastic clause is:\n\nC. Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit."
