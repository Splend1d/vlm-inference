Quick response to change\n\nA hierarchical structure typically involves multiple levels of management, which can slow down decision-making and responsiveness to change. This is because decisions often need to be passed up the chain of command for approval, which can take time. In contrast, flat or decentralized structures may be better suited for quick responses to change as they involve fewer layers of management and more direct communication channels."
