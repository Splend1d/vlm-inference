He compares the nationalist sentiments of various countries (Canada, America, England, France, Germany) with the desire for Black people to have their own homeland.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A: An argument in favor of restrictions on immigration into the United States.**\n     - The passage does not discuss immigration policies or restrictions. It focuses on national identity and pride rather than immigration issues.\n   \n   - **Option B: An attempt to unite working-class African American and white men and women.**\n     - The passage does not mention uniting different racial groups. Instead, it focuses on the unity and pride within the Black community specifically.\n   \n   - **Option C: An expression of black nationalism.**\n     - This option aligns well with the passage. Garvey is advocating for a sense of pride and identity specific to Black people, emphasizing the need for \"Africa for the Africans,\" which is a clear expression of black nationalism.\n   \n   - **Option D: A pamphlet designed to promote the advancement of African Americans in industry.**\n     - While Garvey was involved in promoting economic self-sufficiency among Black people, this particular passage does not focus on industrial advancement but rather on national identity and pride.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate interpretation of the passage is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. an expression of black nationalism.**"
