Making a lying promise would fail this test because if everyone made lying promises, the concept of a promise itself would lose its meaning and purpose, rendering the practice of promising meaningless. Therefore, according to Kant, one cannot consistently will that everyone should make lying promises, which makes such an action morally wrong."
