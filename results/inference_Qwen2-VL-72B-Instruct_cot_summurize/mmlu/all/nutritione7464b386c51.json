Extraction of maximum value from nutrients\n\nImmediately after a meal, the most critical function of the gastrointestinal tract is to extract the maximum value from the nutrients present in the food. This involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler forms that can be absorbed by the body. The absorption of these nutrients provides the energy and building blocks necessary for various bodily functions, including growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues.\n\nWhile absorption and retention of water and electrolytes, elimination of toxins, and maintenance of barrier function are all important aspects of gastrointestinal function, they are not as immediately crucial for survival right after consuming a meal as the extraction of nutrients."
