                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of Ashford's argument:\n\nA. **Abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament**:\n   - This option suggests completely ignoring or neglecting the needs of those in extreme poverty. Given that Ashford is arguing against concerns about causing dependency on aid agencies, it implies that he believes aid should continue despite these concerns. Therefore, abandoning the poor would contradict his stance.\n\nB. **Legally abolish aid agencies**:\n   - This option suggests eliminating aid agencies altogether. Since Ashford argues against the worry of causing dependency, abolishing aid agencies would be counterproductive to his argument, as it would remove the very entities providing aid.\n\nC. **Adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice**:\n   - This option involves adopting a different philosophical framework (social contract theory) to address global economic justice issues. While this might be an alternative approach, it doesn't directly relate to the specific concern about dependency on aid agencies. Thus, it doesn't directly contradict Ashford's argument.\n\nD. **Accept the view that we have no negative duties to the poor**:\n   - This option suggests denying any obligation to prevent harm to the poor. If Ashford argues for continuing aid despite dependency concerns, it implies he believes there are obligations towards the poor. Accepting no negative duties would contradict his stance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting option that aligns with Ashford's argument is:\n\n**C. Adopt a social contract approach to the problem of global economic justice.**\n\nThis option does not directly contradict Ashford's argument about continuing aid despite dependency concerns and provides an alternative perspective rather than opposing his core stance."
