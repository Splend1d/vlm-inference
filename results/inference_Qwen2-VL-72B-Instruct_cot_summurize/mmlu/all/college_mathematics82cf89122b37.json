                    "text": "To find the minimum value of the expression \\(x + 4z\\) under the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or geometric intuition.\n\nGiven the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), this represents all points inside and on the surface of a sphere centered at the origin with radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe expression \\(x + 4z\\) represents a plane in 3D space. To minimize \\(x + 4z\\), we want to find the point on or within the sphere that lies furthest in the negative direction of the normal vector of this plane, which is \\((1, 0, 4)\\). This means we're looking for the point on the sphere (or inside it) that has the smallest projection onto the vector \\((1, 0, 4)\\).\n\nThe plane \\(x + 4z = k\\) (where \\(k\\) is a constant) will intersect the sphere when \\(k\\) is minimized. The plane that is tangent to the sphere in the direction of \\((1, 0, 4)\\) will give us the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\).\n\nThe equation of the plane tangent to the sphere in the direction of \\((1, 0, 4)\\) can be found by considering the line from the origin in the direction of \\((1, 0, 4)\\) until it intersects the sphere. The distance from the origin to any point on the sphere is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so the point on the sphere in the direction of \\((1, 0, 4)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 4^2}}(1, 0, 4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}(1, 0, 4) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}, 0, \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\(x + 4z\\) at this point is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} + 4\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} + \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} = \\frac{17\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we are looking for the minimum value, not the maximum. Since we are projecting onto the vector \\((1, 0, 4)\\), the minimum value occurs in the opposite direction, i.e., at the point \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}, 0, -\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}\\), giving us:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} - 4\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} - \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} = -\\frac{17\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} = -\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nBut this calculation seems to have led us astray; we need to correct our approach to directly address the minimization problem.\n\nThe correct approach involves recognizing that the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) under the given constraint occurs when we maximize the negative of this expression, \\(-(x + 4z)\\), which aligns with finding the point on the sphere that maximizes the projection onto \\((-1, 0, -4)\\).\n\nThe maximum projection onto \\((-1, 0, -4)\\) occurs at the point on the sphere in the direction of \\((-1, 0, -4)\\), which is \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}(1, 0, 4)\\). Thus, the minimum value of \\(x + 4z\\) is obtained by evaluating \\(x + 4z\\) at this point:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} - 4\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} - \\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17}} = -\\frac{17\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{17"
