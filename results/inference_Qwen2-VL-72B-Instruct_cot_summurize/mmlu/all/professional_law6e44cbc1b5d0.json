The one party was a one-man manufacturer's independent distrubutor and the other party was an international conglomerate that manufactured construction materials for eventual delivery to new home builders. The contracting parties got into a dispute over the terms of the contract. The choice-of-law provision mandated Delaware law for all disputes. The independent distributor sued in California where most of his business on behalf of the manufacturer was conducted. The manufacturer was based in Illinois. The manufacturer argued for the application of Delaware law which was favorable to its position. Will the presiding state court have a sustainable reason for rejecting the choice-of-law provision and applying the law of the forum court?\n\nA. No, there is no basis for rejecting a choice-of-law provision in a contract.\nB. Yes, where there is no relationship between the chosen forum and the parties and where one side obtained a contract of adhesion, the court will not generally enforce the choice-of-law provision.\nC. No, one of the parties is incorporated in Delaware and that is enough for the choice-of-law provision to be strictly adhered to.\nD. Yes, the party who brings the lawsuit can designate which state's law applies regardless of the existence of a choiceof- law provision in the contract.\n"

However, the choice-of-law provision mandates Delaware law for all disputes. If there is no significant relationship between Delaware and the parties or the subject matter of the contract, and if the contract appears to be a contract of adhesion (where one party has significantly more bargaining power and imposes terms on the weaker party), the court may find reasons to reject the choice-of-law provision and apply the law of the forum court (California) instead. This is because courts often aim to ensure fairness and avoid enforcing provisions that unduly favor one party without a reasonable connection to the chosen jurisdiction."
