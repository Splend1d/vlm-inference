These guidelines often include a mandated waiting period (typically two years) after the termination of the therapeutic relationship before any romantic or sexual relationship can be considered ethically permissible. This waiting period is designed to ensure that the power dynamics and potential for exploitation inherent in the therapeutic relationship have sufficiently dissipated. Therefore, even if the therapist and client mutually agreed to terminate therapy and start dating, doing so immediately after the end of therapy would generally be considered unethical."
