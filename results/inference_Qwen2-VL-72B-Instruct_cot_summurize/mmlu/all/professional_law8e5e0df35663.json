He also knew that the tenant's actions had led to some violent confrontations in the past, including one where a gun was discharged in the hallway outside the tenant's apartment. Because the tenant regularly paid his rent on time, the owner didn't take any action to try to evict the tenant. One day, a rival drug dealer drove by the tenant's apartment and fired his gun at the tenant's front window. One of the bullets passed through the tenant's living room and went through the wall into the apartment next door. The bullet struck and injured a neighbor who occupied the adjoining apartment. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the owner to recover damages for his injury, he should\n\nA. recover, because the owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment.\nB. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities.\nC. not recover, because the owner is not liable for the criminal acts of third persons.\nD. not recover, because the neighbor is outside the zone of foreseeable danger.\n"

This knowledge indicates that the owner was aware of the potential danger posed by the tenant's actions. As a result, the owner had a duty to take reasonable steps to protect other tenants from harm. By failing to act, the owner may be held liable for the injuries sustained by the neighbor due to the foreseeable risk created by the tenant's activities. Therefore, the neighbor should be able to recover damages based on the owner's awareness of the danger and failure to address it."
