This is an important formal characteristic because it affects how the artwork is perceived and understood by the viewer. While social meaning, faithful representation, and the power to evoke strong emotions are also significant aspects of art, they are not strictly formal characteristics. Formal characteristics pertain to the structure and composition of the artwork itself."
