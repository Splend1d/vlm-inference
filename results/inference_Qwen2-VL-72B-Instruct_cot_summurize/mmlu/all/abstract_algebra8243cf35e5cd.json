According to the classification of groups of order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime number, there are only two possible structures for such groups:\n1. The cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}\\).\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\(p\\), denoted as \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p\\).\n\nBoth of these structures are Abelian groups. Therefore, every group of order \\(p^2\\) is indeed Abelian.\n\n### Statement 2: For a fixed prime \\(p\\), a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nThis statement is also true. According to Sylow's Theorems, specifically the third theorem, all Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of a group \\(G\\) are conjugate to each other. If there is only one Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup, then it must be invariant under conjugation by any element of \\(G\\), which means it is a normal subgroup. Conversely, if a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup is normal, then it is the unique Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup because any other Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup would have to be conjugate to it, but since it is normal, it cannot be conjugate to another distinct subgroup.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
