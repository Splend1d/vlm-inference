Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n"

Since Sally's conviction for vehicular homicide is a felony that carries a potential sentence of more than one year, it is admissible for impeachment purposes regardless of whether she received a suspended sentence or entered a plea of nolo contendere."
