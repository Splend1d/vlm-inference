The largest multiple of 26 that is less than -160 is -169 (which is -7 times 26). Adding 169 to -160 gives us:\n\\[ -160 + 169 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the product \\( (20)(-8) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{26} \\) is 9.\n\nNone of the provided options (A. 0, B. 1, C. 11, D. 22) match the correct answer, which is 9.
