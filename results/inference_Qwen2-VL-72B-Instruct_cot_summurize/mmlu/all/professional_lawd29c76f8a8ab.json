He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\nB. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\nC. Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\nD. Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\n"

No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\n\nIn this scenario, the police officers had several pieces of information that contributed to their reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the man. These include:\n\n1. **High Crime Area**: The location is known for drug trafficking and gun violence, which increases the likelihood of criminal activity.\n2. **911 Call**: There was a specific report about a man fitting the description (jeans and a jacket) who was suspected of selling drugs.\n3. **Behavior**: The man's sudden change in behavior (crossing the street and walking faster when he noticed the officers) can be seen as evasive or suspicious.\n4. **Observation**: The officers noticed a heavy object bulging in his pocket, which could reasonably be interpreted as a weapon or contraband.\n\nThese factors together provide a basis for reasonable suspicion that the man may be involved in criminal activity, justifying the stop and frisk. The discovery of the unlicensed handgun during the pat-down further supports the legality of the initial stop and subsequent search. Therefore, the court is unlikely to suppress the evidence based on these circumstances."
