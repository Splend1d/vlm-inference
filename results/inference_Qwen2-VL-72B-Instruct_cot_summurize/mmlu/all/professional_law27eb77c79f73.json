The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail?\n\nA. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\nB. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction.\nC. Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\nD. Yes, because he succeeded in saving the stockbroker's life.\n"

Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\n\nIn this scenario, the stockbroker's actions placed the taxi driver in a situation where he sustained injuries while attempting to save the stockbroker. The stockbroker's decision to stand on the edge of the bridge and prepare to jump created a foreseeable risk that someone might attempt to intervene and potentially get injured in the process. Therefore, the stockbroker can be held liable for the injuries sustained by the taxi driver due to the dangerous situation he created.\n\nOption A is incorrect because intent to harm others is not necessary for liability in tort law; the foreseeability of harm is sufficient.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the fact that attempted suicide is a criminal offense does not directly affect the civil liability of the stockbroker for the injuries caused to the taxi driver.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the successful rescue does not negate the liability for creating the perilous situation in the first place."
