This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

The commerce clause.\n\nThe commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from enacting laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. In this case, the tax appears to discriminate against nonresident photographers who operate within the state, potentially creating an economic barrier that affects interstate commerce. This differential treatment based on residency could be seen as an impermissible burden on the free flow of commerce across state lines, which is protected under the commerce clause."
