Give the self-defense instruction, because the evidence was sufficient to raise the defense.\n\nIn this scenario, the father's history of being physically abused by his son while the son was under the influence of crack cocaine is relevant. The father's fear and belief that his son was under the influence and posed an imminent threat were reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the evidence presented was sufficient to raise the defense of self-defense, and the judge should instruct the jury accordingly."
