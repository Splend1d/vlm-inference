NAD+ + H+ + 2e- \u2192 NADH\n\nDuring glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which is used as an electron carrier. In fermentation, this process is reversed; NADH is oxidized back to NAD+, regenerating it for further use in glycolysis. This is crucial because fermentation allows cells to continue producing ATP in the absence of oxygen by recycling NAD+."
