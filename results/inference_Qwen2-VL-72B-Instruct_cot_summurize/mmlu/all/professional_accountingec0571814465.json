Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example.\n\nThe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) emphasizes that one of the most effective methods to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization is through leadership by example. When leaders demonstrate ethical behavior, it sets a tone at the top that can cascade down through the organization, influencing employees to follow suit. This approach is considered more effective than merely establishing rules or policies because it embodies the principles of integrity and accountability in action."
