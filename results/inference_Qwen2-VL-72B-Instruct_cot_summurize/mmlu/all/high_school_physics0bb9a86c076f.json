                    "text": "To determine the behavior of the electric field strength due to the given charge distribution, we need to consider Gauss's law. Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed within that surface.\n\nGiven the charge density \\(\\rho = ar\\), where \\(a\\) is a positive constant, we can calculate the total charge \\(Q\\) enclosed within a sphere of radius \\(r\\) (where \\(r \\leq R\\)):\n\n\\[ Q(r) = \\int_0^r 4\\pi r'^2 \\rho(r') dr' = \\int_0^r 4\\pi r'^2 (ar') dr' = 4\\pi a \\int_0^r r'^3 dr' = 4\\pi a \\left[\\frac{r'^4}{4}\\right]_0^r = \\pi a r^4 \\]\n\nNow, using Gauss's law, the electric field \\(E\\) at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of the sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ E(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q(r)}{r^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\pi a r^4}{r^2} = \\frac{a r^2}{4 \\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nThis shows that for \\(r < R\\), the electric field \\(E\\) increases non-linearly with \\(r\\).\n\nFor \\(r > R\\), the entire charge distribution is enclosed within the Gaussian surface, so the total charge \\(Q(R)\\) is:\n\n\\[ Q(R) = \\pi a R^4 \\]\n\nThe electric field outside the sphere (\\(r > R\\)) is then:\n\n\\[ E(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q(R)}{r^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{\\pi a R^4}{r^2} = \\frac{a R^4}{4 \\epsilon_0 r^2} \\]\n\nThis shows that for \\(r > R\\), the electric field decreases as \\(1/r^2\\), which is not linear.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. It increases non-linearly for \\(r < R\\)."
