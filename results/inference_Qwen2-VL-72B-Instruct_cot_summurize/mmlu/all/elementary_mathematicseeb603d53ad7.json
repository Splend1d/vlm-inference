Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim.\n3. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nLet's denote the positions as follows:\n- Let's say Kim is at position \\(K\\).\n- Hector is then at position \\(K + 2\\) (since he sits 2 seats to the right of Kim).\n- Tonya is at position \\(K + 2 + 3 = K + 5\\) (since she sits 3 seats to the right of Hector).\n\nWe need to find how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit. This can be calculated as the difference between Tonya's position and Kim's position, which is \\(|K + 5 - K|\\).\n\nSimplifying this gives us \\(|5|\\), which means Kim sits 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 5."
