The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists and even some order forms with businessperson's logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the businessperson with a third party, which the businessperson refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated. Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n"

Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nIn this scenario, the businessperson provided the assistant with materials such as cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms bearing the businessperson's logo, which can be considered as indicia of authority. Additionally, the assistant represented herself as being authorized to execute contracts on behalf of the principal. These actions suggest that the assistant had apparent authority to negotiate and enter into contracts on behalf of the principal. Therefore, the third party is likely to prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson based on the apparent authority granted to the assistant."
