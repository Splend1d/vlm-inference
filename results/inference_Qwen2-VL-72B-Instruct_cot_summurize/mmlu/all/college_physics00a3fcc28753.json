According to special relativity, when an object is moving relative to an observer, the object's length along the direction of motion appears shorter to the observer.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is given by:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the contracted length (the length measured by the observer),\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length (the length measured in the object's rest frame),\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the object relative to the observer,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given that \\( L_0 = 1.00 \\, \\text{m} \\) and \\( L = 0.80 \\, \\text{m} \\). We need to find \\( v \\).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\( v \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{L}{L_0} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\left( \\frac{L}{L_0} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\left( \\frac{0.80}{1.00} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.64 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{0.36} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 0.60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the observer must move at a speed of \\( 0.60c \\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.60c."
