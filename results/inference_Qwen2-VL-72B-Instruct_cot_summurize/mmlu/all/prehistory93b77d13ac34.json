Other food sources might also have been present.\n\nB. **a much colder climate during that time.**\n   - Caribou typically inhabit colder regions. The presence of caribou bones suggests that the climate was likely cold enough to support these animals, which are adapted to such environments.\n\nC. **that caribou were imported into the United States from Canada.**\n   - There is no evidence or historical context suggesting that caribou were transported over long distances by humans 10,000 years ago. It is more likely that they migrated naturally within their habitat range.\n\nD. **that the people who lived at this site had high cholesterol.**\n   - This conclusion cannot be drawn solely from the presence of caribou bones. Cholesterol levels would depend on various factors including diet, genetics, and lifestyle, none of which can be inferred directly from the presence of animal bones.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable implication is:\n\n**B. a much colder climate during that time.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that caribou are adapted to cold climates, and their presence indicates that the environment was suitable for them, which implies a colder climate."
