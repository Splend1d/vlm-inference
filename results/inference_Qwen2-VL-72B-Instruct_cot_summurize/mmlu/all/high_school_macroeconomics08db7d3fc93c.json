Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.\n\nWhen an economy is operating beyond full employment, it means that the actual output exceeds the potential output. At this point, the economy is likely experiencing capacity constraints and high levels of resource utilization. As a result:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is typically upward sloping, not horizontal, even when the economy is beyond full employment.\n- Option B is incorrect because further increases in aggregate demand would likely lead to higher prices rather than lower ones due to the limited capacity to produce more goods and services.\n- Option C is partially correct but not the best answer because while a decrease in aggregate demand might reduce the price level if prices are sticky, it does not directly address what happens with further increases in aggregate demand.\n- Option D is correct because, beyond full employment, any additional increase in aggregate demand cannot be met by increased production due to capacity constraints. Instead, it leads to higher prices (inflation) without reducing the unemployment rate, which is already at or below its natural rate."
