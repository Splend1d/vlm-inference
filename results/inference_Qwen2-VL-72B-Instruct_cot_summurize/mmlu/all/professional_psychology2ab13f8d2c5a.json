Many studies and real-world implementations suggest that a four-day workweek often leads to improved employee satisfaction and potentially higher productivity due to increased focus and reduced burnout during the workdays. However, there might be initial adjustments and potential long-term considerations that could influence outcomes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most balanced and supported conclusion would be:\n\n**A. long-lasting positive effects on attitudes and productivity.**\n\nThis option aligns with the general findings that a four-day workweek tends to have sustained positive impacts on both employee attitudes and productivity."
