Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\n\nA. A decline in the appeal of religions of salvation\nB. A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean\nC. An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household\nD. A decline in the rights of women\n"

The passage focuses on political and military factors rather than religious trends.\n\nB. **A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean**: While this could be a consequence of the decline of these empires, it is more related to broader economic shifts and technological advancements rather than a direct result of the decline itself.\n\nC. **An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household**: This is plausible because during periods of social and political instability, traditional family structures often become more rigid and patriarchal as a means of maintaining order and stability.\n\nD. **A decline in the rights of women**: This is also plausible because during times of societal upheaval and decline, women's rights and freedoms can be curtailed as societies revert to more conservative norms.\n\nGiven the context of the passage and historical knowledge, both options C and D are plausible. However, option C is more directly related to the general trend of reinforcing traditional family structures during times of societal decline.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household**"
