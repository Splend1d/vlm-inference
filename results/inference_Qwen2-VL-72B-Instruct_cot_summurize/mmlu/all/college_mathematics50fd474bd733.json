We know \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, but without further manipulation, it's not clear how this relates to \\(4x + 6y\\). Let's move on to the next options.\n\nB. \\(x + y + 5\\)\n\nThere's no direct way to manipulate \\(3x + 7y\\) to relate it to \\(x + y + 5\\), so we'll skip this for now and come back if needed.\n\nC. \\(9x + 4y\\)\n\nAgain, there's no straightforward way to manipulate \\(3x + 7y\\) to relate it directly to \\(9x + 4y\\), so we'll skip this for now as well.\n\nD. \\(4x - 9y\\)\n\nLet's see if we can manipulate \\(3x + 7y\\) to relate it to \\(4x - 9y\\):\n\nGiven \\(3x + 7y \\equiv 0 \\mod 11\\), we want to see if \\(4x - 9y\\) is also divisible by 11.\n\nNotice that \\(4x - 9y = 4x + (-9y)\\). We can try to express this in terms of \\(3x + 7y\\).\n\nHowever, a more direct approach might be to look for a linear combination of \\(3x + 7y\\) that gives us something close to \\(4x - 9y\\).\n\nMultiplying \\(3x + 7y\\) by 4 gives us \\(12x + 28y\\), which is close to \\(4x - 9y\\) if we could subtract a multiple of \\(3x + 7y\\) from it to get rid of the \\(+28y\\) term and adjust the \\(x\\) coefficient.\n\nIndeed, multiplying \\(3x + 7y\\) by 3 gives us \\(9x + 21y\\), and subtracting this from \\(12x + 28y\\) gives:\n\n\\[12x + 28y - (9x + 21y) = 3x + 7y\\]\n\nBut we're looking for \\(4x - 9y\\), not \\(3x + 7y\\). Let's correct our approach:\n\nWe want to find a way to manipulate \\(3x + 7y\\) to get to \\(4x - 9y\\). Notice that if we add \\(3x + 7y\\) to itself, we get \\(6x + 14y\\), which simplifies to \\(6x + 3y\\) since \\(14 \\equiv 3 \\mod 11\\).\n\nNow, let's try to get closer to \\(4x - 9y\\):\n\nIf we subtract \\(3x + 7y\\) from \\(6x + 3y\\), we get:\n\n\\[6x + 3y - (3x + 7y) = 3x - 4y\\]\n\nThis isn't quite what we want, but it shows we're on the right track of manipulating expressions involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nInstead, let's try to directly manipulate \\(3x + 7y\\) to get to \\(4x - 9y\\):\n\nWe can try to express \\(4x - 9y\\) in terms of \\(3x + 7y\\) by finding a linear combination that works.
