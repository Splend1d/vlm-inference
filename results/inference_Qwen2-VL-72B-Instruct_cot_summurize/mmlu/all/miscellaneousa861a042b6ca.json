Elasticity of demand refers to how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. Goods with more elastic demand tend to have readily available substitutes or are not necessities.\n\n- Water, bread, and salt are considered necessities with few close substitutes, so their demand tends to be inelastic (less responsive to price changes).\n- Pork, on the other hand, has several substitutes such as beef, chicken, fish, and vegetarian options, making its demand more elastic. Consumers can relatively easily switch to these alternatives if the price of pork increases."
