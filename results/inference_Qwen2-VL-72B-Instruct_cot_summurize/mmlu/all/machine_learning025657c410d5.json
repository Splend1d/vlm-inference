It consists of two steps:\n1. **Expectation (E-step):** Compute the expected value of the log-likelihood function with respect to the current estimate of the parameters.\n2. **Maximization (M-step):** Find parameters which maximize the expected log-likelihood found on the E-step.\n\nThe key property of the EM algorithm is that it guarantees that the log-likelihood of the data increases (or at least does not decrease) with each iteration. This is because the EM algorithm is designed to iteratively improve the estimate of the parameters until convergence.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\nQ-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique. It does not require any prior knowledge about the environment; instead, it learns the optimal policy by interacting with the environment and updating its Q-values based on the observed rewards. The key advantage of Q-learning is precisely that it can learn without needing to know the transition probabilities or reward functions of the environment.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
