Examples include:\n   - Relative size: Objects appear smaller as they move further away.\n   - Linear perspective: Parallel lines appear to converge at a distance.\n   - Texture gradient: The texture of surfaces appears finer as they recede into the distance.\n   - Light and shadow: Shadows and lighting can provide information about depth.\n   - Motion parallax: Objects closer to the viewer move faster than those further away when the observer moves.\n\n2. **Binocular Cues**: These require both eyes and involve the comparison of images from each eye. Examples include:\n   - Stereopsis: The brain combines slightly different images from each eye to create a sense of depth.\n   - Convergence: The eyes turn inward as they focus on nearby objects.\n\nGiven that Abdul has lost sight in his right eye, he cannot use binocular cues (II). However, he can still utilize monocular cues (I).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. I only**"
