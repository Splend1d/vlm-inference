All of the above.\n\nEnsuring informed consent can be challenging for several reasons:\n\nA. **Practicality**: It may not be feasible to provide every participant with all the information about the study due to complexity or the sheer volume of details involved.\n\nB. **Desirability**: In some cases, withholding certain pieces of information (like the exact duration of an interview) might be necessary to avoid influencing the participant's behavior or to maintain the integrity of the research.\n\nC. **Behavioral Impact**: Participants might alter their behavior if they know precisely what the researcher intends to study, which could affect the validity and reliability of the research findings.\n\nTherefore, all these factors contribute to making it \"easier said than done\" to fully adhere to the principle of informed consent in research settings."
