The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\nB. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\nC. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\nD. Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.\n"
