A white woman\n\nAccording to various studies and statistical data, women generally have a longer life expectancy than men, and among racial groups in the United States, white individuals tend to have a slightly higher life expectancy compared to black individuals. Therefore, all other things being equal, a white woman is statistically likely to live the longest. However, it's important to note that individual health outcomes can vary widely based on many factors including genetics, lifestyle, access to healthcare, and environmental conditions."
