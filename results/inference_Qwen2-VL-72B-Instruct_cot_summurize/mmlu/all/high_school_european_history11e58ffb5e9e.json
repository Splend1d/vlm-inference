Instead, it implies acceptance and utility.\n\nC. **In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.**\n   - This contradicts the quote, which speaks of various modes of worship, indicating diversity rather than homogeneity.\n\nD. **In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.**\n   - While Christianity did eventually have a significant impact, the quote does not specifically address this historical development.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate summary of Gibbon's interpretation is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.**"
