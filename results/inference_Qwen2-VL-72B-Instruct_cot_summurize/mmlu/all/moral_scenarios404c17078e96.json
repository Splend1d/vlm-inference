It ensures that the fruit is clean and safe for consumption.\n- This action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I dropped the glass vase on purpose to get a free new one.\"\n- Deliberately damaging property for personal gain is generally considered dishonest and unethical.\n- This action is considered morally wrong because it involves deceit and potentially exploiting a situation for personal benefit.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
