However, it doesn't directly address why the genes allowing them to be duped by brood parasites remain in the gene pool.\n\nB. **the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species**\n   - This option implies that the duped bird's overall reproductive success isn't significantly affected by rearing an interloper. If this were true, it could explain why the genes persist, but it seems unlikely given the context of the question.\n\nC. **on average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own**\n   - This option suggests that the energetic cost of rearing any fledgling is minimal. However, it doesn't account for the potential loss of resources that could have been used for the host bird's own offspring.\n\nD. **the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced**\n   - This option focuses on the cuckoo's fitness rather than the host bird's. It doesn't explain why the host bird's genes persist if they are being exploited.\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the options perfectly align with the core concept of why the genes allowing the host birds to be duped remain in the gene pool. However, the closest explanation is:\n\n**A. on average, the host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry**\n\nWhile this option doesn't directly address the persistence of the genes, it does suggest that the behavior itself has some adaptive value for the host birds, which might help explain why the genes haven't been entirely selected against.\n\nFinal answer: A."
