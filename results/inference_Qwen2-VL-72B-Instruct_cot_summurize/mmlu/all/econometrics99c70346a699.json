The GARCH-M parameter captures the effect of volatility on expected returns.\n\nIn financial markets, it is generally observed that higher volatility leads to lower expected returns due to the risk aversion of investors. This relationship is often referred to as the \"leverage effect\" or \"volatility-return trade-off.\" Therefore, we would typically expect the GARCH-in-mean parameter to have a negative sign, indicating that an increase in volatility leads to a decrease in expected returns.\n\nGiven this context, the most reasonable expectation for the value of the GARCH-in-mean parameter estimate would be:\n\nB. Between -1 and 0\n\nThis range suggests a negative but not excessively large impact of volatility on expected returns, which aligns with empirical findings in financial econometrics."
