So, closure holds.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative by definition.\n   - \\( (AB)C = A(BC) \\) for all matrices \\( A, B, C \\).\n\n3. **Identity Element**: The identity matrix \\( I \\) has determinant 1 and is in the set.\n   - \\( AI = IA = A \\) for any matrix \\( A \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Elements**: For every matrix \\( A \\) in the set, there exists an inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\) such that \\( AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I \\).\n   - Since \\( \\det(A) \\neq 0 \\), \\( A \\) is invertible and its inverse \\( A^{-1} \\) will also have a nonzero determinant.\n\nSince all group properties hold, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n1. **Closure**: For any two matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) in this set, their product \\( AB \\) must also have determinant 1.\n   - If \\( \\det(A) = 1 \\) and \\( \\det(B) = 1 \\), then \\( \\det(AB) = \\det(A)\\det(B) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\).
