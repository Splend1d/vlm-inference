This situation is most commonly associated with monopoly markets, where a single seller can set prices above marginal costs, leading to a reduction in consumer surplus and producer surplus, resulting in deadweight loss. While inefficiencies can occur in other market structures like monopolistic competition and oligopoly, the classic example and most straightforward case of deadweight loss due to P > MC is in monopoly markets."
