Changing tariffs and quotas on imported goods\n\nThe Federal Reserve's monetary tools primarily involve managing the money supply within the United States to achieve its economic goals, such as price stability, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates. These tools include:\n\n- Open market operations (buying or selling Treasury securities)\n- Adjusting the reserve ratio (the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserve)\n- Changing the discount rate (the interest rate at which banks can borrow from the Fed)\n\nChanging tariffs and quotas on imported goods is a fiscal policy tool used by the government, not a monetary policy tool used by the Federal Reserve."
