                    "text": "To determine which situation can be represented by the fraction \\( \\frac{20}{8} \\), let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. How is the amount of money Leslie spent written as a fraction?\n- This scenario involves converting dollars and cents into a single unit (cents) and then expressing it as a fraction. However, the fraction \\( \\frac{20}{8} \\) does not directly represent this situation because it doesn't account for the conversion from dollars to cents.\n\nB. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?\n- To find out how many crackers each grandchild got, you would divide the total number of crackers (20) by the number of grandchildren (8). This results in the fraction \\( \\frac{20}{8} \\).\n\nC. Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers at a plant store. Each container had 8 flowers in it. How many flowers did Mitch buy?\n- To find the total number of flowers, you multiply the number of containers (20) by the number of flowers per container (8). This results in a multiplication problem, not a fraction.\n\nD. Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. How many booklets of stamps did Donna use to send her invitations?\n- To find out how many booklets Donna used, you would divide the total number of stamps she used (8) by the number of stamps per booklet (20). This results in the fraction \\( \\frac{8}{20} \\), not \\( \\frac{20}{8} \\).\n\nTherefore, the situation that can be represented by the fraction \\( \\frac{20}{8} \\) is:\n\nB. Mr. Kramer\u2019s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. How many crackers did each grandchild get?"
