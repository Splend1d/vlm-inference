Start from the rightmost bit (least significant bit).\n2. Increment the rightmost bit by 1.\n3. If the bit becomes 2 (which is not possible in binary), carry over 1 to the next bit and set the current bit to 0.\n4. Repeat this process until there is no carry left or all bits have been processed.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step incrementation:\n\nStarting binary number: 1001 0011\n\n1. Increment the rightmost bit:\n   - 1 + 1 = 10 (in binary)\n   - Carry 1 to the next bit, set the current bit to 0\n   - New number: 1001 0100\n\nSince there are no more carries, the incremented binary number is 1001 0100.\n\nTherefore, the binary number that will be assigned to the next student who enrolls is:\n\nA. 1001 0100"
