This action decreases the money supply because banks have less money to lend out.\n\nGiven a reserve requirement of 10%, for every dollar of reserves that banks lose, they must reduce their loans by $10 (since they need to maintain a 10% reserve ratio on deposits). Therefore, if the FED sells $29 million worth of government securities, banks will lose $29 million in reserves and must reduce their loans by $290 million ($29 million * 10).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. decrease by $290 million."
