Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is central to his theory of law, particularly in his work \"The Concept of Law.\" According to Hart, 'being obliged' refers to the external aspect of a rule, where individuals are compelled by others or by the threat of sanctions to act in certain ways. On the other hand, 'having an obligation' refers to the internal aspect of a rule, where individuals recognize the rule as valid and feel bound by it, even in the absence of external enforcement. This distinction helps to clarify how legal rules can have authority and be followed voluntarily, rather than merely being enforced through coercion."
