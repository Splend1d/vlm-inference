It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?\n\nA. Military campaigns\nB. Meteorological phenomena\nC. Competition with European trade networks\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n"

The presence of highly developed port cities\n\nThe passage describes 'Aden as a bustling port city with significant trade activity involving merchants from various regions such as India and Egypt. The wealth and economic activities of the merchants, along with the strategic location of the city, suggest that the development of the economic system was directly influenced by the presence of highly developed port cities."
