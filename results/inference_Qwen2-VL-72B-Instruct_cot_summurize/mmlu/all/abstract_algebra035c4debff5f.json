We want to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that there exists a polynomial \\(f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0\\) with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(f(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = 0\\).\n\nFirst, square both sides:\n\\[ x^2 = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{6} + 3 = 5 + 2\\sqrt{6}. \\]\n\nThen, isolate the radical term:\n\\[ x^2 - 5 = 2\\sqrt{6}, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{x^2 - 5}{2} = \\sqrt{6}. \\]\n\nSquare again to eliminate the remaining radical:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{x^2 - 5}{2}\\right)^2 = 6, \\]\n\\[ \\frac{(x^2 - 5)^2}{4} = 6, \\]\n\\[ (x^2 - 5)^2 = 24, \\]\n\\[ x^4 - 10x^2 + 25 = 24, \\]\n\\[ x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0. \\]\n\nWe have found a polynomial \\(f(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\\) with rational coefficients such that \\(f(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) = 0\\). To show that this is the minimal polynomial, we need to verify that it is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\\) has no rational roots because it does not factor into linear terms with rational coefficients. Moreover, it cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients because its discriminant is negative. Therefore, \\(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\\) is indeed irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nThus, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4."
