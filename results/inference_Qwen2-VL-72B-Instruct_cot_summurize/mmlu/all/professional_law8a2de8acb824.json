In an action by the employee's widow against the hotel to recover the sum of $5,000, which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument against enforcement of the certificate agreement?\n\nA. The widow was unaware of the certificate agreement until after the employee died.\nB. There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel.\nC. The widowin no way relied on the hotel's promise to pay the $5,000.\nD. There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n"

There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n\nIn contract law, consideration refers to something of value that is exchanged between parties to form a binding agreement. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration from both sides. In this case, the certificate appears to be a gratuitous promise by the hotel to pay $5,000 upon the employee's death, provided he was still employed at the time of his death. If there was no additional consideration given by the employee (such as extra work or a change in job duties) in exchange for this promise, the agreement might be considered lacking in consideration, making it unenforceable.\n\nOptions A, B, and C relate to the widow's awareness and reliance on the promise but do not directly address the fundamental requirement of consideration in forming a legally binding contract."
