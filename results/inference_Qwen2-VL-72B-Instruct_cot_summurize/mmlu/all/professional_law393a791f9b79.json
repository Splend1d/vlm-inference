Under the relevant state statute, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of one year in jail and/or a fine of $500. At trial, the defendant pleaded not guilty and requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him. The trial judge refused to honor the defendant's request for an attorney. If the defendant is subsequently found guilty, which of the following is the most severe sentence that can constitutionally be imposed?\n\nA. A $500 fine.\nB. Six months in jail.\nC. One year in jail.\nD. No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n"

No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n\nUnder the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, a defendant has the right to legal representation if they cannot afford an attorney. This right applies to criminal cases where the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment. In this scenario, since the defendant is facing a potential sentence of up to one year in jail, he is entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent him. The trial judge's refusal to appoint an attorney violates the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nTherefore, any conviction or sentence resulting from a trial where the defendant was denied the right to counsel would be unconstitutional. Consequently, no sentence can be constitutionally imposed on the defendant under these circumstances."
