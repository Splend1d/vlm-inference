A major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party\n\nThis shift was significant because it helped to solidify the New Deal coalition, which included a diverse group of supporters such as labor unions, farmers, and minorities. The support of African American voters was particularly important because they had traditionally been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln. However, the New Deal policies of Franklin Roosevelt, such as the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, provided much-needed relief and employment opportunities for African Americans during the Great Depression. This led many African Americans to switch their allegiance to the Democratic Party, which helped to secure Roosevelt's electoral victories in the 1930s."
