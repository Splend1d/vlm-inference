Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nStatement II is also true. If \\( A^2 = A \\), then the eigenvalues of \\( A \\) must be 0 or 1. Since the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, the trace of \\( A \\) must be nonnegative.\n\nStatement III is false. The trace of the product of two matrices is not necessarily equal to the product of their traces. For example, consider the matrices\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThen\n$$AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},$$\nand\n$$\\text{tr}(AB) = 3 \\neq \\text{tr}(A) \\text{tr}(B) = 2.$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
