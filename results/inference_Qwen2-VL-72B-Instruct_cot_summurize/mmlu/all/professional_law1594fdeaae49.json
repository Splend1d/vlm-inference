Anyhow, I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses. \"At trial, the woman calls an eyewitness to the accident. The eyewitness proposes to testify that he heard the man tell the woman, \"I know I was driving fast. \" The man's attorney objects.

In this case, the man's statement, \"I know I was driving fast,\" is an admission of guilt regarding his driving behavior, which is relevant to the case. This type of statement is admissible because it is considered reliable since the person making the statement has no reason to lie about something that is detrimental to their own case."
