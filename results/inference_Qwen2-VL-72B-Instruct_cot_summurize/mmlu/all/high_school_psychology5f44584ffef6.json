Harlow's research highlighted the importance of emotional bonds and physical contact in early development.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. **The importance of physical contact and emotional bonds in early development**: Harlow's studies showed that baby monkeys preferred contact with a cloth mother over a wire mother, even when the wire mother provided food. This suggests that physical contact and emotional bonds are crucial for healthy development.\n\nII. **The potential negative effects of maternal deprivation**: Harlow's experiments demonstrated that monkeys raised without proper maternal care exhibited severe behavioral problems, indicating that maternal deprivation can have significant negative effects on development.\n\nIII. **The role of genetics in personality development**: Harlow's study did not focus on genetic factors; it concentrated on environmental influences, particularly the impact of maternal care and attachment.\n\nGiven this analysis, options I and II are directly supported by Harlow's findings, while option III is not addressed in his study.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II only"
