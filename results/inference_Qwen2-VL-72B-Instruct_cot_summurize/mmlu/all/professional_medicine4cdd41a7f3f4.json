He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\nB. Herniated nucleus pulposus\nC. Narrowing of the hip joint\nD. Osteoporosis\n"

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\nThe patient's history of glucocorticoid therapy and new onset of leg pain that worsens with weight-bearing are key factors in considering avascular necrosis of the femoral head as the most likely cause of his symptoms. Glucocorticoids can increase the risk of developing avascular necrosis, which is characterized by the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. This condition often presents with pain in the affected joint, particularly during weight-bearing activities. While the other options listed could also potentially cause leg pain, they are less likely given the patient's specific history and presentation."
