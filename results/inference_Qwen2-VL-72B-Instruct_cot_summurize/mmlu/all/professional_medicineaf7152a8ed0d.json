Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonist\nB. Cholinesterase inhibitor\nC. Dopamine agonist\nD. Prednisone\n"

Cholinesterase inhibitor\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of progressive memory loss, frequent repetition, and forgetfulness, along with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 23/30, it suggests cognitive impairment consistent with dementia. The CT scan showing mild volume loss further supports this diagnosis. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to manage symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve memory and cognitive function.\n\n\u03b2-Adrenergic agonists (option A) are typically used for conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and would not be appropriate for treating dementia.\n\nDopamine agonists (option C) are used primarily for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and while they may have some cognitive benefits, they are not first-line therapy for dementia.\n\nPrednisone (option D) is a corticosteroid used for various inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions; it does not have a role in the treatment of dementia.\n\nTherefore, the best choice for pharmacotherapy in this case is a cholinesterase inhibitor."
