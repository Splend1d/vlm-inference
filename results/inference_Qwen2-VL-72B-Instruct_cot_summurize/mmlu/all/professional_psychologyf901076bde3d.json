Practitioners believe that individuals have an inherent tendency toward self-fulfillment, but this potential can be blocked by various factors such as societal pressures, negative experiences, or lack of self-awareness. Therefore, psychopathology is often seen as a result of blocked potential rather than dis-integration, unresolved conflicts, or severe trauma, although these may also play a role in some cases."
