This is because as long as there is any positive marginal utility, the consumer will consume another cookie since it adds to their overall satisfaction without incurring a cost. Once the marginal utility reaches zero, consuming an additional cookie would no longer add to their satisfaction, and thus they would stop consuming cookies at that point."
