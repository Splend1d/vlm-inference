Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H. Clancy, Congressional Record, 68th Congress, 1st Session, 1924\nWhat best accounts for the sharp increase of immigrants during the period 1880\u20131910?\n\nA. Many Southern and Eastern Europeans turned to America for financial gain and political freedom.\nB. Irish farmers were forced to leave their homes due to agricultural disasters.\nC. Germans were seeking ways to avoid military conscription.\nD. The United States welcomed immigrants by providing housing and employment.\n"

This influx was driven by a desire for financial gain and political freedom, as many of these immigrants were fleeing civil, racial, and religious persecution in their home countries."
