                    "text": "A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, who is at 32 weeks' gestation, is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of progressive dyspnea and wheezing. She says her heart is \"racing\" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease\nB. Coarctation of the aorta\nC. Congenital aortic stenosis\nD. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation\n"

                    "text": "The most likely cause of the findings in this patient is D. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing up blood-streaked sputum, along with the physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds at the lung bases with expiratory crackles, suggest pulmonary congestion. The irregularly irregular rhythm on cardiac examination is consistent with atrial fibrillation, a common complication of mitral stenosis. The presence of a grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur at the apex with a distinct snapping sound preceding it is characteristic of mitral stenosis.\n\nMitral stenosis can lead to atrial fibrillation due to the increased pressure in the left atrium, which can cause atrial enlargement and subsequent arrhythmias. The combination of these findings makes mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation the most likely diagnosis.\n\nChronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease (option A) would typically present with a different murmur (a systolic murmur rather than a diastolic one) and might not necessarily be associated with the same degree of pulmonary congestion or atrial fibrillation as seen in this case.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta (option B) and congenital aortic stenosis (option C) would not typically present with the described murmur or the specific constellation of symptoms and findings observed in this patient."
