This mode of transport helps to solubilize the FFAs, which are otherwise not very soluble in water, and allows them to be carried through the aqueous environment of the blood. Lipoproteins also play a role in lipid transport, but they primarily carry triglycerides and cholesterol, not free fatty acids."
