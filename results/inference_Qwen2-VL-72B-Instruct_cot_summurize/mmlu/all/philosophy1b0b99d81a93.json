He argues that individuals can agree to cooperate and follow certain moral rules because it is in their own long-term interest to do so, even if it sometimes requires them to act against their immediate self-interest. This approach contrasts with pure altruism (where actions are motivated solely by concern for others), justified constraint (where moral obligations arise from external constraints), and prima facie duties (which are duties that appear to be binding unless overridden by other considerations)."
