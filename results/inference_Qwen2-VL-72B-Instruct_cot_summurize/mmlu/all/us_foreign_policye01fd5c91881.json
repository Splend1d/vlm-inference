Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nCountries often try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market because the costs of free trade can be concentrated among specific industries or regions that face increased competition and potential job losses, while the benefits of free trade tend to be more broadly dispersed across the economy. This concentration of costs can lead to significant political pressure to protect domestic industries, even though the overall economic benefits of free trade might be positive for the country as a whole."
