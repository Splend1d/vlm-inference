In the case of reindeer herding by the Sami in Norway, it represents relocation diffusion because the Sami people have moved and spread their traditional practice of reindeer herding across different regions within Norway and beyond. This type of diffusion occurs when individuals or groups migrate and bring their cultural practices with them."
