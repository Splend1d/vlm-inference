The mechanism by which it works involves increasing the blood's buffering capacity. This helps to neutralize the increased levels of lactic acid produced during intense exercise, which can lead to a decrease in muscle pH and contribute to fatigue. By elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, sodium bicarbonate allows for a faster removal of hydrogen ions from the muscles, thereby delaying the onset of fatigue and potentially improving performance."
