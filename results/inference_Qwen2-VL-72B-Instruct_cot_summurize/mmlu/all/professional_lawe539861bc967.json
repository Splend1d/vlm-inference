When they got there, they saw a high-ticket group, apparently high-society people, attending an air history video. They took over the meeting room, waving their guns menacingly, and demanded their watches, wallets and jewelry. When they took inventory of their bounty, they found that the customers were actually from a university history club and that they had little real jewelry, watches or wallets, they became enraged and struck several of the participants, killing one and badly injuring another. Which of the following is the most accurate list of common law crimes that they may likely be convicted of? Do not select attempted crimes if they were consummated.\n\nA. Attempted burglary, robbery and attempted murder.\nB. False imprisonment, attempted murder and murder.\nC. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\nD. False imprisonment, attempted robbery and first degree murder.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves several criminal acts that can be categorized under common law crimes. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Attempted burglary**: This crime typically involves attempting to enter a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a felony inside. The scenario does not mention any attempt to enter a building; therefore, this charge is not applicable.\n\n2. **Robbery**: Robbery involves taking property from someone by force or threat of force. In this case, the men demanded watches, wallets, and jewelry at gunpoint, which fits the definition of robbery.\n\n3. **False imprisonment**: False imprisonment occurs when someone is unlawfully restrained or confined against their will. The men took over the meeting room and prevented the attendees from leaving, which could constitute false imprisonment.\n\n4. **Aggravated assault**: Aggravated assault involves causing serious bodily injury to another person, often with a weapon. The men struck several participants, injuring some seriously, which would qualify as aggravated assault.\n\n5. **Murder**: Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. The men killed one participant, which clearly constitutes murder.\n\n6. **Attempted murder**: Attempted murder involves trying to kill someone but failing to do so. The men injured another participant severely, which could be considered attempted murder.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Includes \"attempted burglary,\" which is not applicable, and \"attempted murder,\" which might be applicable if the injuries were severe enough to indicate an intent to kill.\n\n- **Option B**: Includes \"false imprisonment\" and \"murder,\" which are applicable, but it also includes \"attempted murder,\" which might be applicable depending on the severity of the injuries.\n\n- **Option C**: Includes \"false imprisonment,\" \"robbery,\" \"aggravated assault,\" and \"murder,\" all of which are applicable based on the scenario described.\n\n- **Option D**: Includes \"false imprisonment,\" \"attempted robbery,\" and \"first-degree murder.\" The robbery was consummated, so \"attempted robbery\" is not correct. Additionally, \"first-degree murder\" implies premeditation, which is not explicitly stated in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate list of common law crimes that they may likely be convicted of is:\n\n**C. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.**"
