It might be seen as a minor inconvenience or preference issue for those who don't like cinnamon, but it doesn't rise to the level of a moral transgression.\n\nIn Scenario 2, recording someone in a dressing room without their consent is a clear violation of privacy and is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It can also be legally problematic, depending on the jurisdiction."
