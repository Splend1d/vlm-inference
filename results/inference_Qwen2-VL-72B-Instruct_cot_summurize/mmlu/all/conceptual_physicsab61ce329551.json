This means that the charge decreases exponentially over time.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( Q_0 \\) as the initial charge of the capacitor.\n- \\( q \\) as the charge after 5 seconds.\n\nGiven that the capacitor loses half of its remaining charge every second, we can express the charge at any time \\( t \\) in terms of the initial charge \\( Q_0 \\):\n\n\\[ Q(t) = Q_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^t \\]\n\nWe know that after 5 seconds (\\( t = 5 \\)), the charge is \\( q \\). Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ q = Q_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( Q_0 \\):\n\n\\[ Q_0 = q \\times \\left(2\\right)^5 \\]\n\\[ Q_0 = q \\times 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial charge \\( Q_0 \\) is 32 times the charge \\( q \\) after 5 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 32q."
