Reports of the drug being tied to cases of premature dementia surfaced, and a number of lawsuits were filed by injured consumers, alleging strict liability for a defective product. At trial, the manufacturer proved that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. Is the company strictly liable to the victims even though the medical knowledge was not available when the product was developed and put on the market?\n\nA. Yes, strict liability applies to pharmaceutical companies and questions of knowledge of defects is irrelevant.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer must assume the cost of compensating those innocent victims who took the defective drug.\nC. No, the company has no duty to conduct research to determine a product's safety.\nD. No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n"

No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nStrict liability in product liability law generally holds manufacturers responsible for injuries caused by their products, regardless of fault or negligence. However, there are exceptions and defenses that can apply. In this scenario, if the manufacturer can demonstrate that they conducted thorough testing based on the best available scientific knowledge at the time of production and marketing, and that the harmful effects were not discoverable with the technology and understanding available then, it is likely that the company would not be held strictly liable. The principle here is that manufacturers cannot be expected to predict future scientific discoveries that could reveal unforeseen risks."
