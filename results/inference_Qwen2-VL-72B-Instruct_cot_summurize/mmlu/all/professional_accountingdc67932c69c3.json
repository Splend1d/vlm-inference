Separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units.\n\nThe statement of activities in the government-wide financial statements is designed to present the operating results of the government as a whole. It typically includes separate columns for governmental activities (which include most of the primary government functions), business-type activities (such as utilities or airports that operate more like businesses), and discretely presented component units (which are legally separate entities that are financially accountable to the primary government). This format allows users to see the overall financial performance of the government while also distinguishing between different types of activities."
