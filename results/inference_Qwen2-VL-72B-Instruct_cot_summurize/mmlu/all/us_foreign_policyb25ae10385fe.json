It encourages stability of the regime\n\nOil and other natural resource trade can have various effects on developing states, but one common outcome is that it often encourages the stability of the regime in power. This is because the revenue generated from resource exports can provide significant financial resources for the government, which can then use these funds to maintain control and suppress opposition. However, it's important to note that this stability may not necessarily translate into positive outcomes for the broader population or lead to democratic reforms."
