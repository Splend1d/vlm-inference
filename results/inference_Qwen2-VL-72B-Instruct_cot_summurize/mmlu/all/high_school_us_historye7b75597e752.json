I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nThe sentiment expressed by Beveridge best exemplifies which of the following?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Anti-imperialism\nC. Isolationism\nD.

Beveridge argues for the United States' right and responsibility to govern other peoples and territories, even without their consent, based on the belief that the U.S. can provide a better form of governance than what existed previously. This justification for extending political control over other countries or regions is a core aspect of imperialism."
