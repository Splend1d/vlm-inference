However, Carruther's focus tends to be more on the consequences of actions rather than the intrinsic value of the animal.\n\nB. **The animal's capacity for suffering**: This option implies that the justification for moral criticism is based on the potential harm or suffering caused to the animal by human actions. Carruther often emphasizes the importance of considering the well-being and suffering of animals when making ethical decisions.\n\nC. **The bad qualities of character that our actions evince**: This suggests that the justification for moral criticism lies in the negative traits or characteristics that our actions towards animals reveal about us as individuals. While this might be part of the broader ethical discussion, it doesn't seem to be the primary focus of Carruther's arguments.\n\nD. **None of the above**: This would imply that none of the provided options accurately capture Carruther's view, which seems unlikely given the specificity of the question.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting option aligns with the idea that moral criticism is justified based on the potential suffering caused to the animal by human actions. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n**B. The animal's capacity for suffering.**"
