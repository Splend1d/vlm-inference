When he confronted her with it she laughed derisively, admitted to the adultery in sordid detail, and taunted him with insults. He got into a rage and killed her on the spot. In the trial for first degree murder, defense counsel asked for a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge refused. On appeal will the husband prevail on an argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter?\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n"

Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nIn legal terms, voluntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that occurs in the \"heat of passion\" after being provoked. While the specific circumstances and laws vary by jurisdiction, an admission of adultery, especially when accompanied by taunting and insults, could be considered sufficient provocation under certain legal frameworks. This would warrant a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter as an alternative to first-degree murder. However, it's important to note that the outcome would depend on the specific laws and precedents of the jurisdiction in question."
