This action can cause serious injury and is clearly morally wrong because it involves deliberate harm or endangerment to another person.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I knew the right thing to do was to turn the lost wallet into the police department, so I went straight to the station after work.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character does the right thing by turning in a lost wallet to the police department. This action is considered morally correct as it involves honesty and helping someone who has lost their property.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
