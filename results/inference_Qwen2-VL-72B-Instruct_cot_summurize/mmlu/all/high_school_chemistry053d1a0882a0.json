Proton: A proton has a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu).\n\nB. Neutron: A neutron also has a mass of approximately 1 amu, slightly more than that of a proton.\n\nC. Alpha particle: An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, making its total mass approximately 4 amu.\n\nD. Beta particle: A beta particle is essentially an electron or positron, which has a much smaller mass compared to protons and neutrons, around 0.00055 amu.\n\nGiven this information, the most massive subatomic particle among the options is:\n\nC.
