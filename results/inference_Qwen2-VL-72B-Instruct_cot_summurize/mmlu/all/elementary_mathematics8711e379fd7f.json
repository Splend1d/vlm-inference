Therefore, the correct inequality should reflect this range.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\(w > 2.3\\) - This means the weight is more than 2.3 pounds, which is true for all books except the one weighing exactly 2.3 pounds. However, since the question asks for the weight of any book chosen, including the one weighing 2.3 pounds, this option does not fully represent the scenario.\n\nB. \\(w < 2.4\\) - This means the weight is less than 2.4 pounds. This is incorrect because there are books that weigh more than 2.4 pounds (e.g., 2.5, 2.7, 3.2).\n\nC. \\(w > 3.2\\) - This means the weight is more than 3.2 pounds. This is incorrect because no book weighs more than 3.2 pounds.\n\nD. \\(w < 3.3\\) - This means the weight is less than 3.3 pounds. This is correct because all books weigh less than 3.3 pounds, and it includes the heaviest book weighing 3.2 pounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(w < 3.3\\)."
