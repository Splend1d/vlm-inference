                    "text": "To determine which compound is expected to be the least soluble in water, we need to consider the solubility rules for ionic compounds. Generally, most ionic compounds containing alkali metals (Group 1), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and acetate (CH3COO-) ions are soluble in water. However, there are some exceptions for other ions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **NaBr** - Sodium bromide is highly soluble in water because sodium (Na+) is an alkali metal, and bromide (Br-) is generally soluble.\n\nB. **NiSO3** - Nickel(II) sulfite is not a common compound, but if we consider nickel(II) sulfate (NiSO4), it is usually soluble in water. However, sulfites (SO3^2-) can sometimes form insoluble salts with certain metals.\n\nC. **CrCl3** - Chromium(III) chloride is generally soluble in water as chlorides (Cl-) are typically soluble except when paired with silver (Ag+), lead (Pb2+), or mercury(I) (Hg22+).\n\nD. **Mn(NO3)2** - Manganese(II) nitrate is highly soluble in water because nitrates (NO3-) are very soluble.\n\nGiven these considerations, **NiSO3** stands out as potentially less soluble due to the sulfite ion, which can form insoluble salts under certain conditions. Therefore, the least soluble compound among the given options is likely **NiSO3**.\n\nFinal answer: B. NiSO3"
