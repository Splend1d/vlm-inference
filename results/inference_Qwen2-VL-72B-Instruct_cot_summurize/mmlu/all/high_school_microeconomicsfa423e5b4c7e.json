This means that individuals or businesses own and control their own resources, including land, capital, and labor. They can use these resources as they see fit, subject to certain regulations and laws. The other options listed (high degree of government involvement, public ownership of resources, and central planners setting wages and prices) are more characteristic of planned economies or mixed economies rather than a pure free market system."
