Premise 1: I \u2261 ~J (I is equivalent to not J)\n2. Premise 2: I \u2228 J (I or J)\n3. Conclusion: I\n\nLet's create the truth table:\n\n| I | J | ~J | I \u2261 ~J | I \u2228 J |\n|---|---|----|--------|------|\n| T | T | F  | F      | T    |\n| T | F | T  | T      | T    |\n| F | T | F  | T      | T    |\n| F | F | T  | T      | F    |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table to determine if the argument is valid or invalid:\n\n- In the first row, both I and J are true. The premise I \u2261 ~J is false because I is true and ~J is false. The premise I \u2228 J is true. However, the conclusion I is true.\n- In the second row, I is true and J is false. The premise I \u2261 ~J is true because I is true and ~J is true. The premise I \u2228 J is true. The conclusion I is true.\n- In the third row, I is false and J is true. The premise I \u2261 ~J is true because I is false and ~J is false. The premise I \u2228 J is true. However, the conclusion I is false.\n- In the fourth row, both I and J are false. The premise I \u2261 ~J is true because I is false and ~J is true. The premise I \u2228 J is false. The conclusion I is false.\n\nSince there is at least one row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false (row 3), the argument is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false"
