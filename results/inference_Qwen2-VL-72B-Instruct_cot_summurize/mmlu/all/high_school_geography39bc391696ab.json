It greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Green Revolution primarily focused on regions such as South Asia and Latin America, where it had significant success in increasing crop yields through the introduction of high-yielding varieties of crops like rice and wheat, along with improved agricultural practices and inputs. However, its impact in sub-Saharan Africa was more limited due to various factors including different environmental conditions, lack of infrastructure, and other socio-economic challenges."
