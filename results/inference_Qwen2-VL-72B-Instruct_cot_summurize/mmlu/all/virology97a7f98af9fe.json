Both a and c\n\nOpioid replacement therapy (ORT) is used to treat opioid addiction by providing a safer, more controlled form of the substance to which the individual is addicted. This approach helps in reducing the craving for and use of illicit opioids (Option A), thereby decreasing the risk of HIV transmission through the sharing of contaminated needles and other injecting paraphernalia. Additionally, ORT can reduce the frequency of injection drug use (Option C), further lowering the risk of HIV infection. However, it does not increase the sharing of injecting paraphernalia (Option B); in fact, it aims to decrease such behaviors."
