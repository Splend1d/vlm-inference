His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\nA. The findings are clinically and statistically significant\nB. The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\nC. The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\nD. The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant\n"

The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n\nThe study results indicate a statistically significant difference in the mean time for resolution of symptoms between the group receiving the new drug (6.4 days) and the group receiving the placebo (6.7 days), with a p-value of 0.04. This suggests that the observed difference is unlikely due to chance alone.\n\nHowever, the clinical significance of this difference should also be considered. A reduction of only 0.3 days (approximately 7 hours) in the duration of symptoms may not be practically meaningful or impactful enough to justify the use of the new drug over a placebo. Therefore, while the findings are statistically significant, they may be considered clinically insignificant."
