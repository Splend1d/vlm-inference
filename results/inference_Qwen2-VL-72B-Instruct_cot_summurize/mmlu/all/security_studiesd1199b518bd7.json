The responsibility to prevent.\n\nThe concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is based on three key pillars:\n\n1. **The responsibility to prevent:** This pillar emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of potential mass atrocities and taking preventive measures before they occur. It involves diplomatic, humanitarian, and other peaceful means to prevent crises from escalating into mass atrocity situations.\n\n2. **The responsibility to react:** This pillar refers to the international community's obligation to take timely and decisive action when a state is manifestly failing to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, or crimes against humanity. This can include non-military measures such as sanctions, diplomacy, and humanitarian aid, as well as military intervention as a last resort.\n\n3. **The responsibility to rebuild:** This pillar focuses on the need for post-crisis reconstruction and reconciliation efforts to ensure long-term peace and stability. It involves rebuilding societies affected by mass atrocities and supporting their recovery.\n\nAmong these, the responsibility to prevent is often considered the most important because it aims to stop mass atrocities before they happen, thereby saving lives and preventing the suffering that comes with such crises. Prevention is seen as the most effective and humane approach in the context of R2P."
