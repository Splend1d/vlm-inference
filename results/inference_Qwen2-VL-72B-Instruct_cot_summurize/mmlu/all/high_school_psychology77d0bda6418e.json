Newborns can feel sensations such as pressure, warmth, and pain through their skin. This sense helps them to bond with their caregivers and explore their environment. While other senses like hearing and smell are also functional at birth, they may not be as fully developed or as dominant as the sense of touch. Taste and vision, on the other hand, develop more gradually over the first few months of life."
