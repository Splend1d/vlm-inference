In a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated.\n- Sampling error cannot be completely eliminated; it can only be minimized. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. In a well-designed observational study, responses are influenced through an orderly, carefully planned procedure during the collection of data.\n- Observational studies do not involve influencing responses; they simply observe and record data without intervention. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nC. In a well-designed experiment, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible.\n- The goal of a well-designed experiment is to compare different treatments to see how they affect responses, not to make the responses as similar as possible. This statement is also false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above is a true statement."
