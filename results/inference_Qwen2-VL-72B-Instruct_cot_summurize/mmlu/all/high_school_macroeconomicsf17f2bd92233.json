It appears there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the price index or the scale of the numbers. Given the options and assuming the price index is meant to be used directly without conversion to a percentage, let's reconsider the calculation with the correct interpretation:\n\nThe correct approach should consider that the price index is a multiplier relative to a base year's prices. If the price index is 200, it means prices are 200 times what they were in the base year. Thus, to convert Real GDP to Nominal GDP, you multiply by the price index:\n\n\\[ \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\$200 \\text{ billion} \\times 200 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\$40,000 \\text{ billion} \\]\n\nThis result doesn't match any of the provided options directly, suggesting a misunderstanding in the question's setup or the interpretation of the price index. Given the typical context and the options provided, it seems the intention was to illustrate a simpler relationship where the price index directly multiplies the Real GDP to get Nominal GDP without considering the scale issue.\n\nAssuming the intent was to demonstrate a direct multiplication without the scale confusion:\n\n\\[ \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\$200 \\text{ billion} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\$400 \\text{ billion} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, considering the likely intended simplification, is:\n\nB. $400 billion"
