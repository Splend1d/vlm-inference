Several different classes (sets) of registers\n\nPipelining in CPUs is designed to improve performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. Obstacles to aggressive pipelining include:\n\nA. Condition codes set by every instruction: This can cause data dependencies and stalls in the pipeline.\nB. Variable-length encoding of instructions: This complicates the instruction fetch and decode stages, potentially leading to inefficiencies.\nC. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute: This can lead to pipeline bubbles or stalls when instructions with different latencies are executed sequentially.\n\nHowever, having several different classes (sets) of registers does not inherently pose a significant obstacle to pipelining. Modern processors often have multiple register sets (e.g., general-purpose registers, floating-point registers, segment registers) that can be managed independently within the pipeline stages."
