                    "text": "To determine which condition guarantees that the body of the loop will never be executed, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop's condition becomes false.\n\nThe `while` loop condition is:\n```cpp\nnum1 > num2 || num1 > num3\n```\nThis means the loop will continue as long as either `num1` is greater than `num2` or `num1` is greater than `num3`.\n\nFor the body of the loop to never execute, the condition must always evaluate to false. This happens when both parts of the OR condition are false simultaneously. In other words, `num1` must not be greater than `num2` AND `num1` must not be greater than `num3`. This can be expressed as:\n```cpp\n!(num1 > num2) && !(num1 > num3)\n```\nSimplifying this, we get:\n```cpp\nnum1 <= num2 && num1 <= num3\n```\nSo, for the body of the loop to never execute, both `num1` must be less than or equal to `num2` and `num1` must be less than or equal to `num3`.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. `num1 < num2` - This only ensures that `num1` is less than `num2`, but it does not account for the comparison with `num3`.\nB. `num1 < num3` - This only ensures that `num1` is less than `num3`, but it does not account for the comparison with `num2`.\nC. `num1 > num2 && num1 > num3` - This would actually ensure that the loop condition is true, so the body of the loop would execute.\nD. `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3` - This ensures that `num1` is less than both `num2` and `num3`, which means the loop condition will always be false, and thus the body of the loop will never execute.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3`."
