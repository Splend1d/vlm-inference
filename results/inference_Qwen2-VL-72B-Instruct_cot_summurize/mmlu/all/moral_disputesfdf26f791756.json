However, without more specific information about Little's views, it's challenging to definitively choose between these two options.\n\nSince the question asks for Little's argument specifically about the norms of creation, and assuming that Little's perspective is more nuanced than simply viewing abortion as a matter of personal preference (Option C), the best choice seems to be:\n\n**D. none of the above.**\n\nThis selection acknowledges that the provided options do not fully capture Little's nuanced argument about the norms of creation."
