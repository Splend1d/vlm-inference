The basement flooded whenever it rained heavily \u0080\u0094 there were marks along the entire basement wall that showed the level of the flood waters, and there were thin but distinct lines in the wall that were actual cracks in the foundation. The seller painted most of the interior of the house, including the basement walls, and plastered the fracture lines, which obliterated the flood marks and fracture marks. A buyer purchased the home after inspecting the basement and seeing no signs of flooding. After the first heavy rain the problem was revealed.

Yes, the seller has a duty to make adequate disclosure of the known facts with respect to material defects.\n\nIn real estate transactions, sellers typically have a legal obligation to disclose any known material defects about the property to potential buyers. Material defects are significant issues that could affect the value or usability of the property. In this case, the flooding and foundation cracks are likely considered material defects because they can impact the structural integrity and habitability of the home.\n\nBy painting over the flood marks and plastering the fracture lines, the seller intentionally concealed these defects from the buyer. This action could be seen as a failure to fulfill the duty of disclosure, potentially making the seller liable for damages or even allowing the buyer to rescind the sale if the nondisclosure is deemed fraudulent or a material misrepresentation.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws regarding disclosure obligations can vary by jurisdiction, so consulting with a local attorney would be advisable for the buyer to understand their rights and options fully."
