Military warfare enhances the ability of people's access to resources and to aid the development in ecologically sustainable ways; it can secure access routes and rights that would otherwise be denied; rebuild infrastructure and equitable access of resources; benefit the management of environmental problems; and also to bolster social institutions and cohesion.\nB. It is when considering the military and the security institutions that some of the greatest contradictions with the concept of environmental security are raised. War impacts negatively on the sustainable growth of the nation but armed forces may be required to manage the effects.\nC. Stronger militaries and technological advances have reduced the negative impact on the environment having greater impact with fewer materials, whilst the spectre of mass destruction warfare has been reduced with the ending of the Cold War.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Military operations can sometimes enhance access to resources and aid in the development of ecologically sustainable practices. They can secure access routes and rights, rebuild infrastructure, and contribute to the management of environmental problems. Additionally, they can support social institutions and cohesion.\n\nB. However, war and military activities often have negative impacts on the environment, hindering sustainable growth. Armed forces may be necessary to manage the effects of these impacts, creating a complex relationship between military action and environmental security.\n\nC. Technological advancements in military capabilities have led to more efficient use of resources, reducing the environmental footprint of military operations. The end of the Cold War has also lessened the threat of large-scale destructive warfare, which could have catastrophic environmental consequences.\n\nTherefore, all of these options highlight different facets of how armed forces can be connected to environmental security."
