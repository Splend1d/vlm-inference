                    "text": "A retiree, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

This restriction was intended to bind all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns. When the development company subdivided two of the parcels into larger lots (three, four, and five acres) and constructed homes on them, these restrictions were included in the deeds to the purchasers of those homes in tract 1.\n\nTwo years later, when the remaining 250-acre parcel was sold to a contractor who subdivided it into one-acre lots without mentioning the original restriction, the owners of the lots in tract 1 could potentially argue that the entire development (tract 1 and tract 2) should be considered under a common development scheme. If the court agrees with this argument, it would likely find that the original deed restrictions apply to both tracts, thereby supporting the owners' action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the owners have a direct interest in enforcing the deed restrictions, giving them standing to sue.\nOption B is incorrect because the concept of privity of estate does not necessarily preclude enforcement of deed restrictions; courts often look at the intent behind the restrictions and whether they were meant to benefit future owners.\nOption D is partially correct but less specific than option C. While the original deed restrictions are indeed enforceable, the success of the action hinges on the court's consideration of tract 2 as part of the same development scheme."
