Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Square Planar Complexes**: Optical isomerism in square planar complexes (such as those with Pt(II)) can occur even if not all four ligands are identical, provided that there is a suitable arrangement of ligands that results in non-superimposable mirror images.\n- **Tetrahedral Complexes**: Tetrahedral complexes do not exhibit optical isomerism because any tetrahedron can be superimposed on its mirror image by rotation.\n- **Linear Complexes**: Linear complexes (e.g., [Ag(NH\u2083)\u2082]\u207a) cannot display optical isomerism because they lack chirality; they are inherently symmetrical and their mirror images are superimposable.\n- **Octahedral Complexes**: For octahedral complexes to exhibit optical isomerism, they must have at least three different ligands. This is because the presence of three different ligands allows for the formation of non-superimposable mirror images, which is necessary for optical isomerism. If fewer than three different ligands are present, the complex will either be achiral or will not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry considerations."
