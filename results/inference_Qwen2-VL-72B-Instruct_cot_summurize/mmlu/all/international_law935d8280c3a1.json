Reparation includes restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either alone or alongside other forms of reparation\n\nReparation can take various forms depending on the circumstances and the nature of the harm caused. It can include restitution (returning what was taken or restoring the situation to how it was before), compensation (financial payment for damages), and satisfaction (measures that address moral injury or other non-pecuniary damage). These forms of reparation can be applied individually or in combination."
