The linear momentum of the system is conserved, but kinetic energy is not necessarily conserved due to the conversion of some kinetic energy into other forms such as heat or deformation energy. The mass of the combined object is the sum of the masses of the individual objects, but it's the velocity that becomes common to both after sticking together."
