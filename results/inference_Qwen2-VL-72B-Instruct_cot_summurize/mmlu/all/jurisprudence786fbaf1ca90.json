                    "text": "To determine which statement is the least likely to follow logically from Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist, we need to understand the core concept of Volksgeist. Savigny's theory of Volksgeist emphasizes that law is deeply rooted in and reflective of the spirit, culture, and customs of a people (a nation or community). It suggests that law evolves organically from the collective consciousness and traditions of a society rather than being imposed by external forces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A society's law is a reflection of its culture.**\n   - This aligns well with Savigny's idea that law is an organic outgrowth of a society's culture and traditions.\n\nB. **Law is like language.**\n   - This metaphor implies that law, similar to language, is a natural and evolving part of a society's life, which also fits with Savigny's Volksgeist theory.\n\nC. **Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.**\n   - This statement contradicts Savigny's view. According to Savigny, law should not be seen as something deliberately imposed by a sovereign but rather as something that emerges naturally from the people's collective spirit.\n\nD. **Law is an integral element of the social fabric.**\n   - This statement is consistent with Savigny's notion that law is deeply embedded within the social structure and is an essential part of the community's life.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is the least likely to follow logically from Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist is:\n\n**C. Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.**"
