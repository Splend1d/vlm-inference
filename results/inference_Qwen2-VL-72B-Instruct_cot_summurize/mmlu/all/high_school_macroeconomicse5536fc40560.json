This typically leads to a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity because consumers are willing to buy less at each price level.\n\n2. **Supply Increases**: When supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right. This typically leads to a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity because producers are willing to sell more at each price level.\n\nCombining these two effects:\n\n- **Equilibrium Price**: Both a decrease in demand and an increase in supply tend to lower the equilibrium price. Therefore, the equilibrium price will likely fall.\n  \n- **Equilibrium Quantity**: The effect on the equilibrium quantity is less clear because the two shifts work in opposite directions. A decrease in demand would lower the quantity, while an increase in supply would raise it. Without knowing the relative magnitudes of these shifts, the net effect on the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.**"
