                    "text": "To determine the desired outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651 by the Rump Parliament of England, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **To prevent England's colonies from being bombarded with cheap goods manufactured by their mainland European competitors**\n   - This option suggests a focus on protecting English colonies from cheap goods produced in Europe. However, the Navigation Acts primarily aimed to control shipping rather than directly addressing the influx of cheap goods.\n\nB. **To reclaim domination of the slave trade from Portugal in order to meet the growing need for slaves for sugar plantations in the English Caribbean colonies**\n   - While the slave trade was an important aspect of colonial economies, the Navigation Acts focused more broadly on regulating maritime trade rather than specifically targeting the slave trade.\n\nC. **To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries**\n   - The Navigation Acts indeed targeted Dutch dominance in maritime trade. By requiring that goods be transported in English or colonial ships manned by English or colonial sailors, they aimed to restrict Dutch involvement in trade routes involving England and its colonies.\n\nD. **To extricate the French from the Atlantic sea trade as well as the cod and whaling industries which at this time were dominated by the French**\n   - Although the acts had implications for various European powers, including France, the primary focus was on the Dutch, who were the dominant maritime traders at the time.\n\nGiven the context and the specific provisions of the Navigation Acts, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries.**"
