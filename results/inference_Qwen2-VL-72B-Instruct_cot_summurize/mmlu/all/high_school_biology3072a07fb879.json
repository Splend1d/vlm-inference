Biogeography\n\nBiogeography studies the distribution of species and ecosystems over geographic space and through geological time. It can help explain why certain traits, such as prehensile tails, might evolve in one region but not in another due to differences in environmental pressures, available niches, and historical patterns of migration and isolation."
