This is because PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which breaks down phenylalanine into tyrosine. When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up in the body and can cause intellectual disability and other health problems. By restricting phenylalanine intake, the symptoms of PKU can be managed and prevented."
