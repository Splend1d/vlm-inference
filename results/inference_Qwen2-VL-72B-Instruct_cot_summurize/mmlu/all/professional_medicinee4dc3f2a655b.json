Four days ago, he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, during which he swam in the ship\u2019s pool and used the hot tub. He appears well. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph. The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations?\n\nA. Apocrine gland\nB. Dermis\nC. Eccrine gland\nD. Hair follicle\n"

Given the context of swimming in a pool and using a hot tub, one possible cause could be an infection with a fungus such as tinea (ringworm) or a bacterial infection like folliculitis.\n\nSince the rash is described as being on the buttocks and legs, and considering the activities the patient engaged in (swimming and using a hot tub), the most likely location for the infectious agent to begin proliferation would be:\n\nD. Hair follicle\n\nThis is because infections like folliculitis often start in hair follicles, especially after exposure to warm, moist environments like pools and hot tubs, where bacteria can thrive."
