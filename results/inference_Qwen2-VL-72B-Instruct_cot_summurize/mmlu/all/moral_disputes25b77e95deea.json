It suggests that there might be a moral distinction based on the species of the animals.\n\nB. **The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.**\n   - This option addresses the necessity and purpose behind the suffering. It implies that the suffering of puppies is directly linked to personal pleasure, while the suffering of farm animals is an indirect result of economic factors.\n\nC. **Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.**\n   - This option focuses on the ability to prevent suffering. It suggests that Fred has control over preventing puppy suffering, whereas meat-eaters do not have control over preventing the suffering of farm animals.\n\nD. **None of the above**\n   - This option indicates that none of the previously mentioned differences are discussed by Norcross.\n\nGiven the context, it seems that Norcross would likely address all these points in a thorough discussion about the moral relevance of different behaviors involving animal suffering. Therefore, if Norcross indeed discusses all the points mentioned in options A, B, and C, then the correct answer would be:\n\n**D. None of the above**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that Norcross covers all the aspects mentioned in options A, B, and C in his discussion."
