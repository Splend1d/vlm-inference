While it may be morally challenging, it is not inherently impossible because there could be situations where lying might be considered justifiable to prevent significant harm.\n\nB. \"Always do whatever brings about the greatest happiness.\"\n- This rule aligns with utilitarian ethics, which aims to maximize overall happiness. It is theoretically possible but can be complex to apply consistently due to varying interpretations of what constitutes \"greatest happiness.\"\n\nC. \"Always assert what you don\u2019t think to be the case.\"\n- This rule requires one to constantly state things they believe to be false. This is logically contradictory and practically impossible because asserting something one does not believe undermines the very nature of assertion and communication.\n\nGiven this analysis, the morally impossible rule is:\n\nC. always assert what you don\u2019t think to be the case."
