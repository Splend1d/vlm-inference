                    "text": "A developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:\"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. \"The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, \"I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. \"In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will\n\nA. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\nB. win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.\nC. lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.\nD. lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the developer will win or lose in an action for specific performance against the investor, we need to analyze the situation based on the principles of contract law, particularly focusing on the Statute of Frauds and the adequacy of remedies.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Statute of Frauds:**\n   - The Statute of Frauds requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. Contracts involving the sale of land or interests in land typically fall under this requirement.\n   - In this case, the agreement between the developer and the investor is documented in writing, which satisfies the Statute of Frauds.\n\n2. **Specific Performance:**\n   - Specific performance is an equitable remedy that compels a party to fulfill their contractual obligations rather than paying damages. It is generally granted when monetary damages are insufficient to compensate for the breach.\n   - For specific performance to be granted, the subject matter must be unique (e.g., real estate), and the legal remedy (damages) must be inadequate.\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Land:**\n   - Land is considered unique, and therefore, specific performance is often granted in cases involving real estate transactions. However, this principle applies primarily to the sale of land, not necessarily to the financing of a construction project.\n\n4. **Adequacy of Legal Remedy:**\n   - In this scenario, the developer has already contracted with a construction company and construction has begun. If the investor breaches the agreement by refusing to provide the loan, the developer can suffer significant financial harm that may not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone.\n   - The developer has relied on the investor\u2019s promise to proceed with the construction, which indicates potential detrimental reliance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the circumstances, the developer has taken substantial steps in reliance on the investor's promise, including contracting with a construction company and initiating construction. This reliance makes monetary damages potentially inadequate as a remedy. Therefore, the developer has a strong argument for specific performance due to the uniqueness of the land involved and the inadequacy of damages as a remedy.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.**\n\nThis option highlights the fact that the written agreement satisfies the Statute of Frauds, which is a crucial element in enforcing the contract. Additionally, the uniqueness of the land and the inadequacy of damages support the developer's case for specific performance."
