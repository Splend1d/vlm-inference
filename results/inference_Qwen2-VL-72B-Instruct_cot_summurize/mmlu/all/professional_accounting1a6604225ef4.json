The accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to the engagement.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen conducting a review of interim financial information, an accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to the engagement. This means that the accountant should be free from any biases or conflicts of interest that could influence their judgment and objectivity.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The accountant must indicate in the report those circumstances in which generally accepted accounting principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in relation to the preceding period.\n- This statement is more applicable to an audit rather than a review. In a review, the accountant does not provide assurance on consistency with GAAP but rather provides limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements.\n\nB. The accountant must express an opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole.\n- An accountant conducting a review does not express an opinion on the financial statements. Instead, they provide a conclusion stating whether anything has come to their attention that causes them to believe that the financial statements are not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.\n\nD. The accountant must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion.\n- While obtaining evidence is part of the process, a review engagement does not result in an opinion. It results in a conclusion based on the limited procedures performed.\n\nTherefore, maintaining independence in mental attitude is crucial for an accountant conducting a review of interim financial information."
