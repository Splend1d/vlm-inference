The contract provided the following:\"The cost is $2,500 per deck, to be paid upon completion of the decks in each of the eight beach houses. \"On the morning of March 25, the man went to one of the beach houses as the contractor and his assistants were completing the work on the fourth deck. The man said to the contractor, \"I'm very pleased with your progress to date. If you are willing, I would like you to build the same kind of decks on four identical beach houses that I own in a neighboring town, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 20. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The contractor replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. The contractor completed the work on the beach houses located in the city by April 15 and immediately started the construction of the decks on the four beach houses located in the town. On April 22, a hurricane totally destroyed four of the man's beach houses in the city. In addition, the hurricane demolished a beach house in the town on which the contractor had completed 85 percent of the deck work. Two of the contractor's assistants were seriously injured, and all of his equipment was washed away. The man then received a letter from the contractor, which stated:\"The hurricane destroyed my equipment, worth $4,000. I am dead broke and cannot complete the work on the three remaining beach houses in the town. Please pay me $20,000 for the work I did in the city, and please send me $2,500 for the deck I built on the beach house in the town. \"What is the maximum amount that the contractor may recover from the man for the construction that he completed prior to the hurricane?\n\nA. $10,000. 00\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\nC. $20,000. 00\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n"

Therefore, the closest option that matches the calculated amount is:\n\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house."
