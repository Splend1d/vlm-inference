There is a sign warning \"this elevator is not available at this time, please do not ride it.\" A passenger sees the signs, but tries to ride the elevator anyway, and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk. Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based upon the signs.\nB. Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.\nC. No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\nD. No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway.\n"

No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\n\nAssumption of risk is a defense that can be used when a plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily exposes themselves to a known risk. However, for the defense to be valid, the plaintiff must have been aware of the specific danger involved. In this case, the sign simply stated that the elevator was not available and did not provide any information about the specific hazard (the open shaft). Therefore, the passenger could not have reasonably assumed the risk of falling into an open elevator shaft based solely on the information provided by the sign. The city's duty to warn and protect the public from harm extends beyond merely stating that something is unavailable; they must also inform about the specific dangers present."
