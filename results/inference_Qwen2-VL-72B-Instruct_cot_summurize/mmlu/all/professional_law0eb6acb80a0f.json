The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should\n\nA. permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.\nB. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.\nD. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.\n"

In this case, exhibiting the child to highlight facial similarities could serve as a form of demonstrative evidence to support the mother's claim regarding paternity. While the defendant's attorney may object on grounds of prejudice, the judge has discretion to determine whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs any potential prejudice. Demonstrative evidence, when relevant and not overly prejudicial, can be permitted by the court."
