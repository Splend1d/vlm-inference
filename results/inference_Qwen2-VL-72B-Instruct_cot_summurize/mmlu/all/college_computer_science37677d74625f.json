This is essentially asking if \\( M \\) does not halt within the first \\( n \\) steps. Since we can simulate \\( M \\) for exactly \\( n \\) steps and observe whether it halts or not, this problem is decidable. If \\( M \\) halts before \\( n \\) steps, then the answer is \"no\"; otherwise, the answer is \"yes\".\n\n### Problem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\nThis problem requires us to check two conditions:\n1. The computation lasts for at least \\( n \\) steps.\n2. After the \\( n \\)-th step, \\( M \\) prints a 1 somewhere on the tape.\n\nThe first condition is decidable as explained above. However, the second condition involves predicting the behavior of \\( M \\) beyond \\( n \\) steps, which is undecidable due to the Halting Problem. We cannot predict with certainty what \\( M \\) will do after an arbitrary number of steps, especially when it comes to printing specific symbols like 1s. Therefore, this problem is undecidable.\n\n### Problem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\nThis problem asks whether \\( M \\) visits at least \\( n \\) different tape squares during its computation. To decide this, we can simulate \\( M \\) and keep track of all the unique tape positions visited. If the number of unique positions visited reaches \\( n \\), the answer is \"yes\"; otherwise, it's \"no\". This is a finite process that can be carried out by a Turing machine, making this problem decidable.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Problem I is decidable.\n- Problem II is undecidable.\n- Problem III is decidable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and III only"
