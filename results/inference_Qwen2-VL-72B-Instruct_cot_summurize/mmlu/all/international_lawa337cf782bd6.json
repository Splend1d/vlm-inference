Resolution 678 is broader because it authorised the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region.\n\nUNSC Resolution 678, adopted on November 29, 1990, authorized member states to use \"all necessary means\" to enforce compliance with previous resolutions demanding that Iraq withdraw its forces from Kuwait. This resolution provided a legal basis for military action against Iraq beyond what would be permitted under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which pertains to the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense in response to an armed attack. Resolution 678 was broader in scope as it addressed the threat to international peace and security in the Gulf region, not just an immediate act of aggression against a specific state."
