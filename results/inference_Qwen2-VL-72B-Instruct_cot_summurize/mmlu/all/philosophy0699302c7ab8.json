Critics argue that utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize overall happiness or utility, might justify actions that are intuitively unjust if they happen to produce more overall good. For example, it could be argued that it is justifiable to harm an innocent person if doing so would prevent greater harm to many others. Mill responds to this objection by emphasizing that justice is itself a fundamental component of utility and that the principle of utility should not be interpreted in a way that undermines basic principles of justice."
