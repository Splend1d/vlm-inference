In order to raise funds, the state decided to consider the creation of a state postal service that only its residents may use for intrastate mail. The price for stamps printed by the state postal service would be half the cost of stamps printed by the U. S. Postal Service and would always be guaranteed to arrive within 24 hours. In addition, any employees of the state would be able to send their mail for free through the state postal service. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the proposed legislation?\n\nA. It constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws, because employees of the state receive personal benefits that are not enjoyed by employees of other states.\nB. The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.\nC. It denies citizens of the state who are not state government employees their rights under the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. It interferes with the sovereign autonomy of the U. S. Postal Service to operate as an independent federal agency.\n"

The negative implications that flow from the delegation to Congress of the power to establish a post office prohibit such a state postal service.\n\nThis argument is based on the fact that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to establish post offices and post roads (Article I, Section 8, Clause 7). This means that no state can create its own postal service, as it would infringe upon the powers delegated to Congress. Therefore, the establishment of a state postal service would be unconstitutional due to this specific delegation of authority to the federal government."
