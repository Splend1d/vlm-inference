The plaintiff alleged that a tire manufactured by the subsidiary in Europe had caused his wife's death in an automobile accident in Europe. The parent corporation does significant business throughout the United States, including in State A. The subsidiary conducts no business and has no employees or bank accounts in State A. The no employees or bank accounts in State A. The subsidiary manufactures its tires for the European market, but 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. The subsidiary has moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant the subsidiary's motion?\n\nA. No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\nB. No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.\nC. Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.\nD. Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n"

Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n\nExplanation:\nFor a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be sufficient minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state such that the exercise of jurisdiction would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. In this case, the subsidiary conducts no business, has no employees or bank accounts in State A, and only 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. This level of contact is generally considered insufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction over the subsidiary in State A. Therefore, the court should grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere fact that 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce does not necessarily establish the necessary minimum contacts required for personal jurisdiction.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation does not automatically extend to the subsidiary. Each entity must be evaluated separately for jurisdictional purposes.\n\nOption C is irrelevant to the issue of personal jurisdiction, as the location of the accident does not determine whether the court has jurisdiction over the subsidiary based on its contacts with State A."
