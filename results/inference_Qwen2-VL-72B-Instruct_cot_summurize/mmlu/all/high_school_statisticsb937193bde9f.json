First, we calculate how many standard deviations above the mean 225 calories is:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{225 - 210}{10} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\]\n\nThis means 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the area to the left of \\(Z = 1.5\\) (which represents the probability of a candy bar having less than or equal to 225 calories). The area to the left of \\(Z = 1.5\\) is approximately 0.9332, which means about 93.32% of the candy bars have fewer than 225 calories.\n\nTo find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, we subtract this value from 100%:\n\n\\[ 100\\% - 93.32\\% = 6.68\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6.68%."
