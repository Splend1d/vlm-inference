That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

It was a major factor in the economic and demographic changes that supported European expansion.\n\nB. **Refinement of gunpowder technologies**: The improvement and widespread use of gunpowder weaponry gave Europeans a significant military advantage over many other societies they encountered during this period, facilitating conquests and control.\n\nC. **The development and application of steam-powered technologies**: Steam power became prominent later, particularly in the 18th century and beyond (Industrial Revolution). During the specified time frame (1450-1750), steam power was not yet a significant factor in global hegemony.\n\nD. **The implementation of joint-stock companies**: These companies allowed for the pooling of capital and risk, enabling larger-scale overseas ventures and trade, which were crucial for European expansion and economic dominance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the factor that contributed least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. is:\n\n**C. The development and application of steam-powered technologies**"
