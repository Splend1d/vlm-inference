By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code\n\nIn a buffer overflow attack, an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in a program by supplying more data than the buffer is designed to hold. This excess data can overwrite adjacent memory locations, including the return address on the stack. By overwriting the return address with the memory location of the attacker's injected code, the program will jump to and execute the malicious code when it returns from the current function call."
