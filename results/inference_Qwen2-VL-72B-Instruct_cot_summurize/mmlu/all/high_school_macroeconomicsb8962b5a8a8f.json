The supply curve would shift down decreasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nWhen more Americans start saving for retirement, they are essentially increasing the amount of money available for lending in the market. This increase in savings leads to an increase in the supply of loanable funds. As the supply of loanable funds increases, the supply curve shifts to the right (or down, depending on how you visualize it). With more funds available for borrowing, lenders may lower interest rates to attract borrowers, which decreases the equilibrium interest rate."
