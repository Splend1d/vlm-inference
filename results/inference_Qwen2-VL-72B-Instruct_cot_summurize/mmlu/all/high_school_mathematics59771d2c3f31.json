                    "text": "To find the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3, we need to consider the conditions under which this can happen.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem:\n\n- Juan rolls an octahedral (8-sided) die, so the possible outcomes for Juan are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.\n- Amal rolls a six-sided die, so the possible outcomes for Amal are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nFor the product of their rolls to be a multiple of 3, at least one of the rolls must result in a number that is a multiple of 3. Let's calculate the probabilities step by step:\n\n### Probability that neither roll results in a multiple of 3\n\n- For Juan's roll to not be a multiple of 3, he must roll either 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. There are 5 such outcomes out of 8 possible outcomes, so the probability is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n- For Amal's roll to not be a multiple of 3, he must roll either 1, 2, 4, or 5. There are 4 such outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is \\( \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe probability that neither roll results in a multiple of 3 is the product of these probabilities: \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{24} = \\frac{5}{12} \\).\n\n### Probability that the product is a multiple of 3\n\nSince the only way the product is not a multiple of 3 is if both rolls are not multiples of 3, the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is the complement of the above probability: \\( 1 - \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{7}{12} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which seems to be a misinterpretation based on the calculation. The correct probability is actually \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\), but since this option isn't listed among the provided choices, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's options or in the interpretation of the problem. Given the calculation, none of the provided options (A through D) directly match the calculated probability of \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)."
