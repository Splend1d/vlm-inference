The inability to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA:\n- If a country does not have the right to freedom of association, then it cannot choose whether or not to enter into international agreements like NAFTA. Forcing Canada to join NAFTA would be an infringement on its autonomy if it has the right to freedom of association.\n\nB. The inability to explain why it would be wrong for the United States to forcefully annex Canada:\n- Similarly, if a country does not have the right to freedom of association, it cannot decide whether it wants to remain independent or become part of another country. Forcefully annexing Canada would violate its autonomy if it has the right to freedom of association.\n\nBoth scenarios (A and B) involve violating a country's autonomy by imposing external decisions upon it without its consent. Therefore, denying a country's right to freedom of association would indeed make it difficult to justify why these actions would be wrong.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both A and B"
