                    "text": "The concept of \"implied authorisation\" in international law, particularly within the context of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), refers to situations where the UNSC does not explicitly authorize an action but such authorization can be inferred from its actions or resolutions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned**:\n   - This suggests that if a state has been warned about potential threats, it can assume that the UNSC approves the use of armed force. However, this is not a standard interpretation of implied authorisation as it does not directly relate to the UNSC's implicit endorsement through its actions or resolutions.\n\nB. **Implicit authorisation on the basis of a specific number of votes by UNSC members**:\n   - This implies that a certain number of votes by UNSC members can lead to an implicit authorization. While voting patterns and resolutions can imply authorization, this option does not capture the essence of implied authorisation which is more about inference from broader actions or resolutions rather than a specific vote count.\n\nC. **Presumption that all unlawful attacks will be subject to armed force by a resolution of the UNSC**:\n   - This suggests a blanket presumption that any unlawful attack will automatically trigger armed force authorized by the UNSC. Implied authorisation does not work on such a broad and automatic basis; it requires specific circumstances or actions that can be interpreted as implicit approval.\n\nD. **In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation**:\n   - This option aligns closely with the concept of implied authorisation. It suggests that in response to repeated unlawful attacks, the UNSC may implicitly authorize neighboring states to take necessary measures without explicit resolution. This reflects a scenario where the UNSC's broader actions or resolutions can be interpreted as giving implicit permission for such measures.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate definition of implied authorisation is:\n\n**D. In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation.**\n\nThis option best captures the idea of implicit authorization derived from the UNSC's broader actions or resolutions."
