These vocalizations can travel for thousands of miles underwater and are used for communication and navigation. While African elephants (Option A) and Indian elephants (Option D) are also known for their loud trumpeting calls, they do not produce sounds as loud as those of blue whales. Sperm whales (Option B) are also known for their loud clicks, but these are not as loud as the vocalizations of blue whales."
