The rates of violent crime were similar for men and women.\n- This statement is generally not supported by most research on crime statistics, which typically show higher rates of violent crime among men compared to women.\n\nB. Women's sexual delinquency was more likely to be normalized than men's.\n- This could be related to societal norms and how different behaviors are perceived based on gender. However, this specific claim needs to be directly supported by Smart's work.\n\nC. Women's criminal behavior tended to reflect traditional gender roles.\n- This aligns with Smart's analysis of how gender roles influence criminal behavior. She argued that women's crimes often reflected their social roles and expectations.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate reflection of Smart's work seems to be:\n\nC. Women's criminal behavior tended to reflect traditional gender roles.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. Women's criminal behavior tended to reflect traditional gender roles."
