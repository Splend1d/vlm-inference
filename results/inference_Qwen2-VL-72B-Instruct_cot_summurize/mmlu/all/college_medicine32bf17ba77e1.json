Lead to death due to an inability of the cell to pass electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells.\n\nCytochrome oxidase A3 is a crucial component of the electron transport chain (ETC), which is responsible for the final step of aerobic respiration where electrons are passed to oxygen to form water. This process is essential for generating most of the ATP in the cell through oxidative phosphorylation. If a substance binds to and inhibits cytochrome oxidase A3, it would block the ETC, preventing the transfer of electrons to oxygen. As a result, aerobic respiration would be halted, leading to a significant reduction in ATP production and ultimately causing cellular asphyxiation and death."
