Therefore, the kinetic energy just before the brakes stop the elevator is equal to the initial potential energy:\n\\[ KE = PE = 980,000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nThe brakes must dissipate this kinetic energy in the form of heat to bring the elevator to rest. Thus, the heat dissipated by the brakes is:\n\\[ \\text{Heat} = KE = 980,000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nAmong the provided options, the closest value is:\n\nD. 1,000,000 J"
