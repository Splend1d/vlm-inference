Send the report with a covering letter indicating that the report may now be obsolete.\n\nWhen a psychologist receives a request for a patient's report, they should verify the authenticity of the request and ensure that the necessary permissions have been obtained. Assuming that the request is legitimate and the patient has authorized the release of their information, the psychologist should send the report along with a covering letter stating that the report may be outdated since it was created seven years ago. This is important because the patient's condition or circumstances might have changed significantly over time, and relying solely on an old report could lead to misinterpretations or inappropriate treatment decisions."
