This distinction can be used to challenge theories that equate all forms of pleasure with self-interest.\n\nGiven this context, Feinberg\u2019s remarks would most directly refute **psychological egoistic hedonism**, because this theory specifically claims that all actions are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure. By distinguishing between different types of pleasure, Feinberg could argue against the idea that all pleasure is sought for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Psychological egoistic hedonism."
