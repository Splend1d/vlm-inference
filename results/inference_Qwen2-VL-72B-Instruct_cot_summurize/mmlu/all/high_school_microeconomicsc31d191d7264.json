                    "text": "Let's analyze each option in relation to the concept of wage elasticity of demand:\n\nA. **Greater the proportion of capital costs to labor costs in the production of goods**: Wage elasticity of demand refers to how responsive the quantity demanded of labor is to changes in wages. If the wage elasticity of demand is high, it means that small changes in wages lead to large changes in the quantity of labor demanded. This does not directly relate to the proportion of capital costs to labor costs. The proportion of capital to labor costs depends on the technology and production methods used, not necessarily on the elasticity of demand for labor.\n\nB. **Greater the price elasticity for the product produced by labor**: Price elasticity of demand for a product measures how much the quantity demanded of that product responds to a change in its price. Wage elasticity of demand for labor measures how much the quantity of labor demanded responds to a change in wages. These two concepts are related but distinct. A higher wage elasticity of demand suggests that firms can easily substitute labor with other inputs or reduce their workforce when wages rise. However, this does not directly imply anything about the price elasticity of the product itself.\n\nC. **Smaller the number of substitutes for labor**: If the wage elasticity of demand is high, it implies that there are many substitutes available for labor. Firms can easily switch to other inputs or methods when wages increase. Therefore, a higher wage elasticity of demand would suggest a larger number of substitutes for labor, not a smaller one.\n\nD. **Smaller the time period**: Wage elasticity of demand tends to be higher in the long run because firms have more time to adjust their production processes and find substitutes for labor. In the short run, adjustments are limited due to fixed factors of production. Thus, a higher wage elasticity of demand is associated with longer time periods rather than shorter ones.\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the options directly and accurately describe the relationship with a higher wage elasticity of demand. However, if we must choose the closest match, it would be:\n\n**C. the smaller the number of substitutes for labor**\n\nThis is because a higher wage elasticity of demand actually implies the opposite (more substitutes), making this option the least accurate among the choices provided."
