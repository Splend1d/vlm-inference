Dr. Jones considers Lisa to be a very attractive woman and finds himself having sexual fantasies about her. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Jones should:\n\nA. recognize that such attraction is normal but proceed with caution.\nB. confess his attraction to Lisa and make it a topic for mutual examination in therapy.\nC. recognize that such attraction is inappropriate and refer Lisa to another therapist without explaining the reason to her.\nD. continue working with Lisa but consult with a colleague if he believes his attraction might be interfering with his objectivity.\n"

Consulting with a colleague can provide support and guidance on how to manage these feelings appropriately while continuing to provide effective therapy to Lisa. If the attraction becomes too strong or if it starts to impact his ability to remain objective and professional, referring Lisa to another therapist would be the appropriate course of action. However, this decision should be made carefully and communicated professionally to Lisa, ideally providing a clear explanation that respects her dignity and the therapeutic relationship."
