It might be against the law in some jurisdictions due to consumer protection laws, but it is not typically viewed as a morally reprehensible act.\n- Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I don't need to study for the test anymore because the answers are in my pocket where I can retrieve them.\"\n- This action involves cheating on a test by having the answers readily available during the exam.\n- Cheating is widely considered morally wrong and unethical in educational settings.\n- Therefore, this action is morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
