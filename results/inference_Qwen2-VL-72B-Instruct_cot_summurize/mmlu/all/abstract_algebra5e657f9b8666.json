The operations in \\(R/I\\) are defined as \\((r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I\\) and \\((r + I)(s + I) = rs + I\\).\n\n**Proof**:\n- Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and \\(I\\) be an ideal of \\(R\\).\n- Consider two arbitrary elements \\(a + I\\) and \\(b + I\\) in \\(R/I\\).\n- Since \\(R\\) is commutative, we have \\(ab = ba\\).\n- Therefore, \\((a + I)(b + I) = ab + I = ba + I = (b + I)(a + I)\\).\n- This shows that the multiplication operation in \\(R/I\\) is also commutative.\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: An ideal \\(N\\) in a ring \\(R\\) with unity \\(1\\) is all of \\(R\\) if and only if \\(1\\) in \\(N\\).\n- **Definition**: An ideal \\(N\\) in a ring \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) such that for any \\(n \\in N\\) and \\(r \\in R\\), both \\(rn\\) and \\(nr\\) are in \\(N\\).\n- **Unity \\(1\\)**: In a ring with unity, there exists an element \\(1\\) such that for any \\(r \\in R\\), \\(1r = r1 = r\\).\n\n**Proof**:\n- If \\(1 \\in N\\), then for any \\(r \\in R\\), since \\(N\\) is an ideal, \\(r \\cdot 1 = r\\) must be in \\(N\\). Thus, \\(N = R\\).\n- Conversely, if \\(N = R\\), then \\(1 \\in R\\) implies \\(1 \\in N\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
