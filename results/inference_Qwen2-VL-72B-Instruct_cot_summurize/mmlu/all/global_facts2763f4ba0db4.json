However, over the past few decades, there has been substantial progress in closing this gap. In many countries, especially developed ones, women now have similar or even higher levels of educational attainment than men.\n\nGiven that 30-year-old men have spent an average of 10 years in school, it is reasonable to assume that women of the same age would have spent a comparable amount of time in school, considering the improvements in access to education for women.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is:\n\nA. 12 years"
