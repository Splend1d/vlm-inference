Hotels provide towels for guests' use during their stay but expect them to be returned.\n- This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves taking property that does not belong to you without permission.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"Because I've been nervous about retirement, I decided to take money out of the cash register at my job.\"\n- Taking money from a cash register at your job without permission is clearly theft. It involves misappropriating funds that belong to your employer.\n- This action is unequivocally morally wrong as it constitutes stealing and violates trust and ethical responsibilities in the workplace.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
