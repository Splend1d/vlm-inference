The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old.\n2. The first hominins (early human ancestors) appeared around 6 million years ago.\n\nLet's calculate the proportion of time that has passed since the universe began until the appearance of the earliest members of the human family:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ million years}}{13.8 \\text{ billion years}} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^6}{13.8 \\times 10^9} \\approx 0.000435 \\]\n\nThis fraction represents the portion of the movie where the earliest members of the human family would appear. To find out how many minutes this corresponds to in a two-hour (120-minute) movie:\n\n\\[ 120 \\text{ minutes} \\times 0.000435 \\approx 0.0522 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nConverting this to seconds:\n\n\\[ 0.0522 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} \\approx 3.13 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the earliest members of the human family would appear very close to the end of the movie, specifically during the final few seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. during the final 3 seconds of the film"
