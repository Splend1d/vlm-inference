                    "text": "To find the value of $p + q$, we first need to understand how the given polynomial can have a degree of $2$. The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of the variable in that polynomial. \n\nGiven the expression:\n\\[\n(x^2+5x+6)^2+(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the first part, $(x^2+5x+6)^2$, will result in terms with degrees up to $4$ because when you square a quadratic term, the highest degree term squared is $(x^2)^2 = x^4$. \n\nThe second part, $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$, when expanded, will also have terms with degrees up to $4$ because multiplying a linear term by a cubic term gives a quartic term: $px \\cdot x^3 = px^4$.\n\nFor the entire polynomial to have a degree of $2$, it means that all terms with powers higher than $2$ must cancel out when the two parts are combined. This implies that the coefficients of $x^4$ and $x^3$ terms must be zero after combining both parts.\n\nLet's focus on the $x^4$ term since this is the highest degree term that could potentially appear:\n\nFrom the first part, $(x^2+5x+6)^2$, the $x^4$ term comes from squaring $x^2$, so its coefficient is $1^2 = 1$.\n\nFrom the second part, $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$, the $x^4$ term comes from multiplying $px$ by $x^3$, so its coefficient is $p \\cdot 1 = p$.\n\nFor the overall polynomial to have a degree of $2$, the sum of these coefficients must be zero:\n\\[1 + p = 0\\]\n\\[p = -1\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the $x^3$ term. From the first part, there won't be an $x^3$ term because the highest degree term in $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ is $x^4$. So, any $x^3$ term must come from the second part.\n\nIn the second part, $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$, the $x^3$ term comes from multiplying $px$ by $7x^2$ and $q$ by $x^3$. So, its coefficient is $7p + q$.\n\nSince the overall polynomial should not have an $x^3$ term for it to have a degree of $2$, we set this equal to zero:\n\\[7p + q = 0\\]\n\nWe already know $p = -1$, so substituting this into the equation gives:\n\\[7(-1) + q = 0\\]\n\\[-7 + q = 0\\]\n\\[q = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, $p + q = -1 + 7 = 6$, but this option is not listed among your choices. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the provided options. Based on the calculations, none of the provided options (A. -2, B. -4, C. -1, D. 1) match the correct answer of $6$. Please review the question or the context to ensure accuracy."
