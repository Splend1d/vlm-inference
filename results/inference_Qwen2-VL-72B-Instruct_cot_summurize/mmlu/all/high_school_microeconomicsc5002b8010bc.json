One can have comparative advantage in producing both goods.\n\nIn the context of trade theory, comparative advantage refers to the ability of a country or entity to produce a particular good at a lower opportunity cost compared to another country or entity. It is based on the relative efficiency of production rather than absolute efficiency. According to the principle of comparative advantage, it is not possible for one party to have a comparative advantage in producing both goods simultaneously because comparative advantage is determined by relative efficiency, and if one party has a comparative advantage in one good, the other party must have a comparative advantage in the other good.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
