The GDP deflator.\n\nThe GDP deflator is a measure that shows how much prices have changed over time for all new goods and services produced within a country. It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP (GDP at current prices) by real GDP (GDP at constant prices) and multiplying by 100. This gives an indication of the overall price level of the economy's output.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the best measures:\n\nA. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. While it is a widely used measure of inflation, it does not cover the entire range of goods and services produced in an economy, only those purchased by households.\n\nB. The Real Interest Rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. It reflects the purchasing power of money saved or borrowed, but it is not a direct measure of the price level of national product.\n\nC. The Unemployment Rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment. It is an indicator of economic health but does not directly measure changes in the price level of national product."
