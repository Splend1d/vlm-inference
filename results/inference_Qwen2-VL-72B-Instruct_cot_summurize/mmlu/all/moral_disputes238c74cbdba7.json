This aligns with the broader discussion about global justice and the responsibilities of various nations and individuals in addressing climate change.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**A. The dispersion of the impacts of emissions of greenhouse gases to other actors and regions of the Earth**."
