She often discusses the importance of a virtue-based approach to ethics, which emphasizes character development and the cultivation of good habits.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Rationalism**: This philosophical view emphasizes reason as the primary source of knowledge or justification. While rationalism can be important in ethical theory, it does not specifically align with the idea of turning to a virtue-based approach.\n\nB. **Empiricism**: This philosophical view emphasizes experience and evidence gathered through the senses as the basis for knowledge. Again, while empirical evidence can inform ethical theories, it does not directly connect with the concept of virtues.\n\nC. **Relativism**: This philosophical view suggests that points of view have no absolute truth or validity, having only relative, subjective value according to differences in perception and consideration. Virtue ethics can sometimes be associated with relativism because it focuses on the context-dependent nature of virtues and their application.\n\nD. **Absolutism**: This philosophical view holds that certain principles or truths are universally valid and unchanging. Absolutism contrasts with the more flexible and context-sensitive nature of virtue ethics.\n\nGiven Nussbaum's emphasis on the importance of virtues and her critique of overly rigid ethical frameworks, the most fitting connection would be with relativism, as virtue ethics often involves considering the context and nuances of situations rather than applying rigid, universal rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. relativism."
