This can be translated into propositional logic using an implication (\\( \\supset \\)) and a disjunction (\\( \\lor \\)):\n\n\\[ (H \\lor \\neg G) \\supset J \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( H \\lor (\\neg G \\supset J) \\)\nThis formula suggests that either Harry enrolls or if George does not enroll, then Jim enrolls. This does not match the original sentence because it separates the conditions incorrectly.\n\nB. \\( \\neg(H \\lor G) \\supset J \\)\nThis formula suggests that if it is not the case that either Harry enrolls or George enrolls, then Jim enrolls. This does not match the original sentence because it negates both conditions together instead of considering them separately.\n\nC. \\( (H \\lor \\neg G) \\supset J \\)\nThis formula correctly represents the original sentence: If either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll, then Jim enrolls.\n\nD. \\( (H \\supset \\neg G) \\lor J \\)\nThis formula suggests that either if Harry enrolls then George does not enroll, or Jim enrolls. This does not match the original sentence because it incorrectly combines the conditions with an implication and a disjunction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( (H \\lor \\neg G) \\supset J \\)"
