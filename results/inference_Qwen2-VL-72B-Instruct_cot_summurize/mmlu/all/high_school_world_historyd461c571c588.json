He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nHow did the events depicted here affect Koreans?\n\nA. They became a part of Japan\u2019s territory.\nB. The Americans established freedom for all Koreans.\nC. The Korean economy never recovered.\nD. Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\n"

The primary concern was to prevent Soviet control over the entire Korean peninsula.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - Bonesteel aimed to establish a surrender zone as far north as possible to limit Soviet influence.\n   - He knew the Soviet troops could reach Korea before American troops.\n   - The nearest American troops were 600 miles away on Okinawa.\n   - He decided to use the 38th parallel as a dividing line for surrender arrangements between American and Russian authorities.\n\n3. **Implications for Koreans**:\n   - The use of the 38th parallel as a dividing line led to the partition of Korea.\n   - This division has had long-lasting effects, resulting in the current division of Korea into North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and South Korea (Republic of Korea).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel."
