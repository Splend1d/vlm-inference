However, the question specifies \"some of the oldest painted art in the world,\" which implies a much older timeframe.\n\nB. **animals and hand stencils from more than 35,000 to about 40,000 years ago**\n   - This option places the paintings in a very ancient period (more than 35,000 to about 40,000 years ago), which aligns with the description of being among the oldest painted art.\n\nC. **animals and hand stencils from more than 45,000 to about 100,000 years ago**\n   - This option suggests an even older timeframe (more than 45,000 to about 100,000 years ago), which is also consistent with the description of being among the oldest painted art.\n\nD. **animals and abstract geometric shapes from 15,000 to more than 100,000 years ago**\n   - This option includes a wide range of dates (from 15,000 to more than 100,000 years ago) and mentions abstract geometric shapes, which might not be typical for the earliest known cave paintings.\n\nGiven the context and the need to identify the oldest painted art, options B and C are strong contenders. However, option C provides a broader and potentially more accurate timeframe for the oldest known cave paintings.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. animals and hand stencils from more than 45,000 to about 100,000 years ago**"
