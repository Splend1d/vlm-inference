Complex question\n\nAsking a question that includes an unproven assumption can lead to the complex question fallacy, also known as the many questions fallacy or plurium interrogationum. This occurs when a question is asked in such a way that it presupposes certain facts or circumstances that have not been established or proven. The person answering the question is then put in a position where they must either accept the unproven assumption or reject the entire question."
