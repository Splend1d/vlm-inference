When the primary motor cortex is active, it sends signals to the muscles that result in their contraction. These signals travel through the spinal cord and peripheral nerves to reach the muscles.\n\nThe primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain, and its activity is typically associated with the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body (contralateral). This means that if the primary motor cortex in the left hemisphere is active, it will result in the contraction of muscles on the right side of the body, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. contraction of contralateral limb musculature."
