He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?\n\nA. Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes\nB. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches\nC. Impaired chemotaxis\nD. Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n"

Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n\nThe nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test showing no color change suggests a defect in the respiratory burst of neutrophils, which is indicative of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is characterized by impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism, leading to recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms such as Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's history of recurrent infections and the specific type of infection support this diagnosis."
