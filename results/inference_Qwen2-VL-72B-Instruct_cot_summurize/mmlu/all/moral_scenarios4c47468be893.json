Encouraging children to engage in behavior that could lead to serious health issues like skin cancer is morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I took off my pants while I was in the bank.\"\n- This action is inappropriate and violates social norms regarding public behavior. It is generally considered morally wrong to expose oneself inappropriately in public places such as banks.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
