Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.\n\nIn a randomized block design, blocking is used to control for variables that could affect the outcome of the experiment. Since the pharmaceutical company anticipates an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets, blocking on exercise level would help to ensure that any observed differences in cholesterol levels can be attributed to the drug rather than the confounding effect of exercise. Blocking on gender, which is not anticipated to have a significant association with cholesterol level, would not provide the same benefit. Blocking on the type of drug would not make sense since the purpose of the experiment is to compare the two drugs."
