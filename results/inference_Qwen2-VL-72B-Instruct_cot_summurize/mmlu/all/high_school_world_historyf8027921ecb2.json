That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nCrosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans\n\nThe passage discusses the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents, which aligns with the historical context of European colonization of the Americas during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. This period saw extensive exploration, conquest, and settlement by Europeans, leading to significant changes in the demographics, economies, and environments of the Americas."
