In one species of rabbit, the ones that evolved in the cold, snowy north are white, while the ones that evolved in the south are brown.\n\nThis is an example of a cline because it describes a gradual change in a trait (fur color) across a geographic gradient (from north to south). A cline refers to a continuous variation of a trait along a geographic gradient."
