Therefore, for a sequence of \\( n \\) elements, there are \\( 2^n \\) possible combinations.\n\nLet's calculate the number of combinations for each length:\n\n1. For a sequence of 1 element:\n\\[ 2^1 = 2 \\]\n\n2. For a sequence of 2 elements:\n\\[ 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\n3. For a sequence of 3 elements:\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\n4. For a sequence of 4 elements:\n\\[ 2^4 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, we add up all these combinations to get the total number of distinct symbols that can be represented:\n\n\\[ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 30."
