Seedbed Era, 1900 - 1917\n\nMuckraking journalism, which exposed corruption and social issues, was prominent during the early 20th century, particularly in the years leading up to World War I. This period is often referred to as the \"Seedbed Era\" for public relations because it was during this time that businesses began to recognize the need for managing their public image in response to the critical reporting by muckrakers. The efforts of journalists like Upton Sinclair, who wrote about the poor conditions in the meatpacking industry, and Ida Tarbell, who investigated the practices of Standard Oil, contributed to a climate where businesses felt the need to engage in public relations to counteract negative publicity."
