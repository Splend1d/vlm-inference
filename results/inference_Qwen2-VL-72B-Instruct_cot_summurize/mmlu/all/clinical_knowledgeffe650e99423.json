Grade 3/5 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale represents movement against gravity but not against resistance.\n\nB. Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle.\n- This statement is incorrect. Flexion at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle, not the triceps. The triceps muscle produces extension at the elbow.\n\nC. The root value of shoulder abduction is C5.\n- This statement is correct. The nerve root C5 is responsible for shoulder abduction.\n\nD. Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction.\n- This statement is incorrect. Grade 1/5 on the MRC scale represents a flicker or trace of muscle contraction, not no movement or muscle contraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The root value of shoulder abduction is C5."
