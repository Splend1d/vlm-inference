                    "text": "To determine which scenario will definitely increase the equilibrium price of corn, we need to analyze how shifts in supply and demand affect the market.\n\n1. **Both supply and demand shift rightward (Option A):**\n   - When both supply and demand curves shift to the right, it means that there is an increase in both the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at each price level.\n   - The effect on the equilibrium price depends on the relative magnitude of these shifts. If the increase in demand is greater than the increase in supply, the equilibrium price will rise. However, if the increase in supply is greater than the increase in demand, the equilibrium price may fall or remain unchanged.\n   - Therefore, this option does not guarantee an increase in the equilibrium price.\n\n2. **Both supply and demand shift leftward (Option B):**\n   - When both supply and demand curves shift to the left, it means that there is a decrease in both the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at each price level.\n   - Again, the effect on the equilibrium price depends on the relative magnitude of these shifts. If the decrease in demand is greater than the decrease in supply, the equilibrium price will fall. If the decrease in supply is greater than the decrease in demand, the equilibrium price may rise or remain unchanged.\n   - Thus, this option also does not guarantee an increase in the equilibrium price.\n\n3. **Supply shifts to the right; demand shifts to the left (Option C):**\n   - An increase in supply (rightward shift) typically leads to a lower equilibrium price because more units are available at each price level.\n   - A decrease in demand (leftward shift) typically leads to a lower equilibrium price because fewer units are desired at each price level.\n   - Combining these effects, the equilibrium price will likely decrease.\n   - Therefore, this option does not result in an increase in the equilibrium price.\n\n4. **Supply shifts to the left; demand shifts to the right (Option D):**\n   - A decrease in supply (leftward shift) typically leads to a higher equilibrium price because fewer units are available at each price level.\n   - An increase in demand (rightward shift) typically leads to a higher equilibrium price because more units are desired at each price level.\n   - Combining these effects, the equilibrium price will definitely increase.\n   - Therefore, this option results in an increase in the equilibrium price.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**D. Supply shifts to the left; demand shifts to the right.**"
