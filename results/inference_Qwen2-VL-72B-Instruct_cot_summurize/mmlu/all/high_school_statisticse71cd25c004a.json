The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n"

We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area under the curve to the left of this z-score.\n\nFor a z-score of 1.11, the area under the curve to the left is approximately 0.8665, which means Estrella's score falls at the 86.65th percentile.\n\nSince only those who score in the top 15% are invited back for further evaluation, and Estrella scored in the 86.65th percentile, she qualifies for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 86.65; she qualified."
