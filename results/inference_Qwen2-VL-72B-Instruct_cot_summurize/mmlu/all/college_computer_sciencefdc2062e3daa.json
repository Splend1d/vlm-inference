P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.\n\nExplanation:\n- **P_1 (Shortest Path Problem)**: This problem can indeed be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms efficiently find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted or unweighted graph, respectively.\n  \n- **P_2 (Longest Path Problem)**: This problem is significantly more challenging. The Longest Path Problem is NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for solving it. In fact, finding the longest simple path in an undirected graph is equivalent to the Hamiltonian Path problem, which is known to be NP-complete. Therefore, while we can solve the Shortest Path Problem efficiently, the Longest Path Problem remains computationally intractable unless P=NP, which has not been proven."
