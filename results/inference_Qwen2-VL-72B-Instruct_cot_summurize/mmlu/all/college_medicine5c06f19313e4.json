Rewards should ideally be non-food related or involve healthier options.\n\nC. **Snap himself with a rubber band when he eats a high calorie snack.**\n   - This option uses a form of aversion therapy to discourage eating high-calorie snacks, which can help in restricting caloric intake.\n\nD. **Hide snack food out of sight within his house.**\n   - This option reduces temptation by making high-calorie snacks less accessible, which can help in restricting caloric intake.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is NOT a good method to restrict caloric intake is:\n\n**B. Reward himself with a savory meal every Saturday for meeting his calorie goals.**\n\nThis option contradicts the goal of reducing caloric intake because it involves consuming high-calorie meals as rewards."
