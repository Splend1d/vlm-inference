The article was false, and was printed without adequate research. The doctor sued the newspaper company, claiming damages per se. The paper defended on the basis that this was a public interest article, that the paper was not reckless or malicious in its investigation and reporting, and that the doctor could not prove any special damages. Will the court adopt the defense reasoning and dismiss the case for failure to state a claim?\n\nA. Yes, the doctor is a professional figure in the community and he must accept the risk of false reporting, especially where he cannot prove any special damages.\nB. Yes, the newspaper is allowed to make mistakes as long as there is no malice, and the case must be dismissed as a matter of law.\nC. No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.\nD. No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.\n"

No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.\n\nIn defamation cases, certain types of statements are considered \"defamation per se,\" meaning they are inherently damaging and do not require proof of actual harm (special damages) to the plaintiff. Libel per se typically includes accusations of serious crimes, venereal diseases, and unfitness to practice a profession. Since the newspaper falsely accused the doctor of having a venereal disease, this would generally fall under libel per se, allowing the doctor to sue without needing to prove specific damages."
