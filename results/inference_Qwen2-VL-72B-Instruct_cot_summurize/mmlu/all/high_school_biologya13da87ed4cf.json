Small birds mutating their beak genes with the result that later-generation offspring have larger beaks.\nC. Small birds anticipating the long drought and eating more to gain weight and, consequently, growing larger beaks.\nD. More small-beaked birds dying than larger-beaked birds.

The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n\nThis scenario describes a classic example of natural selection. During a prolonged drought, the availability of small, easily eaten seeds decreases, while large, hard-cased seeds remain. Birds with larger beaks are better adapted to consume these large seeds, giving them a survival advantage over birds with smaller beaks. As a result, birds with smaller beaks are more likely to die due to lack of food, while those with larger beaks survive and reproduce. Over time, this leads to an increase in the frequency of genes for larger beaks in the population, resulting in subsequent generations having a higher percentage of birds with large beaks."
