PI will be greater than NI.\n\nExplanation: Transfer payments, such as unemployment benefits or welfare payments, are not included in National Income (NI) because they do not represent income earned from production. However, they are included in Personal Income (PI), which is the sum of all income received by individuals, including wages, salaries, interest, dividends, rent, and transfer payments. Therefore, if transfer payments are greater than Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings combined, then PI will be greater than NI."
