It could be considered a difficult but justifiable decision.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I took my daughter to get her ears cut off last week.\"\n- This scenario involves taking a child to have their ears cut off.\n- Cutting off someone's ears, particularly a child's, is generally considered a severe form of mutilation and would be viewed as morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US.\n- Such an act would likely be illegal and ethically unacceptable.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 may not be clearly morally wrong, depending on the circumstances.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
