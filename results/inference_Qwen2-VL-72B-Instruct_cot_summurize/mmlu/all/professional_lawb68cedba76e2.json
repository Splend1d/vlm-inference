When such a law is challenged in court, particularly if it involves discrimination based on alienage, the state bears the burden of proving that the statute serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This is because laws that discriminate against aliens are subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or other constitutional provisions. Therefore, the state must demonstrate a compelling reason for the restriction imposed by the statute."
