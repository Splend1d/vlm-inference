We use the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg A) \\]\n\\[ P(B) = (0.70 \\cdot 0.15) + (0.10 \\cdot 0.85) \\]\n\\[ P(B) = 0.105 + 0.085 \\]\n\\[ P(B) = 0.19 \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that a patient will be diagnosed with at least one of these conditions (either Condition A or Condition B). This can be calculated using the formula for the union of two events:\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\nSince \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) represents the probability of being diagnosed with both Condition A and Condition B, we can express it as:\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) \\]\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = 0.70 \\cdot 0.15 \\]\n\\[ P(A \\cap B) = 0.105 \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = 0.15 + 0.19 - 0.105 \\]\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = 0.235 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a patient with this set of symptoms will be diagnosed with at least one of these conditions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.235} \\]"
