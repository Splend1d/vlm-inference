It has the power to impose sanctions, authorize military action, and make binding resolutions that member states are obligated to follow. The Security Council consists of 15 members, five of which (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) are permanent members with veto power over substantive resolutions. This structure gives the Security Council significant influence within the UN system."
