The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. The validity of this treaty would most likely be upheld under which of the following principles?\n\nA. The presidential power to conduct foreign affairs.\nB. An ancillary power of the President under his treaty-making power.\nC. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\nD. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress.\n"

This is the standard procedure for validating treaties.\n\n4. **Treaty-Making Power, but Only if the Treaty is Ratified by a Majority in Congress**: This option is incorrect because treaties require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, not a simple majority in Congress.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.**\n\nThis option correctly reflects the constitutional requirement for treaty ratification in the United States."
