                    "text": "The spontaneity of a reaction can be determined by the sign of the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G). A negative \u0394G indicates a spontaneous reaction, while a positive \u0394G indicates a non-spontaneous reaction.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. At equilibrium, there are more products than reactants.\n- This statement describes the composition at equilibrium but does not directly indicate spontaneity. The spontaneity depends on the direction and magnitude of \u0394G, not just the relative amounts of products and reactants at equilibrium.\n\nB. The value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n- If \u0394G\u00b0 > 0, the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions. This option does not indicate spontaneity.\n\nC. The value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n- A positive \u0394S\u00b0 (increase in entropy) is favorable for spontaneity, but it alone does not guarantee spontaneity because spontaneity also depends on the enthalpy change (\u0394H) and temperature (T). However, an increase in entropy is often associated with spontaneous processes.\n\nD. The value of Keq is less than one.\n- The equilibrium constant (Keq) being less than one indicates that at equilibrium, the concentration of reactants is higher than that of products. This does not directly indicate spontaneity; it only tells us about the position of equilibrium.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most direct indicator of spontaneity from the options provided is:\n\nC. The value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that for a reaction to be spontaneous, \u0394G must be negative, which depends on both \u0394H and T\u0394S. An increase in entropy (\u0394S\u00b0 > 0) is a contributing factor to spontaneity but not the sole determinant."
