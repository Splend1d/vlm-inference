To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\n\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which plan is better for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school, let's analyze each plan step-by-step.\n\n### Plan I:\n- **Sampling Method**: Randomly select 30 students out of 1650.\n- **Estimation Process**: Calculate the average investment of these 30 students and construct a confidence interval around this average.\n- **Scaling Up**: Multiply both ends of the confidence interval by 1650 to estimate the total investment.\n\n### Plan II:\n- **Sampling Method**: Randomly select 30 students out of the 132 who already have investments.\n- **Estimation Process**: Calculate the average investment of these 30 students and construct a confidence interval around this average.\n- **Scaling Up**: Multiply both ends of the confidence interval by 132 to estimate the total investment.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Plan I:\n- This plan assumes that the 30 randomly selected students are representative of the entire student body (1650 students).\n- However, only 132 students out of 1650 have investments, meaning that the majority of the student population does not invest in the stock market.\n- By sampling from the entire student body, the sample may include many students who do not invest, leading to an underestimate of the average investment per investor.\n- The resulting confidence interval will likely be too narrow because it includes non-investors, thus underestimating the true variability in investments.\n\n#### Plan II:\n- This plan focuses on the subset of students who actually invest in the stock market.\n- By sampling from the 132 investors, the sample will accurately reflect the investment behavior of those who invest.\n- The confidence interval constructed from this sample will provide a more precise estimate of the average investment among investors.\n- Multiplying this interval by 132 gives a more accurate estimate of the total investment by the investing students.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlan II is better because it directly targets the group of interest (students with investments) and provides a more accurate representation of their investment behavior. Plan I, by including non-investors, introduces unnecessary noise and bias into the estimation process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Plan II**"
