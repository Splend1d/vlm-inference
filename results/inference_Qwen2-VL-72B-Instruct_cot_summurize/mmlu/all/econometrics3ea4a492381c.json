The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples\n\nIn the context of testing for structural stability, the unrestricted residual sum of squares (RSS) refers to the RSS obtained from estimating the regression model on the entire sample without imposing any restrictions. When the sample is split into two sub-samples and each sub-sample is used to estimate separate regression models, the unrestricted RSS is the sum of the RSS from each of these sub-sample regressions. This is because the unrestricted model allows for different parameter estimates in each sub-sample, capturing potential structural changes within the data."
