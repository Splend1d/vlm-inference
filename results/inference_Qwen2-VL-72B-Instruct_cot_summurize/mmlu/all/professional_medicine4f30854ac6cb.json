The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia\n\nSince the patient's father had classic hemophilia, she has a 50% chance of being a carrier of the hemophilia gene on her X chromosome. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning males (XY) are more likely to express the condition if they inherit the affected X chromosome because they do not have a second X chromosome to compensate with a normal gene.\n\nGiven that the fetus is XY, there is a 50% chance that the fetus inherited the affected X chromosome from the mother and thus would have hemophilia. There is also a 50% chance that the fetus inherited the normal X chromosome and would not have hemophilia. Since the fetus is male, he cannot be a carrier of the gene as carriers are typically females (XX) who can have one normal and one affected X chromosome."
