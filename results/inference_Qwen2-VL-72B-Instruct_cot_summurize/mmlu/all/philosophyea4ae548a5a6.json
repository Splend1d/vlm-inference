A moral saint might prioritize activities that have more direct moral value.\n\nB. **cannot have a sarcastic wit**:\n   - A sarcastic wit can be seen as a form of humor that might not align with the serious and earnest nature of a moral saint's character.\n\nC. **cannot have an interest in gourmet cooking**:\n   - An interest in gourmet cooking is another form of personal pleasure that might not be considered essential for a moral saint's dedication to moral pursuits.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that each of these options reflects a potential limitation on the personal interests and activities of a moral saint. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer would be:\n\nD. **all of the above**.\n\nThus, the final answer is D."
