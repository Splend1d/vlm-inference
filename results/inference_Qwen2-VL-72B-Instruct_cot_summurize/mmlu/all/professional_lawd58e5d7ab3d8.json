Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions. The owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is\n\nA. the bartender.\nB. the counselor.\nC. the dentist.\nD. the engineer.\n"

This deed is recorded.\n4. **Bartender to Dentist**: The bartender conveys the land to the dentist. This deed is recorded immediately after its execution.\n5. **Counselor to Engineer**: The counselor conveys the land to the engineer. This deed is recorded immediately after its execution.\n\nIn a notice jurisdiction, the first person to record their deed generally has priority over subsequent grantees who have not yet recorded their deeds. Here's the timeline of recording:\n\n- Developer to Artist: Recorded\n- Artist to Bartender: Recorded\n- Artist to Counselor: Recorded\n- Bartender to Dentist: Recorded\n- Counselor to Engineer: Recorded\n\nSince all deeds were recorded in the order they were executed, there are no overlaps or conflicts regarding the recording dates. Therefore, the last person to receive and record a valid deed is the final owner.\n\nThe final deed recorded is from the counselor to the engineer. Thus, the engineer is the owner of the parcel of land.\n\n**Final Answer: D. the engineer.**"
