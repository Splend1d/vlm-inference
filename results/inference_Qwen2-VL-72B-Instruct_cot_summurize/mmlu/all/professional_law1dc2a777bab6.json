A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train \"Wait for me!\" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?\n\nA. Duty.\nB. Breach.\nC. Cause-in-fact.\nD. Proximate or legal causation.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which element of the coffee shop customer's negligence claim against the railroad she would be unable to satisfy, let's break down each element of negligence:\n\n1. **Duty**: This refers to the obligation owed by the defendant (the railroad) to the plaintiff (the coffee shop customer). In general, a railroad has a duty to ensure the safety of its premises and operations.\n\n2. **Breach**: This involves the failure to meet the standard of care expected under the circumstances. Here, the railroad worker pushed the man onto the train, causing him to drop the box containing fireworks, which led to the accident.\n\n3. **Cause-in-fact (Actual Causation)**: This is the direct link between the breach and the harm suffered by the plaintiff. In this case, the railroad worker\u2019s action directly led to the man dropping the box, which ignited the fireworks, causing the rocket to hit the coffee shop.\n\n4. **Proximate or Legal Causation**: This concerns whether the harm was reasonably foreseeable and whether the chain of events leading to the harm was too remote or extraordinary to hold the defendant liable.\n\nGiven these elements, the most challenging one for the plaintiff to prove would likely be:\n\n**D. Proximate or Legal Causation**\n\nThe chain of events leading to the injury is quite complex and involves multiple unforeseeable factors:\n- The man running towards the train with a box of fireworks.\n- The railroad worker pushing the man, causing him to drop the box.\n- The box containing fireworks, which is not a typical item to be found at a train station.\n- The ignition of the fireworks and the rocket flying across the station.\n- The rocket hitting the coffee shop and causing the shelf to fall.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of unlikely and extraordinary events that make it difficult to argue that the railroad could have reasonably foreseen such an outcome. Therefore, the plaintiff might struggle to establish that the railroad's actions were the proximate cause of her injury.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Proximate or legal causation.**"
