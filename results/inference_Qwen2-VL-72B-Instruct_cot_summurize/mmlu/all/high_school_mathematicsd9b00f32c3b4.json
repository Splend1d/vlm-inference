The innermost fraction is $\\frac{1}{x}$. This fraction is undefined when $x=0$, because division by zero is undefined.\n\n2. The next fraction is $1 + \\frac{1}{x}$. This fraction is undefined when $\\frac{1}{x} = -1$, or $x = -1$.\n\n3. The outermost fraction is $1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}$. This fraction is undefined when $1 + \\frac{1}{x} = -1$, or $\\frac{1}{x} = -2$, or $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the three values of $x$ that are not in the domain of $f(x)$ are $0$, $-1$, and $-\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nThe sum of these three numbers is $0 + (-1) + (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-1.5}$."
