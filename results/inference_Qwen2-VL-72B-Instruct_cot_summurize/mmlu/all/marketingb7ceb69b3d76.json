These three elements together can support long-term economic development by ensuring sustainability, fairness, and economic growth.\n\n3. **Evolutionary, equitable, and economic**: This option includes equitable and economic aspects, which are relevant, but the inclusion of evolutionary does not align well with the focus on economic development.\n\n4. **Ecological, equitable, and emerging**: This option includes ecological and equitable aspects, which are relevant, but \"emerging\" does not clearly relate to the focus on long-term versus short-term economic development.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate option that aligns with encouraging long-term economic development while considering sustainability and fairness is:\n\n**B.
