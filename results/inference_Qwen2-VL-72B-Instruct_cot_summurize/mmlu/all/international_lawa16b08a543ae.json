The courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction.\n\nIn English law, the courts have discretion to stay proceedings if they consider it an abuse of process. However, this is a rare occurrence and depends on the specific circumstances of each case. Extra-territorial abduction can be considered an abuse of process, but it does not automatically lead to a stay of proceedings. The court will weigh various factors before making a decision, including the interests of justice and the nature of the case."
