IVF involves fertilizing eggs outside the body and then transferring the resulting embryos back into the uterus. This process can help identify and select the healthiest embryos for transfer, potentially reducing the risk of miscarriage. Additionally, IVF can be combined with genetic screening to further enhance the chances of a successful pregnancy."
