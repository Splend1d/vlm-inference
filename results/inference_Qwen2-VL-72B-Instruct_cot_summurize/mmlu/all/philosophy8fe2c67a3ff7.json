However, the pleasure derived from tasting food (gustatory sensations) is also an integral part of the eating experience and can be a secondary desire when hungry.\n\nConsidering these points, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is:\n\n**C. both a and b.**\n\nThus, Feinberg claims that when people are hungry, they typically desire both to eat food and to experience pleasant gustatory sensations."
