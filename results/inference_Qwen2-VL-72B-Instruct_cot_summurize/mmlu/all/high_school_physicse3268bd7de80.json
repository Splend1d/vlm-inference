Since \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is perpendicular to \\( \\mathbf{B} \\), \\( \\sin\\theta = 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( F = |q| v B \\).\n   - For circular motion, this force must equal the centripetal force \\( F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circular path.\n   - Setting these forces equal gives us \\( |q| v B = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\).\n   - Solving for \\( r \\), we get \\( r = \\frac{m v}{|q| B} \\).\n\nSince the electron has a negative charge \\( q = -e \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{m v}{|-e| B} = \\frac{m v}{e B} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**B.
