Several codons code for the same amino acid.\n\nThis statement explains how a point mutation can have no negative impact on the protein formed from a DNA sequence because of the redundancy in the genetic code. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Therefore, if a point mutation occurs in a codon, it may result in another codon that codes for the same amino acid, leading to no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein and thus no negative impact on its function."
