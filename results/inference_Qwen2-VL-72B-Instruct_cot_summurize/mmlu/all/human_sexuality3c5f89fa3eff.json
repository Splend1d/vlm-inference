Avalon could not contract genital herpes from performing fellatio (oral-genital sex) on the guy.\n- This statement is incorrect. Genital herpes can be transmitted through oral-genital contact.\n\nB. If Avalon contracted genital herpes, she can be cured with antibiotics if administered immediately after the first occurrence.\n- This statement is incorrect. Genital herpes is caused by a virus (herpes simplex virus), not bacteria, so it cannot be cured with antibiotics. Antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of outbreaks but do not cure the infection.\n\nC. If Avalon contracted genital herpes, she will only be contagious when she has a break out.\n- This statement is also incorrect. People with genital herpes can be contagious even when they have no visible symptoms or outbreaks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. none of the above."
