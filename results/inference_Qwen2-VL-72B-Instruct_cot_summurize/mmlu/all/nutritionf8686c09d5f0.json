In childhood, adolescence and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age\n\nBone mineral accretion, or the process of bone density increase, is crucial during growth periods such as childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Adequate bone mineral accretion during these times helps build strong bones that can reduce the risk of fractures later in life, especially in older age when bone density naturally declines."
