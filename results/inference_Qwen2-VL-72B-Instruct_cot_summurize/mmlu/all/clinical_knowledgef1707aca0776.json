Type IIX fibres.\n\nType IIX (also known as Type IIb) fibers are fast-twitch muscle fibers that are primarily used for short bursts of high-intensity activity, such as sprinting. They have a high capacity for anaerobic metabolism and can generate a lot of force quickly, but they also fatigue more rapidly than other fiber types due to their reliance on anaerobic pathways for energy production. Therefore, during an all-out exercise like sprinting, these fibers are the first to fatigue."
