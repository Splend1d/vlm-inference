There is no harm or unethical behavior involved in this scenario.\n- This action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I wanted my parents to let me quit piano lessons so I asked them.\"\n- Asking parents for permission to quit piano lessons is a reasonable request and falls within the realm of personal choice and communication with family members.\n- This action is also not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that neither scenario involves actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
