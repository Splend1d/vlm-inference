Displaced apex beat; soft first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; short mid-diastolic murmur\n\nThis combination of clinical features is most suggestive of mixed mitral valve disease with a predominance of mitral regurgitation. The displaced apex beat indicates left ventricular enlargement, which can occur due to the volume overload from mitral regurgitation. The soft first heart sound (S1) suggests reduced leaflet coaptation, which is characteristic of mitral regurgitation. The pan-systolic murmur is also indicative of mitral regurgitation, as it occurs throughout systole. Lastly, the short mid-diastolic murmur could be due to relative mitral stenosis, which can occur in mixed mitral valve disease."
