In this case, the psychologist believes that positive rewards are more effective than punishment in promoting good behavior in children. This implies that the mean \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving positive rewards (\u03bc1) should be greater than the mean \"proper behavior\" rating for children receiving punishment (\u03bc2).\n\nTherefore, the proper statement of the alternative hypothesis (HA) would be:\n\nA. HA: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 > 0\n\nThis indicates that the psychologist expects the difference between the two means to be positive, suggesting that positive rewards lead to higher \"proper behavior\" ratings compared to punishment."
