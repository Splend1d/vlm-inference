Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).\n\nPeople with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from donors who have either blood type B (rhesus negative) or blood type O (rhesus negative). This is because they lack the rhesus factor and should not receive blood from someone who has it to avoid an immune reaction. Additionally, they can receive blood from type O donors because type O blood is considered the universal donor and does not contain A or B antigens that could cause an immune response in the recipient."
