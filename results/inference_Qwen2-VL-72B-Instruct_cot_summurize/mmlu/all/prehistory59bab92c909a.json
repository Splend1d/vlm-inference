Art and iconography often reflect cultural and religious themes, which could indicate a common set of beliefs.\n\nB. **Agricultural surpluses that led to the creation of economic inequalities**: While agricultural surpluses might have influenced economic structures, this does not directly address how these surpluses would bind people together across different territories.\n\nC. **They spoke the same language and were related by kinship and marriage**: Language and kinship ties can be strong unifiers, but there is no specific evidence provided here that the Olmec spoke the same language or were related by kinship and marriage across different territories.\n\nD. **A system of trade and exchange, as seen in tokens used as a form of money**: Trade and exchange systems can indeed bind societies together, but the mention of tokens as a form of money is more indicative of economic activity rather than a cultural or social binding factor.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**A. Underlying religious beliefs, as seen in Olmec art and iconography**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that shared cultural and religious practices could serve as a unifying force among the Olmec people across different territories."
