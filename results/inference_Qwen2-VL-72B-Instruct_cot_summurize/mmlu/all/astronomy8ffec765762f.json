The atmosphere on Mars is too thin to trap a significant amount of heat.\n\nThe greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in a planet's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, absorb and emit infrared radiation, trapping heat and warming the planet's surface. On Earth, this effect is driven by gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, methane, and others.\n\nWhile Mars does have an atmosphere composed mostly of CO2, it is much thinner than Earth's atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is only about 0.6% of Earth's sea-level atmospheric pressure. This thin atmosphere means there are fewer molecules to absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, resulting in a weaker greenhouse effect compared to Earth. As a result, despite having a high concentration of CO2, Mars does not experience a strong greenhouse effect capable of significantly warming its surface."
