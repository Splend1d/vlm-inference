This theory suggests that different situations require different leadership styles and that successful leaders adapt their approach based on the specific circumstances they face.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Environment\n\nThis choice reflects the emphasis on the situational context in which leadership occurs, including the environment, tasks, and followers' characteristics."
