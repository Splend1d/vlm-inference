He defined social facts as the ways in which individuals are influenced by the collective forces within society, such as norms, values, and institutions. Durkheim believed that these social facts were external to individuals and had a coercive power over them, shaping their behavior and thoughts. Therefore, he emphasized the importance of studying social facts to understand how societies function and how they can be improved."
