She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?\n\nA. Inactivation of cellular p53\nB. Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX\n"

Inactivation of cellular p53\n\nThis is because cervical cancer, which is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, frequently involves the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53. HPV can integrate its DNA into the host genome, leading to the overexpression of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which inactivate p53 and another tumor suppressor protein, RB, respectively. This inactivation leads to uncontrolled cell division and the development of cancer."
