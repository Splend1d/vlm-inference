She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?\n\nA. Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care\nB. Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings\nC. Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do\nD. Order the MRI as the patient requests\n"

Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings\n\nThe most appropriate initial action for the physician in this situation is to explain to the patient that based on the current examination findings, there is no medical indication for an MRI. It is important to maintain honesty and integrity in the patient-physician relationship and to avoid misrepresenting the patient's condition to obtain unnecessary tests. The physician should discuss the patient's concerns and fears about cancer, provide reassurance, and consider referring her for counseling or support if needed. Additionally, the physician should educate the patient about the importance of evidence-based medicine and the potential risks and costs associated with unnecessary imaging studies."
