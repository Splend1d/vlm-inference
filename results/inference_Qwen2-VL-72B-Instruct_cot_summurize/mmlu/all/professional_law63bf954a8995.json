The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the walk was covered by a thick sheet of ice, which had been negligently left there for several days by the defendant. In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: \"During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?\"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\nB. admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.\nC. inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.\nD. inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.\n"

In this case, the defendant's counsel is attempting to introduce hearsay evidence (the plaintiff's statement to the physician) through the physician's testimony. For such evidence to be admissible, the attorney must first establish a proper foundation showing that the statement was made under circumstances that would make it reliable and relevant to the case.\n\nThe question posed by the defendant's counsel does not provide any indication that the foundation for the hearsay exception has been established. Without laying a proper foundation, the physician's testimony about what the plaintiff said during treatment cannot be admitted as evidence. Therefore, the physician's testimony would be ruled inadmissible due to the failure to lay a proper foundation."
