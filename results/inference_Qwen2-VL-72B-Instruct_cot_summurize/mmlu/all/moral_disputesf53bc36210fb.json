This doesn't directly relate to moral dilemmas where conflicting obligations might exist.\n\nB. **Can implies ought** - Similar to A, this implies that if one has the capability to perform an action, they have a moral obligation to do so. This also doesn't directly address the core issue of moral dilemmas.\n\nC. **Ought implies can** - This means that if one has a moral obligation to do something, they must be capable of doing it. This principle could be problematic in the context of moral dilemmas because it assumes that all moral obligations can be fulfilled without conflict, which Nagel disputes by acknowledging genuine moral dilemmas where obligations might conflict and not all can be fulfilled.\n\nD. **Ought implies should** - This suggests that if one has a moral obligation (ought), then they should fulfill it. This is more about the relationship between moral obligations and actions rather than the capability to act.\n\nGiven Nagel's acceptance of genuine moral dilemmas, where multiple moral obligations might conflict and not all can be fulfilled, he would likely deny the principle that \"ought implies can\" (Option C). This denial allows for the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas where one cannot fulfill all moral obligations due to conflicting demands.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. ought implies can."
