When a nucleus emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 and its mass number decreases by 4.\n\nThe atomic number of uranium-238 is 92. After emitting an alpha particle:\n- The atomic number decreases by 2: \\( 92 - 2 = 90 \\)\n- The mass number decreases by 4: \\( 238 - 4 = 234 \\)\n\nTherefore, the resulting nucleus has an atomic number of 90 and a mass number of 234. This corresponds to thorium-234.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. thorium-234"
