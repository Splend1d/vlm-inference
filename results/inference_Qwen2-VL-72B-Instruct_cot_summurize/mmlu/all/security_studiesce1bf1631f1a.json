Realism focuses on the state as the primary referent object for security, whereas humanitarian intervention prioritizes individuals or groups. This is indeed an assertion made by realists against humanitarian interventions.\n\nGiven this analysis, all options A, B, C, and D reflect assertions made in the realist case against humanitarian interventions. Therefore, there seems to be no option that is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian interventions based on the provided statements. \n\nHowever, if we consider the question's intent to identify an assertion that is not made by realists, it might imply looking for an assertion that supports humanitarian intervention rather than opposes it. In that case, none of the given options fit this criterion since they all oppose humanitarian intervention from a realist perspective. Thus, the question might need clarification or rephrasing for better alignment with the provided options."
