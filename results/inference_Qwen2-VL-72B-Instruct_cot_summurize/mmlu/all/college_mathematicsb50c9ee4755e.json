The derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) gives us the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{8}{x}\\]\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{8}{x^2}\\]\n\nAt any point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) on the curve, the slope of the tangent is \\(-\\frac{8}{x_0^2}\\). Since \\(y_0 = \\frac{8}{x_0}\\), the slope of the tangent can also be expressed as \\(-\\frac{x_0}{8}\\).\n\nFor the line passing through the origin and perpendicular to this tangent, its slope would be the negative reciprocal of the tangent's slope, which is \\(\\frac{8}{x_0}\\).\n\nHowever, to directly find the shortest distance without explicitly finding the tangent and normal lines, we can use the fact that for the curve \\(xy = k\\) (where \\(k\\) is a constant), the shortest distance from the origin to the curve occurs when \\(x = y\\), because this configuration minimizes the distance due to symmetry and the nature of the hyperbola.\n\nSetting \\(x = y\\) in our equation \\(xy = 8\\), we get:\n\n\\[x^2 = 8\\]\n\\[x = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSince \\(x = y\\), the point on the curve closest to the origin is \\((2\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2})\\).\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to this point is given by:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\\sqrt{2})^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{8 + 8}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{16}\\]\n\\[d = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the curve \\(xy = 8\\) to the origin is \\(4\\), which corresponds to option A."
