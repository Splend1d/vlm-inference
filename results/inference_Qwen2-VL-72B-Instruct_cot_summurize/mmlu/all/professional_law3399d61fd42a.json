Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\nB. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\nC. Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.\nD. Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct statement regarding the guilt of the co-defendants, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in the scenario.\n\n1. **Felony Murder Rule**: This rule states that if someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, the individuals committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if the death was unintentional. In this case, the co-defendants committed the felony of planting a bomb with the intent to extort money from the bank.\n\n2. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: Conspiracy involves an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, along with an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, the co-defendants planned and took steps to plant a bomb and make demands for money, which constitutes an overt act in furtherance of their agreement to commit murder.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The co-defendants planted a bomb with the intention of using it as leverage to extort money. This act qualifies as a felony.\n- The explosion of the bomb resulted in the deaths of 30 people, making the felony murder rule applicable.\n- The co-defendants had a clear agreement and took steps to execute their plan, fulfilling the elements of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nTherefore, both co-defendants are guilty of murder under the felony murder rule and also guilty of conspiracy to commit murder due to their agreement and actions taken towards executing their plan.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.**"
