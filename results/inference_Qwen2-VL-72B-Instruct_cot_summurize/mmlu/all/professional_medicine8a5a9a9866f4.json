He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Cluster headache\nB. Meningitis\nC. Migraine\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n"

Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nThe patient's presentation with a sudden onset of a severe occipital headache, stiff neck, and no history of severe headaches is highly suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH often presents with a \"thunderclap\" headache that reaches maximum intensity within minutes, accompanied by meningismus (stiff neck) and can occur without other neurological deficits initially. The absence of fever and the presence of hypertension also support this diagnosis over meningitis or other causes of headache."
