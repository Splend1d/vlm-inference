This does not apply here.\nC. **Fallacy of Division**: This occurs when someone assumes that what is true of a whole must also be true of its individual parts. This does not fit the scenario.\nD. **Questionable Cause**: This involves assuming a cause-and-effect relationship without sufficient evidence. This does not apply here either.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. Equivocation**"
