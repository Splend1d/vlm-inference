However, it does not guarantee finding the globally optimal solution. Back-propagation uses gradient descent, which can get stuck in local minima rather than reaching the global minimum. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2: The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.**\n\nThe VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension measures the capacity of a statistical classification algorithm, defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. For a line in a two-dimensional plane, the VC dimension is indeed 2 because any two points can always be separated by a line, but there exist configurations of three points that cannot be shattered by any single line (e.g., three collinear points). Thus, this statement is true.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
