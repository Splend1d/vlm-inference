At the time the contract was signed, the owner orally said to the distributor, \"We do have an understanding that our chef must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before I will pay you. \" The distributor acknowledged the owner's request and responded, \"If you say so. \"Thereafter, the distributor delivered the heirloom tomatoes to the owner. After inspecting the tomatoes, the chef refused to give his approval, because he felt that the tomatoes were not of sufficient quality. As a result, the owner refused to accept and pay for the tomatoes. The distributor brought a breach of contract action against the owner because he refused to pay for the tomatoes. How should the court rule on the owner's offer to prove, over the distributor's objection, that the chef refused to approve the tomatoes that were delivered?\n\nA. The evidence is admissible to show frustration of purpose.\nB. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\nC. The evidence is barred, because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement.\nD.

The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the owner and the distributor entered into a written contract for the purchase of heirloom tomatoes. However, there was also an oral agreement that the chef's approval of the quality of the tomatoes was necessary before payment would be made. This oral agreement can be considered a condition precedent to the performance of the contract, meaning that the owner's obligation to pay is contingent upon the chef's approval.\n\nCourts generally allow evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that add conditions precedent to a written contract if such conditions are consistent with the terms of the written agreement and do not contradict it. In this case, the oral agreement does not contradict the written contract but rather adds a condition that must be satisfied before the owner's obligation to pay arises.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that the evidence of the chef's refusal to approve the tomatoes is admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent."
