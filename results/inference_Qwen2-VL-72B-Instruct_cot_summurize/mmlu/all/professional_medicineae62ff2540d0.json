Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\nThis patient presents with secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as the absence of menstruation for at least six months after menarche. The history of regular menstrual cycles followed by irregularity and then amenorrhea, along with her emaciated appearance, low body mass index (BMI), and participation in a high-intensity sport like gymnastics, strongly suggests that her amenorrhea is due to hypothalamic dysfunction leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This condition is often associated with conditions such as anorexia nervosa or excessive exercise, both of which can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in low levels of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) and subsequently low estrogen production.\n\nThe other options provided do not fit the clinical picture as well:\n\nA. Hyperthyroidism typically does not present with amenorrhea; it more commonly causes irregular periods or oligomenorrhea.\nC. Hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea, but it usually presents with other symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin, none of which are described in this case.\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by irregular periods, obesity, hirsutism, and insulin resistance, which do not match the patient's presentation of being underweight and having no mention of hirsutism or insulin resistance.\n\nTherefore, given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and the context of her lifestyle, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is the most plausible diagnosis."
