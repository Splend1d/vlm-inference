It completely dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bromide ions (Br-), leading to a high concentration of ions in solution, which makes it a strong electrolyte.\n\nOn the other hand:\n- CH3COOH and HC2H3O2 both represent acetic acid, which is a weak acid and thus a weak electrolyte.\n- PCl5 (phosphorus pentachloride) does not readily dissolve in water to form ions, so it is not considered an electrolyte in this context."
