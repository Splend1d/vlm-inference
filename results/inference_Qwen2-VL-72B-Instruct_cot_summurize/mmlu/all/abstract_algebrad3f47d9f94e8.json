Similarly, in \\(Z_{8}\\), the order of an element \\(b\\) is given by \\(\\text{lcm}(8, b)\\).\n\nFor the element \\((4, 2)\\):\n\n- In \\(Z_{12}\\), the order of \\(4\\) is \\(\\text{lcm}(12, 4) = 12\\).\n- In \\(Z_{8}\\), the order of \\(2\\) is \\(\\text{lcm}(8, 2) = 8\\).\n\nThe order of the element \\((4, 2)\\) in \\(Z_{12} \\times Z_{8}\\) is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, which is \\(\\text{lcm}(12, 8)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(12, 8) = 24\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the options provided do not include 24, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the options provided. Given the correct calculation, the order of the element \\((4, 2)\\) in \\(Z_{12} \\times Z_{8}\\) should be 24, but this option is not listed among A through D.\n\nGiven the options and assuming a potential typo or misunderstanding in the question's setup, none of the provided options (A. 4, B. 8, C. 12, D. 6) correctly reflect the calculated order of 24 for the element \\((4, 2)\\) in \\(Z_{12} \\times Z_{8}\\). If the intention was to ask about the component-wise orders or another aspect of group theory related to these elements, please clarify the context or check the question for any possible errors."
