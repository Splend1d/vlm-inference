Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when\n\nA. the widow died.\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\nC. the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\nD. the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n"

The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when:\n\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\n\nAdverse possession typically requires continuous, open, notorious, and hostile possession of the property. When the tenant stopped paying rent, it could be seen as an indication that they were asserting control over the property without the permission of the rightful owner (the widow's estate, which eventually became the Boy Scouts of America). This act of discontinuing rent payments can be considered the start of the tenant's adverse possession claim because it marks the beginning of their unauthorized occupation of the property."
