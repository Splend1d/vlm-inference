Committee work is where much of the detailed legislative work happens, and having a favorable committee assignment can give a representative more influence over the content and direction of legislation. In contrast, the Senate has different rules that allow for more floor debate and amendments, so senators might not be as focused on committee assignments for the same reasons."
