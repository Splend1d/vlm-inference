The question revolves around Wellman's response to the \"egalitarian\" objection regarding the state's right to exclude individuals from its territory. Wellman argues that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without necessarily allowing them into their territory.\n\nThe task is to identify why Fine believes Wellman's response is insufficient. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Egalitarians are committed to utilitarian principles.**\n   - This statement describes a characteristic of egalitarians but does not directly address why Wellman's response is insufficient in addressing the objection about excluding people.\n\nB. **Wellman himself is an immigrant.**\n   - This personal detail about Wellman does not provide a logical reason for why his response would be considered insufficient by Fine.\n\nC. **Excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.**\n   - This option suggests that even if states fulfill their duties to outsiders, excluding those who want to pursue specific interests within the state could still cause harm. This aligns with the idea that Wellman\u2019s response might not fully address the potential negative consequences of exclusion.\n\nD. **The concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.**\n   - This option implies that the idea of fulfilling duties to outsiders without allowing them into the state (i.e., \"exporting justice\") is inherently contradictory. If this were true, it would indeed undermine Wellman's argument.\n\nGiven these analyses, both options C and D seem relevant. However, option D provides a more direct critique of Wellman's argument by pointing out a fundamental flaw in the concept itself, whereas option C focuses on a specific consequence of exclusion.\n\nTherefore, the most compelling reason why Fine thinks Wellman's response is insufficient is:\n\n**Final answer: D. The concept of \"exporting justice\" is internally contradictory.**"
