Let's examine each option:\n\nA. **Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.**\n   - This option implies that recognizing backup duties allows us to both accept the criticism that effective altruism is merely a temporary solution (a band-aid) and simultaneously mitigate or weaken this criticism. This seems plausible because acknowledging backup duties might suggest that while effective altruism isn't a complete solution, it still plays an important role in addressing immediate needs.\n\nB. **Acknowledge that effective altruism fails to be the right response to global poverty.**\n   - This option suggests that Ashford's argument leads to the conclusion that effective altruism is fundamentally flawed as a response to global poverty. However, the recognition of backup duties doesn't necessarily imply that effective altruism is entirely ineffective; rather, it might complement other strategies.\n\nC. **Feel relieved about our duties to the global poor, since backup duties are not morally urgent.**\n   - This option implies that recognizing backup duties would make one feel less compelled to act urgently regarding global poverty. However, the concept of backup duties typically refers to secondary responsibilities that support primary ones, not a reduction in moral urgency.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option suggests that none of the provided choices accurately reflect Ashford's argument.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting interpretation of Ashford's argument is that recognizing backup duties can help address the criticism that effective altruism is only a temporary fix, while also showing that it still has value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**A. Acknowledge the force of the criticism that effective altruism is at best a band-aid approach while diffusing this same criticism.**"
