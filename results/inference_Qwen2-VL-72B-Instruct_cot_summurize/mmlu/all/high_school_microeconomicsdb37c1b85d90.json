They are price takers, meaning they must accept the market price as given. As a result, the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm's product is perfectly elastic. This means that the firm can sell as much or as little of its product as it wants at the prevailing market price, but if it tries to charge a higher price, it will not be able to sell any of its product because consumers can easily switch to other firms offering the same product at the lower market price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. perfectly elastic."
