These criteria often include:\n\n1. **Revenue Test**: Segments with revenues that exceed 10% of the combined revenue of all segments.\n2. **Profit/Loss Test**: Segments with profits or losses that exceed 10% of the combined profits of all profitable segments or 10% of the combined losses of all loss-making segments.\n3. **Asset Test**: Segments with assets that exceed 10% of the combined assets of all segments.\n\nLet's calculate these percentages for each segment:\n\n### Revenue Test\n- **Segment A**: \\( \\frac{42}{177} \\approx 23.73\\% \\)\n- **Segment B**: \\( \\frac{121}{177} \\approx 68.36\\% \\)\n- **Segment C**: \\( \\frac{14}{177} \\approx 7.91\\% \\)\n\n### Profit/Loss Test\n- **Segment A**: \\( \\frac{12}{74} \\approx 16.22\\% \\)\n- **Segment B**: \\( \\frac{65}{74} \\approx 87.84\\% \\)\n- **Segment C**: \\( \\frac{-3}{74} \\approx -4.05\\% \\)\n\n### Asset Test\n- **Segment A**: \\( \\frac{470}{1350} \\approx 34.81\\% \\)\n- **Segment B**: \\( \\frac{800}{1350} \\approx 59.26\\% \\)\n- **Segment C**: \\( \\frac{80}{1350} \\approx 5.93\\% \\)\n\nBased on these calculations:\n- **Segment A** meets the Revenue Test (23.73%) and the Asset Test (34.81%).\n- **Segment B** meets the Revenue Test (68.36%), the Profit/Loss Test (87.84%), and the Asset Test (59.26%).\n- **Segment C** does not meet any of the tests.\n\nTherefore, the segments required to be separately disclosed are **Segments A and B**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. A and B only."
