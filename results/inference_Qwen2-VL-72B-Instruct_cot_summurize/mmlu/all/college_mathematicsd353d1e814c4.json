A set \\( G \\) with an operation \\( * \\) forms a group if it satisfies the following four properties:\n\n1. **Closure**: For all \\( a, b \\in G \\), the result of the operation \\( a * b \\) is also in \\( G \\).\n2. **Associativity**: For all \\( a, b, c \\in G \\), \\( (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \\).\n3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element \\( e \\in G \\) such that for every element \\( a \\in G \\), \\( e * a = a * e = a \\).\n4. **Inverse Element**: For every element \\( a \\in G \\), there exists an element \\( b \\in G \\) such that \\( a * b = b * a = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The integers under addition**:\n- Closure: The sum of any two integers is always an integer.\n- Associativity: Addition of integers is associative.\n- Identity Element: The number 0 acts as the identity element because \\( a + 0 = 0 + a = a \\) for any integer \\( a \\).\n- Inverse Element: For any integer \\( a \\), its inverse is \\( -a \\) because \\( a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the integers under addition form a group.\n\nB. **The nonzero integers under multiplication**:\n- Closure: The product of any two nonzero integers is always a nonzero integer.\n- Associativity: Multiplication of integers is associative.\n- Identity Element: The number 1 acts as the identity element because \\( a \\times 1 = 1 \\times a = a \\) for any nonzero integer \\( a \\).\n- Inverse Element: Not all nonzero integers have multiplicative inverses within the set of nonzero integers. For example, the inverse of 2 would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), which is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, the nonzero integers under multiplication do not form a group because they fail to satisfy the requirement for the existence of inverse elements.\n\nC. **The nonzero real numbers under multiplication**:\n- Closure: The product of any two nonzero real numbers is always a nonzero real number.\n- Associativity: Multiplication of real numbers is associative.\n- Identity Element: The number 1 acts as the identity element because \\( a \\times 1 = 1 \\times a = a \\) for any nonzero real number \\( a \\).\n- Inverse Element: For any nonzero real number \\( a \\), its inverse is \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) because \\( a \\times \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\times a = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group.\n\nD. **The complex numbers under addition**:\n- Closure: The sum of any two complex numbers is always a complex number.\n- Associativity: Addition of complex numbers is associative.\n- Identity Element: The complex number 0 acts as the identity element because \\( a + 0 = 0 + a = a \\) for any complex number \\( a \\).\n- Inverse Element: For any complex number \\( a \\), its inverse is \\( -a \\) because \\( a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the complex numbers under addition form a group.\n\nIn conclusion, the option that does NOT form a group is:\n\nB.
