This depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can initially increase net exports. However, if the expansionary policy leads to higher inflation, it can erode the competitiveness of exports over time, potentially decreasing net exports. Additionally, capital flows can offset the effects of monetary policy in an open economy, making the policy less effective compared to a closed economy (Economy Y) where such external influences are absent."
