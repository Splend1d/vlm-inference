This means that one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of HCl.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume of HCl = 42.6 mL = 0.0426 L\n- Molarity of HCl = 0.108 M\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of HCl used in the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HCl} = \\text{Volume of HCl} \\times \\text{Molarity of HCl} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HCl} = 0.0426 \\text{ L} \\times 0.108 \\text{ mol/L} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HCl} = 0.0046128 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nSince the mole ratio of NaOH to HCl is 1:1, the moles of NaOH will be equal to the moles of HCl:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.0046128 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the molarity of the NaOH solution using the volume of NaOH solution given:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of NaOH} = 40.0 \\text{ mL} = 0.0400 \\text{ L} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Molarity of NaOH} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\\text{Volume of NaOH}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molarity of NaOH} = \\frac{0.0046128 \\text{ mol}}{0.0400 \\text{ L}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molarity of NaOH} = 0.11532 \\text{ M} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the molarity of the NaOH solution is approximately 0.115 M.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.115 M"
