The formula relates the observed wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{obs}\\)) to the emitted wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{emit}\\)) and the relative velocity (\\(v\\)) between the source and the observer:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_{emit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}}} \\]\n\nGiven that the observed wavelengths are three times as long as the emitted wavelengths (\\(\\lambda_{obs} = 3\\lambda_{emit}\\)), we substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[ 3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:\n\n\\[ 9 = \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c}} \\]\n\nCross-multiplying yields:\n\n\\[ 9(1 - \\frac{v}{c}) = 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n\n\\[ 9 - 9\\frac{v}{c} = 1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 1 = 9\\frac{v}{c} + \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\n\\[ 8 = 10\\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 is \\(0.8c\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.8c"
