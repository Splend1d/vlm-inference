It is committed on a larger, often global, scale, and is well organized: While the Chicago School focused on localized urban crime and its social causes, terrorism often involves transnational networks and sophisticated planning.\n\nB. It is associated with political conflict between states and their citizens: Terrorism is frequently linked to political ideologies or grievances, whereas the Chicago School's focus was more on social disorganization and individual criminal behavior.\n\nC. It can have far-reaching effects upon international relations: The impact of terrorism extends beyond local communities and can influence diplomatic relations and global security policies.\n\nTherefore, all of these points highlight significant differences between terrorism and the types of crime studied by the Chicago School."
