The probability of successfully selling a policy is 20%, or 0.20.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This scheme assigns 2 numbers (0 and 1) out of 10 possible outcomes to represent a successful sale, which corresponds to a 2/10 = 0.20 or 20% chance of success. This matches the given success rate.\n\nB. Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This scheme assigns 3 numbers (2, 3, 4) out of 5 possible outcomes to represent a failure, which corresponds to a 3/5 = 0.60 or 60% chance of failure. This does not match the given success rate.\n\nC. Assign number 0 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and number 1 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This scheme assigns 1 number (0) out of 2 possible outcomes to represent a successful sale, which corresponds to a 1/2 = 0.50 or 50% chance of success. This does not match the given success rate.\n\nD. Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n- This scheme assigns 5 numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) out of 10 possible outcomes to represent a successful sale, which corresponds to a 5/10 = 0.50 or 50% chance of success.
