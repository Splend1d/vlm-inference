                    "text": "To determine which type of logical fallacy is present in the given statement, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Statement:**\n   - The speaker believes they did not deserve a failing grade because their professor praised the class as the best he had ever had.\n   - The speaker assumes that being part of an excellent class means no individual could have failed.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n   - **A. Fallacy of Composition:** This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the parts must be true for the whole. For example, assuming that because each brick is strong, the entire wall must be strong.\n     - In this case, the speaker assumes that because the class as a whole was praised, every individual student must also be excellent. This is a form of the fallacy of composition.\n\n   - **B. Fallacy of Division:** This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the whole must be true for its parts. For example, assuming that because a car is fast, each of its parts must also be fast.\n     - This does not apply here because the speaker is making an assumption about the parts based on the whole, not vice versa.\n\n   - **C. Questionable Cause:** This fallacy involves assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists. For example, believing that because two events occurred together, one caused the other.\n     - This does not fit the scenario since there is no assumed cause-and-effect relationship between the praise and the grades.\n\n   - **D. Appeal to Gallery (Provincialism):** This fallacy involves appealing to the emotions or prejudices of a particular group rather than using logical arguments.\n     - This does not apply here because the speaker is not trying to persuade anyone based on emotions or prejudices.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The speaker's reasoning is flawed because they assume that the excellence of the class as a whole implies that no individual could have performed poorly. This is a classic example of the fallacy of composition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. Fallacy of Composition**"
