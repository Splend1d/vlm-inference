So, the sequence looks like this:\n\n- First number: \\(28\\)\n- Second number: \\(28 + 14 = 42\\)\n- Third number: \\(42 + 14 = 56\\)\n- Fourth number: \\(56 + 14 = 70\\)\n- And so on...\n\nNow, let's check each option:\n\nA. **All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 10.**\n   - This is not true because while some numbers in the pattern (like 70) can be divided by 10, others (like 28 or 42) cannot.\n\nB. **All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.**\n   - This is not true because while some numbers in the pattern (like 28 or 56) can be divided by 4, others (like 42 or 70) cannot.\n\nC. **All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 8.**\n   - This is not true because while some numbers in the pattern (like 28 or 56) can be divided by 8, others (like 42 or 70) cannot.\n\nD. **All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.**\n   - This is true because every number in the pattern is a multiple of 14, and since 14 itself is a multiple of 7, any number that is a multiple of 14 will also be a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7."
