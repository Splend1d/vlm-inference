During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\nA. Median nerve at the wrist\nB. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\nC. Radial nerve at the forearm\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n"

This condition is often referred to as cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\nGiven the patient's history of playing as a pitcher, which involves repetitive elbow movements, and the specific location of her symptoms (medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger), the most likely cause of these findings is:\n\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n\nThis option correctly identifies the nerve involved and the site of entrapment based on the clinical presentation."
