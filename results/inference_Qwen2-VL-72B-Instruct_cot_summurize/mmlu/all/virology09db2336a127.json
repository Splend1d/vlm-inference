Effect modification (interaction)\n\nRandomization helps to evenly distribute known and unknown confounding variables across treatment groups, thereby reducing the likelihood that differences in outcomes can be attributed to these variables rather than the intervention being studied. This helps to control for effect modification or interaction effects, where the effect of the intervention may vary depending on the presence of other factors."
