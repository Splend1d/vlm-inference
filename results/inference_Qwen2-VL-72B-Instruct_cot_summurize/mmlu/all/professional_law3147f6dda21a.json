The man intended to take back some tools that he believed were his and that the neighbor was keeping unlawfully. The woman believed that the tools were the man's, and she intended to help the man take them. When the son learned that the man and the woman were going to break into the neighbor's home, he decided to accompany them. The son planned to find some items inside that might be worth taking. Arriving at the neighbor's home, the man opened the front door, which was closed but unlocked. Upon entering, the son went to the neighbor's upstairs bedroom and found a watch, which he took. In the meantime, the man and the woman went to the garage and began rummaging through the neighbor's tools. The man found the tools, which he seized. The three of them then left the neighbor's home. In this jurisdiction, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of any structure with the intent to commit a felony therein. Which, if any, individuals should be found guilty of conspiracy?\n\nA. The man, the woman, and the son.\nB. The man and the woman.\nC. The woman and the son.\nD. None.\n"

For a person to be guilty of conspiracy, they must have agreed to participate in the criminal plan and taken some action to advance that plan.\n\nLet's analyze each individual:\n\n1. **The Man:**\n   - He intended to take back tools that he believed were his and that the neighbor was keeping unlawfully.\n   - He opened the front door and entered the neighbor's home.\n   - He seized the tools he believed were his.\n\n2. **The Woman:**\n   - She believed the tools were the man's and intended to help him take them.\n   - She accompanied the man and helped him rummage through the neighbor's tools.\n\n3. **The Son:**\n   - He learned about the plan and decided to accompany them.\n   - He intended to find valuable items inside the neighbor's home.\n   - He went to the neighbor's upstairs bedroom and took a watch.\n\nGiven these facts, let's consider the elements of conspiracy:\n\n- **Agreement:** There must be an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime.\n- **Overt Act:** There must be an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.\n\n**The Man and the Woman:**\n- They both had an agreement to enter the neighbor's home and take the tools.\n- Both performed overt acts (entering the home and seizing the tools).\n\n**The Son:**\n- He did not agree with the man and the woman to take the tools; his intention was different (to find valuable items).\n- However, he did perform an overt act by entering the home and taking a watch.\n\nSince the son did not share the same criminal intent as the man and the woman regarding the tools, he cannot be considered part of their conspiracy to take the tools. However, the man and the woman clearly conspired to take the tools and committed overt acts in furtherance of that agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The man and the woman."
