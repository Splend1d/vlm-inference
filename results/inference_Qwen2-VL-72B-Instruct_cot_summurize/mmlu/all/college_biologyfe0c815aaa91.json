                    "text": "To determine the most likely characteristic exhibited by this species of small rodent, let's analyze each option in the context of the given information:\n\n1. **Moderate sexual size dimorphism**: Sexual size dimorphism refers to differences in size between males and females within a species. While this can be a factor in some species, it doesn't directly relate to the litter size or reproductive strategy described.\n\n2. **High parental investment**: This refers to the amount of time, energy, and resources parents invest in raising their offspring. Smaller litter sizes often correlate with higher parental investment because parents can allocate more resources to fewer offspring, ensuring better survival rates.\n\n3. **Precocial young**: Precocial young are born relatively mature and able to function independently soon after birth. This trait is not necessarily linked to litter size but rather to the developmental stage at birth.\n\n4. **Frequent extrapair matings**: This refers to mating outside of a primary pair bond. While it can occur in various species, it does not directly relate to the litter size or the specific reproductive strategy mentioned.\n\nGiven that the rodents have unusually small litter sizes (two or three), it suggests they might invest heavily in each offspring to ensure their survival and growth. Therefore, the most plausible characteristic is:\n\n**B. High parental investment**\n\nThis aligns well with the idea that smaller litters allow for greater individual attention and resource allocation to each offspring, which is a common strategy in species with low reproductive output."
