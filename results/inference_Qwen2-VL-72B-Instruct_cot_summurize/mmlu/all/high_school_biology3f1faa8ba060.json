Therefore, this strand would still have the same number of nucleotides as the original strand but with one nucleotide changed.\n\nC. **the primary RNA transcript (before splicing) from the original DNA**: The primary RNA transcript is transcribed directly from the DNA and includes both exons and introns. It typically has more nucleotides than the original DNA segment because it includes introns that are later removed during splicing.\n\nD. **a single strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) made from the original DNA**: cDNA is synthesized from mRNA, which is the mature RNA after splicing. Since introns are removed during splicing, cDNA will generally have fewer nucleotides compared to the original DNA segment or its primary RNA transcript.\n\nGiven these explanations, the molecule containing the fewest number of nucleotides is:\n\n**D. a single strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) made from the original DNA**."
