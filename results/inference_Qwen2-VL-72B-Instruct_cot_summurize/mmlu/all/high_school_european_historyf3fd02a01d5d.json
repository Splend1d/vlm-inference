                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of the Carlsbad Resolutions mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe Carlsbad Resolutions were adopted by the Germanic States in 1819 and were part of the broader efforts led by Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian statesman who was a key figure in European politics during the early 19th century. Metternich was known for his conservative policies aimed at maintaining stability and preventing revolutionary movements.\n\nGiven this background, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Establish control of European states by democracy in the tradition of the Enlightenment.**\n   - This option suggests promoting democratic principles, which is contrary to Metternich's known conservative stance. He was opposed to the spread of liberal and democratic ideas.\n\nB. **Suppress all voices in government other than his own and control all aspects of his citizens' lives.**\n   - While Metternich was authoritarian, this option seems overly broad and extreme. The Carlsbad Resolutions specifically targeted publications and did not necessarily aim to control all aspects of citizens' lives.\n\nC. **Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent.**\n   - This option aligns well with Metternich's goals. He was deeply concerned about the spread of nationalism and revolutionary ideas, which he saw as threats to the existing order.\n\nD. **Suppress all speech but that of monarchs and the churches that they approve of.**\n   - This option is somewhat close, as the Carlsbad Resolutions did aim to control and suppress certain types of speech. However, it is too narrow and specific compared to the broader goal of suppressing nationalist and revolutionary ideas.\n\nConsidering the historical context and the specific focus of the Carlsbad Resolutions on controlling publications and suppressing revolutionary ideas, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent.**"
