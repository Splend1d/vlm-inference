Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: This theory suggests that when people experience inconsistency between their attitudes and behaviors, they feel psychological discomfort (dissonance). To reduce this discomfort, they may change their attitudes to align with their behavior. In this scenario, participants who were paid only $1.00 to claim the dull experiment was interesting would likely experience more dissonance because the small payment does not justify lying. Therefore, they might genuinely come to believe that the experiment was interesting to reduce their dissonance.\n\n- **Self-Perception Theory**: This theory posits that individuals infer their attitudes from observing their own behavior and the circumstances under which it occurs. Participants who were paid $1.00 might infer that since they claimed the experiment was interesting without much external justification (the low payment), they must actually find the experiment interesting. On the other hand, those paid $20.00 have an obvious external justification for their behavior (the high payment), so they are less likely to change their attitude about the experiment.\n\nThus, both theories predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will report greater liking for the dull experiment compared to those in the $20.00 condition."
