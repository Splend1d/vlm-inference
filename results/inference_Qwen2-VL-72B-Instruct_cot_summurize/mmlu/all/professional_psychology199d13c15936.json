This theory posits that releasing pent-up emotions through an aggressive act can provide a form of emotional release or \"catharsis,\" thereby reducing the likelihood of subsequent aggressive behavior.\n\nGiven this context, the statement that is unsupported by research according to the Catharsis Theory would be:\n\nA. Aggressive act reduces inclination to engage in other aggressive acts\n\nResearch has not consistently supported the idea that engaging in aggressive acts actually reduces future aggression. In fact, some studies suggest that acting aggressively may reinforce aggressive tendencies and increase the likelihood of future aggressive behavior rather than providing cathartic relief."
