During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?\n\nA. Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule\nB. Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone\nC. Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally\nD. Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam\n"

Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally.\n\nThis approach is reasonable because it addresses the patient's concern about addiction while still managing her pain effectively. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an effective analgesic for moderate pain and does not have the addictive potential of opioids like morphine. However, it is important to note that the decision should be made in consultation with the patient and based on her specific pain management needs. If her pain is severe and not adequately managed with acetaminophen alone, other non-opioid pain management strategies or lower doses of opioids may need to be considered."
