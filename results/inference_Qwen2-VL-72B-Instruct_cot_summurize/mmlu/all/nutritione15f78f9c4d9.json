Goitrogens are substances that can interfere with the production of thyroid hormones and potentially cause enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) if consumed in large quantities by individuals with iodine deficiency or certain thyroid conditions. However, it's important to note that moderate consumption of these vegetables is generally safe and beneficial for most people."
