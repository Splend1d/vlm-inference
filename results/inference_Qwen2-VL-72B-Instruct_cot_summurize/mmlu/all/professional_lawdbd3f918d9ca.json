The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n"

Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\n\nIn this scenario, the company knew it had a waste discharge problem that made the water hazardous. This knowledge makes the company strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water, regardless of whether the individuals were trespassers. Strict liability applies when there is a known dangerous condition on the property, and the company failed to take appropriate measures to prevent harm."
