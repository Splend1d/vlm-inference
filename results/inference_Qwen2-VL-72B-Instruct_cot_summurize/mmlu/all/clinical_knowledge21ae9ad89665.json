Phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein, often caused by irritation from an intravenous catheter or infusion.\n\nThe phlebitis scale typically includes the following stages:\n\n- Stage 0: No symptoms\n- Stage 1: Mild erythema (redness) at the insertion site\n- Stage 2: Erythema and tenderness at the insertion site\n- Stage 3: Erythema, tenderness, and edema (swelling) at the insertion site\n- Stage 4: Erythema, tenderness, edema, and possible purulent drainage\n\nGiven the presence of pain, erythema, and swelling, the patient would likely be classified as having Stage 3 phlebitis.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action would be:\n\nC. Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.\n\nThis involves removing the current IV catheter and inserting a new one at a different site. Additionally, treatment options such as warm compresses, elevation of the affected limb, and possibly antibiotics if there is evidence of infection may be considered. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper assessment and management."
