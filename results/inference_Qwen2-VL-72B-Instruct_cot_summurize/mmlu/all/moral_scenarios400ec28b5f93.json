If the person picking up the knife is a surgeon performing a necessary medical procedure, this action is not morally wrong.\n- However, if the person is not a qualified medical professional or the cutting is done without consent or for malicious purposes, then it would be morally wrong.\n\nGiven that we don't have enough context to definitively determine the morality of Scenario 2, but assuming the worst-case scenario where the cutting is unauthorized or malicious, we can conclude:\n\nThe main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1, and potentially in Scenario 2 if the context is malicious or unauthorized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
