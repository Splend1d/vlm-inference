The witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse snatcher. The witness died several days before the trial. When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone, therefore it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator; the exhibit must be admitted.\nB. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime and it therefore has testimonial reliability.\nC. No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\nD. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.\n"

No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal proceedings, the right to cross-examine witnesses is a fundamental aspect of ensuring fairness and reliability of evidence. The witness who created the composite sketch passed away before the trial, which means the defense would not have the opportunity to challenge the accuracy or credibility of the sketch through cross-examination. Additionally, composite sketches can be inherently unreliable due to factors like memory decay, witness bias, and the limitations of the sketching process itself. Therefore, the trial judge is unlikely to admit the sketch as evidence without the ability to scrutinize its reliability through cross-examination."
