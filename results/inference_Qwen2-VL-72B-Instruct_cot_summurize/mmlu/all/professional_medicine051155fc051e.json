Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB.

                    "text": "The hypothesis suggests that stress during examination week may adversely affect the immune system, leading to an increased susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. To support this hypothesis, we need to identify a laboratory finding that indicates a compromised immune response or a physiological change associated with stress.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration**: Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress. A decrease in cortisol levels would not support the hypothesis because it would suggest less stress rather than more stress.\n\nB. **Decreased macrophage activity**: Macrophages are key cells in the immune system responsible for phagocytosis and antigen presentation. A decrease in their activity could indicate a weakened immune response, which aligns with the hypothesis that stress impairs immune function.\n\nC. **Increased basophil count**: Basophils are involved in allergic reactions and inflammation but do not directly relate to the general immune response to viral infections like the common cold. An increase in basophils does not necessarily support the hypothesis about stress affecting the immune system.\n\nD. **Increased lymphocyte count**: Lymphocytes are crucial components of the immune system, including T-cells and B-cells. An increase in lymphocyte count would suggest a heightened immune response, which contradicts the hypothesis that stress weakens the immune system.\n\nGiven the context and the hypothesis, the laboratory finding that most supports the idea that stress adversely affects the immune system, making students more susceptible to infection, is:\n\n**B. Decreased macrophage activity**\n\nThis finding indicates a compromised immune response, which aligns with the hypothesis that stress impairs immune function."
