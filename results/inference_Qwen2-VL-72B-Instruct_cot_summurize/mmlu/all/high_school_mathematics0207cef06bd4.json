The function is undefined when the denominator equals zero, so we set \\(1-x = 0\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[1 - x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1\\]\n\nThus, the domain of \\(f(x)\\) is all real numbers except \\(x = 1\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches the boundaries of its domain:\n\n- As \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the left (\\(x < 1\\)), \\(f(x)\\) approaches positive infinity because the denominator becomes very small and negative.\n- As \\(x\\) approaches 1 from the right (\\(x > 1\\)), \\(f(x)\\) approaches negative infinity because the denominator becomes very small and positive.\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) can take on any value except when \\(x = 1\\), which makes the function undefined, the range of \\(f(x)\\) includes all real numbers except for the value that would make the denominator zero. However, since the function never actually reaches infinity or negative infinity, but rather approaches them, the correct interpretation is that it covers all real numbers except where it is undefined.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. \\((-\\infty,-1)\\cup (1,\\infty)\\)\n\nB. \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)\\)\n\nC. \\([-1,1]\\)\n\nD. \\((-1,1)\\)\n\nThe correct answer is B. \\((-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)\\), because the function can take on any value except 0 (since there is no \\(x\\) value that makes \\(f(x) = 0\\))."
