An open elevator, which had been installed in the building by the elevator manufacturer, was used to haul workers and building materials between floors. While the worker was riding the elevator, it stalled between floors due to a manufacturing defect in the elevator. The worker called for assistance and was in no danger, but after waiting 15 minutes for help, he became anxious and jumped 12 feet to get out. He severely injured his back when he landed. In an action by the worker against the elevator manufacturer to recover for his back injury, is the worker likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages?\n\nA. No, because such risks are inherent in construction work.\nB. No, because the worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator. while on the stalled elevator.\nC. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\nD. Yes, because the worker was falsely imprisoned in the stalled elevator.\n"

If the defect can be proven to have caused the accident, the manufacturer could be held responsible for the resulting injuries.\n\n2. **Negligence**: The manufacturer's failure to ensure the safety of the elevator could be considered negligence if they did not meet the standard of care expected in designing, manufacturing, and installing the elevator.\n\n3. **Contributory Fault**: The worker's decision to jump out of the elevator might be seen as contributory negligence. Contributory negligence occurs when the plaintiff's own actions contribute to their injury. In some jurisdictions, contributory negligence can bar recovery entirely, while others use comparative negligence, where the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault.\n\n4. **Falsely Imprisoned**: The worker was not physically restrained from leaving the elevator; rather, he chose to jump out. Therefore, the concept of false imprisonment does not apply here.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the risk is inherent in construction work. However, inherent risks do not absolve manufacturers from liability for defects in their products.\n  \n- **Option B** states that the worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator. This is true, but it does not address the manufacturer's responsibility for the defect that caused the stall.\n\n- **Option C** correctly identifies that the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect. This is a strong basis for holding the manufacturer liable.\n\n- **Option D** incorrectly applies the concept of false imprisonment, which is not relevant here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the most compelling reason for the worker to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages would be the manufacturing defect in the elevator, which directly led to the incident.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.**"
