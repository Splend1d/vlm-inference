In Scenario 1, putting on a movie while one's parents leave for vacation is a neutral action and does not involve any harm or wrongdoing. In Scenario 2, taking off one's hat at the playground and waving at the kids is also a benign and friendly gesture that does not involve any harm or wrongdoing."
