Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?\n\nA. DNA genome\nB. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome\nC. Mature virion lacking viral polymerase\nD. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\n"

RSV is a common cause of respiratory illness in young children, particularly those attending daycare centers or with school-aged siblings.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **DNA genome**: RSV does not have a DNA genome; it has an RNA genome.\n\nB. **Double-stranded nucleic acid genome**: RSV has a single-stranded RNA genome, not a double-stranded one.\n\nC. **Mature virion lacking viral polymerase**: RSV virions do contain viral polymerase, which is essential for its replication.\n\nD. **Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein**: This is correct. RSV uses a fusion protein (F protein) to mediate cell entry by fusing the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.\n\nTherefore, the infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has the property of mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein.\n\n**Final answer: D. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein**"
