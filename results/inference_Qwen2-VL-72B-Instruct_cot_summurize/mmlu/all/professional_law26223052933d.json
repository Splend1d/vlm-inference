They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n"

Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n\nUnconscionability is a legal doctrine that allows courts to refuse to enforce contracts or provisions within contracts that are so unfair or oppressive as to be against public policy. In this scenario, several factors could contribute to a finding of unconscionability:\n\n1. **Fine Print**: The provision about not owning previous purchases until new ones are paid off was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. This could indicate an attempt to hide important terms from the customers, making it difficult for them to understand the full implications of the agreement.\n\n2. **Lack of Bargaining Power**: The couple had less than perfect credit, which may have limited their options for purchasing furniture. This could suggest that they were in a weaker bargaining position and may have been pressured into accepting unfavorable terms.\n\n3. **Harsh Consequences**: The consequence of losing ownership of all previously paid-for furniture due to the non-payment of a single item (a chair) seems disproportionately harsh and punitive.\n\n4. **Commercial Context**: The nature of the transaction and the relationship between the parties can also be considered. If the furniture dealer is a large business and the couple is a small consumer, the disparity in resources and sophistication could further support a claim of unconscionability.\n\nGiven these factors, it is plausible that a court might find the contract provision unconscionable and rule in favor of the couple. However, the specific outcome would depend on the jurisdiction's laws and the judge's interpretation of the facts presented."
