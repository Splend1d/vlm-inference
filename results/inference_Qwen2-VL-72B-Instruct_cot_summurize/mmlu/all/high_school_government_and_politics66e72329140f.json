The child's family\n\nThe family often plays the most significant role in forming a child's political views because children are typically raised within their family's cultural, social, and political environment. Parents and other family members can influence a child's beliefs through discussions, actions, and the values they emphasize. However, it's important to note that other factors such as education, peers, and personal experiences also contribute to shaping an individual's political views over time."
