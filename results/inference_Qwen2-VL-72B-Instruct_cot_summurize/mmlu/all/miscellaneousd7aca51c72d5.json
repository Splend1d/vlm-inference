Roosevelt was President from March 4, 1933, to April 12, 1945.\n- Harry S. Truman became President on April 12, 1945, after FDR's death, and served until January 20, 1953.\n- Dwight D. Eisenhower was President from January 20, 1953, to January 20, 1961.\n\nGiven these dates, Harry S. Truman was the President of the United States when Bill Clinton was born on August 19, 1946.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Harry S. Truman"
