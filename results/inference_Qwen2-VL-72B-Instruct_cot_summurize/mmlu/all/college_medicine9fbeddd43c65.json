                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. They have stable conjugate bases\n\nStrong acids, like perchloric acid (HClO\u2084), completely dissociate in water, releasing hydrogen ions (H\u207a). The stability of the conjugate base formed after the acid donates its proton is a key factor in determining the strength of an acid. In the case of HClO\u2084, its conjugate base, ClO\u2084\u207b, is very stable, which allows HClO\u2084 to release its proton easily and thus be classified as a strong acid.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not accurate for strong acids:\n\nA. Ka is less than 1 - This statement is incorrect because strong acids have a very high acid dissociation constant (Ka), indicating that they almost completely dissociate in solution.\n\nB. They have an open electron spot on their outer valence rings - This statement is not specific to strong acids. While it might describe certain aspects of some molecules, it does not directly relate to the defining characteristic of strong acids, which is their complete dissociation in water.\n\nD. They remain bound in the presence of water - This statement is incorrect because strong acids do not remain bound in the presence of water; instead, they fully dissociate into their constituent ions."
