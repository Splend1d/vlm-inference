                    "text": "To determine the correct interpretation of the agreement between the manufacturer and the retailer, let's analyze the details provided:\n\n1. **Monthly Deliveries**: The agreement specifies that one thousand widgets are to be delivered by the manufacturer on the first day of each of the next 10 months. This indicates a series of deliveries over time.\n\n2. **Separate Contracts for Each Delivery**: The statement \"EACH MONTHLY DELIVERY IS A SEPARATE CONTRACT\" explicitly mentions that each monthly delivery is considered a distinct contractual obligation.\n\n3. **Payment Terms**: Payment is to be made within 10 days of receipt of each shipment, which aligns with the idea of separate transactions for each delivery.\n\nGiven these points, we can evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. a divisible contract**: A divisible contract typically involves a single agreement that can be divided into parts, but it does not necessarily imply separate contracts for each part. This doesn't fit the explicit mention of separate contracts for each delivery.\n\n- **B. an installment contract**: An installment contract usually involves a single agreement where goods or services are delivered in installments, but payment terms might vary. It doesn't specifically address the concept of separate contracts for each installment.\n\n- **C. 10 separate contracts**: This directly matches the statement in the agreement that each monthly delivery is a separate contract. This option clearly aligns with the given information.\n\n- **D. a requirements-output contract**: This type of contract involves the buyer agreeing to purchase all the output of the seller or the seller agreeing to meet the buyer's requirements. This does not fit the scenario described, where specific quantities are agreed upon for each month.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate interpretation of the agreement is:\n\n**C. 10 separate contracts.**"
