The Forms represent the ultimate reality, which is eternal, unchanging, and perfect. Knowledge involves grasping these Forms through rational thought rather than relying solely on sensory perception, which can be deceptive and changeable. Thus, true knowledge is achieved by understanding the Forms, which are beyond the physical world and are apprehended through reason."
