Japan actually has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports for raw materials.\n\nB. **China lacks natural resources but has a massive labor force.**\n   - While China does have significant natural resources, it is also true that it has a very large labor force. However, this statement oversimplifies China's resource situation.\n\nC. **China is industrializing rapidly.**\n   - This statement is true. China has been industrializing at a rapid pace over the past few decades, becoming a major manufacturing hub globally.\n\nD. **Taiwan lacks industrial enterprise and an educated workforce.**\n   - This statement is false. Taiwan has a well-developed industrial sector and an educated workforce, particularly known for its high-tech industries.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. China is industrializing rapidly.**"
