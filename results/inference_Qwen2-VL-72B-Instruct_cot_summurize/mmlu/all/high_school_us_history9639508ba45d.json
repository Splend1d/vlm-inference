Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nThe language of this passage by Susan B.

Debates over the procedures of amending the Constitution.\n"

However, the content of the passage speaks to broader themes of civil rights and equality, which align with debates over voting rights. Both Martin Luther King Jr. and Susan B. Anthony were pivotal figures in movements advocating for equal rights and the expansion of voting rights to marginalized groups. While King's focus was on racial equality and the civil rights movement, Anthony was a key figure in the women's suffrage movement, fighting for women's right to vote. The continuity between their struggles lies in the fight for voting rights as a means to achieve broader social and political equality."
