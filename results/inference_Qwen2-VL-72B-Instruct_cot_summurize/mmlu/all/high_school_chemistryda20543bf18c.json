As a result, argon atoms do not have permanent dipoles or participate in hydrogen bonding. The attractive forces between argon atoms are due to van der Waals forces, specifically London dispersion forces (also known as instantaneous and induced dipoles). These forces arise from the temporary fluctuations in electron distribution within an atom, which can induce a weak attraction between neighboring atoms. At sufficiently low temperatures, these weak attractions can cause argon to condense into a liquid."
