For example, individuals who consume high amounts of fruits and vegetables may also have other healthy habits, such as regular exercise or not smoking. These factors can influence health outcomes independently of diet, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of individual dietary components. Additionally, many dietary components tend to co-occur in foods, further complicating the analysis."
