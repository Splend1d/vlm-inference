Gardiner discusses the inadequacies of current international institutions in dealing with climate change effectively.\n\nB. **Dispersion of causes and effects**: This refers to the fact that the causes and effects of climate change are spread out globally, making it difficult for any single country or region to address the issue alone.\n\nC. **Fragmentation of agency**: This refers to the division of responsibility among various actors (countries, organizations, individuals) without a unified approach, leading to inefficiencies and delays in action.\n\nGiven these points, all three characteristics (A, B, and C) are indeed discussed by Gardiner as issues related to climate change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. all of the above"
