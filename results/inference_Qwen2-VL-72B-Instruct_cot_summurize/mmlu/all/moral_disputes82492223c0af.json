This would indeed make the slippery-slope argument fallacious because it relies on the assumption that the initial action will inevitably lead to negative outcomes.\n\nB. **The central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster\u2014turns out not to be plausible.**\n   - If the central idea is not plausible, meaning there is no reasonable basis for believing that the initial action will lead to disastrous outcomes, then the argument fails to establish a logical connection between the initial action and the supposed negative consequences. This also makes the slippery-slope argument fallacious.\n\nGiven these analyses, both conditions (A and B) would make the slippery-slope argument fallacious if they were true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. both A and B are correct; either condition would make the argument fallacious.**"
