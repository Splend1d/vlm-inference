Minimize distorted thinking.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It aims to help individuals recognize and challenge their distorted or irrational thoughts, which can lead to emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors. By addressing these thought patterns, CBT helps individuals develop more realistic and adaptive ways of thinking, ultimately improving their mental health and well-being."
