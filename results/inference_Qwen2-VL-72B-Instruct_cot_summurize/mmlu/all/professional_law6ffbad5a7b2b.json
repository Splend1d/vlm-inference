                    "text": "A 10-year-old girl decided to go sledding during a heavy snow and ice storm. She planned to go sledding down Hill Street, a steep and winding thoroughfare. Hill Street, which was located around the corner from the girl's home, was a popular sledding site because of its precipitous incline. The girl's parents had given her permission to sled down Hill Street. On the way to Hill Street, the girl met a classmate, who was 12, and asked if she wanted to join her. The classmate agreed, and the two girls walked to the top of Hill Street together. There, the youngsters mounted the sled. The girl was sitting in front and controlling the steering mechanism while the classmate was behind her. They started their descent at a relatively good speed. As they were about halfway down the road, they approached the intersection of Hill Street and Maple Drive. A driver, who was driving his car along Maple Drive, entered the intersection at the same time as the girls on the sled. When the classmate saw the driver's auto cross into their path, she shouted to the girl to fall off the sled. The girl became frightened and refused to jump off. Just before the sled collided with the car, the classmate pushed the girl off the sled. Her push caused the girl to fall and break her leg. The classmate couldn't get off the sled in time and was struck and injured by the driver's car. If the girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the classmate to recover damages for the girl's broken leg, will they prevail?\n\nA. No, if the classmate believed that the girl was in imminent peril when she pushed her off the sled.\nB. No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\nC. No, if the driver was driving negligently.\nD. No, because the classmate had the girl's implied consent to act in an emergency.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a 12-year-old classmate pushes a 10-year-old girl off a sled to avoid an impending collision with a car. The girl breaks her leg as a result of being pushed off the sled. If the girl's parents assert a claim against the classmate to recover damages for the girl's broken leg, the outcome would depend on several legal principles.\n\nIn general, courts consider whether the actions taken in an emergency situation were reasonable under the circumstances. The classmate's actions could be evaluated based on whether she reasonably believed that the girl was in imminent peril and that pushing her off the sled was necessary to prevent more serious harm.\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. No, unless the classmate acted unreasonably when she pushed the girl off the sled.\n\nThis option reflects the principle that the classmate's actions would be judged based on whether they were reasonable under the circumstances. If the classmate's actions were deemed reasonable, she would not be held liable for the girl's injuries."
