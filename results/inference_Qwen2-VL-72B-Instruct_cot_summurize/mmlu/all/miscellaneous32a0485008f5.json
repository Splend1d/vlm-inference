Deforestation leads to habitat loss, fragmentation, and extinction of many species, making it one of the most significant threats to global biodiversity.\n\nD. **Increased use of ethanol fuels in the United States**: While the production of ethanol fuels (often derived from crops like corn) can lead to land-use changes and potentially affect biodiversity, the direct impact is less severe compared to large-scale deforestation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the activity with the greatest impact on biodiversity is:\n\n**C. Large-scale deforestation of the Amazon or Congo basin tropical forests**."
