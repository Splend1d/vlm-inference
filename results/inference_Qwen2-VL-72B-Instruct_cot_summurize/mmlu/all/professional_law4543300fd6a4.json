                    "text": "A rancher owned a 2,000-acre cattle ranch in a remote section of the state. For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device. One day, a cowboy was riding his horse along the outskirts of the rancher's property, when a gust of wind blew his hat onto the fence. The cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery, wore a pacemaker. When the cowboy touched the top of the fence to retrieve his hat, the electric current short- circuited his pacemaker, resulting in the cowboy's death by electrocution. In a wrongful death action by the cowboy's estate against the rancher, the installation of the electrical wiring device would most likely constitute\n\nA. the legal cause of the cowboy's death, but not the cause-in-fact.\nB. the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death, but not the legal cause.\nC. the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.\nD. neither the legal cause nor the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.\n"

                    "text": "In a wrongful death action, determining whether the installation of the electrical wiring device constitutes both the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death involves understanding the principles of causation in tort law.\n\n1. **Cause-in-Fact (Factual Causation):** This refers to whether the defendant's actions were a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. In this case, the installation of the electrical wiring device was a direct cause of the cowboy's death because it was the electric current from the wiring that short-circuited his pacemaker, leading to his electrocution.\n\n2. **Legal Cause (Proximate Cause):** This involves whether the harm was reasonably foreseeable and whether the defendant's conduct was sufficiently connected to the harm to hold the defendant liable. Here, the rancher's decision to install electrical wiring without posting any warning signs could be seen as creating a foreseeable risk of harm to individuals who might come into contact with the fence, especially given the presence of a pacemaker, which is sensitive to electrical currents.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A:** Incorrect, because the installation of the electrical wiring was indeed the factual cause of the cowboy's death.\n- **Option B:** Incorrect, because the installation of the electrical wiring was also the legal cause of the cowboy's death.\n- **Option C:** Correct, because the installation of the electrical wiring was both the factual and legal cause of the cowboy's death.\n- **Option D:** Incorrect, because the installation of the electrical wiring was both the factual and legal cause of the cowboy's death.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.**"
