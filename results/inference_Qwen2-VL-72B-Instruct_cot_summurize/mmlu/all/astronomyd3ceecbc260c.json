Its distance from you\n\nThe relationship between an object's actual brightness (luminosity) and its apparent brightness (flux) is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the observer. This is known as the inverse square law for light. If you know both the actual brightness and the apparent brightness, you can use this law to estimate the distance of the object from you. The other options (speed, composition, and size) cannot be directly determined from just these two pieces of information."
