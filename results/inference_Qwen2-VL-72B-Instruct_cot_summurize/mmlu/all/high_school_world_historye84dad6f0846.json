If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nAccording to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods?\n\nA. Awe at their technological superiority\nB. Fascination with their strangeness\nC. Offense at a perceived bribe\nD. Interpreting them as an act of submission\n"

The passage begins by stating, \"Strange and costly objects do not interest me.\" This indicates that the Chinese emperor did not find the British goods particularly interesting or valuable.\n\n2. The emperor then mentions accepting the \"tribute offerings\" but clarifies that it was done \"solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.\" This suggests that the acceptance of the goods was more about acknowledging the gesture rather than valuing the items themselves.\n\n3. The emperor continues by saying, \"I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures.\" This reinforces the idea that the emperor did not find the British goods valuable or useful.\n\n4. Finally, the emperor advises the British king to show \"even greater devotion and loyalty in future,\" implying that the exchange of goods should be seen as an act of submission rather than a trade negotiation.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate interpretation of the Chinese reaction to the British goods is:\n\nD. Interpreting them as an act of submission\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
