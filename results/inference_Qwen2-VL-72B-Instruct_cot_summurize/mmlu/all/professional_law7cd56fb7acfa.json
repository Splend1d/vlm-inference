These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.\nB. No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.\nC. Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\nD. Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.\n"

Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\n\nDouble jeopardy protection, as enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, prevents a person from being prosecuted twice for the same offense. This protection applies even if the offenses occur in different jurisdictions. In this scenario, the man was already convicted in State A for the kidnapping, and attempting to prosecute him again in State B for the same act would violate the principle of double jeopardy. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss the charge in State B."
