                    "text": "A chemical company's plant was located in a residential community. The manufacturing process used at the plant generated a toxic chemical as a by- product. The chemical was stored in a state-of-the- art tank on the site before being moved to an off-site disposal facility. The on-site storage arrangement conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations. However, the storage of the toxic chemical created a foreseeable and highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised. Despite the chemical company's proper use and care of the storage tank, toxic fumes escaped from the tank and made residents of the area seriously ill. No state or federal statutes address the issue of the company's liability. In an action by one of the affected residents against the chemical company, will the resident be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the chemical company conformed to the requirements of reasonable care and to the applicable government regulations.\nB. No, because the chemical company used a state-of-the-art storage tank.\nC. Yes, because the chemical company is strictly liable in tort for any harm caused by the toxic chemicals it produced.\nD. Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n"

Yes, because the storage of toxic chemicals in a residential community created a highly significant risk of physical harm even when reasonable care was exercised.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the chemical company has taken all necessary precautions and followed both reasonable care standards and applicable government regulations. However, despite these measures, the storage of the toxic chemical still posed a significant risk of harm to the surrounding community. This situation falls under the doctrine of strict liability in tort law, which holds that certain activities are so inherently dangerous that liability can be imposed regardless of whether the defendant exercised due care. The fact that the chemical company used a state-of-the-art storage tank and conformed to regulations does not absolve them of liability if the activity itself creates an unreasonable risk of harm. Therefore, the affected resident is likely to prevail in their action against the chemical company."
