It also has several movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, a small amusement park, and a branch of the local public library. The mall is advertised as \"a small town with a big-town feel.\" During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\nB. No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.\nC. Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\nD. Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.\n"

No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\n\nThe First Amendment protects individuals from government infringement on their freedom of speech, while the Fourteenth Amendment extends this protection to state governments. However, these constitutional protections do not generally extend to private property unless there is state action involved. Since the mall is privately owned and operated, the mall management's actions in breaking up the protest and requiring the protesters to leave would not be considered state action. Therefore, the mall is within its rights to enforce rules regarding activities on its property, including prohibiting protests, without violating the protesters' constitutional rights to free speech."
