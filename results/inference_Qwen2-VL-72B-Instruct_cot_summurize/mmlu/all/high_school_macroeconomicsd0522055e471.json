Supply refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at various price levels, while demand represents the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy at those same price levels. When supply and demand intersect, it establishes the market equilibrium price. This mechanism allows for the allocation of resources based on consumer preferences and producer capabilities without direct intervention from the government (except for regulations aimed at ensuring fair competition and preventing monopolies)."
