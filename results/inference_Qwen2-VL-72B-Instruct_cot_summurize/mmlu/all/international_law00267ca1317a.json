The flag State is to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas, with the exception of specific cases, such as piracy\n\nUnder international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the flag State has primary and exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas. However, there are exceptions where other States can exercise jurisdiction, notably in cases involving piracy, slave trade, unauthorized broadcasting, and certain other serious crimes."
