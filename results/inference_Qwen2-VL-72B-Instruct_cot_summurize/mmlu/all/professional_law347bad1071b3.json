Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will\n\nA. succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.\nB. succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.\nC. not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.\nD. not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the man can assert a successful claim for assault against the security guard, we need to consider the elements of assault under common law. Assault is typically defined as an intentional act that causes another person to reasonably apprehend imminent harmful or offensive contact.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.**\n   - This option suggests that the man would succeed if he saw the security guard pointing the gun at him. Seeing someone point a gun at you could certainly cause reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Therefore, this could potentially support a claim of assault.\n\nB. **Succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.**\n   - While the reasonableness of the security guard's belief might be relevant to other legal claims such as false imprisonment or malicious prosecution, it does not directly impact the claim of assault. Assault focuses on the victim's reasonable apprehension of harm, not the reasonableness of the defendant's actions.\n\nC. **Not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.**\n   - Intent to injure is not required for assault. The intent to cause apprehension of imminent harm is sufficient. Therefore, the lack of intent to injure does not negate the possibility of an assault claim.\n\nD. **Not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.**\n   - Physical injury is not necessary for an assault claim. The key element is the reasonable apprehension of imminent harm, which can occur without physical injury.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. Succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that seeing the security guard pointing a gun at him would likely cause the man to reasonably apprehend imminent harm, fulfilling the criteria for assault."
