A 2-liter (2L) bag is commonly used for overnight use to ensure comfort and minimize disruptions to sleep. Smaller bags, such as those with capacities of 350ml or 500ml, are generally not suitable for overnight use as they would likely require frequent emptying. A 1-liter (1L) bag might also be used, but a 2-liter bag provides more capacity and is often preferred for overnight use."
