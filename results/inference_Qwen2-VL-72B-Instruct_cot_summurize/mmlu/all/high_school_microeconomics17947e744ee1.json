The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n\nWhen an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X, it increases the cost of production for suppliers. This typically leads to a higher market price and a reduction in the quantity supplied. The burden of the tax is shared between consumers and producers, depending on the elasticity of demand and supply.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because if the demand curve is perfectly elastic (infinitely elastic), any increase in price would lead to zero quantity demanded, meaning that the entire burden of the tax falls on the producers, not the consumers.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because if the demand curve is more elastic, consumers are more responsive to price changes, which means they will reduce their consumption significantly in response to the price increase caused by the tax. Therefore, the consumer's burden of the tax decreases as the demand curve becomes more elastic.\n- **Option C** is incorrect because consumer surplus generally decreases when a tax is imposed, as the price paid by consumers increases and the quantity consumed decreases.\n- **Option D** is correct because if the demand curve is less elastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes. They continue to buy the good despite the price increase, which means they bear a larger portion of the tax burden."
