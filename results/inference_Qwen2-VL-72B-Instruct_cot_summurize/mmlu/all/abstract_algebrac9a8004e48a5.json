The **kernel** of this homomorphism, denoted as \\( \\ker(\\phi) \\), is defined as the set of all elements in \\( R \\) that map to the zero element in \\( S \\):\n\\[ \\ker(\\phi) = \\{ r \\in R \\mid \\phi(r) = 0_S \\} \\]\n\nA ring homomorphism \\( \\phi \\) is said to be **one-to-one (injective)** if it maps distinct elements of \\( R \\) to distinct elements of \\( S \\). This means that for any \\( r_1, r_2 \\in R \\),\n\\[ \\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_2) \\implies r_1 = r_2 \\]\n\nThe kernel being trivial (i.e., containing only the zero element) is equivalent to the homomorphism being injective. Specifically:\n- If \\( \\ker(\\phi) = \\{0_R\\} \\), then for any \\( r_1, r_2 \\in R \\),\n  \\[ \\phi(r_1) = \\phi(r_2) \\implies \\phi(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S \\implies r_1 - r_2 \\in \\ker(\\phi) \\implies r_1 - r_2 = 0_R \\implies r_1 = r_2 \\]\n- Conversely, if \\( \\phi \\) is injective, then for any \\( r \\in R \\),\n  \\[ \\phi(r) = 0_S \\implies \\phi(0_R) = 0_S \\implies r = 0_R \\]\n  Hence, \\( \\ker(\\phi) = \\{0_R\\} \\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n\nThis statement is ambiguous without specifying what \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) represent. In general, for \\( Q \\) to be an ideal in \\( R \\), \\( Q \\) must be a subset of \\( R \\) that satisfies the following conditions:\n1. \\( Q \\) is closed under addition.\n2. For every \\( q \\in Q \\) and every \\( r \\in R \\), both \\( qr \\) and \\( rq \\) are in \\( Q \\).\n\nWithout additional context or clarification about what \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) specifically refer to, we cannot definitively determine the truth of this statement.\n\nGiven the ambiguity of Statement 2, the most accurate answer would be:\n\n**C. True, False**\n\nThus, the final answer is C."
