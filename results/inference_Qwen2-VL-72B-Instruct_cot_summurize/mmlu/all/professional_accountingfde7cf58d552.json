The TIE ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{TIE Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expense}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Income after tax: $5.4 million\n- Interest expense: $1 million\n- Depreciation expense: $1 million\n- Tax rate: 40%\n\nFirst, let's find EBIT. We know that income after tax is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Income After Tax} = \\text{EBIT} - (\\text{Interest Expense} + \\text{Tax on EBIT}) \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for EBIT:\n\n\\[ \\text{EBIT} = \\text{Income After Tax} + \\text{Interest Expense} + \\text{Tax on EBIT} \\]\n\nSince we don't have the exact amount of tax on EBIT directly, we can use the given information to find it. The income after tax is after paying both interest and taxes, so we can calculate the pre-tax income (EBIT - Interest Expense):\n\n\\[ \\text{Pre-Tax Income} = \\text{Income After Tax} + \\text{Interest Expense} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Pre-Tax Income} = \\$5.4 \\text{ million} + \\$1 \\text{ million} = \\$6.4 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the tax on EBIT. Since the tax rate is 40%, the tax on EBIT would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax on EBIT} = \\text{Pre-Tax Income} \\times \\text{Tax Rate} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Tax on EBIT} = \\$6.4 \\text{ million} \\times 0.40 = \\$2.56 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow we can calculate EBIT:\n\n\\[ \\text{EBIT} = \\text{Pre-Tax Income} + \\text{Tax on EBIT} \\]\n\\[ \\text{EBIT} = \\$6.4 \\text{ million} + \\$2.56 \\text{ million} = \\$8.96 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the TIE ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{TIE Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expense}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{TIE Ratio} = \\frac{\\$8.96 \\text{ million}}{\\$1 \\text{ million}} = 8.96 \\]\n\nThe closest option to 8.96 is:\n\nC. 7.4\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 7.4."
