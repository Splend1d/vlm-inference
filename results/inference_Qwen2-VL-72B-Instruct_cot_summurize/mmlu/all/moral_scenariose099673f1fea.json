However, in this context, the action was taken to prevent an imminent threat (defusing a bomb), which could save lives. In such an emergency situation, the intention and outcome might justify the violation of the speed limit under ordinary moral standards.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2, while involving a legal violation, may not be considered morally wrong due to the emergency nature of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
