File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\nHere\u2019s why this option is appropriate:\n\n1. **Affirmative Defense of Contributory Negligence**: In a contributory negligence state like State B, if the pedestrian was indeed crossing the street illegally, the driver can raise contributory negligence as an affirmative defense. This means that if the pedestrian was also negligent, it could potentially bar the pedestrian from recovering any damages.\n\n2. **Counterclaim for Negligence**: Since both parties were injured, the driver can assert a counterclaim for negligence against the pedestrian, seeking damages for his own injuries. This allows the driver to seek compensation for his losses within the same lawsuit.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not suitable for the following reasons:\n\n- **Option B**: Moving for judgment on the pleadings is premature at this stage. The driver needs to first file an answer with defenses and possibly a counterclaim before considering such a motion.\n  \n- **Option C**: Lack of personal jurisdiction is generally not applicable here since the accident occurred in State B, where the lawsuit is filed. Personal jurisdiction typically exists over a defendant who causes harm within the forum state.\n\n- **Option D**: Subject-matter jurisdiction is not an issue in this case. Federal courts have diversity jurisdiction if there is complete diversity between the parties (both plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states or countries) and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Here, the pedestrian is from State A, the driver is from a foreign country, and the claim is for $100,000, which meets the criteria for diversity jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, the most strategic and legally sound advice would be to file an answer with the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and a counterclaim for negligence."
