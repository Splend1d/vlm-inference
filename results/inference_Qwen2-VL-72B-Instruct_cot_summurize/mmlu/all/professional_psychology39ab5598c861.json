Evaluating only one party would not provide a complete picture of the family dynamics and the best interests of the children.\n\n2. **Impartiality**: As a psychologist, your role is to provide objective and unbiased information based on your evaluation. Making a specific recommendation without assessing all parties could introduce bias and undermine the credibility of your testimony.\n\n3. **Best Interests of the Child**: The primary consideration in custody cases should always be the best interests of the child(ren). This requires a thorough evaluation of both parents and the children to understand their needs, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\n4. **Professional Responsibility**: Ethical guidelines for psychologists emphasize the importance of maintaining professional integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest. Recommending custody without a full assessment could compromise these principles.\n\nTherefore, conducting a thorough assessment and providing testimony based on those findings while refraining from making a specific recommendation without evaluating all parties involved aligns with ethical standards and professional responsibilities."
