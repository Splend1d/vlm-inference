This approach is characteristic of:\n\nD. systematic desensitization\n\nSystematic desensitization is a type of behavior therapy that aims to reduce anxiety responses through gradual exposure to the feared stimulus. It typically involves three steps: relaxation training, creation of an anxiety hierarchy, and systematic exposure to the feared stimuli. In Calvin's case, the exposure started with observing the counselor with a dog and progressed to direct interaction with a dog, which aligns with the principles of systematic desensitization."
