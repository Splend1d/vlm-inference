They were built of over 1 million granite bricks.\n- This is a plausible statement as the construction of such monumental structures often involves a large number of building materials.\n\nB. They exhibit sophisticated masonry.\n- This is likely true given the complexity and size of the structures at Great Zimbabwe, indicating advanced construction techniques.\n\nC. They stood 40 feet tall in places.\n- This is also plausible as ancient structures could reach significant heights, especially considering the engineering capabilities of the time.\n\nD. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells.\n- This statement seems less plausible because Great Zimbabwe is located inland in modern-day Zimbabwe, far from any ocean. It would be unusual for them to use ocean shells as a primary material for mortar.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is most likely NOT true about the walls of the central complex of Great Zimbabwe is:\n\nD. The mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells."
