The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots can be complex and require experience to interpret correctly.\n\n(ii) \"The acf and pacf can be difficult to calculate for some data sets\" - This is also true. Calculating ACF and PACF involves statistical computations that can be challenging with certain types of data or large datasets.\n\n(iii) \"Information criteria represent an alternative approach to model order determination\" - This is correct. Information criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are indeed used as alternatives to ACF and PACF for determining the order of autoregressive models.\n\n(iv) \"If applied correctly, the acf and pacf will always deliver unique model selections\" - This is not necessarily true. ACF and PACF can sometimes lead to multiple plausible model orders, especially when the data patterns are not clear-cut.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
