                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the concept of natural selection. During a prolonged drought, finches with deeper, stronger beaks would have had an advantage in cracking open larger, harder seeds that became more prevalent due to the lack of rain. As a result, these birds were more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to the next generation. This process does not imply that each individual bird evolved or developed new traits during its lifetime (which would be incorrect according to evolutionary biology), but rather that those with advantageous traits were more likely to survive and pass those traits on."
