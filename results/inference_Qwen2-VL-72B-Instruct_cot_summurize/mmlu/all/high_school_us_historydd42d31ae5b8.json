I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice.\"\n\u2014William Lloyd Garrison, \"To the Free People of Color of the United States,\" The Liberator, January 15, 1831\nThe reform that William Lloyd Garrison is advocating in the passage was later enacted as a result of the\n\nA. issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation (1863).\nB. passage of the Reconstruction Act of 1867.\nC. ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868).\nD. passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875.\n"
