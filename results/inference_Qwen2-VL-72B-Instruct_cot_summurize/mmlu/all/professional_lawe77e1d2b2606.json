On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor \"is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. \" Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?\n\nA. It was not supported by new consideration.\nB. It was violative of the statute of frauds.\nC. The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.\nD. There was no mutuality of obligation.\n"

It was violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds generally requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. One common provision of the Statute of Frauds is that agreements to pay a debt that is barred by the statute of limitations must be in writing to be enforceable. Since the debtor's promise to pay the $750 debt was made orally after it had been barred by the statute of limitations, it would likely be unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds."
