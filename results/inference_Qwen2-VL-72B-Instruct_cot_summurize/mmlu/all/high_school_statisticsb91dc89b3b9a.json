The response variable was the difference in the number of pimples (old formula - new formula). Which is the correct significance test to perform?\n\nA. A two-proportion z-test\nB.

This test is appropriate because the data are paired (each volunteer uses both the old and new formulas), and the response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the two sides of the face. The matched pairs t-test accounts for the dependency between the measurements from the same individual, making it suitable for analyzing the effectiveness of the new cream compared to the old cream."
