Typically, each pair of electrons carried by NADH can lead to the production of approximately 2.5-3 ATP molecules, while each pair of electrons carried by FADH2 results in about 1.5-2 ATP molecules. Therefore, when considering both FADH2 and NADH+H together, they collectively contribute to the production of around 3 ATP molecules."
