Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman\nB. Ming and Aztec\nC. Han and Gupta\nD. Qin and Etruscan\n"

                    "text": "To determine which other classical empires the reasons given for the fall of the Roman Empire could apply to, let's analyze the key points mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. **Immoderate Greatness**: The empire became too large and powerful, leading to internal decay.\n2. **Prosperity and Decay**: Prosperity led to complacency and internal corruption.\n3. **Military Vices**: The military, influenced by foreign elements and becoming mercenaries, oppressed the freedom of the state.\n4. **Emperor's Actions**: Emperors weakened the military discipline to maintain power and peace.\n5. **Invasion by Barbarians**: The empire was eventually overwhelmed by invasions from external barbarian groups.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these criteria:\n\n**A. Tang and Ottoman**\n- **Tang Empire**: The Tang Dynasty experienced significant prosperity but faced internal corruption and military issues, eventually succumbing to rebellions and invasions.\n- **Ottoman Empire**: The Ottoman Empire expanded greatly and faced internal decay, military challenges, and eventual invasion and fragmentation.\n\n**B. Ming and Aztec**\n- **Ming Dynasty**: The Ming Dynasty faced internal corruption, military weaknesses, and invasions that contributed to its downfall.\n- **Aztec Empire**: The Aztec Empire was conquered by external forces (Spanish conquistadors) after facing internal issues and military challenges.\n\n**C. Han and Gupta**\n- **Han Dynasty**: The Han Dynasty experienced prosperity but faced internal corruption, military challenges, and invasions that led to its decline.\n- **Gupta Empire**: The Gupta Empire faced similar issues of internal decay, military challenges, and external invasions.\n\n**D. Qin and Etruscan**\n- **Qin Dynasty**: The Qin Dynasty was relatively short-lived and did not experience the same prolonged period of prosperity and subsequent decline as described.\n- **Etruscan Civilization**: The Etruscans were an ancient civilization that did not have the same characteristics of a large, long-lasting empire with significant internal and external pressures.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting options that align with the reasons provided for the fall of the Roman Empire are those that experienced significant prosperity followed by internal decay, military challenges, and external invasions. Therefore, the best match is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. Han and Gupta**"
