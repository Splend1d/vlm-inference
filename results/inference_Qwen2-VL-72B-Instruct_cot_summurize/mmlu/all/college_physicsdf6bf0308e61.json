The kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nFor a particle moving at \\(0.6c\\), the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\]\n\nThe kinetic energy of the particle at \\(0.6c\\) is then:\n\n\\[ KE = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = (1.25)mc^2 - mc^2 = 1.25mc^2 - mc^2 = 0.25mc^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the work required to accelerate the particle from rest to \\(0.6c\\) is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, which is \\(0.25mc^2\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.25mc^2"
