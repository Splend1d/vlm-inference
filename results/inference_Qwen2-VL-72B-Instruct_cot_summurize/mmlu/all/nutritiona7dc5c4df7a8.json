Because people who are sick often alter their diets, and may eat less food.\nB. Because the accuracy of some laboratory assays may be compromised in samples from people who are sick.\nC. Because some metabolic pathways are altered in sick people, which changes their micronutrient requirements.\nD. Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n"

Because an acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n\nDuring infections or inflammatory states, the body undergoes an acute phase response, which can lead to changes in the distribution and metabolism of various micronutrients. This response is part of the immune system's efforts to combat infection and inflammation, but it can also affect the levels of certain nutrients in the blood, making it difficult to accurately assess nutritional status based on plasma or serum measurements alone."
