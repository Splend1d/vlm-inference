However, I can guide you on how to find this information:\n\n1. **Search for Reports**: Look for reports from organizations such as UNICEF, WHO, or local Egyptian government health and education departments.\n2. **Surveys and Studies**: Check for any surveys or studies conducted around 2015 that specifically address bullying among children in Egypt.\n3. **Academic Journals**: Academic journals often publish studies on social issues like bullying. These might contain relevant data.\n\nIf you have access to these resources, you should be able to find the specific percentage. If not, it would be best to consult someone with expertise in this area or access to such data."
