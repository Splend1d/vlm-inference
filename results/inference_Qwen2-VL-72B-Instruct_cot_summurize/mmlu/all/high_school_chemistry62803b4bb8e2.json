The I2 molecule is much larger than Br2 (atomic radii are 114 and 133 pm, respectively). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in I2 are much weaker than those in Br2.\nC. The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.\n"

The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nExplanation:\nBoiling points of nonpolar molecules like bromine and iodine are primarily influenced by dispersion forces (London forces), which arise from the temporary dipoles created by the movement of electrons within the molecule. Larger atoms or molecules have more electrons and thus more polarizable electron clouds, leading to stronger dispersion forces. Since iodine (I2) has a larger atomic radius and more electrons compared to bromine (Br2), its electron cloud is more polarizable, resulting in stronger London forces. These stronger intermolecular forces require more energy to overcome, leading to a higher boiling point for iodine."
