However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely\n\nA. relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\nB. relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\nC. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\nD. not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nWhen the father made the promise to the finance manager, he essentially acted as a guarantor or surety for his son's debt. This means that he agreed to be responsible for the debt if his son defaulted on the payments. In many jurisdictions, there is a legal principle known as the \"main purpose exception\" which applies when someone agrees to guarantee another person's debt primarily for their own benefit. \n\nIn this case, the father's primary purpose in making the promise was likely to ensure that his son could obtain the car, which indirectly benefited him by allowing his son to get to college more efficiently. Therefore, the court would most likely hold the father liable for the debt, even though the car lot did not sue the son first. The main purpose exception allows the creditor (the car lot) to seek recovery directly from the guarantor (the father) without having to exhaust remedies against the principal debtor (the son) first."
