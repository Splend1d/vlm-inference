As they were leaving, one of the co-defendants inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. At common law, the co-defendants should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary and arson.\nB. larceny and arson.\nC. larceny only.\nD. burglary, larceny, and arson.\n"

In this case, the co-defendants broke into the warehouse, which constitutes burglary.\n\n2. **Larceny (Theft)**: The unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. The co-defendants loaded large crates of appliances onto their truck, which is theft.\n\n3. **Arson**: The willful and malicious burning of property. While the fire was not initially set intentionally, the co-defendants had the opportunity to extinguish the fire but chose not to, allowing it to spread and cause significant damage. This can be seen as a form of constructive arson because they failed to prevent the fire from spreading when they could have done so.\n\nGiven these points, the most comprehensive charge that covers all aspects of their actions would be:\n\n**D. burglary, larceny, and arson.**\n\nThis option includes all the relevant crimes committed by the co-defendants based on the described scenario."
