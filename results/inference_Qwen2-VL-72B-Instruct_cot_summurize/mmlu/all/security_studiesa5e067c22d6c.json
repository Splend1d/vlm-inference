Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\n\nThis perspective argues that environmental security is a complex issue that cannot be easily addressed through traditional security frameworks. It suggests that not all environmental problems are truly global, and that some states may be more responsible for environmental problems than others. It also suggests that systemic interdependence may not be sufficient to manage environmental security issues.\n\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.\n\nThis perspective argues that the ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not fundamentally challenge traditional security frameworks. It suggests that these approaches still prioritize the security of the state, rather than considering alternative objects of security such as the environment or individuals."
