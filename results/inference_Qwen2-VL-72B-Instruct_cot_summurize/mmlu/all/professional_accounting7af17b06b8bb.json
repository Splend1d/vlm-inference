Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations.\n\nThis concern is unique to SaaS because, unlike with an in-house application where the company has direct control over its data and infrastructure, in a SaaS model, the data is stored on servers managed by the service provider. This raises questions about who owns the data, how it is protected, and what happens if the company decides to switch providers or terminate the service. Additionally, migrating data from one SaaS provider to another can be complex and costly, which is not typically an issue with in-house applications."
