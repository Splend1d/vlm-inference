Debates over social justice\n\nPhillis Wheatley's poem \"On Being Brought from Africa to America\" addresses themes of racial prejudice and the potential for moral and spiritual refinement among people of African descent. The poem challenges the notion that skin color determines one's worth or potential, advocating for the recognition of the humanity and capability of all individuals, regardless of race. This reflects broader debates over social justice, particularly concerning issues of equality and the treatment of marginalized groups in American society."
