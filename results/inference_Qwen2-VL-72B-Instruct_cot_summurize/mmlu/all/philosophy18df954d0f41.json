What constitutes a public space - Understanding the distinction between public and private spaces can help determine where visual data collection is appropriate and legal.\n\nB. Protecting individuals from potential harm - Researchers must ensure that their methods do not cause physical or psychological harm to participants or bystanders.\n\nC. Any risk of invasion of privacy - Visual methods often involve capturing images or videos of people, which can raise concerns about privacy. Researchers need to be mindful of these risks and take steps to mitigate them, such as obtaining informed consent and anonymizing data when necessary.\n\nTherefore, considering all of these factors is crucial for conducting ethical and responsible visual research."
