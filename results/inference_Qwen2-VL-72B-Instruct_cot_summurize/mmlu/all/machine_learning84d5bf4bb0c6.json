An infinite VC dimension means that the model can shatter any set of points, implying it has very high flexibility and expressive power. However, this does not necessarily mean that an SVM with a Radial Basis Kernel (RBF) is worse than one with a polynomial kernel. In fact, the RBF kernel is often used because it can capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data, which might make it more effective in certain scenarios compared to a polynomial kernel. The choice between kernels depends on the specific problem and data at hand.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **False**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"A two-layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, trained on a given dataset; the boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators, therefore these two algorithms will give the same result.\"\n\nA two-layer neural network with linear activation functions indeed performs a linear combination of its inputs, effectively creating a linear separator. Similarly, boosting algorithms like AdaBoost combine weak learners (often linear classifiers) into a strong learner. While both methods involve combining linear separators, they do so in fundamentally different ways. Neural networks use weights and biases to define their decision boundaries, while boosting algorithms iteratively adjust the weights of training examples based on the performance of previous weak learners.\n\nThus, even though both methods involve linear combinations, they operate under different principles and optimization strategies, leading to potentially different results.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. False, False**."
