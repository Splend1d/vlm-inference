It is a common reaction to observing animals in captivity, especially if they are engaging in amusing behavior.\n- This action does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
