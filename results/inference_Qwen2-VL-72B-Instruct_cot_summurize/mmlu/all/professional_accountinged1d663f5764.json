Let's analyze the ownership structure:\n\n1. **Rigg**:\n   - Owns 85% of **Steele**\n   - Owns 40% of **Urco**\n\n2. **Steele**:\n   - Owns 50% of **Urco**\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n### Option A: Rigg and Urco\n- Rigg owns 40% of Urco directly.\n- This does not meet the 80% ownership requirement.\n\n### Option B: Urco and Steele\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n- This also does not meet the 80% ownership requirement.\n\n### Option C: Rigg, Steele, and Urco\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele (meets the 80% requirement).\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco.\n- Rigg indirectly owns 42.5% of Urco through its ownership of Steele (85% of 50%).\n\nSince Rigg owns more than 80% of Steele and indirectly owns more than 80% of Urco through Steele, this configuration meets the criteria for an affiliated group.\n\n### Option D: An affiliated group does not exist\n- This is incorrect based on the analysis above.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Rigg, Steele, and Urco.**"
