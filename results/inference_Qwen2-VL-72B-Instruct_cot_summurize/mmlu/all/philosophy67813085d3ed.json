However, this does not directly address whether deliberative justification is complete or incomplete.\n\nB. **Gauthier argues that deliberative justification by definition takes account of all relevant considerations.**\n   - If Gauthier argues that deliberative justification inherently considers all relevant factors, it implies that he believes it is complete because it addresses all necessary aspects.\n\nC. **Gauthier claims that deliberative justification works.**\n   - This statement indicates that Gauthier believes deliberative justification is effective or functional. While this suggests a positive view, it doesn't explicitly state whether it is complete or incomplete.\n\nD. **Gauthier argues that all theories of justification are equally incomplete.**\n   - This option implies that Gauthier sees a general incompleteness across all theories of justification, including deliberative justification. It suggests that he views deliberative justification as incomplete but no more so than other theories.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most direct and relevant response to the claim that deliberative justification is incomplete would be:\n\n**B. Gauthier argues that deliberative justification by definition takes account of all relevant considerations.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the completeness of deliberative justification by asserting that it encompasses all relevant considerations, thereby countering the claim of its incompleteness."
