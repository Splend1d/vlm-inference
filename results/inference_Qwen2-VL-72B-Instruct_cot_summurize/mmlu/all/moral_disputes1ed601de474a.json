The value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions.\n- This statement suggests that autonomy is only relevant in significant choices. However, it does not directly address the contradiction in euthanasia.\n\nB. Terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives.\n- This implies that patients' decisions might be influenced by their condition, thus questioning the authenticity of their autonomy. While this is an important consideration, it doesn't directly highlight the inherent contradiction in euthanasia itself.\n\nC. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions.\n- This statement directly addresses the core issue: if euthanasia ends a person's life, it also ends their capacity to make any further autonomous decisions. This highlights the inherent contradiction in using autonomy as a justification for euthanasia since it ultimately negates the very autonomy it seeks to uphold.\n\nD. Above of the above.\n- This option suggests that all previous points are correct. However, based on our analysis, only option C directly addresses the contradiction in question.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. Killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions."
