This is because adding limit points to a connected set does not introduce any separation that would disconnect the set. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every continuous function \\( f : (0, 1) \\rightarrow (0, 1) \\) has a fixed point.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Fixed Point:** A fixed point of a function \\( f \\) is a point \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = x \\).\n- **Intermediate Value Theorem:** For a continuous function \\( f \\) on an interval \\([a, b]\\), if \\( f(a) \\neq f(b) \\), then for any value \\( y \\) between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\), there exists at least one \\( c \\in [a, b] \\) such that \\( f(c) = y \\).\n\nConsider a continuous function \\( f : (0, 1) \\rightarrow (0, 1) \\). Since \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f(1) \\) are both in the interval \\((0, 1)\\), we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. However, the theorem does not guarantee a fixed point directly because the endpoints of the interval are not included in the domain of \\( f \\).\n\nFor example, consider the function \\( f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2} \\). This function maps \\((0, 1)\\) into itself but does not have a fixed point within \\((0, 1)\\) since \\( f(x) > x \\) for all \\( x \\in (0, 1) \\).\n\nTherefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe first statement is true, and the second statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. True, False"
