Thus, the initial expenditure is \\( P \\times Q \\).\n   - After the price increase, the new price is \\( 1.1P \\) and the new quantity demanded is \\( 0.8Q \\). Thus, the new expenditure is \\( 1.1P \\times 0.8Q = 0.88PQ \\).\n\n   Comparing the initial expenditure (\\( PQ \\)) with the new expenditure (\\( 0.88PQ \\)):\n   \\[\n   0.88PQ < PQ\n   \\]\n   This indicates that consumer spending on beef has decreased.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**A. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling.**"
