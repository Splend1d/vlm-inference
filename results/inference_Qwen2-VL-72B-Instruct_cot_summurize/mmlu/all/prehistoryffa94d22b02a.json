The Inca Empire reached its greatest extent under the rule of Emperor Pachacuti (r. 1438\u20131471), who initiated a period of rapid expansion.\n\nGiven this information, the most accurate time frame for the beginning of the Inca military expansion is around the mid-15th century.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1450 A.D."
