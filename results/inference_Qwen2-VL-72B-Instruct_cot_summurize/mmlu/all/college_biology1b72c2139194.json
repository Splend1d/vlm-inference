The extensive fungal hyphae network increases the surface area for nutrient absorption, making phosphorus more accessible to the plant roots.\n\nD. **They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because mycorrhizal fungi do not fix nitrogen; they typically receive carbon from the plant in exchange for nutrients like phosphorus.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.**"
