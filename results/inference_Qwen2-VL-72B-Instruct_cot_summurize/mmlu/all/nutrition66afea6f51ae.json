Reports suggest that older people consume less than the recommended contribution of fat to energy intake.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The fat intake of older people can vary widely depending on individual habits, health conditions, and cultural factors.\n\nB. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in older people in high-income countries.\n- This statement is generally accurate. Older adults may be at higher risk for micronutrient deficiencies due to decreased absorption, reduced appetite, and other age-related changes.\n\nC. Older people generally have a lower energy intake than younger adults.\n- This statement is correct. As people age, their basal metabolic rate decreases, and they often become less physically active, leading to a lower overall energy requirement.\n\nD. There is little variation in the dietary intake between older people.\n- This statement is incorrect. Dietary intake among older people can vary significantly based on personal preferences, health conditions, socioeconomic status, and access to food.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Older people generally have a lower energy intake than younger adults."
