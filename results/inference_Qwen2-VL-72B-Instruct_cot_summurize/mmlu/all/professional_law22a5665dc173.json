The law also provides that all other public monies used to support public schools in the state come from locally levied real estate taxes. This results in a large disparity in per-student funding among the state's many public school districts because some districts have higher property values per student than other districts. Public school students who claim to be disadvantaged by this school funding law have challenged the law solely on the ground that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\nC. The students must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest.\nD. The students must demonstrate that the law is not substantially related to an important state interest.\n"

                    "text": "The burden of persuasion in this legal challenge would depend on the level of scrutiny applied by the court when evaluating the constitutionality of the school funding law under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nGiven that the challenge is based on the equal protection clause, the court will likely apply one of three levels of scrutiny: rational basis review, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny. Each level of scrutiny places different burdens on the parties involved.\n\n1. **Rational Basis Review**: This is the lowest level of scrutiny and is typically applied when there is no suspect classification (such as race, national origin) or fundamental right at issue. Under rational basis review, the government must show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. This is a relatively easy standard for the government to meet.\n\n2. **Intermediate Scrutiny**: This level of scrutiny is applied when the law involves quasi-suspect classifications (such as gender). The government must show that the law is substantially related to an important governmental objective.\n\n3. **Strict Scrutiny**: This is the highest level of scrutiny and is applied when the law involves suspect classifications or infringes upon fundamental rights. The government must show that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest and that it is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\n\nIn the context of school funding laws, courts often apply rational basis review unless there is a specific argument that the law discriminates based on a suspect classification or infringes upon a fundamental right. Since the question does not specify that the law discriminates based on a suspect classification or infringes upon a fundamental right, it is reasonable to assume that rational basis review would be applied.\n\nUnder rational basis review:\n- The **state** has the burden of demonstrating that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest."
