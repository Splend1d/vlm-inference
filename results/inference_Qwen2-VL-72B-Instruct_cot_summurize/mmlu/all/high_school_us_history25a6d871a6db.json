They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of following Amendments to the Constitution is most directly an example of the sentiments expressed above?\n\nA. The First Amendment, which guaranteed the right to free speech\nB. The Tenth Amendment, which allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states\nC. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote\nD. The Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol\n"

                    "text": "The sentiment expressed by Thomas Jefferson in the passage suggests that laws and institutions should evolve over time to reflect changes in society, knowledge, and circumstances. This idea is about adapting to new realities and making necessary changes to ensure that the legal framework remains relevant and effective.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The First Amendment, which guaranteed the right to free speech**:\n   - This amendment was part of the original Bill of Rights and was ratified in 1791. It was not a response to changing societal conditions but rather a foundational principle established early on in American history.\n\nB. **The Tenth Amendment, which allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states**:\n   - This amendment was also part of the original Bill of Rights and was ratified in 1791. Like the First Amendment, it was not a response to evolving societal needs but rather a foundational principle of federalism.\n\nC. **The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote**:\n   - This amendment was ratified in 1920 and was a significant change in response to the women's suffrage movement. It reflects a shift in societal attitudes towards gender equality and the recognition of women's rights.\n\nD. **The Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the prohibition of alcohol**:\n   - This amendment was ratified in 1933 and reversed the Eighteenth Amendment, which had prohibited the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. This change was a direct response to the failure of Prohibition and the changing social and economic conditions of the time.\n\nBoth options C and D represent amendments that were introduced to address specific changes in societal attitudes and circumstances. However, the Nineteenth Amendment (option C) is particularly emblematic of Jefferson's sentiment because it fundamentally altered the political landscape by extending voting rights to women, reflecting a profound shift in societal values and understanding of equality.\n\nTherefore, the most directly applicable example of the sentiments expressed by Thomas Jefferson is:\n\n**C. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote**."
