Physical examination shows lesions that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions.

Basement membrane\n\nThe clinical presentation described\u2014recurrent, widespread blister formation with lesions primarily in flexural areas such as the axillae and groin, without oral involvement\u2014suggests a dermatological condition known as pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid. Both conditions involve adhesion failure at different levels of the skin.\n\nIn pemphigus vulgaris, the adhesion failure occurs within the epidermis (above the basement membrane), leading to intraepidermal blistering. In bullous pemphigoid, the adhesion failure occurs below the basement membrane, resulting in subepidermal blistering.\n\nGiven the lack of oral lesions and the presence of intact blisters, bullous pemphigoid is more likely than pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous pemphigoid involves autoantibodies targeting components of the basement membrane zone, particularly BP180 and BP230 antigens, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the dermo-epidermal junction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Basement membrane"
