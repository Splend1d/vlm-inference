Long-term capital gain: $15,000\n2. Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis: $9,000\n3. Dividends from publicly-held companies: $10,000\n\nFor AMT purposes, certain items are treated differently than they are for regular income tax purposes. Specifically:\n\n- **Long-term capital gains** are generally not considered AMT preference items.\n- **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis** is an AMT preference item.\n- **Dividends from publicly-held companies** are generally not considered AMT preference items.\n\nTherefore, the only AMT preference item listed here is the percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis, which amounts to $9,000.\n\nSo, the amount of West's AMT tax preference items is:\n\nA. $9,000"
