It ensures the safety of the person driving the car.\n- There is no indication that this action was done with malicious intent or caused harm.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I told my son he could not have candy until after dinner.\"\n- Setting limits on when a child can consume certain foods, such as candy, is a common parenting practice aimed at promoting healthy eating habits.\n- This action is typically seen as responsible and caring rather than morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
