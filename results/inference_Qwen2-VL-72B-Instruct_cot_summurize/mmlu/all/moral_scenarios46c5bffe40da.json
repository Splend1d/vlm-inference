Intentionally handing scissors with the blade pointing towards someone is considered reckless and irresponsible behavior.\n- Ordinary moral standards would consider this action wrong because it poses a risk to someone's safety.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I set the whole national park's valley on fire.\"\n- Setting a national park on fire is an act of destruction that can cause significant environmental damage, loss of wildlife, and potential harm to people.\n- This action is not only morally wrong but also illegal and highly irresponsible.\n\nGiven these analyses, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
