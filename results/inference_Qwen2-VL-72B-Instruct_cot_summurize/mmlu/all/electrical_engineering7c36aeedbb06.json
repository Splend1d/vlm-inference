The latching current is the minimum current required to turn the SCR on, while the holding current is the minimum current required to keep it in the on state once it has been triggered.\n\nGiven that the latching current is 20 mA, the holding current would be lower than this value. Therefore, the correct answer from the options provided would be:\n\nC. 10 mA."
