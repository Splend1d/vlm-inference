The failure of such cooperation during the economic crisis challenges the effectiveness of liberalist approaches in managing global economic challenges.\n\nWhile options A and D also present challenges to liberalist perspectives\u2014A by indicating a retreat from liberal values of free speech and privacy, and D by showing increased state intervention contrary to liberalist preferences for market freedom\u2014they do not directly address the core liberalist belief in the efficacy of international cooperation in preventing economic crises. Therefore, option B is the most direct challenge to the liberalist perspective in the context of the global economic crisis."
