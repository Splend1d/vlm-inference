In practice, the actual number of cuts could be slightly less due to the random distribution of the sequence.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\n- A. about 2\n- B. about 4\n- C. about 20\n- D. about 50\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value (approximately 256) is:\n\n**D. about 50**\n\nThis is because the actual number of cuts might be less than the theoretical maximum due to the random distribution of the sequence. Thus, the best estimate among the given options is about 50."
