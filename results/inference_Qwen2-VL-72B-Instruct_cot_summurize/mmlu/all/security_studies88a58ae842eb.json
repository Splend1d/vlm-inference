Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others.\n\nPost-structuralists often focus on how knowledge and discourse construct and reinforce power dynamics and social hierarchies. In the context of security studies, they would be interested in how narratives and theories about security and warfare not only reflect but also actively shape political realities, legitimizing certain actions and actors while delegitimizing others. This perspective emphasizes the role of security studies in constructing what is considered legitimate or illegitimate in the realm of warfare and international relations."
