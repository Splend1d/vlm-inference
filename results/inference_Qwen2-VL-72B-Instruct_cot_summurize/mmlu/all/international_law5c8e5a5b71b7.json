The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at its third session. It is not a treaty, nor is it a Security Council resolution or a declaration adopted by several states at an international conference. Instead, it serves as a foundational document that outlines fundamental human rights to be universally protected."
