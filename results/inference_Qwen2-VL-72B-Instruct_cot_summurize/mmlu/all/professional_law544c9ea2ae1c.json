When Costco added the condition of a loading charge, it changed the terms of the original offer, making it a counteroffer. Since this counteroffer was not accepted by Rainmaking Lawfirm, there is no binding contract.\n\n**Option D: No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.**\n- This is also correct. The mirror image rule states that for a contract to form, the acceptance must match the offer exactly. Since Costco's order confirmation deviated from the original offer by adding a new term (loading charge), it constitutes a counteroffer, which was not accepted by Rainmaking Lawfirm.\n\nGiven the analysis, both Options C and D are correct based on different legal principles. However, Option C directly addresses the specific scenario where the counteroffer was not accepted, making it the most straightforward and accurate choice.\n\n**Final Answer: C. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.**"
