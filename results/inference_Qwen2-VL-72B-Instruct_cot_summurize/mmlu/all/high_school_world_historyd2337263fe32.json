It discusses the conditions of labor and the necessity for children to work due to economic circumstances.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A: A factory owner is forcing him to do so.**\n     - There is no mention in the passage of any factory owner forcing the witness to send his children to work.\n   - **Option B: He doesn\u2019t earn enough on his own.**\n     - The witness states, \"Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.\" This suggests that he needs additional income because his own earnings are insufficient.\n   - **Option C: The children need discipline.**\n     - There is no indication in the passage that the witness believes his children need discipline through work.\n   - **Option D: Their labor is only moderately difficult.**\n     - The passage mentions that the children's work is not sufficient for their subsistence (\"it will not keep it as it should do\"), implying that the difficulty of the labor is not the primary reason.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most accurate reason given in the passage for allowing the children to work is that the witness does not earn enough on his own to support his family.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**B. He doesn\u2019t earn enough on his own.**"
