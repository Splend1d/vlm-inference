Their payouts (i.e. dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted.\n\nEquity, in the form of stocks or shares, represents ownership in a company. Dividends paid to shareholders are typically distributed from the company's post-tax profits. On the other hand, bondholders receive interest payments (coupons), which are generally considered a business expense and are therefore tax-deductible for the issuing company. This means that bondholders receive their payouts before the company pays its corporate taxes, whereas equity holders receive dividends after the company has paid its taxes."
