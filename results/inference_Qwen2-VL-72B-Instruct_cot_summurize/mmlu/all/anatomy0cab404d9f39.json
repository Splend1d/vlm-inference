Masseter\n\nThe masseter muscle is one of the primary muscles involved in elevating the mandible, which is essential for actions like chewing and clenching the teeth. The temporalis muscle also contributes to this movement, but the masseter is particularly powerful and plays a significant role in the initial phase of mandibular elevation. The lateral pterygoid and medial pterygoid muscles are more involved in protrusion and retraction of the mandible, respectively."
