                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of Marcus Garvey's statement:\n\n1. **Context**: Marcus Garvey was a prominent figure in the early 20th century who advocated for the rights and empowerment of African people worldwide. His movement, known as the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), promoted Pan-Africanism and encouraged African Americans to return to Africa.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - Garvey emphasizes that Black people have the same emotions, hopes, and desires as other races.\n   - He references the nationalistic sentiments of various countries (\"Canada for the Canadians,\" \"America for the Americans,\" etc.) and argues that it is reasonable for Black people to advocate for \"Africa for the Africans.\"\n   - This suggests a call for racial pride and self-determination among African Americans.\n\nGiven this analysis, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Interventionism vs. Isolationism in Foreign Policy**: This debate concerns whether the United States should engage actively in international affairs or remain isolated from them. Garvey's statement does not directly address U.S. foreign policy stances.\n\nB. **Separatism vs. Integration in African American Society**: This debate involves whether African Americans should seek to live separately from white society or integrate into it. Garvey's advocacy for \"Africa for the Africans\" aligns with separatist ideas, promoting a distinct identity and possibly even a separate homeland.\n\nC. **Exclusion vs. Inclusion in Immigration Policy**: This debate pertains to whether the U.S. should allow immigrants to enter and become part of society or exclude them. Garvey's statement does not specifically address immigration policy but rather focuses on racial identity and self-determination.\n\nD. **Laissez-Faire Policies vs. Government Intervention in Economic Affairs**: This debate concerns the role of government in regulating the economy. Garvey's statement does not discuss economic policies or government intervention.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most fitting context for Garvey's statement is related to the debate between separatism and integration within African American society.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nB. The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society."
