Glucose\n\nAfter breaking an overnight fast with a meal consisting of three slices of toast and a boiled egg, the concentration of glucose in the blood will likely be higher compared to before breakfast. The toast, which is a source of carbohydrates, will be broken down into glucose during digestion and absorbed into the bloodstream, raising blood glucose levels. The boiled egg provides protein and some fat, but its primary impact on blood glucose is minimal compared to the carbohydrates from the toast.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Alanine: While alanine can be released from muscle tissue and converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis, the immediate increase in blood glucose after consuming carbohydrates would overshadow any changes in alanine concentration.\n\nC. Ketone bodies: Ketone bodies are typically elevated during fasting or when carbohydrate intake is low, as the body shifts to using fat for energy. After a meal containing carbohydrates, ketone body levels would decrease rather than increase.\n\nD. Non-esterified (free) fatty acids: These are also typically elevated during fasting as the body mobilizes fat stores for energy. After a meal, especially one containing carbohydrates, the levels of non-esterified fatty acids would decrease as the body prioritizes the use of glucose for energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Glucose."
