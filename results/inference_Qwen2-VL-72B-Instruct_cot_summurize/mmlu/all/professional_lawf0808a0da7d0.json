                    "text": "The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state tax exemption that discriminates based on gender and attendance status. Specifically, it asks which option best summarizes the correct rule of constitutional law regarding this tax exemption.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process.**\n   - Due process typically refers to fair procedures in legal proceedings. This option does not directly address the issue of gender discrimination, which is the core concern here.\n\nB. **The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.**\n   - The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This clause is particularly relevant when a law discriminates based on gender. Since the tax exemption treats female and male students differently based on their gender, it likely violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nC. **The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process.**\n   - Substantive due process deals with the content of laws rather than the procedures used to enforce them. It generally protects fundamental rights such as privacy or freedom of speech. This option does not fit because the issue here is about gender discrimination, not a fundamental right protected by substantive due process.\n\nD. **The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.**\n   - Municipalities have some discretion in taxation, but they must do so without violating constitutional protections. Discriminating based on gender would likely be unconstitutional regardless of whether it is a municipal or state action.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate summary of the correct rule of constitutional law regarding the state tax exemption for students who enroll half-time is:\n\n**B. The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the primary constitutional issue at hand: the violation of the Equal Protection Clause due to gender-based discrimination."
