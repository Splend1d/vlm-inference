Probable cause typically requires a warrant unless there are exigent circumstances.\n\n- **Option C:** \"Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.\"\n  - This option suggests that the entry violated the knock and announce rule. However, the scenario states that they knocked and announced their presence, so this does not apply.\n\n- **Option D:** \"Yes, the police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home for an arrest.\"\n  - This option is generally true but does not consider the possibility of exigent circumstances, which could justify the entry without a warrant.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.**\n\nThis conclusion takes into account the probable cause, the knock and announce procedure, and the plain view doctrine, aligning with the legal principles described."
