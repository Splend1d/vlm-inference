Since \\(G\\) has a subgroup of order 7, the order of \\(G\\) must be divisible by 7.\n\n2. **Elements and their inverses**: If no element other than the identity is its own inverse, this means that for every non-identity element \\(g \\in G\\), there exists another distinct element \\(h \\in G\\) such that \\(gh = hg = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element. This implies that elements come in pairs (except for the identity).\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **27**: This is not divisible by 7, so it cannot be the order of \\(G\\).\n\nB. **28**: This is divisible by 7 (\\(28 = 7 \\times 4\\)). However, if \\(G\\) had an order of 28, it would imply that there are 27 non-identity elements. Since elements come in pairs (except for the identity), and 27 is odd, it's impossible to pair all non-identity elements without leaving one out, which contradicts the condition that no element other than the identity is its own inverse. Therefore, 28 cannot be the order of \\(G\\).\n\nC. **35**: This is divisible by 7 (\\(35 = 7 \\times 5\\)). With an order of 35, there would be 34 non-identity elements. Since 34 is even, it's possible to pair all non-identity elements without contradiction. Thus, 35 is a possible order for \\(G\\).\n\nD. **37**: This is a prime number and not divisible by 7, so it cannot be the order of \\(G\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 35**."
