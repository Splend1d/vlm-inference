High fatigue resistance\n\nType IIb muscle fibers, also known as fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, are characterized by their high contractile speed (D), low oxidative capacity (A), and high motor unit strength (C). However, they have low fatigue resistance, which means they tire quickly during sustained activity. Therefore, high fatigue resistance is not a characteristic of type IIb muscle fibers."
