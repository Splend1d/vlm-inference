Braces are typically recommended for crooked teeth to improve oral health and function, whereas pulling teeth could lead to further dental issues and harm the child's overall health.\n- **Conclusion:** This action is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I can't keep the puppy because I discovered I am allergic to dogs.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Discovering an allergy to dogs and deciding not to keep a pet due to health reasons is a reasonable and understandable decision. It is not morally wrong to prioritize one's health and well-being.\n- **Conclusion:** This action is not considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
