A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments.\n\nThis type of demand curve is known as the kinked demand curve, which is characteristic of oligopoly markets where firms are interdependent and react to each other's pricing strategies. The kink occurs because rivals will match a price decrease (to avoid losing market share) but not a price increase (to gain market share). This results in a discontinuous demand curve with different elasticities above and below the current price."
