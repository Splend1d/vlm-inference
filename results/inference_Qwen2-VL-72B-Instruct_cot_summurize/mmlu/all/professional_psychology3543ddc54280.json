It helps in matching the right person to the right job (A), setting wages and salaries based on the job's requirements and market rates (B), and establishing safety standards related to the job tasks (C). However, determining underutilization in the workforce labor market comparisons is not a direct use of job analysis; it involves broader economic and labor market analyses that go beyond the scope of job analysis."
