The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accepts it and responds in the attacker's favor.\nA replay attack is a type of security threat where an attacker intercepts and retransmits a previously transmitted data transmission in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or to fraudulently manipulate the system. In a replay attack, the attacker captures a valid data transmission, such as a password or session ID, and retransmits it at a later time to gain access to the system or to perform some other malicious action. Replay attacks can be difficult to defend against because they use legitimate data that has already been authorized by the system. However, there are techniques that can be used to prevent replay attacks, such as using timestamps or sequence numbers to ensure that each message is unique and cannot be reused."
