A larger sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval because it provides more information about the population parameter, reducing the uncertainty. On the other hand, a higher level of confidence (e.g., 99%) results in a wider confidence interval because it requires capturing more of the possible values of the parameter.\n\nGiven these factors:\n\n- Option A: Small sample size and 95% confidence will result in a relatively wide confidence interval.\n- Option B: Small sample size and 99% confidence will result in an even wider confidence interval than option A due to the higher confidence level.\n- Option C: Large sample size and 95% confidence will result in a narrower confidence interval compared to options A and B due to the larger sample size.\n- Option D: Large sample size and 99% confidence will result in a wider confidence interval than option C but still narrower than options A and B due to the larger sample size.\n\nTherefore, the narrowest confidence interval would be obtained with:\n\nC. Large sample size and 95% confidence"
