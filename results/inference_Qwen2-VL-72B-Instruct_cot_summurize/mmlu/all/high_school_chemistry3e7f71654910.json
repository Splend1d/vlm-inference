However, as the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases, there are more points where temporary dipoles (induced dipoles) can be formed due to the movement of electrons. These induced dipoles can interact with each other through van der Waals forces, which become stronger as the number of carbon atoms and thus the surface area for interaction increases. This leads to higher melting points for longer hydrocarbon chains because more energy is required to overcome these intermolecular forces."
