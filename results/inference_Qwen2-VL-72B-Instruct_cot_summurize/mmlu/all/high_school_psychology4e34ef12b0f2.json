This contrasts with fluid intelligence, which involves problem-solving, reasoning, and the ability to process new information quickly, and generally peaks in early adulthood before gradually declining.\n\nVisual acuity typically declines with age, and the ability to reason speedily also tends to decrease as one gets older due to the natural decline in processing speed associated with aging."
