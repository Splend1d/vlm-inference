However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB. Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\nC. Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\nD. Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\n"

Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\n\nThe issue here is that the researcher was unable to make contact with people in 8 out of the initial 50 homes selected for the survey. This means that those 8 homes were not included in the final sample of 50 homes used to calculate the average number of children. If the households that were not contacted have a different average number of children compared to those that were contacted, then the final sample may not accurately represent the entire population of single-family homes. This can lead to undercoverage bias, where certain groups within the population are underrepresented in the sample, potentially resulting in an underestimate of the true average number of children. Therefore, the estimate of 1.73 is likely too low due to undercoverage bias."
