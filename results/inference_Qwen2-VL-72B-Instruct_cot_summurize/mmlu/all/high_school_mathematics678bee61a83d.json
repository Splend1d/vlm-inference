Therefore, 4 is not guaranteed to be a factor.\n\nB. 6 = \\(2 \\times 3\\)\n- The number has a factor of 2, but there is no mention of 3 among its prime factors. Therefore, 6 is not guaranteed to be a factor.\n\nC. 10 = \\(2 \\times 5\\)\n- The number has both a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Since both of these primes are listed as factors of the number, 10 must be a factor of the number.\n\nD. 15 = \\(3 \\times 5\\)\n- The number has a factor of 5, but there is no mention of 3 among its prime factors. Therefore, 15 is not guaranteed to be a factor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 10."
