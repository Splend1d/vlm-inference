On May 1, the owner sold the tract to a buyer for the purchase price of $40,000 under a quitclaim deed. The owner delivered the deed to the buyer who did not record the deed. After the sale to the buyer, the owner found himself in desperate need of money because he lost his job. So the owner, in consideration of the sum of $75,000, conveyed the tract to an investor by warranty deed. This transaction took place on August 1. When the investor acquired title to the tract, he had no actual knowledge of the buyer's deed (which was still unrecorded). On August 10, the buyer recorded his deed to the tract. The investor did not record the deed he received from the owner until August 15.

                    "text": "To determine who holds title to the tract in this scenario, we need to analyze the recording statute and the sequence of events.\n\nThe recording statute states: \"No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nHere are the key points:\n1. The owner sold the tract to the buyer on May 1 via a quitclaim deed, but the buyer did not record it.\n2. The owner then sold the tract to the investor on August 1 via a warranty deed. The investor had no actual knowledge of the buyer's deed at the time of purchase.\n3. The buyer recorded his deed on August 10.\n4. The investor recorded his deed on August 15.\n\nGiven these facts, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The buyer, because his deed preceded the investor's deed.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the recording statute does not prioritize the order of deeds but rather the recording of those deeds.\n\nB. **The buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.**\n   - This option is correct. According to the recording statute, the buyer's deed must be considered because it was recorded before the investor's deed. Since the investor did not have actual notice of the buyer's deed when he purchased the property, the recording of the buyer's deed prior to the investor's deed makes the buyer's interest superior.\n\nC. **The investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.**\n   - This option is incorrect. While the investor may have taken the property in good faith and for value without notice, the recording statute specifically requires that the conveyance be recorded prior to the subsequent purchase to protect against subsequent purchasers. The investor's deed was not recorded before the buyer's deed.\n\nD. **The investor, because he took title by warranty deed and the buyer took title by quitclaim deed.**\n   - This option is incorrect. The type of deed (warranty vs. quitclaim) does not affect the priority of recording under the recording statute. The recording date is what matters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.**"
