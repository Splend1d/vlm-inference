The concept of universal and fundamental human rights is not universally accepted or understood in the same way across different cultures and societies. This lack of consensus can undermine the moral foundation for humanitarian intervention.\n\nB. There may not be a broad global consensus on the circumstances under which the use of force is justified to protect human rights. Different countries and international actors may have varying interpretations of when such interventions are appropriate.\n\nC. The potential for abuse by powerful states is a significant concern. Norms that allow for the use of force to protect individual rights could be exploited by stronger nations to pursue their own interests under the guise of humanitarianism.\n\nTherefore, all of these points highlight limitations to the case for humanitarian intervention."
