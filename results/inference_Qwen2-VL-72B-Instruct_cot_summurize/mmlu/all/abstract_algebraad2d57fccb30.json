Since \\(H\\) is normal, \\(kh'k^{-1} \\in H\\), and thus \\(hkh'k' = h(kh'k^{-1})k' \\in HK\\).\n\nThus, if one of the subgroups (\\(H\\) or \\(K\\)) is normal, \\(HK\\) will indeed form a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n### Statement 2: All groups of order \\(p^2\\) where \\(p\\) is prime are Abelian.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- A group of order \\(p^2\\) has \\(p^2\\) elements.\n- By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups (subgroups of order \\(p\\)) divides \\(p^2\\) and is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\). The only possibilities for the number of Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups are 1 and \\(p\\).\n- If there is exactly one Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup, it is normal. Since \\(p^2\\) is the order of the group, this implies the group is cyclic and hence Abelian.\n- If there are \\(p\\) Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups, they must intersect trivially (since their intersection would be a proper subgroup of each, which cannot have more than \\(p\\) elements). Thus, each non-identity element generates a distinct subgroup of order \\(p\\), implying the group is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\(p\\), which is also Abelian.\n\nTherefore, all groups of order \\(p^2\\) are indeed Abelian.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
