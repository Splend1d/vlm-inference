The most well-known form is utilitarianism, which aims to maximize overall happiness.\n\n2. **Kantianism (Deontological Ethics)**: This theory focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, independent of their consequences. It emphasizes duties, rules, and respect for rational beings.\n\n3. **Virtue Ethics**: This theory centers on the character and virtues of individuals rather than on specific actions or consequences. It considers what kind of person one should be.\n\n4. **Contractualism**: This theory suggests that moral norms arise from agreements or social contracts among rational agents.\n\nGiven that Carruthers' approach to the moral standing of nonhuman animals often involves considerations of their capacities and the intrinsic value of their experiences, it aligns more closely with a theory that values the inherent worth of beings rather than just their utility or the outcomes of actions.\n\nConsidering this, **Kantianism** seems to be the most fitting choice because it emphasizes the intrinsic dignity and respect owed to beings capable of experiencing things, which can include nonhuman animals if they are considered rational or sentient beings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Kantianism"
