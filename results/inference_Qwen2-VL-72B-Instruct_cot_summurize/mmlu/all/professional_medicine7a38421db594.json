Each episode of pain lasts for 1 second or less. The pain is often triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth. She has had no trauma to the face or head. Medical history is remarkable for tension headaches, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal.

Carbamazepine\n\nCarbamazepine is the first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, which is characterized by brief, intense, electric shock-like pains in the face, typically triggered by certain activities like chewing, speaking, or touching the face. The patient's symptoms are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, making carbamazepine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time."
