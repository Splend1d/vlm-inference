One night, he was working backstage security for one of his favorite bands when he noticed a groupie sneak in the back door, pick up a guitar, and begin to walk out with it. He drew his service revolver and exclaimed, \"Stop or I'll shoot!\" The groupie looked at him and then fled. The defendant fired at the fleeing groupie, fatally wounding her. Use of force was not authorized by the concert promotion company that employed him. On these facts, if the defendant is charged with murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty.\nB. not guilty, because the killing constituted justifiable homicide.\nC. not guilty, because the killing constituted excusable homicide.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant warned the groupie before he fired his gun.\n"

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Proportionality of Force**: The defendant used lethal force to prevent theft of a guitar. In most jurisdictions, lethal force is only justified when there is an imminent threat to life or serious bodily harm. Stealing a guitar does not typically rise to the level of such a threat.\n\n2. **Authorization**: The defendant was not authorized by the concert promotion company to use lethal force. This lack of authorization suggests that his actions were beyond the scope of his employment duties.\n\n3. **Warning**: While the defendant did warn the groupie before firing, the warning itself does not justify the use of lethal force in this context. The warning must be followed by a proportionate response, which in this case would likely involve non-lethal means to apprehend the thief.\n\n4. **Fleeing Offender**: The groupie was fleeing after being confronted. In many legal systems, once a suspect is no longer posing an immediate threat (e.g., they are running away), lethal force is not justified.\n\nGiven these points, the defendant\u2019s actions do not meet the criteria for justifiable or excusable homicide. Therefore, he should be found guilty of murder unless additional mitigating circumstances are presented that are not included in the given facts."
