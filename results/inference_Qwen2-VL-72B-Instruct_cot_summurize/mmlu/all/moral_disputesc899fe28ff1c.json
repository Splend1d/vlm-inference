Most feminist theories differentiate between consensual and non-consensual acts.\n\nB. \"By suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good.\"\n   - This option suggests that feminist legal theory focuses on consent as the primary factor distinguishing harmful (rape) from non-harmful (consensual) sex. This could imply that any consensual act is inherently without harm, which might lead to an under-acknowledgment of other potential harms within consensual relationships.\n\nC. \"By suggesting that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender, it implies that women are not especially harmed by nonconsensual sex.\"\n   - This option addresses the idea that feminist legal theory might overlook gender-specific harms associated with rape, implying that the focus on consent alone might neglect broader social and gender-based impacts of sexual violence.\n\nGiven these analyses, options B and C seem more aligned with West's argument about the potential oversimplification or under-acknowledgment of harms within consensual sex due to a focus on consent alone.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. By suggesting that the harm of rape is that it is nonconsensual, it implies that all consensual sex is good."
