As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.\n\nA tracheostomy is often performed to help patients who are on mechanical ventilation (a ventilator) for an extended period. It provides a direct airway, which can make it easier to wean them off the ventilator and manage their breathing. While tracheostomies can be used in other situations such as repairing vocal cords or before certain types of neck surgery, aiding in the weaning process from a ventilator is a common reason."
