It serves as a benchmark to ensure that individuals seeking licensure have attained a certain level of proficiency in the field. While it does contribute to protecting the public by ensuring that licensed psychologists have met a standard of competence, its primary purpose is to evaluate foundational knowledge rather than directly predicting job performance or determining the need for additional training or supervision."
