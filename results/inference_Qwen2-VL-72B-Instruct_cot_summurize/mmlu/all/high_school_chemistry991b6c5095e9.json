                    "text": "The velocity of an electron after being ejected from an atom depends on the energy difference between the initial state (the subshell it was in) and the final state (which is typically at infinity for a free electron). The higher the energy level of the subshell, the lower the binding energy of the electron to the nucleus, and thus the less energy is required to eject it.\n\nIn a neutral chlorine atom, the subshells are filled in order of increasing energy: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p. Chlorine does not have any electrons in the 3d subshell since its electron configuration ends with 3p^5.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- Electrons in the 1s subshell are most tightly bound to the nucleus due to their proximity.\n- Electrons in the 2p subshell are less tightly bound than those in the 1s but more so than those in the 3p.\n- Electrons in the 3p subshell are the least tightly bound among the filled subshells in chlorine.\n\nSince the 3p electrons are the least tightly bound, they require the least amount of additional energy to be ejected compared to electrons from other filled subshells. Therefore, when high-energy photons bombard the chlorine atom, electrons from the 3p subshell will have the highest velocity after being ejected because they were already at a higher energy level and thus have a smaller energy gap to overcome to reach the final state.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3p"
