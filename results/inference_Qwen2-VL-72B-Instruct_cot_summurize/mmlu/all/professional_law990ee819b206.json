The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?\n\nA. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.\nB. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.\nC. Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.\nD. Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves several legal concepts, including conspiracy, solicitation, and murder. Let's break down each element:\n\n1. **Conspiracy**: A conspiracy occurs when two or more individuals agree to commit an unlawful act. In this case, the brothers and the housekeeper agreed to poison the uncle.\n\n2. **Solicitation**: Solicitation happens when someone requests, encourages, or commands another person to commit a crime. Here, the brothers solicited the housekeeper to poison their uncle.\n\n3. **Murder**: Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. The brothers intended to kill their uncle, but the physician ended up dying instead due to an accidental switch of cups.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only**:\n   - This option does not account for the physician's death, which occurred as a direct result of the brothers' actions.\n\nB. **Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician**:\n   - This option incorrectly implies that the brothers conspired to kill both the uncle and the physician, which was not their intention.\n\nC. **Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician**:\n   - This option correctly identifies the conspiracy to kill the uncle and acknowledges the unintended murder of the physician.\n\nD. **Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician**:\n   - This option includes all relevant elements: solicitation (the brothers asking the housekeeper), conspiracy (the agreement to kill the uncle), and murder (the physician's death).\n\nConsidering the detailed analysis, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**D. Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.**"
