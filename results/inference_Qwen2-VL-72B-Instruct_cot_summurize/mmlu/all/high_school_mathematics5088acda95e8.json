The LCM of 5 and 2 is 10, meaning both computers will back up data together every 10 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, so there are \\(60 \\times 24 = 1440\\) minutes in twenty-four hours.\n\nNow, we divide the total number of minutes in a day by the interval at which they back up together:\n\n\\[1440 \\div 10 = 144\\]\n\nTherefore, the two computers back up data at the same time 144 times in twenty-four hours.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 144."
