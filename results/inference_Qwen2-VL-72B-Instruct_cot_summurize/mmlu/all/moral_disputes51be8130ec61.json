Justice: Justice often involves ensuring that rights and deserts are respected and balanced. It can be seen as a broader concept that encompasses both rights and desert.\n\nB. Fairness: Fairness is closely related to justice and can also involve balancing rights and deserts. However, it might not necessarily be considered more fundamental than rights and desert themselves.\n\nC. Respect for other persons: This value emphasizes treating individuals with dignity and consideration, which can underpin both rights and desert. It suggests a foundational principle that supports the recognition of rights and desert.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. respect for other persons\n\nThis choice implies that respecting individuals as persons is a more fundamental value that supports the recognition and application of rights and desert."
