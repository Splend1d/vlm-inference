So, the probability that a chip came from Company Y is \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\n3. \\( P(D) \\): The probability that a chip is defective.\n   - There are 3 defective chips out of 9 total chips (1 from Company X and 2 from Company Y). So, the probability that a chip is defective is \\( \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nNow, substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\n\\[ P(Y|D) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)} \\]\n\n\\[ P(Y|D) = \\frac{\\frac{4}{18}}{\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\n\\[ P(Y|D) = \\frac{4}{18} \\cdot \\frac{3}{1} \\]\n\n\\[ P(Y|D) = \\frac{4}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ P(Y|D) = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the probability that the chosen chip came from Company Y given that it is defective is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 2 / 3."
