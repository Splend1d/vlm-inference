However, it is not necessarily morally wrong because the intention is likely to be supportive and kind. The action could be seen as misguided rather than malicious or harmful.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character plans to meet up after graduation.\n\nThis scenario describes a simple plan to meet someone after graduation. There is no indication of any harm or wrongdoing involved in this plan. It is a neutral action without any moral implications.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong; it is more about a well-intentioned but possibly ineffective action.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong; it is simply a plan to meet up.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
