The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be\n\nA. granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.\nB. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.\nC. granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\nD. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the ski mask and the money should be excluded from evidence, we need to analyze the circumstances surrounding their discovery and seizure.\n\n### Ski Mask:\n- **Discovery**: The ski mask was found in the closet when the officer inspected it before allowing the defendant to retrieve his pants.\n- **Lawfulness of Inspection**: The officer had a legitimate reason to inspect the closet for safety reasons (to ensure no accomplices or weapons were present). This inspection can be considered reasonable under the circumstances, especially given the context of an arrest and the potential danger associated with bank robbery suspects.\n- **Admissibility**: Since the inspection of the closet was lawful, the ski mask discovered during this inspection would likely be admissible in court.\n\n### Money:\n- **Discovery**: The money was found during a protective sweep conducted by the officer's partner in another room of the house.\n- **Lawfulness of Protective Sweep**: A protective sweep is generally permissible to ensure officer safety and to check for additional threats. However, the scope of such a sweep is limited to areas where an accomplice might reasonably be expected to hide.\n- **Admissibility**: The protective sweep may have been justified initially, but the discovery of the money in a back storage room seems to extend beyond the immediate scope of ensuring officer safety. This could potentially be seen as exceeding the bounds of a lawful protective sweep, making the discovery of the money questionable.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n**Option D: denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money** is not correct because the ski mask was discovered lawfully.\n\n**Option C: granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money** is incorrect for the same reason.\n\n**Option B: granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask** is plausible since the ski mask was found during a lawful inspection, while the money's discovery might be challenged due to the broader scope of the protective sweep.\n\n**Option A: granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money** is incorrect because the ski mask was found during a lawful inspection.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.**"
