Sort the jobs by their service times: 2, 3, 5, 15, 25.\n2. Calculate the completion time for each job:\n   - The first job completes at time 2.\n   - The second job completes at time 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - The third job completes at time 5 + 5 = 10.\n   - The fourth job completes at time 10 + 15 = 25.\n   - The fifth job completes at time 25 + 25 = 50.\n\n3. Calculate the total completion time: 2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 92.\n4. Calculate the average completion time: Total completion time / Number of jobs = 92 / 5 = 18.4.\n\nTherefore, the minimum average completion time is 18.4, which corresponds to option B (208/5)."
