An official who leaves the State Department to work as a paid consultant to foreign governments.\n\nInfluence peddling refers to using one's position or connections for personal gain, often by leveraging influence from a previous governmental role. In this case, an official who transitions from the State Department to a paid consultancy with foreign governments could potentially use their prior governmental connections and knowledge to benefit themselves or the foreign governments they consult for, which could raise concerns about influence peddling."
