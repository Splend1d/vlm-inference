However, there is no direct indication from Huemer's worry that he believes the metaphor is used to mask a bad argument.\n\nB. **does not really describe the situation well at all, since it is more like a game than a war.**\n   - This implies that Huemer thinks the metaphor is inaccurate because the situation is better described as a game rather than a war. There is no mention of Huemer comparing the situation to a game, so this seems unlikely.\n\nC. **is perfectly apt.**\n   - This would mean Huemer believes the \"war\" metaphor is an accurate description of the situation. However, his worry indicates dissatisfaction with the metaphor, so this option is inconsistent with his concern.\n\nD. **makes it hard to think and discuss the rights of drug users.**\n   - This suggests that Huemer is concerned that the \"war\" metaphor hinders rational discussion and understanding of the rights of drug users. Given that metaphors can influence how we perceive and discuss issues, this aligns well with a worry about the impact of language on thought processes.\n\nConsidering the options and the context provided, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**D. makes it hard to think and discuss the rights of drug users.**"
