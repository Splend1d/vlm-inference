While some less developed countries did experience rapid growth, it is not generally true that they all exceeded high-income countries consistently.\n\nC. **Exceeded that of Britain during the industrial revolution**: The industrial revolution in Britain saw very rapid economic growth. For less developed countries to exceed this rate would be highly unusual and unlikely.\n\nD. **Was approximately 3.0% per year**: This is a specific growth rate. Historically, many less developed countries experienced significant growth rates during this period, but whether it was consistently around 3.0% per year requires more detailed data analysis.\n\nGiven the historical context and typical economic growth patterns, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**D. Was approximately 3.0% per year**\n\nThis aligns with general economic trends where many less developed countries experienced substantial growth rates during this period, though it varied significantly by country."
