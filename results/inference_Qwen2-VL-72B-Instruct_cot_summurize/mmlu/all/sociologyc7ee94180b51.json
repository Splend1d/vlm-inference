Wider at the bottom than at the top\n\nWhen a population has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations, it means that there are more young people entering the population than older people leaving it. This results in a population pyramid that is wider at the bottom (representing the younger age groups) and narrows as it moves up (representing the older age groups). This shape indicates a growing or expanding population."
