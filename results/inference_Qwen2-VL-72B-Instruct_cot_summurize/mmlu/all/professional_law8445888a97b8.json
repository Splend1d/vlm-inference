A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\n\nIn this scenario, the identification process appears to have been highly suggestive and potentially unreliable. The victim saw the defendant in a highly unusual context (in jail clothing, restrained with handcuffs and leg irons) which could have influenced her identification. This type of identification is often viewed with skepticism by courts due to the potential for misidentification. The court would likely consider whether the identification was made under circumstances that were fair and reliable before allowing it into evidence."
