They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.\n\nMeteorites, especially those classified as chondrites, contain isotopes that can be used to date their formation. These isotopes indicate that meteorites formed around 4.6 billion years ago, which is consistent with the estimated age of the solar system. This information helps scientists understand the early conditions and processes that led to the formation of the planets and other bodies in our solar system."
