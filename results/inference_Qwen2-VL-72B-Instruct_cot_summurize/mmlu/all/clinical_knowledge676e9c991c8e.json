                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It always elevates on swallowing\" - This statement is not entirely accurate. While many thyroid swellings (nodules) may move with swallowing, it is not a universal characteristic and can vary depending on the location and attachment of the nodule.\n\nB. \"Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign\" - This is incorrect. Enlarged lymph nodes in the context of a thyroid swelling often suggest a more serious condition, such as thyroid cancer, which is generally considered a poor prognostic sign rather than a good one.\n\nC. \"An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone\" - This is not correct. Ultrasound is excellent for evaluating the size, shape, and internal characteristics of a thyroid nodule but does not directly measure hormone secretion. To assess hormonal activity, a blood test measuring thyroid hormones or radioactive iodine uptake scan would be more appropriate.\n\nD. \"A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer\" - This statement is true. Functioning nodules, also known as \"hot\" nodules, typically produce their own thyroid hormones and are less likely to be malignant compared to non-functioning (\"cold\") nodules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
