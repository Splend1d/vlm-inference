This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's apply this to each option:\n\nA. 4, 7\n- Sum of the other two sides: \\(4 + 7 = 11\\)\n- Since 11 > 10, these lengths could form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nB. 5, 5\n- Sum of the other two sides: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n- Since 10 is not greater than 10, these lengths would not form a valid triangle because the sum of the two shorter sides must be strictly greater than the longest side.\n\nC. 3, 9\n- Sum of the other two sides: \\(3 + 9 = 12\\)\n- Since 12 > 10, these lengths could form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nD. 9, 8\n- Sum of the other two sides: \\(9 + 8 = 17\\)\n- Since 17 > 10, these lengths could form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nTherefore, the set of lengths that could NOT form a triangle with the longest side being 10 is **B. 5, 5**."
