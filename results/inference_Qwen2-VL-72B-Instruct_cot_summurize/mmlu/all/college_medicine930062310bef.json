When the hypothalamus detects stress, it releases corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol, the primary stress hormone in humans.\n\nOnce cortisol levels rise in the bloodstream, they exert a negative feedback effect on both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. This negative feedback mechanism helps to reduce the production and release of CRF and ACTH, thereby decreasing cortisol production and returning the body to a state of homeostasis. This is how the stress response is eventually suppressed."
