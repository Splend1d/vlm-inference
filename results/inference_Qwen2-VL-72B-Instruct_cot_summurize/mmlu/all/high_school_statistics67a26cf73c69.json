Since the IQR is based on the middle 50% of the data (the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile), changing the height of the tallest student will not affect the IQR. The mean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and variance can be influenced by extreme values, so they may change when the tallest student's height is corrected."
