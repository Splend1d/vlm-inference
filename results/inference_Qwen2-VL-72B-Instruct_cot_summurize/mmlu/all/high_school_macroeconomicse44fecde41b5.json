It includes legal economic activities that contribute to the economy.\n\n- **Pirated DVDs entering the nation illegally** (Option A) would not be counted in GDP because they are illegal and do not represent legitimate economic activity.\n- **The services of a physician** (Option B) would be counted in GDP as it represents a legal service provided within the economy.\n- **A retiree's social security benefits** (Option C) would not be counted in GDP because these are transfer payments, which are not considered production or economic output.\n\nTherefore, both A and C are correct, making D the right choice."
