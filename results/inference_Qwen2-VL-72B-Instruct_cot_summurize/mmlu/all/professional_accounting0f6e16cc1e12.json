Charging all costs to expense when incurred.\n\nAccording to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), research and development (R&D) costs that have no alternative future use should be expensed as they are incurred. This is because R&D costs are considered to be highly uncertain in terms of their future economic benefit, and thus, they do not meet the criteria for capitalization as an asset on the balance sheet."
