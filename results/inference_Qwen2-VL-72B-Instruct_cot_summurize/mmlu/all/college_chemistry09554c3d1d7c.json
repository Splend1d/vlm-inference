                    "text": "The correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\nHere's why:\n\nI. The conditional formation constant (K'f) is indeed affected by pH because it takes into account the activities of all species present in the solution, including the protonated forms of EDTA and the metal ions. At different pH levels, the concentration of these species can change, thus affecting the overall stability of the metal-EDTA complex.\n\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form does vary with pH. EDTA has four carboxylic acid groups and two amino groups that can be protonated. At lower pH values, more of the EDTA will be protonated, reducing its ability to form stable complexes with metal ions. Buffering the solution at a specific pH ensures that a sufficient amount of the fully deprotonated form is available for complexation.\n\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, hydrogen ions (H+) are often produced as a byproduct. This is because the deprotonated form of EDTA (Y4\u2212) binds to the metal ion, and the protons are released into the solution. Buffering the solution helps maintain a consistent pH despite the release of H+ during the reaction.\n\nTherefore, buffering the solutions at the same pH is crucial for maintaining consistent conditions throughout the titration process, ensuring accurate results."
