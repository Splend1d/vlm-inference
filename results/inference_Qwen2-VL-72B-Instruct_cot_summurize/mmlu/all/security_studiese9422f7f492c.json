Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.\n\nThis option accurately reflects one of the ways in which weapons from state military or police forces can end up on the illicit arms market. In situations where there is significant corruption, weak governance, or inadequate security measures, weapons can be stolen or looted and subsequently sold on the black market. This can occur during conflicts, coups, or other periods of instability when control over arms is compromised."
