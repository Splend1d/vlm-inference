Let's break down each recommendation and see which hypotheses they align with:\n\n1. **Increased access to education**: This is often associated with the **Self-esteem hypothesis** (I), as education can help individuals develop a stronger sense of self-worth and reduce feelings of inferiority that might contribute to prejudice.\n\n2. **Paid community improvement projects open to people from different, possibly conflicted, groups**: This aligns with the **Contact hypothesis** (II), which suggests that direct contact between members of different groups under conditions of equality and cooperation can reduce prejudice.\n\n3. **Stricter anti-hate ordinances**: This relates to the **Legal hypothesis** (IV), which posits that legal measures can deter hate crimes and enforce societal norms against discrimination.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer would include the Self-esteem hypothesis (I), the Contact hypothesis (II), and the Legal hypothesis (IV).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I, II, and IV"
