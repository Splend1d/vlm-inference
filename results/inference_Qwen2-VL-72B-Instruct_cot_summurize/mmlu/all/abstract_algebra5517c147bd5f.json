This property does not necessarily imply that the group must be of prime-power order. For example, the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\) is solvable but its order is 6, which is not a prime power. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\nA group of prime-power order (i.e., a p-group for some prime \\( p \\)) is always solvable. This is a well-known result in group theory. The proof relies on the fact that any finite p-group has a non-trivial center, and by induction, it can be shown that such groups have a subnormal series with abelian factor groups. Hence, this statement is true.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
