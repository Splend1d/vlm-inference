After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\nA. Women's suffrage\nB. Trust-busting\nC. Greater rights for unions\nD. Weakening political machines\n"

                    "text": "Let's analyze the passage step by step to determine which political goal it most directly supports.\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage describes a situation where working women faced hardships during a strike due to financial pressures. They discuss forming their own boarding club to support each other during such times. This initiative is supported by Hull House, leading to the establishment of a self-managed club.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **A. Women's suffrage**: While the passage does involve women and their struggles, it focuses more on economic and labor issues rather than explicitly addressing voting rights.\n   - **B. Trust-busting**: This involves breaking up large monopolies or trusts. The passage does not mention any large corporations or trusts that need to be broken up.\n   - **C. Greater rights for unions**: The passage discusses the difficulties faced by workers during a strike and how they sought to support each other through a collective effort (the boarding club). This suggests a focus on worker solidarity and support, which aligns with union rights.\n   - **D. Weakening political machines**: There is no mention of political machines or corruption in the passage.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The passage emphasizes the importance of worker solidarity and mutual support during strikes, which is closely related to the broader goal of strengthening unions and workers' rights.\n\nTherefore, the perspective of the passage most directly supports:\n\n**C. Greater rights for unions**"
