While Leroy appreciates these changes, he is worried that his parents will not be able to afford to continue living in their neighborhood because property values are rising.

Gentrification\n\nGentrification refers to the process by which a neighborhood experiences an influx of wealthier residents, often leading to the renovation of buildings and an increase in property values. This can result in the displacement of lower-income residents who can no longer afford to live in the area due to rising costs. The description of new developments and upscale shopping centers, along with concerns about affordability for long-term residents like Leroy's parents, aligns with the characteristics of gentrification."
