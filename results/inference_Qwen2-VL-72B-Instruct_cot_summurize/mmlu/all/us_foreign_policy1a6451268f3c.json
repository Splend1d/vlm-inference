The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in November 2002, whereas the 9/11 Commission Report was released in July 2004.\n\nB. **Moving the Department of Defense Intelligence Agencies to the CIA for better coordination**: There is no evidence that the 9/11 Commission recommended such a drastic measure. The Commission focused more on improving coordination and oversight rather than merging agencies.\n\nC. **Creation of the National Intelligence Director**: This is a key recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The Commission suggested the creation of a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee and coordinate the activities of the various intelligence agencies within the U.S. government. This position was established to improve inter-agency communication and intelligence sharing.\n\nD. **Moving the domestic intelligence component of the FBI to the CIA**: There is no indication that the 9/11 Commission recommended transferring the FBI\u2019s domestic intelligence functions to the CIA. The Commission emphasized the need for better coordination between existing agencies rather than restructuring them fundamentally.\n\nGiven this analysis, the main organizational change proposed by the 9/11 Commission with regard to the U.S. intelligence community was:\n\n**C. Creation of the National Intelligence Director**"
