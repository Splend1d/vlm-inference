People with fixed money incomes, such as retirees living on pensions or individuals receiving fixed salaries, are particularly vulnerable because their income does not increase along with the rising prices. As a result, they can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money, leading to a decline in their standard of living.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Debtors with fixed interest rates benefit from inflation because the real value of their debt decreases over time.\n- Investors in gems, coins, and stamps may see an increase in the value of their investments during inflationary periods.\n- Property owners often benefit from inflation as property values tend to rise, and the real value of any mortgage debt they have decreases."
