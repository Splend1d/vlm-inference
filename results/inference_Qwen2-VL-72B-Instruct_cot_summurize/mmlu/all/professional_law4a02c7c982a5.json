                    "text": "Recently, Congress enacted a statute requiring all boat owners to register their boats with a newly created federal boat registry. Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Interstate Commerce**: The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states (the Commerce Clause). Given that an increasing number of stolen boats are being transported across state lines and even to other countries, this activity falls under the purview of interstate commerce. Therefore, Congress has the authority to enact legislation aimed at preventing such activities.\n\n2. **General Welfare**: While Congress does have the power to regulate for the general welfare, this power is typically exercised through its spending powers rather than directly regulating commerce. However, the primary argument here would be based on the Commerce Clause rather than the General Welfare Clause.\n\n3. **Tenth Amendment**: The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. However, when an issue involves interstate commerce, it falls under the federal government's jurisdiction, potentially overriding state laws.\n\n4. **State Laws**: Although all states already require boat registration, the existence of these state laws does not preclude federal regulation if the federal law addresses issues that extend beyond state boundaries, such as interstate theft and resale.\n\nTherefore, the most compelling reason for the constitutionality of the statute is that Congress can reasonably determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce, thereby justifying federal regulation under the Commerce Clause."
