When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

This act demonstrates a level of intent and recklessness.\n\n2. **Resulting Death**: The gun discharged due to an external factor (the beer bottle striking the man's hand), resulting in the friend's death.\n\n3. **Common Law of Homicide**:\n   - **Depraved-Heart Murder**: This involves a situation where the defendant acts with extreme indifference to human life, even if there is no specific intent to kill. The act of pointing a loaded gun at someone with the finger on the trigger can be seen as demonstrating such indifference.\n   - **Felony Murder Rule**: This rule applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of intent to kill. Pointing a gun at someone could be considered assault, which is a felony in many jurisdictions.\n\n4. **Claim of Right**: The man's argument that he intended to retrieve property under a claim of right does not negate the fact that he used a dangerous method to do so, which led to the death.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these points, the evidence supports the notion that the man acted with a depraved heart by pointing a loaded gun at his friend, even if he did not intend to pull the trigger. Additionally, the felony murder rule could apply if pointing the gun is considered a felony.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the principles of common law regarding murder convictions, considering both the depraved-heart doctrine and the felony murder rule."
