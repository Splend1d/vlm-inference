This information is essential for developing effective training programs tailored to the needs of the community organizations and the outplaced workers. Once the job requirements are understood, the group can then proceed with determining the skill levels and job satisfaction of currently employed people (if necessary), evaluating the self-esteem of each outplaced worker, and developing training objectives."
