If the Sun's mass were doubled, the new mass of the Sun (\\( m_1' \\)) would be:\n\n\\[ m_1' = 2m_1 \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for gravitational force gives us:\n\n\\[ F' = G \\frac{(2m_1) m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\\[ F' = 2G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nComparing this to the original force \\( F \\):\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nWe see that the new force \\( F' \\) is twice the original force \\( F \\).\n\nTherefore, if the Sun were twice as massive, its pull on Mars would be twice as much.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. twice as much"
