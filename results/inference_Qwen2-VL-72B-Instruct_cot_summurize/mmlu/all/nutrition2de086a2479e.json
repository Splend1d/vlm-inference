The increase in blood glucose concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread.\n\nThe glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrates based on how they affect blood sugar levels. It compares the rise in blood glucose levels following the consumption of a particular food to the rise in blood glucose levels following the consumption of a reference food, typically white bread or glucose. Foods with a high GI cause a more rapid and pronounced rise in blood glucose levels compared to foods with a low GI."
