No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine whether the plaintiff's proposed testimony is admissible, we need to analyze the nature of the statements made by the janitor and the supervisor in the context of hearsay rules.\n\n1. **Hearsay Rule**: Generally, hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is inadmissible unless it falls under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\n2. **Janitor's Statement**:\n   - The janitor's statement is a report of what he heard from the supervisor. This is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the supervisor made the derogatory comment).\n   - For the janitor's statement to be admissible, it must fall under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n3. **Supervisor's Statement**:\n   - The supervisor's statement (\"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\") is also hearsay if it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the supervisor actually said this and harbored discriminatory intent).\n\n4. **Applicable Exceptions**:\n   - **Present Sense Impression**: This exception allows for immediate reactions to events or perceptions. However, the janitor's statement does not qualify as a present sense impression because it was not made contemporaneously with the event but rather reported later.\n   - **Statement of Then-Existing State of Mind**: This exception allows statements reflecting the declarant\u2019s then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. The supervisor's statement could potentially fall under this exception if it reflects his then-existing state of mind regarding the plaintiff.\n\n5. **Scope of Employment**:\n   - Statements made by employees within the scope of their employment can sometimes be attributed to the employer. However, this typically applies to statements made in the course of performing job duties, not casual remarks overheard by third parties.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The janitor's statement is not a present sense impression and does not fall under any recognized hearsay exception.\n- The supervisor's statement might be admissible if it reflects his then-existing state of mind, but this would still require careful consideration by the court.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.**\n\nThe supervisor's statement might be admissible under certain circumstances, but the janitor's repetition of it is hearsay and does not fall under any recognized exception."
