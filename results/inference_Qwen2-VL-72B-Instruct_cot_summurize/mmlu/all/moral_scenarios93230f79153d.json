It involves taking someone against their will, which is a violation of their basic human rights and can cause immense harm and suffering.\n- This action is universally condemned under both legal and moral standards.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves behavior that might be considered disrespectful but does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrongdoing due to the severe harm caused by kidnapping.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
