Lapita\n\nThe Lapita culture is known for its distinctive pottery, which features intricate geometric designs and is named after the site of Lapita in New Caledonia where such artifacts were first discovered. The Lapita people were early Austronesian speakers who migrated across the Pacific, leaving behind a rich archaeological record that includes their pottery. This pottery style became a hallmark of the broader Lapita cultural complex."
