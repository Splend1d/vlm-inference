When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, \"You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. \" Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, \"Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. \" The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.\nB. guilty, because duress is not a defense to murder.\nC. not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome if the defendant is charged with felony murder for the deaths caused by the arson, we need to analyze the given information and apply relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Felony Murder Rule**: This rule holds that if someone dies during the commission of a felony, the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, regardless of whether they intended to kill anyone.\n\n2. **Duress**: Duress occurs when a person commits a crime under threat of immediate harm to themselves or others. It can sometimes serve as a defense in criminal law, but its applicability varies depending on the jurisdiction and the specific crime involved.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A**: Guilty, because the killings occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony (arson). This aligns with the felony murder rule, which would hold the defendant responsible for the deaths that occurred during the commission of the arson.\n\n- **Option B**: Guilty, because duress is not a defense to murder. While duress might mitigate some crimes, it typically does not serve as a complete defense to murder in many jurisdictions.\n\n- **Option C**: Not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson. This option suggests that duress could exonerate the defendant from the arson charge, but it does not address the felony murder charge directly.\n\n- **Option D**: Not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances. This implies that the defendant had a valid justification for their actions, which is unlikely given the context provided.\n\nConsidering the felony murder rule and the fact that duress is generally not a defense to murder, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.**"
