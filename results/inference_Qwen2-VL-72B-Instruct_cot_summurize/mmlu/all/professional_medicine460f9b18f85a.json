She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"\n\nA. Adrenal insufficiency\nB. Anxiety\nC. Atlanto-axial instability\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia\n"

                    "text": "The most likely cause of the patient's \"drop attacks\" is C. Atlanto-axial instability.\n\nAtlanto-axial instability is a condition where there is excessive movement between the first two cervical vertebrae (the atlas and axis) in the neck. This can occur due to inflammation and erosion of the ligaments and bones in the area, which can be caused by conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The symptoms of atlanto-axial instability can include weakness and loss of feeling in the legs, as well as incontinence during episodes of instability. These symptoms are consistent with the patient's description of her \"drop attacks.\"\n\nAdrenal insufficiency, anxiety, and cardiac arrhythmias can also cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient, but they are less likely to be the cause of her \"drop attacks\" based on the information provided."
