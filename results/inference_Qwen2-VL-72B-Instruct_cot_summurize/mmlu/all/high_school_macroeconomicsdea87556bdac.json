This can lead to an increase in prices, or inflation, as businesses raise prices to keep up with demand. Inflation can be a significant threat to the macroeconomy because it can erode purchasing power and make it more difficult for consumers and businesses to afford goods and services. Additionally, high inflation can lead to higher interest rates, which can slow down economic growth."
