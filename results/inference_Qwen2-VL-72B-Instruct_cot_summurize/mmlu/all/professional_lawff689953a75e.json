At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?\n\nA. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.\nB. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\nC. The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.\nD. 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.\n"

                    "text": "The owner's defense that the sale of the materials is constitutionally protected speech hinges on the legal standards for obscenity under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. According to the Supreme Court's decision in Miller v. California (1973), obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and can be regulated by states. However, for material to be considered obscene, it must meet specific criteria:\n\n1. The average person, applying contemporary community standards, must find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\n2. The work must depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law.\n3. The work, taken as a whole, must lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nGiven these criteria, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.**\n   - This statement addresses the nature of the sexual conduct depicted but does not directly address the prurient interest or the lack of serious value required by the Miller test. It may help to some extent but is not the strongest argument.\n\nB. **The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.**\n   - This statement directly addresses the third prong of the Miller test: whether the work lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. If the materials are indeed serious scientific studies, they could be considered to have significant scientific value, which would make them less likely to be deemed obscene.\n\nC. **The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.**\n   - While this might raise issues regarding the legality of the police action and potentially the admissibility of evidence, it does not directly address the constitutionality of the materials themselves under the obscenity laws.\n\nD. **85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.**\n   - This statement reflects public opinion but does not directly relate to the legal standards set forth in the Miller test. Public opinion alone is not sufficient to determine the constitutionality of the materials.\n\n**Conclusion:** The option that would be most helpful to the owner's defense is B. If the materials are shown to consist of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges, they would likely be considered to have significant scientific value, thereby failing to meet the third prong of the Miller test and thus being constitutionally protected speech."
