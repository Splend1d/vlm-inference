Discouraged people who have given up looking for jobs\n\nThe official unemployment rate, as calculated by many statistical agencies, typically includes only those individuals who are actively seeking employment but are currently without work. This means it does not account for \"discouraged workers,\" who are people who have given up looking for jobs due to the belief that no jobs are available for them. These individuals are considered outside the labor force and thus are not included in the official unemployment statistics, leading some to argue that the official rate underestimates the true level of unemployment."
