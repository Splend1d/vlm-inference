While many philosophers and political theorists emphasize the importance of life as a fundamental right, Butler's specific focus on this point is not widely recognized.\n\n2. **Liberty**: Liberty or freedom is often considered a fundamental right in various philosophical traditions. However, Butler's work does not particularly highlight liberty as the sole right.\n\n3. **Property**: Butler's philosophy, particularly his views on ethics and morality, emphasizes the importance of property rights. He argues that individuals have a natural right to their own property, which is foundational to his ethical system.\n\n4. **Happiness**: While happiness is a significant goal for many ethical theories, Butler did not specifically claim that happiness is the only right one has.\n\nGiven Butler's emphasis on property rights within his ethical framework, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. property.**"
