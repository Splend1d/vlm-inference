While this might be true in general, it does not directly address the concept of becoming more or less docile.\n\nB. **Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile**:\n   - This statement aligns well with the idea of the docility hypothesis. It suggests that when faced with high environmental demands, individuals may become more submissive or docile as a response to cope with these pressures.\n\nC. **Those who experience high environmental demands become less docile**:\n   - This statement contradicts the typical understanding of the docility hypothesis. If anything, high environmental demands would likely lead to increased stress and potentially more aggressive behavior rather than less docility.\n\nD. **Those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands**:\n   - This statement is contrary to common sense and empirical evidence. Generally, those with fewer capabilities are considered more vulnerable to environmental demands, not less so.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate interpretation of the docility hypothesis is:\n\n**B. Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile**."
