The Doppler effect is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \\right) f \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f' \\) is the observed frequency,\n- \\( f \\) is the emitted frequency,\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium,\n- \\( v_o \\) is the velocity of the observer (positive if moving towards the source),\n- \\( v_s \\) is the velocity of the source (positive if moving away from the observer).\n\nFrom this formula, it is clear that we need:\n1. The speed of sound in the medium (\\( v \\)).\n2. The frequency of the emitted sound (\\( f \\)).\n\nThe time of interaction between the sound source and detector (II) and the distance between the source and detector (III) are not directly required for calculating the Doppler shift. These variables might be useful in other contexts but are not necessary for determining the Doppler shift itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and IV"
