Children exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\nB. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\nC.

In this case, the experimental group would be children exposed to chemical waste who may or may not have ALL. The control group should consist of individuals who are as similar as possible to the experimental group in all respects except for the exposure to the chemical waste.\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate control group would be:\n\nB. Children not exposed to the chemical waste who do not suffer from ALL\n\nThis option ensures that the control group is comparable to the experimental group in terms of age and health status but differs only in their exposure to the chemical waste. This allows researchers to isolate the potential effect of the chemical waste on the development of ALL."
