This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(4\\text{-year} | \\neg 2\\text{-year}) \\]\n\nThe event \"not going to a 2-year college\" includes students going to a 4-year college, finding employment, or searching for a job. So, the probability of not going to a 2-year college is:\n\n\\[ P(\\neg 2\\text{-year}) = P(4\\text{-year}) + P(\\text{Employment}) + P(\\text{Job Search}) \\]\n\\[ P(\\neg 2\\text{-year}) = 0.54 + 0.19 + 0.07 \\]\n\\[ P(\\neg 2\\text{-year}) = 0.80 \\]\n\nNow, we can use the definition of conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(4\\text{-year} | \\neg 2\\text{-year}) = \\frac{P(4\\text{-year} \\cap \\neg 2\\text{-year})}{P(\\neg 2\\text{-year})} \\]\n\nSince going to a 4-year college and not going to a 2-year college are mutually exclusive events (a student cannot simultaneously go to both types of colleges), the intersection probability simplifies to just the probability of going to a 4-year college:\n\n\\[ P(4\\text{-year} | \\neg 2\\text{-year}) = \\frac{P(4\\text{-year})}{P(\\neg 2\\text{-year})} \\]\n\\[ P(4\\text{-year} | \\neg 2\\text{-year}) = \\frac{0.54}{0.80} \\]\n\\[ P(4\\text{-year} | \\neg 2\\text{-year}) = 0.675 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.675"
