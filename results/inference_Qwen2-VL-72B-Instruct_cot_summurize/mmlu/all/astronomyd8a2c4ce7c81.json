It is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.\n- This is true. Jupiter has one of the strongest magnetic fields in our solar system, estimated to be about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.\n\nB. It traps charged particles from Io's volcanoes in a \"plasma torus\" around the planet.\n- This is also true. Jupiter's magnetic field interacts with volcanic emissions from its moon Io, creating a plasma torus around the planet.\n\nC. It causes spectacular auroral displays at Jupiter's north and south poles.\n- This is true as well. Jupiter's strong magnetic field interacts with charged particles, leading to intense auroral displays at its poles.\n\nD. It switches polarity every 11 years.\n- This is not true. Unlike Earth's magnetic field, which undergoes reversals approximately every few hundred thousand years, Jupiter's magnetic field does not switch polarity on an 11-year cycle.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true about Jupiter's magnetic field is:\n\nD. It switches polarity every 11 years."
