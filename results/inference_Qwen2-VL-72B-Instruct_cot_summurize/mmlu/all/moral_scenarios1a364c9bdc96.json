However, this is not necessarily considered morally wrong by most people, as it is a natural behavior for dogs. It might be more about etiquette and consideration for other dog owners rather than a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I put my son's dishes in the dishwasher and started it.\"\n- This action is a routine household task and is generally considered responsible and appropriate. There is nothing inherently morally wrong about putting dishes in the dishwasher.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
