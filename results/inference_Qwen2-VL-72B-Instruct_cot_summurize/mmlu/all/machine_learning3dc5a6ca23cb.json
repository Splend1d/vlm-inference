SVMs are fundamentally designed to find the maximum margin hyperplane that separates different classes. While there are methods to estimate probabilities from SVM outputs (e.g., Platt scaling or isotonic regression), these are post-processing steps and not inherent to the SVM model itself.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is False**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The choice of kernel in an SVM can significantly affect which data points become support vectors. \n- A linear kernel considers only the original feature space, while higher-order polynomial kernels map the data into higher-dimensional spaces, potentially changing the decision boundary and thus the set of support vectors.\n- Therefore, it is not generally true that the support vectors will remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to higher-order polynomial kernels.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. False, False**."
