The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nIn this scenario, the researcher is dividing the population of school principals into smaller groups (strata) based on the school districts and then obtaining a random sample from each stratum. This method ensures representation from each district, which can provide more detailed and comparative information about different districts compared to a simple random sample where such representation might not be guaranteed."
