This means that Venus completes its orbit faster than Earth does.\n\n2. **Relative Position**: When Venus is between the Earth and the Sun (inferior conjunction), it appears as a thin crescent from Earth because most of its illuminated side is facing away from us. Conversely, when Earth is between Venus and the Sun (superior conjunction), Venus appears fully illuminated from Earth because its entire sunlit side is facing us.\n\n3. **Phases Visible from Venus**:\n   - **New Phase**: When Earth is between Venus and the Sun, Earth would appear fully illuminated from Venus.\n   - **First Quarter**: As Venus moves in its orbit, there will be a point where half of Earth's sunlit side is visible from Venus.\n   - **Full Phase**: When Venus is between Earth and the Sun, Earth would appear as a thin crescent or not at all from Venus.\n   - **Third Quarter**: Again, as Venus continues in its orbit, another half of Earth's sunlit side becomes visible from Venus.\n\nGiven these considerations, the phases of Earth that would be visible from Venus would include:\n\n- **New Phase**\n- **First Quarter**\n- **Full Phase**\n- **Third Quarter**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. New first quarter full third quarter"
