Replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins\n\nInfluenza viruses are RNA viruses that enter a host cell and use the cell's machinery to replicate their own genetic material and synthesize viral proteins. This process involves the translation of viral RNA into proteins and the replication of viral RNA using the host cell's enzymes. The newly synthesized viral components are then assembled into new virus particles, which can go on to infect other cells."
