An increase in demand increasing the interest rate.\n\nWhen corporate optimism increases, firms are more likely to invest in new projects and expand their operations. This leads to an increased demand for loanable funds as businesses seek to borrow money to finance these investments. The higher demand for loans can lead to an increase in interest rates as lenders respond to the greater demand by charging higher rates to lend their money."
