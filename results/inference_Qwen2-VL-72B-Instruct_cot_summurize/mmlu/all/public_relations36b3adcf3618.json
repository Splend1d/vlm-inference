Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nCurrent thinking in the field of mass communication recognizes that audiences are not passive recipients but rather active participants in the process of receiving and interpreting media messages. This perspective acknowledges that individuals bring their own experiences, beliefs, and critical thinking skills to the consumption of media, which can influence how they perceive and respond to messages. Therefore, the impact of mass communication is not uniform across all audience members."
