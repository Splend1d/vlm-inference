According to this theorem, the work done by the net force on an object equals the change in kinetic energy of the object.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial and final kinetic energies of the box:\n\nInitial kinetic energy (\\(KE_i\\)):\n\\[ KE_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 \\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the box (10 kg) and \\(v_i\\) is the initial velocity (1 m/s).\n\n\\[ KE_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times (1)^2 = 5 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nFinal kinetic energy (\\(KE_f\\)):\n\\[ KE_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 \\]\nwhere \\(v_f\\) is the final velocity (2 m/s).\n\n\\[ KE_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times (2)^2 = 20 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThe change in kinetic energy (\\(\\Delta KE\\)) is:\n\\[ \\Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i = 20 \\text{ J} - 5 \\text{ J} = 15 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nNext, we know that the work done by the force (\\(W\\)) is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\n\\[ W = \\Delta KE = 15 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nWork is also defined as the product of the force (\\(F\\)) and the distance (\\(d\\)) over which the force acts:\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nGiven that the distance (\\(d\\)) over which the force acts is 5 meters, we can solve for the force (\\(F\\)):\n\\[ 15 \\text{ J} = F \\cdot 5 \\text{ m} \\]\n\\[ F = \\frac{15 \\text{ J}}{5 \\text{ m}} = 3 \\text{ N} \\]\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3 N."
