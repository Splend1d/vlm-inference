Hart's concept of secondary rules includes the rule of recognition, which serves as a criterion for identifying valid legal rules within a legal system. The rule of recognition is considered \"power-conferring\" because it provides the authority for judges and other officials to make decisions based on the legal rules recognized by the system. However, it also imposes duties on these officials to apply those rules correctly and consistently. This dual nature of conferring power while simultaneously imposing duties makes the argument that secondary rules are purely \"power-conferring\" less convincing in the case of the rule of recognition."
