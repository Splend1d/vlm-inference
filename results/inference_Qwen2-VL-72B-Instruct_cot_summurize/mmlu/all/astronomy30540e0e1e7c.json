Stability of particles within rings: Moons can help stabilize the orbits of particles within rings through their gravitational influence, preventing them from dispersing or colliding with each other.\n\nB. Gravitational effects at ring edges as the moons pass by: Moons can exert gravitational forces on the edges of rings, causing perturbations that can lead to the formation of sharp boundaries or gaps.\n\nC. Gaps between rings: Moons can create gaps in rings by sweeping up material or by resonant interactions that prevent particles from occupying certain regions.\n\nTherefore, moons contribute to all of these phenomena in the context of planetary rings."
