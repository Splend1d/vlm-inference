If it were prime, its only factors would be 1 and itself, making the answer D (54,320) since it's the largest factor less than the number itself. However, without directly checking for primality, we can proceed by attempting to factorize 54,321.\n\nLet's start by checking divisibility by small primes:\n\n- Divisibility by 2: 54,321 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n- Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits in 54,321 is \\(5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15\\), which is divisible by 3, so 54,321 is divisible by 3.\n- Divisibility by 5: The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n\nSince 54,321 is divisible by 3, let's divide it by 3 to see what we get:\n\n\\[54,321 \\div 3 = 18,107\\]\n\nNow, we have two factors: 3 and 18,107. To determine if 18,107 is prime or has further factors, we can check divisibility by primes greater than 3 but less than \\(\\sqrt{18,107}\\) (since if there were a factor larger than this, there would also be a corresponding smaller factor).\n\nChecking divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc., we find that 18,107 is not divisible by any of these primes. This suggests that 18,107 might be prime, but without further checks, we can't be certain. However, for the purpose of this question, we're looking for the largest factor less than 54,321, and we've already found that 18,107 is a factor.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 6 (which is \\(2 \\times 3\\))\nB. 121 (which is \\(11^2\\))\nC. 18,107\nD. 54,320\n\nThe correct answer is C. 18,107, as it is the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321."
