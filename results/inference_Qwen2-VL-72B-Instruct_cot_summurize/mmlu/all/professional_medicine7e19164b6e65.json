Pheochromocytomas are tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla and secrete catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, which can cause hypertension and other symptoms.\n\nTo establish the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, the most helpful urinary assay would be:\n\nD. vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)\n\nUrinary VMA is a metabolite of catecholamines and is often elevated in patients with pheochromocytoma. Other tests that may also be used include measurement of urinary metanephrines or plasma-free metanephrines, which are more sensitive and specific than VMA for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, among the options provided, VMA is the correct choice."
