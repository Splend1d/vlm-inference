If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\n\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings\n"

In this context, if the machinery is producing ball bearings that do not meet the specified diameter (i.e., they are either under 1.23 cm or over 1.27 cm), but the quality control procedure fails to detect this deviation, the machinery will continue to produce ball bearings of incorrect sizes without any adjustments being made. Therefore, a Type II error results in continued production of wrong size ball bearings."
