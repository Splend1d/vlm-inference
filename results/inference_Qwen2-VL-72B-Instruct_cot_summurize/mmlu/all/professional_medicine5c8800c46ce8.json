This occurs because when the resistance to blood flow through the arteries increases, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the circulatory system, leading to higher blood pressure readings. Factors that can increase PVR include vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), which can be caused by various conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or sympathetic nervous system activation.\n\nIn contrast, decreased cardiac output, decreased pulse rate, and decreased stroke volume would typically result in lower blood pressure rather than higher, as they all imply less forceful or less frequent pumping of blood by the heart."
