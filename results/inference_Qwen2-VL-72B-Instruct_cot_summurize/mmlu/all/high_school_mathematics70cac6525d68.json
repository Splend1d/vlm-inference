                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that the rate of contaminant removal is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. This means that as more contaminant is removed, the rate of removal decreases.\n\nGiven:\n- 20% of the contaminant is removed in the first minute.\n- We need to remove 98% of the contaminant to make the water safe.\n\nLet's denote the initial amount of contaminant as \\( C \\).\n\nAfter the first minute, 20% of \\( C \\) is removed, leaving 80% of \\( C \\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{remaining after 1 minute}} = C \\times (1 - 0.20) = C \\times 0.80 \\]\n\nWe need to find out how many minutes it takes to reduce the contaminant to 2% of its original amount (\\( C \\times 0.02 \\)).\n\nSince the rate of removal is proportional to the amount remaining, we can use the concept of exponential decay. The general formula for exponential decay is:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{remaining}} = C \\times (1 - r)^t \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C_{\\text{remaining}} \\) is the remaining contaminant,\n- \\( C \\) is the initial amount of contaminant,\n- \\( r \\) is the rate of removal per unit time,\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that \\( r = 0.20 \\) and \\( C_{\\text{remaining}} = C \\times 0.02 \\). Plugging these values into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[ C \\times 0.02 = C \\times (1 - 0.20)^t \\]\n\\[ 0.02 = (0.80)^t \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 0.02 = 0.80^t \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = \\ln(0.80^t) \\]\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = t \\cdot \\ln(0.80) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{\\ln(0.80)} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\frac{-3.912}{-0.223} \\approx 17.54 \\]\n\nTherefore, the decontamination process will take approximately 18 minutes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 18 min"
