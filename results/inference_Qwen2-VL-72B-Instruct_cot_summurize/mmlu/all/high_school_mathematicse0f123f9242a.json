To find the other solution, we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-b/a\\) and the product of the roots is \\(c/a\\).\n\nGiven our equation is \\(x^2 - (p+q)x - r(r - (p+q)) = 0\\), we have:\n- The sum of the roots: \\(r + x_2 = p + q\\)\n- The product of the roots: \\(r \\cdot x_2 = -r(r - (p+q))\\)\n\nWe're interested in finding \\(x_2\\), the other root. From the sum of the roots, we can express \\(x_2\\) directly:\n\n\\[x_2 = p + q - r\\]\n\nTherefore, the other solution in terms of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) is \\(p + q - r\\), which corresponds to option D."
