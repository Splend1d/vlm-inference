We need to calculate the total distance fallen in 2 seconds and then subtract the distance fallen in the first second.\n\nFor 2 seconds:\n\\[ s_2 = 0 \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot 2^2 = 19.6 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThe distance fallen during the next second (from 1 to 2 seconds) is:\n\\[ s_{next} = s_2 - s_1 = 19.6 - 4.9 = 14.7 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nComparing this with the distance fallen in the first second (4.9 meters), we see that the distance fallen during the next second is not exactly one of the options provided directly. However, if we consider the pattern of distances fallen in each subsequent second due to increasing velocity, the distance fallen in the next second would be more than the distance fallen in the first second but less than three times as much.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. h (4.9 meters)\nB. 2h (9.8 meters)\nC. 3h (14.7 meters)\nD. 4h (19.6 meters)\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3h, which matches our calculated value of 14.7 meters for the distance fallen during the next second."
