The international recognition of human rights after WWII.\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the international recognition of human rights following World War II. This period saw the establishment of the United Nations and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasized the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as a foundation for freedom, justice, and peace in the world. These developments aligned with the principles of natural law, which posits that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be universally recognized."
