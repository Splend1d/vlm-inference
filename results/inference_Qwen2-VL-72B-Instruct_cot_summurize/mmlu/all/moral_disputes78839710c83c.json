Marquis's argument against abortion centers on the idea that killing a fetus is morally equivalent to killing a person because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The fetus can feel pain.\n- While this might be a consideration in some ethical discussions about abortion, Marquis's primary focus is not on the capacity for pain but rather on the potential future of the fetus.\n\nB. Abortion will harm the woman.\n- This is more related to the physical or psychological effects on the mother, which is not the central argument made by Marquis.\n\nC. Killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future.\n- This aligns directly with Marquis's main argument. He contends that the moral wrongness of abortion lies in the fact that it deprives the fetus of its potential future life, which he considers to have intrinsic value.\n\nD. All of the above.\n- Since Marquis's primary argument is focused on the deprivation of a valuable future, this option is less precise than option C.\n\nBased on Marquis's argument, the main reason he believes it is wrong to kill a fetus is:\n\nC. Killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future."
