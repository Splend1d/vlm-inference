The net charge on the circuit elements (battery and light bulb) remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Connection**: When the circuit is connected, the battery provides a potential difference that drives electrons from the negative terminal to the positive terminal through the wire and the light bulb.\n\n3. **Flow of Charge**: Electrons flow from the negative terminal of the battery, through the wire, through the light bulb, and back to the positive terminal of the battery. This flow of electrons constitutes an electric current.\n\n4. **Charge Balance**: In a closed circuit, the total amount of charge entering the system must equal the total amount of charge leaving the system. This is because charge is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.\n\n5. **Net Charge**: Since the same number of electrons that leave one part of the circuit enter another part, the net charge in the entire circuit remains constant. The movement of electrons does not change the overall net charge of the circuit elements.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The net charge has not changed."
