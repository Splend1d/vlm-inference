If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\nA. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\nB. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\nC. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\nD. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation of the bias found in the document, let's analyze the content and context provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Document**: The passage describes Louis XIV's expectations and behaviors towards his courtiers, emphasizing his strict surveillance and the importance of his favor. It highlights how Louis XIV used his influence to control the nobility financially and socially.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: This suggests that the duke is sympathetic to King Louis. However, the tone of the passage seems more critical than sympathetic, indicating that the duke might not be entirely supportive of Louis XIV's methods.\n   - **Option B**: This option states that the duke is biased against the king due to his suppression of the nobility. The passage does criticize Louis XIV\u2019s methods of controlling the nobility, which aligns with this interpretation.\n   - **Option C**: This option suggests that the duke supported the extension of central state control. While the passage does describe how Louis XIV controlled the nobility, it doesn\u2019t explicitly indicate the duke\u2019s support for broader state control.\n   - **Option D**: This option implies that the duke supported King Louis\u2019s actions aimed at preserving the aristocracy\u2019s social status while removing their power. The passage does mention that Louis XIV made the nobility dependent on his favor, which could be seen as a form of preserving their social status while reducing their actual power.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The best explanation of the bias found in the document is that the duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility. This is evident from the critical tone and the detailed description of how Louis XIV controlled and manipulated the nobility.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**B. The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.**"
