Let's use substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\\[ y = 19 - x \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y \\) in equation 2:\n\\[ x(19 - x) = 70 \\]\n\\[ 19x - x^2 = 70 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - 19x + 70 = 0 \\]\n\nNow we need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\\[ (x - 7)(x - 10) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the solutions for \\( x \\) are:\n\\[ x = 7 \\] or \\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nIf \\( x = 7 \\), then \\( y = 19 - 7 = 12 \\).\nIf \\( x = 10 \\), then \\( y = 19 - 10 = 9 \\).\n\nHowever, neither of these pairs (7, 12) or (10, 9) matches the given options exactly.
