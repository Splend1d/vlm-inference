Visual imagery\n\nThe method of loci, also known as the \"loci method\" or \"method of places,\" is a mnemonic technique that uses visualization to help remember information. It involves associating items you want to remember with specific locations in a familiar place, such as your home or a route you frequently take. By mentally walking through this place and visualizing each item at its corresponding location, you can more easily recall the items later. This technique relies heavily on visual imagery to enhance memory retention."
