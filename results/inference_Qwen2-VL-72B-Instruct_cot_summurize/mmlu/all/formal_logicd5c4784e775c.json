(\u2200x)[Bx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Lxy)]\nThis states that for all x, if x is a bird, then there exists some y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. This correctly captures the meaning of the original statement: every bird lives in at least one nest.\n\nC. (\u2200x)[(\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Lxy]\nThis states that for all x, if there exists some y that is both a nest and a bird, then x lives in y. This is incorrect because it mixes the properties of being a bird and a nest in an invalid way.\n\nD. (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Bx \u2022 Ny) \u2283 Lxy]\nThis states that for all x and for some y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y.
