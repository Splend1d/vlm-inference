The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA\n"

The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\n\nWhen deciding whether to include additional predictor variables in a regression model, the primary concern should be how much that variable improves the predictive power of the model. In this context, the school psychologist should focus on whether adding the school interest inventory scores increases the overall explanatory power of the regression model for predicting first-year high school GPAs. This is typically assessed by examining the change in the multiple correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) or the adjusted R\u00b2 when the new variable is added. If the inclusion of the school interest inventory significantly raises the multiple correlation, it suggests that the inventory provides unique information that enhances the prediction of GPA beyond what is already explained by the achievement and aptitude scores."
