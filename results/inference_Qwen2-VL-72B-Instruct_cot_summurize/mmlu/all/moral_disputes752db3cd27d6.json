This aligns with his argument that while sudden border openings might cause harm, there are ways to manage immigration that minimize such harm.\n\nB. **liberal egalitarianism is false, and so this possibility is irrelevant.**\n   - This option implies that Carens dismisses liberal egalitarianism as a valid framework. However, since Carens is discussing issues from a liberal egalitarian perspective, this option contradicts his approach.\n\nC. **sometimes you have to do more harm than good in the short term to do more good in the long term.**\n   - This statement suggests a trade-off between short-term and long-term outcomes. While Carens acknowledges potential harms, he does not explicitly argue that doing more harm in the short term is necessary for greater long-term benefits.\n\nD. **all of the above**\n   - Given that only option A aligns with Carens' argument, D cannot be correct because B and C do not fit his perspective.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. in practice, feasible policy options will not entail major costs to current citizens.**"
