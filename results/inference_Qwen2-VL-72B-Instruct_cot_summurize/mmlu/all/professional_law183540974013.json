Under the proposal, the postal service would be established as a separate state agency under the direction of a postmaster general. The postal service would be responsible for the overnight or express delivery of official governmental mailings within the state. The bill further provides that all state government employees may utilize the overnight postal service at no charge for sending mailings to persons or corporations within the state. Assume that no other state has established such a postal service to date. Moreover, assume there is uncontradicted evidence that the establishment of such an independent state postal service will diminish the revenues of the U. S. Postal Service. Which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation?\n\nA. Under the Tenth Amendment, a state has exclusive authority to regulate transactions that are wholly intrastate.\nB. Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.\nC. State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.\nD. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n"

However, this does not directly address the potential conflict with the U.S. Postal Service's operations.\n\nB. **Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.**\n   - This argument implies that the state's action does not conflict with federal law and thus is valid. However, it does not provide a strong basis for why the state should establish its own postal service.\n\nC. **State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.**\n   - This argument focuses on the financial aspect but does not address the broader justification for establishing a state postal service.\n\nD. **There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.**\n   - This argument highlights a practical and compelling reason for the state to establish its own postal service: to ensure timely delivery of important governmental mailings. It addresses the core purpose of the proposed legislation and provides a clear rationale for why the state should take this action.\n\nGiven these considerations, the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation is:\n\n**D. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.**\n\nThis argument directly addresses the practical benefits and necessity of the state postal service, making it the most compelling reason for its establishment."
