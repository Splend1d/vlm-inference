The contract contained a provision wherein the restaurant promised to purchase \"a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. \" On a separate sheet, there was a note stating that any modifications must be in writing. The parties signed each sheet. Both sides performed fully under the contract for the first four months. On May 1, the president of the bakery telephoned the manager of the restaurant and told him that, because of an increase in the cost of wheat, the bakery would be forced to raise its prices to $1. 20 per loaf. The manager said he understood and agreed to the price increase. The bakery then shipped 100 loaves (the amount ordered by the restaurant) to the restaurant, along with a bill for $120. The restaurant sent the bakery a check for$100 and refused to pay any more. Is the restaurant obligated to pay the additional $20?\n\nA. Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it was not supported by new consideration.\nB. Yes, because the bakery detrimentally relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.\nC. No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.\nD. No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n"

No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.\n\nExplanation:\nThe original contract between the restaurant and the bakery included a clause stipulating that any modifications must be in writing. This clause is significant because it invokes the parol evidence rule and potentially the Statute of Frauds, which require certain agreements to be in writing to be enforceable. Since the modification to the price was made orally over the phone and not in writing, it does not meet the requirement set forth in the original contract. Therefore, the restaurant is not legally obligated to pay the additional $20 based on the oral agreement."
