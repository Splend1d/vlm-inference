A cashier at a restaurant receiving the same $8 an hour that other cashiers receive.\n\nTransfer earnings refer to the minimum amount of compensation required to keep a worker in their current job, essentially the opportunity cost of their labor. In this context, the cashier's wage represents the transfer earning because it is the amount they would need to earn to stay in their current position rather than seek employment elsewhere. The other options represent different types of income or payments, not transfer earnings."
