The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855\nWhich of the following actions of Napoleon does the author seem to be ignoring the hypocrisy of in his examination of the high mindedness and praiseworthiness of Napoleon?\n\nA. The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there\nB. The creation of the Napoleonic Code\nC. Promoting soldiers and government workers based upon their merits only\nD. His conquest of Europe and use of the Continental System\n"
