The con-sumer claimed that a flaw in the manufacturer's product had resulted in severe injuries to the consumer. In its answer,the manufacturer asserted a third-party complaint againstthe product designer, also incorporated and with its principal place of business in State B. Believing that the consumer had sued the wrong defendant, the manufacturer claimed boththat the designer was solely responsible for the flaw that had led to the consumer's injuries and that the manufacturer was not at fault. 7.After being fired, a woman sued her former employer in federal court, alleging that her supervisor had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex. The woman's complaint included a lengthy description of what the supervisor had said and done over the years, quoting his telephone calls and emails to her and her own emails to the supervisor's manager asking for help. The designer is aware that the manufacturer did not follow all of the designer's specifications when making the product. Which of the following arguments is most likely to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint?\n\nA. The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, because both the manufacturer and the designer are citizens of State B.\nB. The manufacturer failed to obtain the court's leave to file the third-party complaint.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which argument is most likely to achieve the designer's goal of dismissal of the third-party complaint, we need to analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **The court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint, because both the manufacturer and the designer are citizens of State B.**\n   - Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's authority to hear cases involving certain types of claims or disputes. In this case, the original lawsuit involves a products liability action, which falls under the court's jurisdiction. The third-party complaint is part of the same lawsuit and thus would also fall within the court's jurisdiction. This argument is unlikely to succeed.\n\nB. **The manufacturer failed to obtain the court's leave to file the third-party complaint.**\n   - Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a) allows a defendant to assert a third-party complaint against another party who may be liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claim. However, the rule requires the defendant to obtain the court's permission if the third-party complaint is filed more than 21 days after the defendant's answer. If the manufacturer did not seek the court's leave, this could be grounds for dismissal of the third-party complaint. This argument has potential merit but depends on specific procedural details.\n\nC. **The manufacturer's failure to follow the designer's specifications caused the flaw that resulted in the consumer's injuries.**\n   - This argument addresses the merits of the case rather than procedural issues. It suggests that the manufacturer, not the designer, is responsible for the flaw due to non-compliance with specifications. While it might be relevant to the ultimate outcome of the case, it does not directly address the procedural issue of whether the third-party complaint should be dismissed.\n\nD. **The manufacturer's third-party complaint failed to state a proper third-party claim.**\n   - This argument focuses on the sufficiency of the pleadings. If the third-party complaint fails to meet the requirements of Rule 14(a), such as failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it could be dismissed. This is a strong procedural argument that could lead to dismissal if the third-party complaint is indeed deficient.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most compelling argument for the designer to achieve the goal of dismissing the third-party complaint is:\n\n**D. The manufacturer's third-party complaint failed to state a proper third-party claim.**\n\nThis argument directly addresses the procedural requirement that the third-party complaint must state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and if it fails to do so, it can be dismissed."
