                    "text": "To determine which statement is true based on Dr. Ramchandran's research and the newswriter's report, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.**\n   - This option suggests that having at least 100 patients in the study justifies the writer's statement. However, the number of patients alone does not necessarily justify the conclusion; it also depends on how the data was analyzed and whether the results are statistically significant.\n\nB. **If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.**\n   - Similar to option A, this option focuses on the number of patients but does not address the statistical significance or the methodological rigor of the study. A larger sample size might increase confidence in the results, but it doesn't automatically justify the conclusion.\n\nC. **At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.**\n   - This option specifies that at least 100 patients should have brushed their teeth after lunch. While having a sufficient number of participants in both groups (those who brushed and those who did not) can help ensure the validity of the comparison, it still doesn't guarantee that the conclusion is justified without considering other factors like statistical analysis and potential confounding variables.\n\nD. **No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.**\n   - This option asserts that the writer's statement cannot be justified regardless of the number of participants. This is a strong claim and implies that there are fundamental issues with the study design or methodology that cannot be overcome by increasing the sample size.\n\nGiven the information provided, none of the options explicitly state that the writer's statement is justified solely based on the number of participants. The justification would depend on additional factors such as the study design, statistical analysis, and control for confounding variables. Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the given context is:\n\n**D. No matter how many participants, the writer's statement is not justified.**\n\nThis option reflects the idea that simply having a certain number of participants does not inherently justify the conclusion drawn by the newswriter."
