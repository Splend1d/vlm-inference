The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\nB. Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.\nC. The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column.\nD. Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water.\n"
