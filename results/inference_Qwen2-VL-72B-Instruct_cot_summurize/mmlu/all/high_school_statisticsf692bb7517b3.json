Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true? (Assume conditions for inference are met.) I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.\n\nA. I and II only\nB. I and III only\nC.
