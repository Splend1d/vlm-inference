This antibiotic is commonly used to treat atypical pneumonia, which is often caused by organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila. These organisms can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's presentation, including a low-grade fever, nonproductive cough, and patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray. Amoxicillin, cefaclor, and ciprofloxacin are also antibiotics that may be used to treat respiratory infections, but they are typically not first-line treatments for atypical pneumonia."
