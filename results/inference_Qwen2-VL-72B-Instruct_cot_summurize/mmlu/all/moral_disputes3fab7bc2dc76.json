Singer is known for his utilitarian approach, particularly his emphasis on reducing suffering and promoting well-being.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The principle of maximizing happiness**: While this is a utilitarian principle, it doesn't specifically address the central concern of Singer's argument regarding animal rights, which is more focused on minimizing suffering rather than just maximizing happiness.\n\nB. **The principal principle**: This term does not seem to be directly related to Singer's arguments or any established ethical principle in philosophy.\n\nC. **The principle of double effect**: This principle deals with situations where an action has both good and bad effects, and it is not central to Singer's argument about animal equality.\n\nD. **The principle of minimizing suffering**: This aligns closely with Singer's utilitarian ethics, especially as he argues that all beings capable of suffering should have their interests considered equally. His argument for animal equality hinges on the idea that suffering is what matters morally, and that all beings capable of suffering deserve moral consideration.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion argued for in \"All Animals Are Equal\" flows from:\n\n**D. The principle of minimizing suffering**"
