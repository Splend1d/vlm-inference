Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.\n\nGender is indeed applicable to the field of Security Studies as it influences how security policies and practices are developed and implemented. By examining social constructions of masculinity and femininity, scholars can explore how these roles shape perceptions of security threats, responses to those threats, and the distribution of power within security institutions. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of security that takes into account the experiences and perspectives of all individuals, regardless of gender."
