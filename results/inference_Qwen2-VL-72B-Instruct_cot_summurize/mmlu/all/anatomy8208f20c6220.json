The pupillary light reflex is a consensual reflex.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Option A**: This statement is incorrect because the efferent limb (motor pathway) of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), not the optic nerve.\n  \n- **Option B**: This statement is incorrect because the pupillary light reflex is mediated by the pretectal area and Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the midbrain, not the inferior colliculi.\n  \n- **Option C**: This statement is correct. The pupillary light reflex is indeed a consensual reflex, meaning that when light shines into one eye, both pupils constrict (the direct response in the illuminated eye and the consensual response in the non-illuminated eye).\n  \n- **Option D**: This statement is incorrect because the afferent limb (sensory pathway) of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), not the oculomotor nerve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
