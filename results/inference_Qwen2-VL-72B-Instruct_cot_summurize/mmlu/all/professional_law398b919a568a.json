The drug dealer was always late, so the victim continued to wait outside in the freezing cold weather because he needed a quick fix. Suddenly a car rounded the street corner and a shot rang out. The victim slumped over and fell to the sidewalk. Immediately after being shot and before he died, the victim exclaimed, \"The defendant did it!\" The defendant was indicted and is now on trial for the victim's murder. Based on these facts alone, the admissibility of the victim's statement should be determined by\n\nA. the jury, after a preliminary determination by the judge.\nB. the jury, without a preliminary determination by the judge.\nC. the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines that the victim knew he was dying.\nD. the judge, without assistance from the jury.\n"

A dying declaration is an exception to the hearsay rule and can be admitted into evidence if the declarant believed they were about to die at the time of making the statement. The judge would instruct the jury that they may consider the dying declaration as evidence if they find that the victim knew they were dying when they made the statement. This instruction helps the jury understand the context and relevance of the statement in determining its credibility and weight in the case."
