International society consists of a constellation of sovereign States and other international organizations, which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority.\n\nThis option best describes the structure of the international society. It acknowledges the presence of sovereign states and international organizations as key actors within the international system, and it highlights the horizontal nature of their relationships, where no single entity holds supreme authority over others. This horizontal order reflects the principle of state sovereignty and the absence of a central authority above individual states in the international system."
