After his meal, the defendant picked up a similar black leather jacket, believing it to be his own. The jacket he took, however, belonged to another customer. The defendant left the deli and walked a short distance before realizing he had taken the wrong jacket by mistake. He then returned to the deli and placed the jacket back on the coat rack. He found his own jacket, which had been partially hidden under a stack of other coats. If the defendant were arrested and charged with larceny of the other customer's jacket, he will most likely be acquitted because\n\nA. there was a mistake of fact.\nB. he returned the jacket after discovering his mistake.\nC. he lacked the requisite state of mind.\nD. there was no fraudulent conversion.\n"

For a charge of larceny, the prosecution must prove that the defendant intentionally took someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this scenario, the defendant mistakenly believed the jacket he took was his own, indicating a lack of intent to steal. Upon realizing his mistake, he promptly returned the jacket, further demonstrating that he did not have the requisite state of mind to commit larceny."
