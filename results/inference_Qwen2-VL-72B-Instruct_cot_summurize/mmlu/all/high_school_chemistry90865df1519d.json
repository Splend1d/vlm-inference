                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. The O\u2013H bonds in sulfuric acid are much weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atoms on sulfuric acid.\n\nExplanation:\n- Sulfuric acid (H\u2082SO\u2084) and sulfurous acid (H\u2082SO\u2083) differ in their acidity primarily due to the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the sulfur atom.\n- In sulfuric acid, the presence of additional oxygen atoms around the sulfur atom creates a stronger electron-withdrawing effect. This effect destabilizes the O-H bond, making it easier for the hydrogen ion (H\u207a) to dissociate from the molecule, thus increasing the acid's strength.\n- The other options do not accurately describe the primary reason for the difference in acidity between these two acids:\n  - B. While sulfuric acid does have more oxygen atoms, it is the electron-withdrawing effect of these atoms that matters more than just their quantity.\n  - C. The electronegativity of sulfur itself does not change significantly between the two compounds; it is the overall molecular structure and the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atoms that matter.\n  - D. In both acids, the hydrogen atoms are bound to oxygen atoms, not directly to the sulfur atom.\n\nTherefore, the key factor is the electron-withdrawing effect of the additional oxygen atoms in sulfuric acid, which weakens the O-H bond and enhances its acidity compared to sulfurous acid."
