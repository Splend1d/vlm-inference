It is one of the most resource-rich countries in the world and has significant domestic production capabilities.\n\n2. **Japan (B)**: Japan is known for its limited natural resources. It heavily relies on imports for raw materials and energy sources like oil, gas, and minerals. This makes it highly dependent on international trade for its industrial needs.\n\n3. **France (C)**: France has some natural resources, including uranium, coal, and agricultural land. However, it still depends on imports for many key resources, particularly oil and gas.\n\n4. **United Kingdom (D)**: The UK has historically been rich in coal and has significant offshore oil and gas reserves. However, these resources have been declining, and the UK now relies more on imports for certain resources.\n\nGiven this analysis, **Japan** stands out as the country that is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry due to its heavy reliance on imports for nearly all critical resources.\n\nFinal answer: B. Japan"
