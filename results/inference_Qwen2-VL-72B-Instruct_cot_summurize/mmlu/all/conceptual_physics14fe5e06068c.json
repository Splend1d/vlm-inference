The original kinetic energy (\\( KE_0 \\)) is then:\n\n\\[ KE_0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\]\n\nIf the speed increases to three times its original speed, the new speed \\( v \\) becomes \\( 3v_0 \\). The new kinetic energy (\\( KE \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}m(3v_0)^2 \\]\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}m \\cdot 9v_0^2 \\]\n\\[ KE = 9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\]\n\\[ KE = 9 \\cdot KE_0 \\]\n\nThus, the kinetic energy becomes nine times greater than the original kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of these"
