CO2 is a greenhouse gas that traps heat and contributes significantly to global warming. This is widely recognized as a major factor in rising global temperatures.\n\nC. **Dust Clouds from Volcanoes**: Volcanic eruptions can release dust and aerosols into the atmosphere, which can reflect sunlight back into space, potentially cooling the Earth temporarily. However, this effect is usually short-lived and does not contribute to long-term warming.\n\nD. **Depletion of Earth's Ozone Layer**: The depletion of the ozone layer allows more ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth's surface, which can have various environmental impacts. However, it is not directly linked to a rise in average atmospheric temperatures like greenhouse gases are.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option most likely to cause a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere in the future is:\n\n**B. CO2 from fossil fuels**"
