In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\nB. prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\nC. not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\nD. not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the second friend can assert a cause of action against the third friend, we need to analyze the legal principles involved, particularly regarding the duty of care and the concept of foreseeability.\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: Generally, individuals have a duty to act reasonably and avoid causing harm to others. This duty can be breached if someone fails to act when they have a reasonable opportunity to prevent harm.\n\n2. **Foreseeability**: For the third friend to be held liable, it must be reasonably foreseeable that their failure to act would result in harm to the second friend.\n\n3. **Omission to Act**: The third friend's failure to warn the second friend is an omission rather than an active act. Liability for omissions typically requires a special relationship or duty between the parties.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A: Prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.**\n  - Awareness of danger alone does not establish liability. There must also be a duty to act and a breach of that duty.\n\n- **Option B: Prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.**\n  - Omission to act generally requires a specific duty to act. Without such a duty, mere awareness and failure to act may not be sufficient grounds for liability.\n\n- **Option C: Not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.**\n  - While the first friend's actions directly caused the injury, this does not necessarily absolve the third friend from potential liability if they had a duty to warn.\n\n- **Option D: Not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.**\n  - This option correctly identifies that the third friend's liability hinges on whether there was a duty to warn. In most jurisdictions, absent a special relationship or duty, one person is not legally obligated to warn another of potential harm.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. Not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the general principle that, without a special relationship or duty, one individual is not legally required to warn another of potential harm."
