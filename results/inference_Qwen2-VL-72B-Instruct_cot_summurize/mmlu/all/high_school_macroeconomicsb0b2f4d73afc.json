Increases aggregate demand which increases real GDP and increases employment.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy typically involves actions by a central bank to increase the money supply, lower interest rates, and make borrowing cheaper. This encourages spending and investment, thereby increasing aggregate demand. As a result, real GDP tends to grow, and employment levels may rise as businesses expand production to meet the increased demand."
