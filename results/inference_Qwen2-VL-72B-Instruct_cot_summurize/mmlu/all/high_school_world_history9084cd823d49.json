It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies?\n\nA. The absence of religious orthodoxy\nB. Hostility toward outsiders\nC. Limited economic opportunities\nD. The supremacy of piety\n"

                    "text": "Let's analyze the passage step by step to determine which option best reflects the views expressed:\n\n1. **Absence of Religious Orthodoxy (Option A)**:\n   - The passage mentions that the inhabitants are \"pious\" and \"pay in full the tithes due to God,\" indicating a strong adherence to religious practices. This does not suggest an absence of religious orthodoxy.\n\n2. **Hostility Toward Outsiders (Option B)**:\n   - The text states that the inhabitants \"treat strangers well\" and \"give liberally to devotees.\" This suggests a welcoming attitude towards outsiders rather than hostility.\n\n3. **Limited Economic Opportunities (Option C)**:\n   - The passage describes the inhabitants as being either merchants, porters, or fishermen, and notes that some merchants are \"immensely rich.\" This indicates a variety of economic activities and opportunities, not limited ones.\n\n4. **The Supremacy of Piety (Option D)**:\n   - The passage emphasizes the piety of the inhabitants multiple times: they are described as \"pious,\" \"humble,\" \"upright,\" and \"generous in character.\" They also \"pay in full the tithes due to God.\" These details highlight the importance of piety in their society.\n\nGiven the analysis, the views expressed in the passage are best seen as evidence of the supremacy of piety within medieval Islamic societies.\n\n**Final Answer: D. The supremacy of piety**"
