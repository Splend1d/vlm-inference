In his moral philosophy, Kant argues that the highest good is a good will, which acts out of duty and according to moral laws, rather than from inclinations or desires for happiness or pleasure. Reason, in this context, serves to guide us towards making decisions based on moral principles and duties, leading to actions that reflect a good will."
