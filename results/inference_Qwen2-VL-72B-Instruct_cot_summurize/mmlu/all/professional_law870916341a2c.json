The security guard, having already graduated from a program in his former state, wishes to work again as a private security guard. He began to advertise his services but was informed by the state that he must cease and desist from working as a private security guard until he complied with state law and graduated from an in-state program. The security guard challenges the constitutionality of the licensing statute on grounds that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the state does not have a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation.\nB. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process.\nC.

The state has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process.\n\nIn cases involving economic regulations, such as occupational licensing laws, courts typically apply rational basis review. Under this standard, the state must demonstrate that its regulation is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. In this context, the state would need to show that requiring in-state training for private security guards serves a legitimate public interest, such as ensuring the competence and reliability of security personnel, without violating the security guard's constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
