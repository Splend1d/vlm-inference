During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal\u2265500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Cryptosporidium parvum\nB. Cytomegalovirus\nC. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex\nD. Salmonella enteritidis\n"

Cryptosporidium parvum\n\nCryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of prolonged diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with AIDS. The patient's history of travel to Asia, where Cryptosporidium is more prevalent, and her symptoms of progressive diarrhea and weight loss over the past month are consistent with cryptosporidiosis. Additionally, her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 400/mm3 indicates that her immune system is compromised, making her more susceptible to opportunistic infections like Cryptosporidium.\n\nWhile the other options listed can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's specific presentation and risk factors."
