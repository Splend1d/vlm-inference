Only two major parties can successfully be supported.\n\nSingle-member district electoral systems, such as the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system used in many countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, tend to favor two major parties. This is because smaller parties often struggle to win seats due to the requirement for a candidate to secure a plurality or majority of votes within each district. As a result, voters may feel compelled to support one of the two major parties to avoid \"wasting\" their vote on a third party that has little chance of winning. This dynamic can lead to a two-party system where third parties have difficulty gaining significant representation."
