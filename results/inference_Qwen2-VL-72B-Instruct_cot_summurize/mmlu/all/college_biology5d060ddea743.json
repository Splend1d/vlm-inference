A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of different B lymphocytes.\n\nThis option accurately describes the fundamental difference between monoclonal and polyclonal antisera. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by a single clone of cells, resulting in a highly specific antibody that targets a single epitope on an antigen. Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are produced by multiple clones of cells, leading to a mixture of antibodies that can recognize multiple epitopes on an antigen."
