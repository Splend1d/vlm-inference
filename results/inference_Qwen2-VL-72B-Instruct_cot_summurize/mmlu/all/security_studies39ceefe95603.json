Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\nB. Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.\nC. Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.\nD. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.\n"

While deepening the concept of security, it has both critical and practical dimensions, although the utility of the concept is contested.\n\nEnvironmental security is a complex and multifaceted issue that encompasses various aspects of the relationship between the environment and human security. It involves considering the security of the global environment and its nested sub-systems, as well as the social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation-state (Option A). It also challenges traditional security policies by questioning who and what should be protected and from what threats, and explores the connections between environmental, security, and development issues (Option B). Furthermore, environmental security examines how environmental change can lead to violent conflicts within and between countries and how it can undermine national security (Option C).\n\nThe concept of environmental security is not without controversy, as its utility and interpretation may vary depending on the context and perspective. However, it remains an important area of study and policy-making, as it highlights the interdependence between environmental health and human security."
