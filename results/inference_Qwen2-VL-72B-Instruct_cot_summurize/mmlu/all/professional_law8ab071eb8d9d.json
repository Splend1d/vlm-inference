A out- of-state farmer who is a U. S. citizen has contracted, subsequent to the aforementioned law, to purchase a farm from a landowner, which is located in the state. The landowner, who is a resident of the state, has been informed by his attorney that his sales agreement with the farmer is null and void under state law. Which of the following is the best constitutional argument to contest the validity of the state statute?\n\nA. The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\nB. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2.\nD. The national property power provision under Article IV, Section 3.\n"

The privileges and immunities clause under Article IV, Section 2.\n\nThis clause states that \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\" This means that citizens of one state cannot be discriminated against by another state when it comes to basic rights and privileges, such as owning property. Therefore, the state's law that restricts ownership of agricultural land to only residents of the state who are U.S. citizens could be seen as violating this clause by discriminating against non-resident U.S. citizens."
