Instead, the PDF can take any non-negative value, but the integral of the PDF over the entire range of \\( x \\) must equal 1. This means:\n\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\, dx = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the statement \"0 \u2264 p(x) \u2264 1 for all x\" is incorrect because the PDF can exceed 1 at certain points as long as the total area under the curve equals 1.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain.\"\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. Decision trees are typically learned by maximizing information gain rather than minimizing it. Information gain measures how well a given attribute separates the training examples according to their target classification. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the decision node at each step in the tree-building process.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
