It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The passage provided is an excerpt from \"Germania\" by Publius Cornelius Tacitus, written around 98 C.E. The text describes how the Bructeri were driven out and exterminated by the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes, with Tacitus expressing a desire for continued discord among these tribes to benefit the Roman Empire.\n\nTo determine which conclusion is most directly supported by the passage, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.**\n   - This option aligns closely with the passage. Tacitus expresses satisfaction that the Bructeri were exterminated by other tribes and hopes for continued discord among them. This suggests that the empire benefits from such conflicts, reducing potential threats.\n\nB. **Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.**\n   - There is no mention in the passage of welcoming migrations or using barbarian peoples for military or economic purposes. The focus is on the destruction and discord among the tribes.\n\nC. **Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.**\n   - The passage does not discuss the use of military force by the empire against barbarian peoples. Instead, it highlights the conflict between different tribes without direct Roman intervention.\n\nD. **Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.**\n   - There is no reference to religious conversion or attempts to make barbarian peoples friendly through religion in the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion most directly supported by the passage is:\n\n**A. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.**\n\nFinal answer: A."
