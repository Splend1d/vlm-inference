In this case, the argument provides several pieces of evidence about the history of genetics and when key discoveries were made. The conclusion should summarize or encapsulate the main point that these premises support.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n   - This statement is part of the evidence provided in the argument but does not serve as a summary or main point.\n\nB. \"The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n   - This statement is also part of the evidence but does not encompass the overall message about the youthfulness of genetics as a science.\n\nC. \"From a historical point of view, genetics is a young science.\"\n   - This statement summarizes the entire argument by stating that genetics is a young science, which is supported by the evidence given about the timing of key discoveries.\n\nD. \"The principles that govern inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago.\"\n   - This statement is another piece of evidence within the argument but does not serve as the main point.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion of the argument is:\n\nC.
