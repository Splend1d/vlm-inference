UV radiation primarily causes thymine dimers, which are covalent bonds between adjacent thymine bases on the same strand of DNA. These lesions distort the DNA helix and interfere with normal DNA replication and transcription. Individuals with XP have defects in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which normally removes thymine dimers and other bulky DNA adducts. Therefore, thymine dimers are the type of molecular lesion that is most likely to accumulate in individuals with XP."
