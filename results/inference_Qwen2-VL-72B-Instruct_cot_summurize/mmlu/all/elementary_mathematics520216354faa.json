Therefore, we subtract 5 from the position of point A:\n   \\[\n   -20 - 5 = -25\n   \\]\n   So, point B is located at -25.\n\n3. **Determine the relative position of point B with respect to point A**:\n   - Since point B is at -25 and point A is at -20, point B is to the left of point A on the number line.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\"\n   - This is incorrect because point B is actually to the left of point A.\n\nB. \"It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.\"\n   - This is incorrect because point B is not located at -15; it is at -25.\n\nC. \"It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\"\n   - This is correct because point B is indeed located at -25 and is to the left of point A.\n\nD. \"It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\"\n   - This is incorrect because point B is not located at -15; it is at -25.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about point B is:\n\nC.
