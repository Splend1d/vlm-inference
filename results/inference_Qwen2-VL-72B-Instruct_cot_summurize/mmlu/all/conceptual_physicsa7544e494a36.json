                    "text": "To determine what happens when a diver points a flashlight upward toward the surface of the water at an angle 20\u00b0 from the normal, we need to consider the principles of refraction and total internal reflection.\n\n1. **Refraction**: When light travels from one medium to another (e.g., from water to air), it changes direction due to the difference in the speed of light in those media. This change in direction is described by Snell's Law:\n   \\[\n   n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n   \\]\n   where \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the indices of refraction of the two media, and \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n2. **Total Internal Reflection**: Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction to one with a lower index of refraction (like from water to air) and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle. The critical angle (\\( \\theta_c \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}\n   \\]\n\nFor water-air interface:\n- Index of refraction of water (\\( n_1 \\)) \u2248 1.33\n- Index of refraction of air (\\( n_2 \\)) \u2248 1.00\n\nThe critical angle for water-air is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{1.00}{1.33} \\approx 0.752\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta_c \\approx \\arcsin(0.752) \\approx 48.6^\\circ\n\\]\n\nGiven that the angle of incidence is 20\u00b0, which is less than the critical angle of approximately 48.6\u00b0, the light will not undergo total internal reflection. Instead, it will refract and pass into the air above.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. passes into the air above"
