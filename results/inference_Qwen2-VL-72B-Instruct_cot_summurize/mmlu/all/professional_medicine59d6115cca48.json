Increased hydrostatic pressure\n\nWhen the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, it leads to an increase in the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus. This results in an increased hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries because the blood flow into the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole remains unchanged while the outflow is restricted. The increased hydrostatic pressure enhances the force driving fluid filtration across the glomerular membrane, potentially increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increased hydrostatic pressure"
