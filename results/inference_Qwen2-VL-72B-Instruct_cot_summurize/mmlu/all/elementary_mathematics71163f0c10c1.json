This means if an object weighs \\( e \\) pounds on Earth, it would weigh \\( \\frac{e}{6} \\) pounds on the moon.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( m = \\frac{1}{6} + e \\)\n   - This equation suggests adding \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) to the Earth weight \\( e \\), which does not represent the relationship described.\n\nB. \\( m = \\frac{e}{6} \\)\n   - This equation correctly represents the relationship where the weight on the moon \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the weight on Earth \\( e \\).\n\nC. \\( m = 6 + e \\)\n   - This equation suggests adding 6 to the Earth weight \\( e \\), which does not represent the relationship described.\n\nD. \\( m = 6e \\)\n   - This equation suggests multiplying the Earth weight \\( e \\) by 6, which also does not represent the relationship described.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation that represents the approximate weight of an object on the moon in terms of the object's weight on Earth is:\n\nB. \\( m = \\frac{e}{6} \\)"
