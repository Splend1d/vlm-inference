A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?\n\nA. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa\nB. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa\nC. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\nD. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa\n"

A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\n\nThe passage by Kwame Nkrumah, a prominent Ghanaian leader, advocates for the creation of a political union among African states. This union, according to Nkrumah, would enhance the continent's ability to project its identity and command respect on the global stage. He emphasizes the need for unity to counteract the \"callous disregard\" of African independence by the Great Powers, highlighting instances such as the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the United Nations' handling of the situation in the Congo. Therefore, the passage is best described as a proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world through political unification."
