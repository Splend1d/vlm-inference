On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?\n\nA. Intramural (pre-prostatic)\nB. Membranous\nC. Prostatic\nD. Spongy\n"

Membranous\n\nIn the scenario described, the patient has sustained a pelvic fracture and is experiencing symptoms suggestive of urethral injury, such as bruising of the perineum, pain with pelvic motion, and blood at the urethral meatus. The membranous portion of the urethra is most commonly injured in association with pelvic fractures because it is relatively fixed in place by its attachments to the pelvic bones and the urogenital diaphragm. This fixation makes it susceptible to shearing forces during pelvic trauma, leading to potential disruption or tearing of the urethra at this site."
