The frequencies of the harmonics for a pipe closed at one end follow the pattern:\n\n\\[ f_n = n \\cdot f_1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an odd integer (1, 3, 5, ...).\n\nSo, the frequency of the third harmonic \\( f_3 \\) would be:\n\n\\[ f_3 = 3 \\cdot f_1 \\]\n\nGiven that the fundamental frequency \\( f_1 \\) is 131 Hz, we can calculate the frequency of the third harmonic as follows:\n\n\\[ f_3 = 3 \\cdot 131 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\\[ f_3 = 393 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 393 Hz"
