To find the one cycle surge current rating, we need to understand that the surge current is inversely proportional to the square root of time when considering the thermal effects on the device.\n\nGiven:\n- Half cycle surge current rating = 3000 A\n- Frequency = 50 Hz\n\nOne cycle is twice as long as half a cycle, so the time for one cycle is double the time for half a cycle. The relationship between the surge current and time can be expressed using the formula:\n\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = I_{\\text{half cycle}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{T_{\\text{half cycle}}}{T_{\\text{one cycle}}}} \\]\n\nSince \\( T_{\\text{one cycle}} = 2 \\times T_{\\text{half cycle}} \\), we have:\n\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = I_{\\text{half cycle}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = 3000 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = 3000 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = 3000 \\times \\frac{1}{1.414} \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = 3000 \\times 0.707 \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{one cycle}} = 2121.32 \\, \\text{A} \\]\n\nTherefore, the one cycle surge current rating is approximately 2121.32 A."
