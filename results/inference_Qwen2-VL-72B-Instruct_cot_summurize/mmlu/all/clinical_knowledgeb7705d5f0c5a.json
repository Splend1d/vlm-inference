Intravenous (IV) administration typically results in the quickest onset of action because the drug is delivered directly into the bloodstream.\n\nB. **IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.**\n   - This statement is false. IV administration actually carries a higher risk of bacteraemia compared to other routes, as it involves direct access to the bloodstream which can introduce bacteria if proper sterile technique is not followed.\n\nC. **IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.**\n   - This statement is true. IV administration allows for precise control over the dosage and timing of drug delivery, making it easier to titrate the dose to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\n\nD. **An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.**\n   - This statement is false. It is common practice to use the same IV cannula for administering both drugs and fluids, although there may be specific circumstances where separate lines are preferred or required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.**"
