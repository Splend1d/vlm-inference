This is because businesses are economic entities that aim to generate revenue through the sale of goods or services, which exceeds their costs and expenses. Profitability is essential for the sustainability and growth of a business, allowing it to reinvest in operations, expand, and provide returns to its owners or shareholders. While other objectives such as procuring resources, communicating with shareholders, and mediating between the organization and the environment are important aspects of running a business, they are generally means to the end goal of profitability."
