Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nStratification in auditing refers to dividing the population into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics, such as size of transactions, and then sampling from each stratum separately. This approach is often used when the auditor wants to ensure that larger, more significant items receive greater scrutiny because they have a higher potential impact on the financial statements. Therefore, if the auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts, stratifying the population would be an appropriate strategy."
