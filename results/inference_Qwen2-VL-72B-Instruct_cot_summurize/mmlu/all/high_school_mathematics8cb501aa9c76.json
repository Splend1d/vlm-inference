The sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of all the previous terms.\n\nLet's denote the terms of the sequence as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\), where \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a_1 = 1\\)\n- \\(a_2 = a_1 = 1\\) (since it's the sum of all previous terms, which is just \\(a_1\\))\n- \\(a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\)\n- \\(a_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\\)\n\nWe can see that each term is actually doubling from the previous term, which means the sequence is actually a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2 starting from 1.\n\nSo, the \\(n\\)th term of the sequence can be represented as \\(a_n = 2^{(n-1)}\\).\n\nWe want to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(2^{(n-1)} > 5000\\).\n\nTaking logarithms on both sides gives us:\n\\[n - 1 > \\log_2{5000}\\]\n\nUsing a calculator or logarithm table, we find that \\(\\log_2{5000} \\approx 12.29\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(n - 1 > 12.29\\), which implies \\(n > 13.29\\). Since \\(n\\) must be an integer, the smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies this condition is \\(n = 14\\).\n\nThus, the first term that exceeds 5000 is \\(a_{14} = 2^{(14-1)} = 2^{13} = 8192\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 8192."
