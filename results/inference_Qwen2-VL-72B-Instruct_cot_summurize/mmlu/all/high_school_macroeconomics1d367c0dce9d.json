Higher interest rates can discourage borrowing and spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand. This decrease in aggregate demand can cause a reduction in real GDP. At the same time, if the decrease in the money supply is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in aggregate supply (the total output of goods and services in the economy), the price level may rise due to the reduced purchasing power of money. This scenario describes stagflation, where there is a simultaneous occurrence of inflation (increase in the price level) and economic stagnation (decrease in real GDP)."
