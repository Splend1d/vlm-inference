The most common units for the rate of a chemical reaction are moles per liter per second (mol L^-1 s^-1), which corresponds to option B.\nOption A, L^2 mol^-2 s^-1, does not make sense as units for the rate of a chemical reaction because it has an extra factor of L^2 and an extra negative exponent on mol.\nOption C, L mol^-1 s^-1, also does not make sense as units for the rate of a chemical reaction because it has an extra factor of L and a negative exponent on mol.\nOption D, \"it depends on the particular reaction,\" is not correct because the units for the rate of a chemical reaction are generally the same regardless of the specific reaction being considered. However, the numerical value of the rate constant may depend on the specific reaction and the conditions under which it is carried out."
