Instructions for the builders written there by the engineers:\nThis is plausible because ancient construction sites often had some form of guidance or instructions left by the engineers or overseers for the workers.\n\nB. Random scratches and not a meaningful script or written language:\nWhile this is possible, it seems less likely given that such markings would have been made intentionally during the construction process.\n\nC. Intended to identify the local group that had produced them:\nThis is also plausible as ancient cultures often marked their work with symbols or signs to indicate the group responsible for the construction.\n\nD. Simple arithmetic performed by carpenters on the building site:\nThis is possible if the markings were used for calculations related to the construction process, such as measuring materials or tracking progress.\n\nGiven the context of an ancient construction site like Huaca del Sol, where precision and organization were crucial, it is reasonable to assume that the markings served a specific purpose rather than being random scratches. Among the options provided, marking the bricks to identify the local group that produced them (Option C) seems particularly relevant in ancient construction practices, as it would help in organizing labor and ensuring accountability.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. Intended to identify the local group that had produced them."
