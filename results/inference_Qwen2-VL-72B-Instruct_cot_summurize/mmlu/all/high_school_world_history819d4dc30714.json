                    "text": "To determine which option would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1, we need to analyze the context and content of the source.\n\nArticle 1 of Source 1 states: \"The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombia.\"\n\nThe expectation here is that the unification of Venezuela and New Granada (now Colombia) will lead to increased power and prosperity. This unification is based on the belief that together, they can achieve more than if they remain separate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries**\n   - While foreign intervention could certainly impact the stability and autonomy of newly independent states, it does not directly address the issue of sectionalism or the internal divisions that could undermine the unity of Venezuela and New Granada.\n\nB. **Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America**\n   - This option actually supports the idea of unity and would likely reinforce the expectations of Article 1 rather than undermine them.\n\nC. **Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states**\n   - While slave rebellions could cause significant social and political instability, they do not specifically target the sectionalism or the division among elites that could prevent the unification envisioned in Article 1.\n\nD. **Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states**\n   - Sectionalism among elites directly relates to the internal divisions and conflicts that could prevent the unification of Venezuela and New Granada. If elites in different territories cannot agree or cooperate, it would significantly undermine the expectations of unity and prosperity expressed in Article 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that most undermines the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1 is:\n\n**D. Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states**"
