This indicates that the process has a deterministic component that evolves over time at a constant rate determined by $\\lambda$. The presence of this deterministic trend distinguishes it from other processes listed:\n\n- A unit root process typically refers to a non-stationary process where the variable can wander without returning to a long-run mean.\n- A stationary process is characterized by statistical properties (such as mean and variance) that do not change over time, which does not fit the given model due to the presence of the time trend.\n- A random walk with drift would involve a stochastic component that accumulates over time, often represented as $y_t = y_{t-1} + \\alpha + u_t$, which is different from the specified model.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the process for $y_t$ in the given model is a deterministic trend process."
