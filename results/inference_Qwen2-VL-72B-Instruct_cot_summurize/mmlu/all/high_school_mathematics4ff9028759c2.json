The divisors of $12$ are the numbers that divide $12$ without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe positive divisors of $12$ are: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $12$.\n\nFor each positive divisor, there is a corresponding negative divisor (since if $n$ divides $12$, then $-n$ also divides $12$). Therefore, for every positive divisor, there is one negative divisor.\n\nSo, the total number of positive and negative integers that $12$ is a multiple of is twice the number of positive divisors:\n\nPositive divisors: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$ (6 in total)\n\nNegative divisors: $-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12$ (6 in total)\n\nTotal: $6 + 6 = 12$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 12."
