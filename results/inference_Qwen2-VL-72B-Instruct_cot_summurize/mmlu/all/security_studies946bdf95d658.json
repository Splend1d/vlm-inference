A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.\nC. A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.\nD. A culture within which survival relies on military power, security dilemmas abound, and security is a zero-sum game.\n"

A culture characterized by rivalry, which has dominated since the beginning of the modern system of states and in which actors regard each other as rivals but exercise some restraint in violence.\n\nIn the Lockean culture, states recognize each other as legitimate actors with mutual interests and rights to survival. They engage in competition and rivalry but maintain a level of restraint in their interactions, avoiding the complete destruction or annihilation of one another. This culture acknowledges the need for cooperation and mutual respect among states, even though they may be rivals."
