Given that it's an arithmetic progression with the first term being 9, we can express these terms as follows:\n\n- \\(a_1 = 9\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 9 + d\\) (where \\(d\\) is the common difference)\n- \\(a_3 = 9 + 2d\\)\n\nAccording to the problem, when 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the resulting numbers form a geometric progression. So, the modified terms become:\n\n- \\(b_1 = a_1 = 9\\)\n- \\(b_2 = a_2 + 2 = 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d\\)\n- \\(b_3 = a_3 + 20 = 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d\\)\n\nFor these numbers to form a geometric progression, the following condition must be satisfied:\n\n\\[b_2^2 = b_1 \\cdot b_3\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\), we get:\n\n\\[(11 + d)^2 = 9(29 + 2d)\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation gives us:\n\n\\[121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for \\(d\\), we use the quadratic formula where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = -140\\):\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[d = \\frac{-4 \\pm 24}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible values for \\(d\\): \\(d = 10\\) or \\(d = -14\\).\n\nIf \\(d = 10\\), then the third term of the geometric progression is:\n\n\\[b_3 = 29 + 2d = 29 + 2(10) = 49\\]\n\nIf \\(d = -14\\), then the third term of the geometric progression is:\n\n\\[b_3 = 29 + 2d = 29 + 2(-14) = 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is \\(1\\), which corresponds to option B."
