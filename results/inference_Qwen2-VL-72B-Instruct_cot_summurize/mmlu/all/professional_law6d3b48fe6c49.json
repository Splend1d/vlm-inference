Valid and enforceable.\n\nThe agreement between Base Electric Co. and Seymour Metal Wire Company appears to be valid and enforceable because it specifies that Seymour Metal will sell all the copper wiring that Base Electric requires for six months, and Base Electric will buy its actual requirements of copper wiring from Seymour Metal for the same period. This mutual commitment provides sufficient definiteness regarding the quantity and terms of the agreement, ensuring that both parties have a clear understanding of their obligations. Therefore, the agreement meets the necessary legal criteria for enforceability."
