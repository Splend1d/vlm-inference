Glycogen is the primary fuel source for high-intensity activities, and without adequate stores, performance can be impaired. Options A, B, and D are not accurate because:\n\nA. Carbohydrate intake can influence performance even in short-duration events if glycogen stores are depleted.\nB. Resting muscle pH is not directly affected by carbohydrate intake; it's more influenced by factors like lactic acid production during exercise.\nD. Low carbohydrate intake would actually result in less reliance on muscle glycogen, as there would be less available."
