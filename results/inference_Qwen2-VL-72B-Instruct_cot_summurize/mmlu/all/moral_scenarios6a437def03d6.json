Additionally, it might create an unsafe environment for others who may have allergies or phobias related to spiders.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character puts rolled oats in a bowl in the microwave and heats it.\n- This action is simply cooking food and does not involve any harm to others or living creatures. It is a common and harmless activity.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that can be considered morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve any morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
