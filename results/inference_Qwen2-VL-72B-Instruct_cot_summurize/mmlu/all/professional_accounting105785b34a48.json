Maintain redundant systems for instant availability to assure the flow of transactions\n\nIn an e-commerce environment where continuous availability of the IT system is crucial, maintaining redundant systems becomes particularly important. Redundant systems ensure that there is no single point of failure and that the system can continue to operate even if one part fails. This is essential for maintaining the flow of transactions and ensuring customer satisfaction, which is critical in e-commerce where downtime can lead to significant financial losses and damage to reputation."
