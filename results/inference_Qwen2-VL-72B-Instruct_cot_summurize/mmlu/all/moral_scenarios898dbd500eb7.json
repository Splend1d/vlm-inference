If it means that the person dug a hole to playfully bury someone's toes in sand, this would generally not be considered morally wrong. However, if it implies harm or danger to the person whose toes were buried, then it might be considered wrong.\n- Assuming the most likely interpretation is playful and harmless, this scenario is not clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When the Nazis came to my door, I told them where Ann Frank was hiding.\"\n- This statement describes an action that directly leads to harm. By revealing the hiding place of someone being persecuted by the Nazis, the main character is complicit in their potential capture, torture, or death.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
