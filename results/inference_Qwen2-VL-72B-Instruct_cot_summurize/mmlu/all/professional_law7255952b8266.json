                    "text": "In 1998, a landowner owned a 30-acre tract located just inside the city. The tract included the family home, a decaying antebellum mansion complete with tennis courts, stables and a smaller second house that was once occupied by tenants who farmed the city. The second house, however, had long been vacant as a result of the economic decay of the surrounding area. Prosperity burst upon the city in 1999, and the landowner began selling acre lots in the tract. By 2006, the landowner had sold 25 acres, retaining five acres that included the antebellum mansion, tennis courts, stables, and the former tenants' house. On May, 19, 2007, the landowner entered into a valid written contract with a buyer. According to the terms of their agreement, the landowner agreed to sell and convey his remaining interest in the tract for a consideration of $500,000. The land sale contract provided a closing date of November 19, 2007 and stipulated that \"time was of the essence. \"On July 2, 2007, a fire destroyed the antebellum mansion. The landowner had the mansion insured for $450,000 against fire loss and collected that amount from the insurance company. At the closing on November 19, the buyer tendered a cashier's check for $50,000 and demanded a deed conveying a fee simple interest in the property. Conversely, the landowner tendered a deed of conveyance and demanded the full purchase price of $500,000. The buyer refused the landowner's demand. In an appropriate action for specific performance against the buyer, the landowner demanded $500,000. If the landowner prevails, which of the following is the best rationale for the outcome?\n\nA. The fact that the antebellum mansion was insured for $450,000 is irrelevant.\nB. The landowner and the buyer each had an insurable interest in the property.\nC. The doctrine of equitable conversion has been abolished.\nD. The doctrine of equitable conversion requires such a result.\n"

                    "text": "The best rationale for the outcome if the landowner prevails would be:\n\nD. The doctrine of equitable conversion requires such a result.\n\nHere's why: \n\nEquitable conversion is a legal principle that applies when a contract for the sale of real estate is made. It holds that, from the moment the contract is signed, the buyer becomes the equitable owner of the property, while the seller retains legal title until the closing. This means that any risks associated with the property, including damage or destruction, generally fall on the buyer.\n\nIn this case, the contract was signed on May 19, 2007, and the fire occurred on July 2, 2007, before the closing date of November 19, 2007. Since the contract was already in place, the doctrine of equitable conversion would mean that the risk of loss passed to the buyer at the time the contract was signed. Therefore, the buyer would still be obligated to pay the full purchase price of $500,000 despite the destruction of the antebellum mansion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the insurance coverage is relevant to the buyer's potential recovery but not to the obligation to pay the full purchase price.\n\nOption B is not directly relevant to the outcome of the specific performance action; it addresses the concept of insurable interest, which is different from the doctrine of equitable conversion.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the doctrine of equitable conversion has not been abolished; it remains a relevant legal principle in many jurisdictions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
