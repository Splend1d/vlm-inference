Here's an analysis of each option:\n\nA. **Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.**\n   - This option suggests that the core instructional methods or materials might need to be adjusted to better meet the needs of the students. If many students are struggling, it could indicate that the current approach isn't effective for the majority.\n\nB. **Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.**\n   - This option focuses on providing additional support to those students who are falling behind. It acknowledges that some students may require extra help beyond the standard curriculum.\n\nC. **Students must be given more time to develop competencies.**\n   - This option implies that the pacing of the curriculum might be too fast for some students. Allowing more time could help them catch up and master the necessary skills.\n\nD. **Students who are not meeting competencies must be evaluated for learning disabilities.**\n   - This option suggests that some students might have underlying conditions that are hindering their ability to learn. Evaluating for learning disabilities can provide insights into specific needs and appropriate interventions.\n\nGiven the context, the most comprehensive initial step would likely involve a combination of these strategies. However, if we must choose one option that directly addresses the immediate need to improve student outcomes, **Option B** stands out as the most practical first step. Providing strategic or supplemental instruction to students who are not meeting competencies can quickly target those who need additional support without necessarily altering the entire core program or assuming underlying disabilities.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n**B. Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.**"
