Identify the thousands digit: The thousands digit in 836,527 is 6.\n2. Determine if the number should be rounded up or down:\n   - If the thousands digit is 5 or more, we round up.\n   - If the thousands digit is less than 5, we round down.\n\nSince the thousands digit is 6 (which is greater than 5), we round up.\n\nTherefore, rounding 836,527 to the nearest ten thousand gives us 840,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 840,000"
