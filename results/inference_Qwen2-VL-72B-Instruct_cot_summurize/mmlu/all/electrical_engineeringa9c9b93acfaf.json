It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nThe potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is considered more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it does not draw any current from the circuit being measured. This means that the act of measuring the voltage does not affect the voltage itself, which can be a significant issue with other types of measurements where the meter's resistance can load the circuit and alter the readings. The potentiometer method achieves this by balancing a known voltage against the unknown voltage without drawing current from the circuit under test."
