Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins.\n\nThese symptoms are indicative of circulatory overload, which occurs when there is an excessive amount of fluid in the circulatory system. This can lead to increased pressure on the heart and blood vessels, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath (dyspnoea), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), and visible swelling in the neck veins (distended neck veins).\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia: These symptoms are more indicative of shock or severe dehydration rather than circulatory overload.\n\nB. Hypotension, oliguria, and urticaria: Hypotension and oliguria can be associated with various conditions including dehydration or kidney issues, while urticaria (hives) is typically related to allergic reactions.\n\nC. Shivering, pyrexia, and thirst: These symptoms are more commonly associated with fever or infections rather than circulatory overload.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate indicators of circulatory overload are dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins."
