During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\n\nA. The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nB. The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\nD. The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n"

The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of the premises during the period of her alleged exposure.**\n\nThis argument suggests that the employee should direct her claim towards the current owner and occupier of the premises, the appliance repair shop, rather than the former manufacturer. The reasoning behind this is that the appliance repair shop had control over the premises and could have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with the contamination once they became aware of it. Additionally, the appliance repair shop may have been responsible for ensuring the safety of their employees and could potentially be held liable for any harm caused by their failure to do so.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C highlight deficiencies in the employee's complaint regarding the severity of emotional distress, the nature of the manufacturer's conduct, and the absence of physical consequences, these arguments alone may not be sufficient to secure a dismissal. Option D addresses a more fundamental issue: the appropriate party to be held responsible for the employee's exposure and resulting distress."
