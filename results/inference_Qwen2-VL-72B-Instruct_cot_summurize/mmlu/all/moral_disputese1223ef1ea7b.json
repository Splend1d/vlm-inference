This option does not directly address Arthur's reasoning about the affluent's obligations.\n\nC. **The consequences of helping the poor would be worse than the consequences of not helping them.**\n   - This option suggests a consequentialist argument, but it does not directly address the nature of rights or obligations between the affluent and the poor.\n\nD. **This kind of right would require a contract or agreement, and the affluent haven't entered into a contract or agreement with the poor.**\n   - This option implies that Arthur believes rights to aid must be based on mutual agreements or contracts. Since there is no such agreement between the affluent and the poor, he concludes that the poor do not have a right to aid from the affluent.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the most coherent and direct explanation for Arthur's view is:\n\n**D. This kind of right would require a contract or agreement, and the affluent haven't entered into a contract or agreement with the poor.**"
