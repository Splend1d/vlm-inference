As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule\n\nA. in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.\nB. against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\nC. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.\nD. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n"

The correct instruction for the jury would depend on the principles of joint and several liability, which typically apply when multiple parties are involved in causing harm.\n\nGiven the facts:\n\n1. Both friends shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n2. One of the spears struck and injured the other scuba diver.\n3. It is unclear which friend's spear caused the injury.\n\nThe appropriate legal principle here is joint and several liability. Under this principle, if multiple parties act together or concurrently to cause harm, each party can be held fully liable for the entire damage, even if it cannot be determined whose specific action caused the harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct instruction for the jury would be:\n\n**B. against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.**\n\nThis instruction aligns with the principle of joint and several liability, where both defendants can be held responsible for the full amount of damages unless one can prove that they were not the cause of the injury."
