                    "text": "The doctrine of substantial performance is a legal principle that applies when a party has completed the majority of their contractual obligations, even if there are minor deviations or defects. The key aspect is that the work performed must be substantially what was agreed upon, and any deviations should not significantly affect the overall purpose or value of the contract.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs from Kyle but Kyle delivered a dozen red chairs.**\n   - This does not illustrate substantial performance because the chairs delivered were of a completely different color than specified. The deviation is significant enough to affect the purpose of the contract.\n\nB. **Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.**\n   - This could potentially illustrate substantial performance. Painting the entire room is the main obligation, and failing to replace the outlet covers is a minor detail that does not significantly detract from the overall completion of the painting job.\n\nC. **A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.**\n   - This does not illustrate substantial performance because the contract explicitly states that the work must meet Toby's satisfaction, which it did not. The dissatisfaction, even if in good faith, means the contract terms were not met.\n\nD. **A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.**\n   - This does not illustrate substantial performance because pulling the wrong tooth is a significant error that affects the fundamental purpose of the contract, which was to extract a specific tooth.\n\nTherefore, the transaction that correctly illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance is:\n\n**B. Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.**"
