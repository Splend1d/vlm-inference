The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n"

No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nIn cases where multiple defendants could potentially be responsible for the harm but the plaintiff cannot identify which one specifically caused the harm, the doctrine of alternative liability may apply. This doctrine allows the plaintiff to hold all potential defendants liable if they can show that each defendant had the opportunity and capability to cause the harm and that it is impossible to determine who actually did so. The burden then shifts to the defendants to prove that they were not responsible.\n\nTherefore, the court should not grant the motion for a directed verdict based on the doctrine of alternative liability."
