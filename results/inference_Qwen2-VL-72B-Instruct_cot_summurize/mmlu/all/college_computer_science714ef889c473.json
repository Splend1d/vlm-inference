The number of 0's in \\( x \\) must be divisible by \\( k \\).\n2. The number of 1's in \\( x \\) must be odd.\n\nWe will analyze each condition separately and then combine them to find the total number of states required.\n\n### Condition 1: Number of 0's Divisible by \\( k \\)\n\nFor the number of 0's to be divisible by \\( k \\), there are \\( k \\) possible remainders when dividing by \\( k \\). These remainders correspond to the states where the current count of 0's modulo \\( k \\) is stored. Therefore, we need \\( k \\) states to keep track of this condition.\n\n### Condition 2: Number of 1's is Odd\n\nFor the number of 1's to be odd, there are two possibilities: either the number of 1's is odd or even. This requires 2 states to keep track of whether the current count of 1's is odd or even.\n\n### Combining Conditions\n\nSince these two conditions are independent, we can use the product rule for the number of states. For each state tracking the number of 0's modulo \\( k \\), there are 2 states tracking the parity of the number of 1's. Thus, the total number of states is:\n\n\\[ k \\times 2 = 2k \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes \\( L \\) is \\( 2k \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 2k"
