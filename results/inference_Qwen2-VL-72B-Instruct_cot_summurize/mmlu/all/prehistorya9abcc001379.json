However, Caral is known more for its monumental architecture than its agricultural practices.\n\nC. **the building of the Piramide Mayor**\n   - The construction of monumental structures like the Piramide Mayor indicates significant social organization and labor coordination, which are hallmarks of complex societies.\n\nD. **the excavating work to produce the sunken plazas**\n   - Sunken plazas also require substantial labor and planning, reflecting a high level of societal complexity.\n\nGiven that Caral is renowned for its monumental architecture, including the Piramide Mayor and sunken plazas, the most plausible reason for the development of a complex society at Caral would be related to these constructions.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**C. the building of the Piramide Mayor**"
