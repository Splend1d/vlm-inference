                    "text": "To determine which change will not affect the results when the code segment is executed, let's analyze each option:\n\n### Original Code Segment:\n```plaintext\nIF (a = 0) {\n    b \u2190 a + 10\n} ELSE {\n    b \u2190 a + 20\n}\n```\n\n### Analysis of Each Option:\n\n#### A. Changing line 3 to `b \u2190 10`\n- **Original Line 3:** `b \u2190 a + 10`\n- **Proposed Change:** `b \u2190 10`\n\nThis change will always set `b` to 10 regardless of the value of `a`. This will affect the result because it removes the dependency on `a`.\n\n#### B. Changing line 3 to `a \u2190 b + 10`\n- **Original Line 3:** `b \u2190 a + 10`\n- **Proposed Change:** `a \u2190 b + 10`\n\nThis change modifies `a` instead of `b`, which fundamentally alters the logic of the code. It will affect the result.\n\n#### C. Changing line 7 to `b \u2190 20`\n- **Original Line 7:** `b \u2190 a + 20`\n- **Proposed Change:** `b \u2190 20`\n\nThis change sets `b` to 20 regardless of the value of `a`. This will affect the result because it removes the dependency on `a`.\n\n#### D. Changing line 7 to `a \u2190 b + 10`\n- **Original Line 7:** `b \u2190 a + 20`\n- **Proposed Change:** `a \u2190 b + 10`\n\nThis change modifies `a` instead of `b`, similar to option B. It will also affect the result.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll options (A, B, C, and D) will affect the results when the code segment is executed. Therefore, there is no correct answer among the provided options that will NOT affect the results."
