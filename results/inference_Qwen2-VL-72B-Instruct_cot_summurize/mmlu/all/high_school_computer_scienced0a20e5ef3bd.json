                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. The song was saved using fewer bits per second than the original song.\n\nExplanation: When a song is recorded and then saved with fewer bits per second (bps), it means that less data is used to represent the audio. This can result in a lower sound quality because some of the finer details and nuances of the original recording might be lost during the compression process. This is a common issue when saving audio files in formats like MP3, which use lossy compression techniques to reduce file size at the expense of audio fidelity."
