Damage to this nerve can result in specific signs and symptoms.\n\n- **Pupillary constriction vs. pupillary dilatation:** The third cranial nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that control the sphincter muscle of the iris, which is responsible for pupillary constriction (making the pupil smaller). If the third cranial nerve is damaged, these fibers would not function properly, leading to pupillary dilatation (making the pupil larger).\n\n- **Medial strabismus vs. lateral strabismus:** The third cranial nerve innervates four of the six extraocular muscles: the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles help move the eye upward, downward, medially, and inwardly. Damage to the third cranial nerve would impair the function of these muscles, causing the eye to deviate outward (lateral strabismus or exotropia) because the lateral rectus muscle, which is not innervated by the third cranial nerve, remains unopposed.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus**"
