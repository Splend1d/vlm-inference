The mass of an electron is approximately \\(9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg, while the mass of a proton or neutron is around \\(1.67 \\times 10^{-27}\\) kg. This means that the mass of an electron is about \\(1/1836\\) times the mass of a proton or neutron.\n\n2. **Protons and Neutrons**: Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom and contribute significantly to its mass. Each proton and neutron has a mass close to \\(1.67 \\times 10^{-27}\\) kg.\n\nGiven this information:\n- The mass of electrons is much smaller than the mass of protons and neutrons.\n- The mass of protons and neutrons is nearly equal and contributes the majority of the atomic mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. the electrons**\n\nThe electrons contribute less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom."
