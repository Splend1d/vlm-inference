The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.\nB. succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.\nC. not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Implied Delegation of Duties**: There is no basis for an implied delegation of duties from the woman to the farmer regarding the mortgage. The farmer did not assume any obligations related to the mortgage when they received the quitclaim deed.\n\n2. **Third-Party Beneficiary**: The niece was not a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer. The conveyance was between two parties (the woman and the farmer), and there was no agreement or intention to benefit the niece directly through this transaction.\n\n3. **Promise to Pay**: The farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt. A quitclaim deed does not transfer any obligations or debts associated with the property unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n4. **Constructive Notice**: Constructive notice is a legal concept where a person is presumed to have knowledge of certain facts because those facts were recorded in public records. If the mortgage was recorded immediately after it was given, it would be part of the public record. Therefore, if the farmer did not check the public records before acquiring the property, they would still be presumed to have constructive notice of the mortgage. Without constructive notice, the farmer would not be liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nGiven these points, the mortgagee (the niece) will likely not succeed in recovering the amount of the mortgage due from the farmer unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage."
