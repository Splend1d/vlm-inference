While international corporations might indirectly contribute to harm by supporting corrupt regimes, it is not typically characterized as murder.\n\nB. **Prostitutes who knowingly spread disease**: This implies engaging in harmful behavior with awareness of its consequences. While this could be seen as a metaphor for corporations knowingly contributing to corruption and its negative impacts, it is a less common analogy.\n\nC. **People who knowingly buy stolen goods**: This is a more fitting analogy. Buying stolen goods implies complicity in illegal activities and supports the continuation of such activities. Similarly, corporations dealing with corrupt dictators can be seen as complicit in corruption and supporting oppressive regimes.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate analogy according to Singer's perspective would be:\n\n**C. People who knowingly buy stolen goods.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
