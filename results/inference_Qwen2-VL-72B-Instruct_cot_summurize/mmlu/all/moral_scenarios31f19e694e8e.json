Assuming the scolding is done in a reasonable and educational manner, it would not be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong if the scolding is done appropriately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
