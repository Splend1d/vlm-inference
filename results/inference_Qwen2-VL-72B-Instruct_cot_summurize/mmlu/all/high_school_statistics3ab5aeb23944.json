                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of a normal distribution. The given information tells us that the resistors' resistances are normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 200 ohms and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 5 ohms.\n\nWe want to find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms, given that it is less than 194 ohms. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(188 < X < 194) \\]\n\nFirst, let's convert these values to z-scores using the formula:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nFor \\(X = 188\\) ohms:\n\\[ Z_{188} = \\frac{188 - 200}{5} = \\frac{-12}{5} = -2.4 \\]\n\nFor \\(X = 194\\) ohms:\n\\[ Z_{194} = \\frac{194 - 200}{5} = \\frac{-6}{5} = -1.2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between these two z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the cumulative probabilities for these z-scores.\n\nThe cumulative probability for \\(Z = -2.4\\) is approximately 0.0082 (or 0.82%).\nThe cumulative probability for \\(Z = -1.2\\) is approximately 0.1151 (or 11.51%).\n\nThe probability that a resistor's resistance is between 188 and 194 ohms is the difference between these two cumulative probabilities:\n\n\\[ P(188 < X < 194) = P(Z < -1.2) - P(Z < -2.4) \\]\n\\[ P(188 < X < 194) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 \\]\n\\[ P(188 < X < 194) = 0.1069 \\]\n\nThis value is not exactly listed in the options provided, but it is closest to option B. 0.12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.12"
