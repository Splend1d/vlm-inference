The degrees of freedom (df) for this test is \\( n - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13 \\).\n\nFor a one-sided test, if the P-value is 0.075, it means that the t-value falls at the point where 7.5% of the distribution is more extreme than this value in the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator for df = 13 and a one-tailed test, we find the critical t-value corresponding to a P-value of 0.075. This value is approximately 1.771.\n\nSince the question asks for the range of t-values that would give this P-value, we need to consider values slightly less than and slightly greater than 1.771 because the exact P-value could be achieved by any t-value in a small interval around 1.771 due to rounding or interpolation in the t-table.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.771 < t < 2.160\n\nThis range includes the critical t-value of 1.771 and extends to a higher value, which would still result in a P-value close to 0.075."
