A farmer is the owner of parcel \"B,\" which is situated lower than \"A\" on the mountainside. In 2000, the rancher, who owned both parcels of land, constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across both parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the rancher sold parcel \"B\" to the farmer. The deed to the farmer did not contain any mention of the rancher's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. Lately, the sewage drain has begun to emit an unpleasant odor across parcel \"B. \" As a result, the farmer sued the rancher in trespass praying for damages caused by the drainage system. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the rancher, because the deed to the farmer did not contain any covenants restricting the rancher's use of the land.\nB. the rancher, because the farmer's proper cause of action would be for nuisance, rather than trespass.\nC. the farmer, because the drainage system was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages as a matter of law.\nD. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the rancher installed a drainage system that crosses both parcels of land and causes an unpleasant odor on the farmer's property (parcel \"B\"). Even though the rancher initially owned both parcels, the sale of parcel \"B\" to the farmer without any mention of the drainage system implies that the rancher did not retain any rights to use the farmer's land for the drainage system. The fact that the system is causing harm (unpleasant odor) to the farmer's enjoyment of their property suggests a legal issue.\n\nTrespass involves the unauthorized entry onto someone else's land, whereas nuisance deals with interference with the use or enjoyment of land. However, since the drainage system was installed before the sale and continues to cause harm after the sale, it can be argued that the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a way that causes harm to another's property. Therefore, the farmer has a valid claim against the rancher for the harm caused by the drainage system."
