                    "text": "To find the least possible positive integer value of $n$ such that $\\sqrt{18\\cdot n \\cdot 34}$ is an integer, we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is a perfect square.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[18 \\cdot n \\cdot 34 = 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot n \\cdot 2 \\cdot 17 = 2^2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot n \\cdot 17\\]\n\nFor this product to be a perfect square, each prime factor must appear to an even power. We already have $2^2$, which is good, but we need to make sure that $9$ (which is $3^2$) and $17$ also contribute to making the entire product a perfect square.\n\nSince $9$ is already a perfect square ($3^2$), it doesn't need any adjustment. However, $17$ is a prime number and appears to the first power in our expression. To make the entire product a perfect square, we need another $17$ to pair with the existing one, making it $17^2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest $n$ that can make the entire expression a perfect square is $17$, because adding another $17$ to the product will give us $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 17^2$, which is a perfect square.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 17."
