On the south side of the river is situated a rural community with a population of 40,000. For many years, various civic groups have urged that both communities merge into one township with a single governmental body. Independent studies have indicated that such a merger would result in an enormous tax savings to the residents of both municipalities by eliminating the duplication of services. On one previous occasion, proponents of the merger pian succeeded in having the proposal appear as an election referendum in each community. Although the merger referendum passed in the industrial town by a sizable margin, the voters of the rural community rejected the measure, fearing the combined government would be dominated and controlled by its neighbor's larger representation. In order to alleviate the concern of the rural community's voters regarding under representation in a merged governmental system, the respective city councils of both municipalities appointed a steering committee to formulate a new proposal. Accordingly, the steering committee devised a merger scheme wherein the city council of the united city, would consist of eight members. Within this proposed new system of government, each former municipality would be divided into four districts. With respect to the industrial town, each district would consist of 25,000 persons and each would have one elected city council member. By the same token, the rural community would be divided into four elective districts, each containing 10,000 residents. One city council member would be elected from each of these districts as well. The mayor would be elected at large by a popular vote of all residents in the newly created eight districts. Before this merger proposal was placed on the ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both municipalities. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from the industrial town initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the disproportionate representative districts. Which of the following represents the plaintiffs' strongest constitutional argument in support of their action?\n\nA. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the equal protection of the law.\nB. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the due process of the law.\nC. The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the privileges and immunities of citizenship as guaranteed by Article IV, Section 2.\nD. The merged city would not constitute a republican form of government.\n"

The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the equal protection of the law.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" which is a fundamental aspect of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This principle requires that electoral districts be drawn in a way that ensures each voter's vote carries approximately equal weight. In the proposed merger scheme, the districts in the industrial town each contain 25,000 persons, while those in the rural community each contain only 10,000 persons. This disparity means that each vote in the rural community has more influence than each vote in the industrial town, thus violating the principle of equal representation and the Equal Protection Clause."
