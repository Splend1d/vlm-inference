The paradox, now referred to as Meno's Paradox, has to do with the question of:\n\nA. how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world.\nB. how knowledge of the Forms can ever be anything other than a generalization of experience.\nC. how anyone can recognize the correct answer to a question without already knowing the answer.\nD. how concepts bound to the realm of becoming have meaning only when associated with the realm of Being.\n"

This paradox challenges the very possibility of inquiry and learning new things. Plato's theory of recollection (anamnesis) suggests that all knowledge is actually recollection of what the soul knew before birth, which allows for the resolution of this paradox by positing that we can \"remember\" the truth through proper inquiry and reasoning."
