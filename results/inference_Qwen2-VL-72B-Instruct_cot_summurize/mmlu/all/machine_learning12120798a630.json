The use of prior distributions on the parameters in a probabilistic model.\n\nBayesians incorporate prior knowledge into their models through prior distributions, whereas frequentists typically do not use prior distributions and instead focus on the likelihood function and the data at hand. This is a fundamental difference between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to statistical inference."
