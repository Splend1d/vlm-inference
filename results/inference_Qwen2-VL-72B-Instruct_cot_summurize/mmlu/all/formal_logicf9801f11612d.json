G \u2283 F\n3. H \u2228 ~E\n4. H \u2283 I\n5. ~I\n\nWe will now examine each option to see if it follows directly from these premises:\n\n**Option A: E \u2283 F**\n\n- From premise 1: ~E \u2283 ~F.\n- If we assume E, then ~E is false, and since ~E \u2283 ~F, this does not immediately give us F because the implication only works when ~E is true.\n\n**Option B: F \u2283 G**\n\n- From premise 2: G \u2283 F.\n- This is the reverse of what we have. We cannot infer F \u2283 G from G \u2283 F without additional information.\n\n**Option C: H \u2283 ~E**\n\n- From premise 3: H \u2228 ~E.\n- If H is true, then by disjunction elimination, ~E must also be true for the disjunction to hold.\n- Therefore, H \u2283 ~E is a direct consequence.\n\n**Option D: ~H**\n\n- From premise 4: H \u2283 I.\n- Given premise 5: ~I.\n- By modus tollens, if I is false, then H must also be false.\n- Therefore, ~H is a direct consequence.\n\nBoth options C and D are immediate consequences of the given premises. However, since the question asks for a single immediate consequence, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- Option C: H \u2283 ~E is derived directly from premise 3.\n- Option D: ~H is derived through modus tollens from premises 4 and 5.\n\nGiven that both options are valid, but the question asks for a single immediate consequence, we should choose the one that directly follows from a single premise without needing additional steps.\n\nThus, the most straightforward immediate consequence is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. H \u2283 ~E**"
