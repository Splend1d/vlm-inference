                    "text": "To determine which statement is false, let's analyze each option step by step.\n\n### Given Information:\n- All containers are the same size.\n- They are at the same temperature.\n- Container 1: 4.0 g of helium (He)\n- Container 2: 28.0 g of nitrogen (N\u2082)\n- Container 3: 44.0 g of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### A. The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\nDensity is calculated as mass per unit volume. Since the containers are the same size, we can compare the masses directly to determine density.\n\n- Helium (He): 4.0 g\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): 28.0 g\n- Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082): 44.0 g\n\nThe masses increase in the order He < N\u2082 < CO\u2082, so the densities also increase in that order. This statement is true.\n\n#### B. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\nTo find the number of molecules, we need to calculate the number of moles for each gas and then use Avogadro's number.\n\n- Molar mass of He = 4.0 g/mol\n- Molar mass of N\u2082 = 28.0 g/mol\n- Molar mass of CO\u2082 = 44.0 g/mol\n\nNumber of moles:\n- He: \\( \\frac{4.0 \\text{ g}}{4.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\)\n- N\u2082: \\( \\frac{28.0 \\text{ g}}{28.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\)\n- CO\u2082: \\( \\frac{44.0 \\text{ g}}{44.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1 \\text{ mol} \\)\n\nSince each container has 1 mole of gas, and 1 mole contains \\( 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\) molecules (Avogadro's number), the number of molecules in all the containers is the same. This statement is true.\n\n#### C. The pressure in all three containers is the same.\nAccording to the ideal gas law (\\( PV = nRT \\)), where \\( P \\) is pressure, \\( V \\) is volume, \\( n \\) is the number of moles, \\( R \\) is the gas constant, and \\( T \\) is temperature, if \\( n \\), \\( V \\), and \\( T \\) are the same for all containers, then \\( P \\) must be the same for all containers. This statement is true.\n\n#### D. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\nThe average speed of gas molecules depends on the temperature and the molar mass of the gas. At the same temperature, lighter gases have higher average speeds than heavier gases.\n\n- He (lightest) will have the highest average speed.\n- N\u2082 will have an intermediate average speed.\n- CO\u2082 (heaviest) will have the lowest average speed.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of all the molecules is not the same. This statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe false statement is **D. The average speed of all the molecules is the same**."
