Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nIn the context of felony murder, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony (such as robbery), the perpetrator can be held responsible for the death, even if it was unintentional or accidental. In this scenario, the man's actions led to the deaths of both the store manager and the clerk, making him potentially liable for felony murder charges for both deaths."
