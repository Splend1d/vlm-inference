The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the excerpt above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which conclusion is best supported by the excerpt, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Lincoln received more votes in the heavily populated states of the North, while McClellan won more sparsely populated states.**\n   - The excerpt does not provide specific information about the population density of the states where Lincoln or McClelan won. It mentions that Lincoln won in an Electoral College landslide and that McClellan won only three states (New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky), but it doesn't specify the population density of these states.\n\nB. **Lincoln won the Election of 1864 due to Union successes during the Civil War.**\n   - The excerpt does not explicitly mention Union successes as the reason for Lincoln's victory. It focuses more on the demographics and groups supporting each candidate rather than attributing the win to specific military successes.\n\nC. **The Emancipation Proclamation mobilized black voters in the South to vote for Lincoln in the Election of 1864.**\n   - The excerpt does not mention anything about black voters in the South voting for Lincoln. In fact, it would be historically inaccurate since the South was not part of the Union electorate at that time, and black suffrage had not yet been established.\n\nD. **Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.**\n   - The excerpt states that Republicans gained seats in Congress and retained unassailable control. While it does not explicitly say that Lincoln campaigned on their behalf, it does imply that his popularity and the support he received contributed to the Republican gains.\n\nGiven the analysis, the conclusion that is best supported by the excerpt is:\n\n**D. Republicans managed to gain control of Congress through the efforts of Lincoln to campaign on their behalf.**"
