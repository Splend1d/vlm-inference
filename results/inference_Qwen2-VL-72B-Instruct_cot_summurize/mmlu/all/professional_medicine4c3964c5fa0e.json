In this context, the expected physical finding would be:\n\nB. Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration\n\nThis is because the murmur associated with infective endocarditis often becomes louder during inspiration due to increased blood flow through the affected valve. This phenomenon is known as a \"murmur accentuated by inspiration\" or \"murmur loudest in inspiration.\"\n\nDecreased intensity of S1 (option A) is not typically associated with infective endocarditis. Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration (option C) is less likely, as murmurs related to valvular heart disease usually do not behave this way. A positive Kussmaul sign (option D), which is a rise in jugular venous pressure with inspiration, is more commonly seen in constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy rather than infective endocarditis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B."
