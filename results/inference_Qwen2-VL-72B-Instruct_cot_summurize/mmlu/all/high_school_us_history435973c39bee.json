There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934\nSenator Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" attracted many followers in 1934 because\n\nA. the New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\nB. a flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes.\nC. the Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos.\nD. Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n"

Long's speech indicates that his \"Share the Wealth Society\" was proposed during a time of economic hardship, which aligns with the period of the Great Depression. The New Deal, implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was intended to alleviate the effects of the depression, but it had not yet achieved its goals by 1934. Therefore, option A is the most accurate explanation for why Senator Long's proposal attracted many followers at that time."
