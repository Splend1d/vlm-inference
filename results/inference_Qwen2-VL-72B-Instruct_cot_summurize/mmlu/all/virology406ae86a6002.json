Identifying genetic variation\n\nDeep nucleotide sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS), has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of entire genomes. This technique is particularly useful for identifying genetic variations within individuals or populations, which can provide insights into disease susceptibility, drug responses, and evolutionary relationships.\n\nWhile NGS can also contribute to other areas such as vaccine development, virus excretion studies, and the identification of new viruses, its primary utility lies in its ability to comprehensively analyze genetic variation at an unprecedented scale and resolution. This makes it an indispensable tool in fields such as personalized medicine, population genetics, and evolutionary biology."
