This shrinkage can pull the mediastinum and trachea towards the affected side, causing deviation.\n\nD. **Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis**: Also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, this condition involves progressive scarring of the lungs. While it can cause significant lung damage, it typically affects both lungs symmetrically and does not usually cause unilateral pressure sufficient to deviate the trachea.\n\nGiven these considerations, the condition most likely to cause deviation of the trachea is:\n\n**C. Previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe**"
