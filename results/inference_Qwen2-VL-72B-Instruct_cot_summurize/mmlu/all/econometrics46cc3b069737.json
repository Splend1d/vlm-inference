                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. The number of parameters to estimate may be large, resulting in a loss of degrees of freedom.\n\nIn the fixed effects approach to estimating a panel model, each individual (or entity) in the panel has its own intercept term, which is estimated along with the coefficients for the explanatory variables. This means that the number of parameters to estimate increases with the number of individuals in the panel, potentially leading to a loss of degrees of freedom and making the model less efficient.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. The model is likely to be technical to estimate - While it is true that any statistical model can be technically challenging to estimate depending on the software and data at hand, this is not a specific disadvantage unique to the fixed effects approach.\n\nB. The approach may not be valid if the composite error term is correlated with one or more of the explanatory variables - This statement describes an issue related to endogeneity, which is a concern in both fixed effects and random effects models. It is not a disadvantage specific to the fixed effects approach.\n\nD. The fixed effects approach can only capture cross-sectional heterogeneity and not temporal variation in the dependent variable - This is incorrect. The fixed effects approach allows for capturing both cross-sectional and time-series variation by including individual-specific intercepts and allowing the effect of the explanatory variables to vary over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
