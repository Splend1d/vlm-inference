It plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly in muscle and fat tissues. Insulin also promotes the storage of excess glucose as glycogen in the liver and inhibits the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose. This helps to maintain stable blood sugar levels and prevent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)."
