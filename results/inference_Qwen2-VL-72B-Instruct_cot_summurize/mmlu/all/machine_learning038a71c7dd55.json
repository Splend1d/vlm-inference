It works by placing a kernel (a small, smooth curve) at each data point and summing these kernels to obtain a density estimate. In essence, KDE can be seen as a form of kernel regression where the response variable \\( Y_i \\) for each data point \\( X_i \\) is set to \\( 1/n \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of data points. This setup ensures that the estimated density integrates to 1 over the entire domain, which is a requirement for a probability density function.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"The depth of a learned decision tree can be larger than the number of training examples used to create the tree.\"\n\nThe depth of a decision tree refers to the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. While it is theoretically possible to construct a very deep tree, the practical depth of a decision tree is often constrained by the number of features and the number of training examples. However, the depth does not necessarily have to be less than or equal to the number of training examples. A decision tree could potentially have a depth greater than the number of training examples if the tree splits on every feature multiple times or if there are many categorical features with numerous levels.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **True**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
