This ensures that the price reflects the true cost of producing an additional unit of output and helps to achieve allocative efficiency. Setting the price at this point balances the interests of consumers and producers, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently in the market.\n\nOption A (average revenue equals zero) and Option B (marginal revenue equals zero) do not relate directly to setting a socially optimal price. Option D (the average total cost curve intersects the demand curve) would result in a price that covers all costs but does not necessarily ensure allocative efficiency, as it may lead to prices higher than the marginal cost."
