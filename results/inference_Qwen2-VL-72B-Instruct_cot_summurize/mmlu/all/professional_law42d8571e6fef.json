Privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between the landlord and the tenant that arises from the lease agreement. When a tenant subleases the property to a third party, the landlord does not have privity of estate with the sublessee unless specifically provided for in the lease or by statute. Therefore, the landlord cannot directly sue the sublessee for rent arrears without privity of estate. The landlord would typically need to pursue the original tenant for any unpaid rent, who in turn may have recourse against the sublessee under their sublease agreement."
