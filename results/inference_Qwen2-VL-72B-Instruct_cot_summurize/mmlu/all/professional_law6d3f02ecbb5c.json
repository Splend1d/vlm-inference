He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, \"Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. \"The witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.\nB. admissible, as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.\nC. inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it was not a spontaneous utterance.\n"

In this scenario, the witness's testimony about hearing someone warn the customer about stepping on the piece of fish is relevant to the issue of contributory negligence. Contributory negligence refers to the plaintiff's own actions contributing to their injury. If the customer ignored a warning and stepped on the eel despite being alerted to the danger, this could be seen as evidence that the customer contributed to their own injury. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as it directly relates to the customer's behavior and potential contributory negligence."
