The descent of the tongue, changes in the flexure of the developing brain, and increased turgor pressure due to hydrophilic molecules all contribute to this process. Each of these factors plays a role in ensuring that the palatine shelves rise from their lateral position to meet in the midline, eventually fusing to form the hard and soft palate."
