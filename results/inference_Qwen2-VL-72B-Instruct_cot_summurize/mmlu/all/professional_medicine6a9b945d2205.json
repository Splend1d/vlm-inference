Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Ammonium urate\nB. Calcium oxalate\nC. Calcium pyrophosphate\nD. Calcium urate\n"

Pseudogout often presents with an acute inflammatory arthritis, similar to gout, but is caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals rather than monosodium urate crystals. The patient's history of osteoarthritis and the sudden onset of pain and swelling without injury are consistent with pseudogout.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Calcium pyrophosphate"
