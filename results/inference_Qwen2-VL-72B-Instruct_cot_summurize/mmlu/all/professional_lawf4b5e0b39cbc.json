After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\n\nIn this scenario, the investor, as an assignee of the original buyer, is entitled to enforce the terms of the contract. The contract was valid and binding when it was entered into, and there is no indication that the assignment itself was invalid or improper. The fact that the land's value increased due to a zoning change does not negate the original agreement. The investor, having paid consideration for the assignment, has standing to seek specific performance from the owner. The owner's refusal to close does not justify denying specific performance to the investor."
