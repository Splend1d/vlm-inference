The act of State doctrine is a legal mechanism that allows the courts to provide immunity to public acts of foreign States\n\nThe act of State doctrine is a principle in international law that generally holds that the courts of one country should not review the validity of the public acts of another sovereign state performed within its own territory. This doctrine is often invoked to prevent judicial interference with foreign policy decisions or to respect the sovereignty of other nations. It is not about the courts assessing the existence of an alleged tort committed by the State, nor does it mean that all State acts attract immunity. Instead, it provides a framework for courts to avoid ruling on certain matters involving foreign states' actions."
