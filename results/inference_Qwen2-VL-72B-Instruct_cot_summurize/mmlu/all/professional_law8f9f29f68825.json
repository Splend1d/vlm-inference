                    "text": "The owner and operator of a pizza restaurant entered into a written contract with an employee that provided that the employee would be employed as manager of the restaurant for a period of three years. The contract provided that the owner was to pay the employee a salary of $2,000 per month, payable one-half to the employee and one-half to the employee's elderly mother. The contract further stipulated that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable. \"When the mother learned of this contract, she wrote a letter to the owner stating, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient. \" During the first year of the contract, the owner paid $1,000 per month to the employee and $1,000 per month to the nursing home. After one year, another pizza restaurant opened across the street, creating competition. During the next few months, business steadily declined. As a result of the loss in business, the owner informed the employee that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, the employee would be fired. Reluctantly, the employee orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 per month. By the terms of their oral agreement, the owner promised to continue to pay $1,000 to the employee, but to pay only $500 per month to the nursing home. If the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n"

                    "text": "To determine who is most likely to prevail in the lawsuit brought by the nursing home against the owner for breach of contract, we need to analyze the various aspects of the situation:\n\n1. **Assignment Clause in the Contract**: The original contract between the owner and the employee stipulates that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\" This clause restricts the ability of either party to assign their rights or obligations under the contract.\n\n2. **Mother's Assignment to Nursing Home**: The mother wrote a letter to the owner requesting that her portion of the monthly payment be directed to the nursing home. However, since the contract explicitly prohibits assignments, the mother's attempt to assign her rights to the nursing home is void.\n\n3. **Oral Agreement Between Owner and Employee**: The employee and the owner entered into an oral agreement to reduce the salary by $500 per month. This new arrangement affects the distribution of payments: $1,000 to the employee and $500 to the nursing home.\n\n4. **Legal Analysis**:\n   - **Void Assignment**: Since the contract explicitly prohibits assignments, the mother's assignment to the nursing home is invalid. Therefore, the nursing home has no legal right to receive the money based on the assignment.\n   - **Oral Agreement**: The oral agreement between the owner and the employee modifies the original contract terms regarding the distribution of payments. This modification is binding between the owner and the employee but does not affect the nursing home's rights since they were never a party to the original contract or the subsequent oral agreement.\n\nGiven these points, the owner is most likely to prevail because:\n- The mother's assignment to the nursing home is void due to the anti-assignment clause in the contract.\n- The oral agreement between the owner and the employee does not create any obligation for the owner to pay the nursing home more than what was agreed upon in the oral modification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause."
