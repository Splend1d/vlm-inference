This system was known as apartheid, which was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority and other ethnic groups in South Africa. The Sharpeville Massacre was a significant event in the anti-apartheid movement, where police opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing dozens of black South Africans who were protesting against the pass laws, which required black South Africans to carry identity documents at all times."
