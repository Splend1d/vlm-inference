However, Rawls' concept of the original position is more about a hypothetical scenario rather than a practical action.\n\nB. **At any time, by simply following a certain procedure.**\n   - This implies that there is a straightforward method or process to enter the original position at any given moment. While Rawls discusses the original position as a thought experiment, it is not something that can be entered through a specific procedure in real life.\n\nC. **Only if we somehow forget who we are, which is very rare.**\n   - The original position involves a \"veil of ignorance,\" where individuals do not know their place in society, their class position, or even their own personal characteristics. This condition is indeed rare in reality but central to Rawls' theory as a hypothetical state.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - Given the nature of the original position as a theoretical construct, none of the options accurately describe how one can enter it in a literal sense.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the most accurate interpretation aligns with the idea that entering the original position requires forgetting one's identity, which is a rare occurrence in reality. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n**C. Only if we somehow forget who we are, which is very rare.**"
