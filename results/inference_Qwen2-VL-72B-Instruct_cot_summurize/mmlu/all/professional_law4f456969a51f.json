State law provided that if he tried to leave against medical advice, the hospital could hold him for 72 hours while trying to convince him to stay. During the stay, he told his medical providers that he was intensely angry at his wife, who was living with another man, and he wanted to harm her. Despite that knowledge, the hospital issued him an unrestricted weekend pass. When he got out he shot and killed his wife. The man's children sued the hospital for negligence. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss mainly because there was no privity with the decedent and no duty owed to her. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the hospital is strictly liable for releasing patients who it knows or should know represent an unreasonable danger to third persons.\nB. No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\nC. Yes, because there is no duty to control the conduct of another person to prevent that person from harming others.\nD. Yes, because the intervening acts of third parties are unforeseeable and cannot give rise to liability.\n"

No, because the special relationship and the control between doctor and an in-patient mandates due care by the doctor to prevent a foreseeable danger to others.\n\nIn this scenario, the hospital had a special relationship with the patient due to his voluntary admission for treatment related to emotional distress. This special relationship imposes a duty on the hospital to exercise reasonable care to protect third parties from foreseeable harm caused by the patient. Given that the patient expressed a desire to harm his wife, the hospital should have taken appropriate measures to prevent such harm, including potentially not issuing the unrestricted weekend pass. Therefore, the court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on the absence of a duty to the decedent, as the special relationship and foreseeability of harm create a duty of care."
