The number of tosses before a \"5\" appears when tossing a fair die.\n- This is not a binomial random variable because it involves a geometric distribution, which counts the number of trials until the first success occurs. Binomial variables have a fixed number of trials.\n\nB. The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses.\n- This is not a binomial random variable because there are more than two possible outcomes per game (win, tie, loss). Binomial variables require exactly two outcomes per trial.\n\nC. The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.\n- This is not a binomial random variable because the trials are not independent (drawing without replacement changes the probability of drawing a heart on subsequent draws).\n\nD. The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.\n- This is a binomial random variable because:\n  - There is a fixed number of trials (n = 5, the sample size).\n  - Each trial has two possible outcomes (motorist wears a seat belt or does not wear a seat belt).\n  - The probability of success (a motorist not wearing a seat belt) is assumed to be constant across trials.\n  - Trials can be considered independent if the sample size is much smaller than the population size, which is typically the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
