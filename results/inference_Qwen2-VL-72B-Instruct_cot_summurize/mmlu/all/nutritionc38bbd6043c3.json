Glucagon actually decreases the rate of glycolysis by stimulating glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis to increase blood glucose levels.\n\nB. **Glycolysis requires NADP+**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Glycolysis primarily uses NAD+ as an electron acceptor, not NADP+.\n\nC. **In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products**\n   - This statement is correct. During glycolysis, glucose (a six-carbon molecule) is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules, specifically glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).\n\nD. **The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate**\n   - This statement is incorrect. In red blood cells, the end-product of glycolysis is lactate due to the lack of mitochondria for further processing of pyruvate into carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**C. In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products**"
