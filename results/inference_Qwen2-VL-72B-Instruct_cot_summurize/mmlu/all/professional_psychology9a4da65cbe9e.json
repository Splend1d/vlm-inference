Untestable and thus, of uncertain scientific value\n\nAnderson's ACT (Adaptive Control of Thought) theory has been criticized for being difficult to test empirically, which raises questions about its scientific validity and value. While the theory provides a framework for understanding cognitive processes, its abstract nature can make it challenging to design experiments that directly test its predictions."
