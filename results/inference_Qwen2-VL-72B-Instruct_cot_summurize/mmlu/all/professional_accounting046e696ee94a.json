Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nThis statement reflects the relationship between control deviations and potential misstatements. When assessing the tolerable rate of deviations, auditors consider that even if there are deviations from controls, these may not necessarily lead to material misstatements in the financial statements. The rate of misstatements is often lower than the rate of control deviations because other compensating controls or error detection mechanisms might be in place. Therefore, understanding this relationship helps in determining how many deviations can be tolerated without significantly increasing the risk of material misstatement."
