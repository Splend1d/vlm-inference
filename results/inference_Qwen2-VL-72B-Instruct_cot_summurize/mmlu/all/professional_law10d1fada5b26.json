A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

For a claim of IIED to succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, intentionally or recklessly caused severe emotional distress, and that the distress was foreseeable. Given that the friend knew the woman was present and was aware of her excitable nature, it can be argued that the friend should have foreseen the potential for severe emotional distress leading to physical harm such as a miscarriage. Therefore, the woman has grounds to win the case based on the foreseeability and extreme nature of the friend's conduct."
