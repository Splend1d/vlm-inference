However, since our base is not explicitly given as \\(e\\) or \\(10\\), we'll keep it general for now and see if we can simplify further without specifying the base.\n\nNotice that the equation is symmetric with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), which suggests that the graph might be symmetric about the line \\(y = x\\).\n\nLet's take the logarithm of both sides (assuming the same base for simplicity):\n\\[\\log(x^{(\\log y)}) = \\log(y^{\\log x})\\]\nUsing the power rule of logarithms (\\(\\log(a^b) = b\\log(a)\\)), we get:\n\\[(\\log y)\\log x = (\\log x)\\log y\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\\log x \\cdot \\log y = \\log x \\cdot \\log y\\]\n\nThis equation holds true for all positive values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) because it essentially states that two expressions are equal to themselves. This means that any positive value of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfies the original equation, as long as they are both greater than 0 (since logarithms are only defined for positive arguments).\n\nTherefore, the graph of the given equation is the entire open first quadrant, where both \\(x > 0\\) and \\(y > 0\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. the open first quadrant"
