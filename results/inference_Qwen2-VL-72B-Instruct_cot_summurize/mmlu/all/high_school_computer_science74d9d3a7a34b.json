This set includes weights that fall into each of the three pricing categories, as well as weights that are just outside the acceptable range (negative and greater than 20). This will help ensure that the program is able to handle all possible inputs correctly.\nOption A only includes weights that fall into the first two pricing categories, so it may not fully test the program's ability to handle weights in the third category or weights that are outside the acceptable range.\nOption B only includes weights that fall into the first two pricing categories, so it may not fully test the program's ability to handle weights in the third category or weights that are outside the acceptable range.\nOption C includes weights that fall into each of the three pricing categories, but it does not include any weights that are outside the acceptable range. This means that the program may not be fully tested for its ability to handle such inputs."
