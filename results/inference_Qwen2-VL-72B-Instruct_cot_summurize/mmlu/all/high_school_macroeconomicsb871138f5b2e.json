This slowdown leads to a decrease in employment as businesses cut back on hiring or lay off workers due to reduced demand for their products and services. Additionally, inflation tends to be low during this period because the overall demand for goods and services decreases, leading to lower prices. Consumption may also fall, and private investment typically declines as businesses become more cautious about investing in new projects or expanding operations. Household wealth might not necessarily rise during a contraction; in fact, it could decline if asset values such as stocks or real estate fall."
