The contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the total cost per unit.\n\nLet's denote the selling price as SP. The contribution margin (CM) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ CM = SP - Total \\, cost \\, per \\, unit \\]\n\nWe know that the contribution margin should be 20% of the selling price:\n\n\\[ CM = 0.20 \\times SP \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for CM from above:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times SP = SP - 28 \\]\n\nSolving for SP:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times SP = SP - 28 \\]\n\\[ 0.20 \\times SP - SP = -28 \\]\n\\[ -0.80 \\times SP = -28 \\]\n\\[ SP = \\frac{-28}{-0.80} \\]\n\\[ SP = 35 \\]\n\nSo, the target selling price for Duct is $35. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. It seems there might have been an error in the calculation or the options given. Based on the calculations, none of the provided options (A, B, C, or D) match the correct target selling price of $35. Please review the question and ensure all details are accurate."
