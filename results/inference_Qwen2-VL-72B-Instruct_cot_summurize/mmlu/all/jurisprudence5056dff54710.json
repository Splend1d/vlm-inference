According to Nozick, the appropriate level of punishment should be proportional to both the degree of responsibility the offender bears for the act and the severity of the harm that resulted from it.\n\nThis formula reflects Nozick's view that punishment should be commensurate with the wrongdoing and its consequences, rather than being based on other factors such as the potential for rehabilitation or the risk of future offenses."
