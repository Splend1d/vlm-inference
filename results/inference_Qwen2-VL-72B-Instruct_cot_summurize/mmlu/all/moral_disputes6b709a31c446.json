This contrasts with involuntary euthanasia, where the patient's consent is not obtained, and nonvoluntary euthanasia, where the patient is unable to give consent (e.g., due to being unconscious or incapacitated). Passive euthanasia involves withholding or withdrawing treatment necessary to sustain life, whereas active euthanasia involves taking direct action to end a person's life."
