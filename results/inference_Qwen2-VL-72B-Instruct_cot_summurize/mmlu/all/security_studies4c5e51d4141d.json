It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\n\nLiberalism in international relations theory is characterized by its optimism about human nature and the potential for cooperation among states. Liberals believe that international institutions, norms, and regimes can facilitate cooperation and reduce the likelihood of conflict. They also emphasize the importance of economic interdependence and democratic governance in promoting peace and stability. While it may not be the only dominant conception in practice, it has certainly been influential in shaping international policies and institutions."
