For a bill of $\\$60$, the standard tip would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Standard Tip} = 60 \\times 0.15 = \\$9.00 \\]\n\n**Tip by Doubling Sales Tax Calculation:**\n\nThe sales tax is $8.25\\%$. Doubling this percentage gives us $16.5\\%$. To find the tip by doubling the sales tax for a $\\$60$ bill:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tip by Doubling Sales Tax} = 60 \\times 0.165 = \\$9.90 \\]\n\n**Difference Between the Two Tips:**\n\nNow, we subtract the standard tip from the tip calculated by doubling the sales tax to find out by how much it exceeds the standard tip:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Amount} = \\$9.90 - \\$9.00 = \\$0.90 \\]\n\nSince the question asks for the difference in cents, we convert $\\$0.90$ to cents:\n\n\\[ \\$0.90 = 90 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nTherefore, the tip calculated by doubling the sales tax exceeds the standard tip by 90 cents.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 90**."
