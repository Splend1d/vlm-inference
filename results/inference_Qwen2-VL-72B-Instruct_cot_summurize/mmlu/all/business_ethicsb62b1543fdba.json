Minimizing The Influence Of Stakeholder Information On The Firm\n\nA stakeholder orientation typically involves actively considering and managing the interests and impacts on various stakeholders, including generating data about them, assessing the firm's effects on them, and distributing relevant information throughout the organization. Minimizing the influence of stakeholder information would be counter to a stakeholder-oriented approach, as it would involve disregarding or downplaying the importance of stakeholder concerns and impacts."
