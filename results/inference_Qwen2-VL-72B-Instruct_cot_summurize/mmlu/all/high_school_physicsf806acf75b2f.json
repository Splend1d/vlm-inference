Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\n\nThis method utilizes the principle of resonance to determine the wavelength. When the pipe's length matches a multiple of half the wavelength of the sound wave, resonance occurs, amplifying the sound. By measuring the difference in pipe lengths between two consecutive resonances, you effectively measure half the wavelength of the sound wave. This approach is practical because it does not require direct contact with the vibrating string or precise timing measurements, which can be challenging."
