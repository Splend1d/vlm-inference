When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, \"I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. \" On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:\"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. \" The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.\nB. Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.\nC. Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.\nD. An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties, because of mutual mistake of fact.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most accurate statement regarding the art collector's claim against the woman for breach of contract, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Initial Offer (March 15)**: The art collector offered to sell the painting for $10,000 with a 30-day decision period.\n2. **Revocation Attempt (March 25)**: The art collector attempted to withdraw the offer.\n3. **Acceptance (March 27)**: The woman accepted the original offer of $10,000.\n4. **Subsequent Agreement (April 10)**: The parties agreed to a new price of $15,000 with a delivery date of April 15.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Revocation of Offer**: Generally, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance unless there is a specific time limit provided. Here, the offer was made with a 30-day decision period, which means it could not be revoked during that time without the consent of the offeree. The revocation attempt on March 25 was ineffective because it was within the 30-day period.\n  \n- **Acceptance**: The woman's acceptance on March 27 was valid since it occurred within the 30-day period and before the offer was effectively revoked.\n\n- **Subsequent Agreement**: After the valid acceptance of the original offer, a new agreement was reached on April 10 for $15,000. This new agreement modifies the original contract terms but does not negate the existence of the original contract.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**B. Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.**\n\nThis statement correctly reflects that the original offer was validly accepted, and subsequently, the parties entered into a new agreement on April 10, which the woman is bound to honor."
