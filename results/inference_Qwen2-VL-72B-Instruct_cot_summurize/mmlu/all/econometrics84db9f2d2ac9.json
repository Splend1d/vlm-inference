A model that is based on financial theory\n\nModels based on financial theory are more likely to have a higher degree of out-of-sample forecast accuracy because they incorporate fundamental economic principles and relationships that tend to be stable over time. These models are designed to capture the underlying drivers of the phenomena being forecasted, which can improve their predictive power when applied to new data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- B. A model that contains many variables may suffer from overfitting, where it performs well on historical data but poorly on new data due to capturing noise rather than signal.\n- C. A model whose dependent variable has recently exhibited a structural change will likely perform poorly out-of-sample if the model does not account for this change.\n- D. A model that is entirely statistical in nature with no room for judgmental modification of forecasts may lack flexibility to adapt to changing conditions or unforeseen events, potentially reducing its out-of-sample accuracy."
