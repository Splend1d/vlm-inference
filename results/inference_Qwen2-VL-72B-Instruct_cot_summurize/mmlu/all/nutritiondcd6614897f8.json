High nutrient requirements for tissue turnover\n\nIn high-income countries, older adults may face increased risks of vitamin or mineral deficiencies due to factors such as low income affecting their ability to purchase nutrient-rich foods (A), decreased mobility leading to less time spent outdoors and thus reduced vitamin D synthesis from sunlight (B), and age-related changes like decreased intrinsic factor production in the stomach that can impair absorption of certain nutrients like vitamin B12 (C). However, high nutrient requirements for tissue turnover is generally not a reason for increased risk of deficiencies in this population, as nutrient needs often decrease with age due to lower metabolic rates and reduced physical activity."
