An elderly woman, who was worried about her failing health, had heard that the fortuneteller was clairvoyant and could see into the future. Consequently, the woman decided to see the fortuneteller in order to have her Tarot cards read. As the fortuneteller was telling the woman her fortune, she suddenly said, \"I have a vision. If you give me $25,000 tomorrow, you will live to be 100 years old. \" The woman, who was 72 years of age, believed the fortuneteller and gave her the money the next day. The following week, the woman's physician informed her that she had a serious heart disease and he didn't expect her to live for more than a year or two. If the woman asserts a claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, the plaintiff should\n\nA. prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.\nB. prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.\nC. not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.\nD. not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the plaintiff (the elderly woman) should prevail in her claim against the fortuneteller based on deceit, we need to analyze the elements of deceit and the context provided.\n\nDeceit typically involves making a false representation with the intention of inducing reliance upon it, which results in damage to the person relying on the representation.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. **Prevail, because she relied to her detriment on the fortune teller's foretelling.**\n   - This option suggests that the woman relied on the fortuneteller's prediction and suffered a detriment (giving away $25,000). However, mere reliance is not sufficient; the representation must also be false and made with intent to deceive.\n\nB. **Prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.**\n   - This option focuses on the fortuneteller's belief regarding the accuracy of the prediction. If the fortuneteller knew or should have known that the prediction was false, this could constitute deceit. This aligns well with the legal requirement that the misrepresentation must be knowingly false.\n\nC. **Not prevail, unless there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties.**\n   - A fiduciary relationship implies a higher duty of care and trust. While such a relationship might strengthen the case, it is not necessary for a claim of deceit. The absence of a fiduciary relationship does not automatically mean the plaintiff cannot prevail.\n\nD. **Not prevail, unless the fortuneteller warranted the truth as believed.**\n   - This option suggests that the fortuneteller must have believed in the truth of their prediction for the plaintiff to prevail. However, deceit can occur even if the fortuneteller genuinely believed in their prediction but still made a false representation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Prevail, if the fortuneteller did not honestly believe that the woman would live to be 100 years of age.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that deceit requires the fortuneteller to have knowingly made a false representation, which is a key element in proving deceit."
