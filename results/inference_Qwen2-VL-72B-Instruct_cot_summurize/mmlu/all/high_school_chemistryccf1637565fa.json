At least two pi bonds: Ethene has one pi bond between the two carbon atoms, not two. So this option is incorrect.\n\nB. At least four sigma bonds: Ethene has five sigma bonds in total - four sigma bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms (one per hydrogen) and one sigma bond between the two carbon atoms. This makes option B correct.\n\nC. A tetrahedral configuration: Ethene does not have a tetrahedral configuration. The carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized, leading to a trigonal planar geometry around each carbon atom. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Cis-trans isomers: Ethene does not have cis-trans isomers because it only has two substituents (hydrogen atoms) on each carbon, which are identical. For cis-trans isomerism to occur, there must be two different groups attached to each carbon in the double bond. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. At least four sigma bonds"
