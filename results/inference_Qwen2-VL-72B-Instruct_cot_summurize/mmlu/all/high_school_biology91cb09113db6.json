If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD.

There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nWhen the dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution is placed into a beaker of distilled water (which has a concentration of approximately 0 M), there is a concentration gradient where the water concentration is higher outside the bag than inside. Osmosis is the movement of solvent molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. In this case, water will move from the beaker (higher water concentration) into the dialysis bag (lower water concentration), causing the bag to swell in size."
