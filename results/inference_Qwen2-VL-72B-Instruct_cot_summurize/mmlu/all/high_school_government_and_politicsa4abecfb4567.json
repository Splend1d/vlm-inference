It prohibited discrimination in public places and employment and also provided for the integration of schools.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did include enforcement provisions, such as the authority to cut off federal funding to programs that practiced discrimination.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because the \"separate but equal\" principle was overturned by the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, not by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nC. This statement is correct because one of the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the authorization to withhold federal funds from any program that practiced discrimination, including school systems. This provision helped to hasten school desegregation by putting financial pressure on discriminatory institutions.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not involve sending federal troops to every segregated public school in the South. While federal troops were used in specific instances to enforce desegregation, this was not a general provision of the act.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\nC. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems."
