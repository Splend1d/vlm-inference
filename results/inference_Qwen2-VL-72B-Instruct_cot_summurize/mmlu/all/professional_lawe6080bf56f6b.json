Subsequently, the jury returns a verdict for Plaintiff. The day after the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for Plaintiff. One week later, Defendant moves to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with its motion for directed verdict. In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?\n\nA. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.\nB. Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\nC. No, because the court denied the motion for directed verdict rather than reserving ruling.\nD. No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n"

No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, once a final judgment has been entered, the court generally does not have the authority to reconsider or modify the judgment unless there is a specific legal basis for doing so, such as a motion for a new trial or a motion to amend the judgment. Since the court entered judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed, the court would typically lack jurisdiction to consider the motion."
