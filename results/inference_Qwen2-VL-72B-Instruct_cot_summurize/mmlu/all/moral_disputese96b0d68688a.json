The conqueror doesn't understand what makes the conquered community tick.\n- This suggests that the conqueror lacks insight into the cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the conquered community. Without understanding these dynamics, the conqueror may make decisions that undermine the community's stability and cohesion.\n\nB. The conqueror doesn't know what and who within the community is valuable.\n- This implies that the conqueror fails to recognize the key individuals or resources that are crucial for the community's functioning. Ignoring these valuable elements can lead to the erosion of the community's resilience and productivity.\n\nC. The conqueror doesn't know what and who is worthless in community life.\n- This indicates that the conqueror might not be able to distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of the community. Failing to identify and possibly eliminate non-essential elements could result in inefficiencies and misallocation of resources.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that each of these factors contributes to the self-defeating nature of the conqueror role. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer would be:\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nThe conqueror role is self-defeating because the conqueror lacks understanding of the community's dynamics (Option A), fails to recognize valuable elements (Option B), and cannot discern worthless aspects (Option C). Each of these failures can contribute to the eventual downfall of the conqueror's position."
