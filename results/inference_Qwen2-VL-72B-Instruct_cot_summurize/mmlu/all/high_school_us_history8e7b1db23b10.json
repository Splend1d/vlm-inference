We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest.

                    "text": "To determine whether the Underwood-Simmons Tariff of 1913 would be generally endorsed by Progressives of that era, let's analyze the context and the options provided:\n\n1. **Underwood-Simmons Tariff (1913)**: This tariff act was passed under President Woodrow Wilson's administration and aimed to reduce tariffs on imported goods. It was part of Wilson's broader progressive agenda, which included lowering trade barriers to stimulate competition and reduce prices.\n\n2. **Progressive Movement**: The Progressive Era (late 19th century to early 20th century) was characterized by efforts to address social, political, and economic issues through reforms. Progressives sought to regulate big businesses, improve working conditions, and promote social justice.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"Square Deal\"**\n   - The \"Square Deal\" was Theodore Roosevelt's domestic policy agenda, which focused on consumer protection, conservation of natural resources, and control of corporations. While many Progressives supported Roosevelt's policies, the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was not directly related to the \"Square Deal.\"\n\nB. **Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties**\n   - The Underwood-Simmons Tariff was indeed supported by Democrats, including President Woodrow Wilson, who favored lower tariffs as part of his progressive platform. Many Progressives, regardless of party affiliation, aligned with these goals of reducing tariffs to promote fair competition and lower prices.\n\nC. **No, because they were largely supporters of Teddy Roosevelt's \"New Nationalism\"**\n   - The \"New Nationalism\" was another term associated with Theodore Roosevelt's later political philosophy, emphasizing strong federal regulation of the economy. However, this does not directly relate to opposition to the Underwood-Simmons Tariff.\n\nD. **No, because they were largely opponents of Woodrow Wilson**\n   - While some Progressives may have opposed Wilson for various reasons, the specific issue of the Underwood-Simmons Tariff was about economic policy rather than personal opposition to Wilson. Many Progressives supported the tariff reduction as part of broader economic reform.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate reason for Progressives endorsing the Underwood-Simmons Tariff is related to their support for lower duties, which aligns with progressive economic policies.\n\n**Final Answer: B. Yes, because most Democrats advocated lower duties**"
