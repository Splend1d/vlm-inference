In this case, Stark's legal counsel believes it is only \"reasonably possible\" that there will be an unfavorable outcome, which does not meet the criteria for probability. Therefore, Stark should not accrue any amount for the contingent liability.\n\nHowever, since the outcome is reasonably possible and the range of damages can be estimated, Stark should disclose the potential liability in the notes to the financial statements. The disclosure should include the range of possible damages, which is $100,000 to $150,000."
