In-sample forecasting ability is a poor test of model adequacy\n\nIn-sample forecasting refers to using a model to predict values within the same dataset that was used to estimate the model parameters. This approach does not provide a robust test of a model's predictive power because it does not account for how well the model will perform on new, unseen data. A better test of model adequacy involves out-of-sample forecasting, where the model is used to predict values outside the estimation sample, thus providing a more realistic assessment of its forecasting ability."
