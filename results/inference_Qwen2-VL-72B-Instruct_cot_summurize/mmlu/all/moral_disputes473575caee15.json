The question asks us to identify what the \"standard view\" must argue in order to explain the preeminence of controlled use according to Shapiro.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Controlled use is preeminent.\n- This statement simply restates the fact that controlled use is preeminent without providing an explanation for why it is so.\n\nB. Drug laws have no effect on access to illegal drugs.\n- If drug laws have no effect on access to illegal drugs, then the preeminence of controlled use would not be explained by the impact of drug laws. This does not align with explaining the preeminence through the lens of drug laws' effects.\n\nC. Drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs.\n- If drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs, then the preeminence of controlled use could be explained by the idea that fewer people have access to illegal drugs, thus making controlled use more prominent. This seems like a plausible argument from the standard view.\n\nD. Drug laws increase access to illegal drugs.\n- If drug laws increase access to illegal drugs, this would contradict the idea of controlled use being preeminent because it suggests that illegal drug use might become more prevalent. This does not support the preeminence of controlled use.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most logical answer is:\n\nC. Drug laws reduce access to illegal drugs.\n\nThus, the final answer is C."
