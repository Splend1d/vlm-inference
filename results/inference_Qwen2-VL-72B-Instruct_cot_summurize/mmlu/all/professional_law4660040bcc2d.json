One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n"

Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nUnder a strict liability theory, the owner of an animal (in this case, Doug Dogman) is liable for any harm caused by their animal, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. Since Doug's dog, Rover, was chasing cars and caused Ginny to swerve and suffer a head injury, it can be argued that Rover was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries. Therefore, the court is likely to find in favor of Ginny."
