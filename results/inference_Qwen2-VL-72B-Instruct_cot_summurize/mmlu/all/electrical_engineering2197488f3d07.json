The relationship can be expressed by the formula:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{\\epsilon A}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance,\n- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the permittivity of the dielectric,\n- \\( A \\) is the area of the plates, and\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the plates.\n\nFrom this formula, it is clear that a higher permittivity (\\( \\epsilon \\)) results in a higher capacitance (\\( C \\)). Therefore, to obtain a high value of capacitance, the permittivity of the dielectric medium should be high."
