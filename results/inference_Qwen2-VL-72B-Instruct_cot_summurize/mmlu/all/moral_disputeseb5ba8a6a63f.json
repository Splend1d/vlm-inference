                    "text": "To determine why Little suggests thinking about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The fetus gains a more certain claim to the right to life over time.**\n   - This option implies that as the fetus develops, its right to life becomes stronger. While this might be a consideration, it doesn't directly address the complexity of the issue in terms of degrees and layers.\n\nB. **The fetus gains more capacities over time.**\n   - This option suggests that as the fetus develops, it acquires new abilities or characteristics. This could be relevant but still doesn't fully capture the nuanced approach Little seems to advocate.\n\nC. **A gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense.**\n   - This option indicates that the gestating mother's status is complex and multifaceted, suggesting that her role and responsibilities evolve during pregnancy. This aligns with the idea of considering multiple layers and degrees of responsibility and rights.\n\nD. **The gestating mother has different degrees and layers of preferences.**\n   - This option focuses on the mother's preferences, which can vary and change over time. It supports the notion of considering various aspects and complexities involved in the decision-making process regarding abortion.\n\nGiven the context and the need to consider the issue in terms of degrees and layers, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**C. A gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense.**\n\nThis option best captures the complexity and evolving nature of the gestating mother's role and responsibilities, which aligns with the idea of thinking about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers."
