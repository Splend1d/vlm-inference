                    "text": "To determine which statement cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\n- This statement suggests that mathematicians and natural scientists contributed to the field, making it interdisciplinary. This is plausible given the interdisciplinary nature of peace studies.\n\nB. Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\n- This statement implies that journals became important later in the development of peace studies. This is also plausible since academic fields often develop their own specialized journals over time.\n\nC. Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\n- This statement indicates that the early work in peace studies was concentrated in specific regions. This is consistent with historical patterns where certain regions can lead in the development of new academic fields.\n\nD. The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.\n- This statement suggests that research institutes were established globally, which would imply a significant level of institutionalization and international recognition. However, this might not align with the initial development phase when such widespread institutionalization might not have occurred yet.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies is:\n\nD. The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies."
