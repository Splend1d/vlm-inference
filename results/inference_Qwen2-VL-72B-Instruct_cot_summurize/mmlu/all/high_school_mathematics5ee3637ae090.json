Let's denote Glow's volume as G units. Therefore, Bright's volume is $G - (0.25 \\times G) = 0.75G$ units.\n   - Glow has $33\\frac{1}{3}\\%$ more volume than Fresh. This means Glow's volume is $V + (33\\frac{1}{3}\\% \\times V)$. Since $33\\frac{1}{3}\\% = \\frac{1}{3}$, this simplifies to $V + \\frac{1}{3}V = \\frac{4}{3}V$. So, Glow's volume is $\\frac{4}{3}V$ units.\n\nGiven that Bright has $0.75G$ units of volume and Glow has $\\frac{4}{3}V$ units of volume, we can equate these since they refer to the same product (Bright and Glow), just in terms of their respective comparisons:\n\n\\[0.75G = \\frac{4}{3}V\\]\n\nHowever, we don't need to solve for G or V directly because we're interested in the cost per unit of volume for Glow, which we've already calculated as $1.20 per unit of volume.\n\nTherefore, the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is $1.20, which is equivalent to 120 cents.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 120."
