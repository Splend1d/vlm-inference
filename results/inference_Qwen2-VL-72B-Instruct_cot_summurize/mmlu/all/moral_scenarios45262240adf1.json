Tightening one's grip to prevent someone from falling is generally considered a responsible and caring action.\n- Therefore, this scenario does not involve doing something morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I slipped $20 to the judge for a favorable outcome.\"\n- This action involves bribing a judge, which is illegal and unethical. Bribery undermines the integrity of the judicial system and is considered a serious moral and legal violation.\n- Therefore, this scenario involves doing something morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
