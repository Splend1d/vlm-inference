In this case, simply viewing an old pirate ship does not involve any harmful actions or illegal behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"The ladies' flower garden was so beautiful I just had to pick some of them.\"\n- Picking flowers from someone else's garden without permission is typically considered morally wrong because it involves taking something that belongs to someone else without their consent. This action can be seen as theft or vandalism.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
