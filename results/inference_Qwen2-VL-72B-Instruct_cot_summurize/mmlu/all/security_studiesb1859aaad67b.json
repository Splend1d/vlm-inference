Democratization and nationalism inhibits the opportunity for terrorism: nationalism provides the ideological dynamic to unify ethnic differences, and democracy allows for the articulation of grievances in a constructive manner. Within this analysis states with weak democratic and nationalist credentials may provide the conditions that contribute to the development of terrorism.\nB. Terrorism amongst Islamic groups is developed on ethnocentric lines opposed to the secularism that accompanies modernity. It is perhaps ironic that whilst terrorism was organized around the threat to Islamic society in the Middle East, the response to threat has resulted in groups in Europe feeling threatened by Muslim intrusion on Western values.\nC. Capitalist market activities and technological and communication revolutions have increasingly intruded on traditional cultures and societies. Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism.\nD. Non-democratic state structures characterized by a strong centralized system and repressive methods open a space for popular discontent to transform into operational terrorist activities with the intent of ending the political system. Whilst the opportunities for popular participation in liberal democracies prevent popular discontent from being articulated in a negative form.\n"

However, some of the factors that have been identified as contributing to the development of terrorism include:\n\n  * Political, social, and economic grievances: People who feel marginalized, oppressed, or discriminated against may turn to violence as a means of expressing their frustration and seeking redress.\n  * Ideological beliefs: Some individuals or groups may be motivated to engage in terrorism by extremist ideologies, such as religious fundamentalism or political extremism.\n  * Lack of political participation: In some cases, people may turn to terrorism because they feel that they have no other way to make their voices heard or effect change in their society.\n  * Access to resources and training: Terrorist organizations often require resources and training in order to carry out attacks, and these may be provided by sympathetic individuals or governments.\n\nIt is important to note that not all people who experience these factors will become terrorists, and that many other factors can also play a role in the development of terrorism."
