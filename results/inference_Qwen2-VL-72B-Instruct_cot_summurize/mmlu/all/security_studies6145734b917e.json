No, arms control does not serve any purpose outside the realm of traditional military weapons.\nB. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\nC. Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.\nD. Only arms control is unproblematic, deterrence has failed because international cooperation cannot be reached and common rules or practices cannot be established.\n"

Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.\n\nArms control and deterrence strategies have been traditionally applied to nuclear weapons and other conventional military threats. In the context of cybersecurity, while the concept of deterrence can still be relevant (e.g., by increasing the cost and risk of cyber attacks), the verification and monitoring aspects of arms control are significantly more challenging due to the nature of cyber operations. The anonymity and complexity of cyber threats make it difficult to attribute attacks and enforce agreements, thus complicating the application of traditional arms control measures."
