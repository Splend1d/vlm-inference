The person who did the majority of the work, including designing and conducting the study, analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript, is usually listed as the first author. While the faculty advisor may have contributed significantly by providing the original idea and necessary resources, the student's substantial involvement in the actual execution of the research and writing of the paper generally warrants first-author status. It is important for both parties to discuss and agree upon the authorship order before submission to ensure fairness and transparency."
