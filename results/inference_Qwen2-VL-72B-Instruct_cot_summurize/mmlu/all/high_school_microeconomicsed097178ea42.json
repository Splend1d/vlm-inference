Labor demand\n\nIn a monopoly, the marginal revenue (MR) curve lies below the demand curve because the monopolist must lower the price on all units sold in order to sell an additional unit. This relationship is analogous to that of a monopsony, where the marginal factor cost (MFC) curve lies above the labor demand curve. The monopsonist must pay a higher wage to attract an additional worker, which increases the cost of all workers hired at that higher wage rate. Thus, the MFC curve reflects the additional cost of hiring one more unit of labor, just as the MR curve reflects the additional revenue from selling one more unit of output."
