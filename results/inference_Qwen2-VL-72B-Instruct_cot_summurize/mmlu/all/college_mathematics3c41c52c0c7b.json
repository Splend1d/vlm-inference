The number of distinct Abelian groups of order \\( n \\) depends on the prime factorization of \\( n \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n### Option A: \\( n = 4 \\)\nThe prime factorization of 4 is \\( 2^2 \\). The possible structures of Abelian groups of order 4 are:\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\)\n\nThere are exactly two Abelian groups of order 4 up to isomorphism.\n\n### Option B: \\( n = 7 \\)\nThe prime factorization of 7 is \\( 7 \\). Since 7 is a prime number, there is only one Abelian group of order 7:\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\)\n\nThere is exactly one Abelian group of order 7 up to isomorphism.\n\n### Option C: \\( n = 8 \\)\nThe prime factorization of 8 is \\( 2^3 \\). The possible structures of Abelian groups of order 8 are:\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_8 \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\)\n\nThere are three Abelian groups of order 8 up to isomorphism.\n\n### Option D: \\( n = 12 \\)\nThe prime factorization of 12 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\). The possible structures of Abelian groups of order 12 are:\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)\n- \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)\n\nThere are four Abelian groups of order 12 up to isomorphism.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option A: \\( n = 4 \\)**"
