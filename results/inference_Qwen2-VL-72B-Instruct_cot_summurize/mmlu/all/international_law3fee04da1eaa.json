The outcome arising from legal methods, ie arbitration or adjudication by the ICJ, is final and binding upon the parties, whereas this is not the case with diplomatic methods\n\nThis option correctly highlights one of the key differences between political and legal means of dispute settlement. Legal methods such as arbitration or decisions by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) typically result in outcomes that are final and binding on the parties involved. In contrast, political methods, which often involve diplomacy and negotiation, may not necessarily lead to a legally binding resolution."
