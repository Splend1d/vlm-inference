Investment tax credits.\n\nInvestment tax credits are designed to encourage businesses to invest in new equipment, technology, and infrastructure by reducing their tax liability. This increased investment can lead to higher productivity, job creation, and overall economic growth. In contrast, the other options listed (more rapid consumption of natural resources, higher adult illiteracy rates, and a falling stock of capital goods) are generally associated with negative impacts on long-term economic growth."
