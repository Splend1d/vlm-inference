Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:\n\nA. tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.\nB. begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.\nC. begin therapy with her but seek consultation if any problems arise.\nD. begin therapy with her but take special precautions to ensure that client confidentiality is maintained.\n"

In this case, providing therapy to his son's teacher creates a complex situation where there is a potential conflict of interest. This dual relationship could affect both his ability to provide unbiased therapy and his role as a parent. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to inform the teacher that he cannot provide therapy due to these ethical considerations and suggest finding another qualified therapist."
