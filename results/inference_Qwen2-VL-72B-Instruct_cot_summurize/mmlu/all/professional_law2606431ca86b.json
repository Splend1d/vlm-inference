The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant. What is the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n"

Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\nThis option is most appropriate because it directly addresses the issue of the relevance of the earlier lawsuit to the current case. If the purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit is factually different and irrelevant to the current breach of contract claim, moving to strike the separate defense would be a strategic way to remove it from consideration in the current litigation. This motion would argue that the prior lawsuit does not have any bearing on the merits of the current case and should not be considered by the court."
