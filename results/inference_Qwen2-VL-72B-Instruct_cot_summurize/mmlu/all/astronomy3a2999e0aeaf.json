These bands are characterized by alternating regions of rising and falling air, which create the distinct light and dark bands we see when observing Jupiter. The lighter zones are areas where the atmosphere is rising, while the darker belts are regions where the atmosphere is descending. This circulation pattern is influenced by Jupiter's strong internal heat and rapid rotation."
