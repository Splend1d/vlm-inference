The native peoples of the northwest coast did not rely heavily on maize agriculture.\n\nB. **Simple Foragers**: This term typically refers to groups that have a basic subsistence strategy based on hunting, gathering, and fishing without significant surplus or complex social structures. While some indigenous groups might be considered foragers, the term \"simple\" does not accurately describe the sophisticated and resource-rich societies of the northwest coast.\n\nC. **Affluent Foragers**: This term describes societies that have abundant resources and a high standard of living through foraging, fishing, and hunting. The native peoples of the northwest coast, such as the Tlingit, Haida, and Kwakwaka'wakw, are well-known for their rich marine resources, elaborate social structures, and complex cultural practices, fitting this description well.\n\nD. **Conquered by the Aztec**: The Aztec civilization was located in central Mexico and did not have any historical contact or influence over the native peoples of the northwest coast of North America.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate description of the native peoples of the northwest coast of North America is:\n\n**C. Affluent foragers.**"
