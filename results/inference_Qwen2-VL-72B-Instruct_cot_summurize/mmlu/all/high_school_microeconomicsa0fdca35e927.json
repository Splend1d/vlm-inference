A decrease in the price of ice cream, a complimentary good to ice cream cones.\n\nWhen the price of a complementary good (in this case, ice cream) decreases, it becomes more affordable and people tend to buy more of it. Since ice cream cones are often consumed with ice cream, the demand for ice cream cones would also likely increase as people purchase more ice cream."
