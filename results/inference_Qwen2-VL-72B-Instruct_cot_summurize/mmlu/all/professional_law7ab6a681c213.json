The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?\n\nA. Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.\nB. Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\nC. No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.\nD. No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.\n"

Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\n\nIn legal proceedings, experts are often called upon to provide their professional opinions based on the information presented during the trial. This allows them to offer insights and interpretations that can assist the jury in understanding complex or technical aspects of the case. In this scenario, the toxicologist, despite having no prior knowledge of the case, can form an opinion based on the evidence and testimony heard during the trial."
