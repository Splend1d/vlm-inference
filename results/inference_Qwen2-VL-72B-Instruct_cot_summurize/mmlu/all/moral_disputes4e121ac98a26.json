According to Kant, marriage is a unique institution where two individuals enter into a mutual agreement to respect each other's autonomy and dignity. In this context, sexual activity within marriage is seen as morally permissible because it occurs within a framework where both partners have consented to the relationship and recognize each other's full humanity. This mutual recognition and respect prevent either partner from being treated merely as a means to satisfy the other's desires."
