The main character is using the newer milk instead of the expired one, so the friend is not being given something harmful. However, the main character is lying about the milk's freshness, which could be seen as a minor moral lapse due to dishonesty.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character drives home after drinking three bottles of wine at a winery.\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is illegal and poses a significant risk to public safety. This action is clearly morally wrong because it endangers others on the road and violates legal standards.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nThe first scenario involves a minor moral lapse due to dishonesty, while the second scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing due to endangering public safety."
