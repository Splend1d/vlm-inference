Phonemic awareness** in students through the center.\n\nPhonemic awareness involves the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds (phonemes) in spoken words. The activity of matching pictures of objects with pictures of letters to correctly indicate the beginning sound helps students recognize and associate the initial sounds of words with specific letters, which is a key component of phonemic awareness. This foundational skill is crucial for developing reading and spelling abilities."
