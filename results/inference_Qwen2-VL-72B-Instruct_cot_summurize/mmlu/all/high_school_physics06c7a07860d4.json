In a uniform magnetic field, a charged particle like a proton will experience a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force causes the proton to move in a circular path but does not change its speed. Therefore, the proton's speed remains constant at 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s throughout its motion in the magnetic field."
