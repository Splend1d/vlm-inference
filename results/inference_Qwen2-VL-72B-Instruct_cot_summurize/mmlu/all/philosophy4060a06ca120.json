The first step is to identify if there is a moral rule that forbids the action within one's group. If there is such a rule, then the second step is crucial to evaluate whether this rule is a genuine moral rule or not.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **whether it is forbidden by a moral rule of one\u2019s group.**\n   - This corresponds to the first step in Baier's theory, not the second.\n\nB. **whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.**\n   - This directly aligns with the second step in Baier's theory, where one must assess the legitimacy and genuineness of the moral rule identified in the first step.\n\nC. **whether it is forbidden by a law.**\n   - This does not fit into Baier's specific framework for assessing moral permissibility based on moral rules and their genuineness.\n\nD. **whether one can approve of it.**\n   - This is more subjective and does not directly correspond to Baier's structured approach involving moral rules and their evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.**"
