Specifically:\n\n- A smaller confidence level results in a smaller margin of error because you are accepting a higher risk of the interval not containing the true population parameter.\n- A smaller sample standard deviation also leads to a smaller margin of error because it indicates less variability in the data.\n- A smaller sample size increases the margin of error because there is more uncertainty associated with estimates based on fewer observations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. I and II."
