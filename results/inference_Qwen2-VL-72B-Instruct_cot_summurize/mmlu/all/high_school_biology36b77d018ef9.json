For a child to be affected, both parents must be carriers (heterozygous) of the recessive allele.\n- If both parents are carriers (Aa x Aa), the probability of having an affected child (aa) is 25%.\n- This statement can be supported if the pedigree shows that both parents in row II are carriers.\n\n### Option D: The genotype of woman 1 is X-X.\n- Similar to Option A, this statement assumes that X-X indicates a homozygous genotype for a particular trait.\n- Without specific details about the symbols used in the pedigree, we cannot definitively conclude this based on general knowledge alone.\n\nGiven the analysis, **Option C** is the most likely to be supported by the information given in the pedigree, assuming the parents in row II are both carriers of the recessive allele for alkaptonuria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. If parents 1 and 2 in row II have another child, the chance that the child would be afflicted with alkaptonuria is 25%."
