When the husband saw the gun, he jumped on the man and angrily twisted his neck, breaking it and killing him. The husband is guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

The husband's actions result in the death of the other man. To determine the appropriate charge, we need to consider the legal definitions of the crimes listed:\n\n1. **Murder**: This typically involves the intentional or premeditated killing of another person.\n2. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This involves a killing that occurs in the heat of passion, often due to provocation, without prior intent to kill.\n3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This involves a killing that occurs unintentionally but as a result of reckless behavior or negligence.\n4. **No Crime**: This would imply that the husband's actions were legally justified.\n\nGiven the context:\n- The husband did not have prior intent to kill the other man; the killing occurred in the heat of the moment.\n- The husband was provoked by finding his wife with another man, which could be considered a significant provocation.\n- The husband's reaction was immediate and violent, resulting in the death of the other man.\n\nBased on these points, the most fitting charge appears to be:\n\n**B. Voluntary manslaughter.**\n\nThis is because the killing occurred in the heat of passion due to a significant provocation, without prior intent to kill."
