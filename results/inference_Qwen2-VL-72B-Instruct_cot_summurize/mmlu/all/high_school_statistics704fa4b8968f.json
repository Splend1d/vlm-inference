                    "text": "To find the interval that contains the middle 80% of durations for emergency room visits, we need to determine the range within which 80% of the data falls. Since the distribution is normal, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this interval.\n\nThe middle 80% of the data corresponds to the central 80% of the normal distribution curve. This means we are looking for the z-scores that correspond to the 10th percentile and the 90th percentile because these will give us the boundaries that encompass the middle 80%.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that:\n- The z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28.\n- The z-score for the 90th percentile is approximately +1.28.\n\nNow, we convert these z-scores back into actual values using the formula:\n\\[ X = \\mu + Z\\sigma \\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value on the original scale, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, \\(Z\\) is the z-score, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven that the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is 167 minutes and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 76 minutes:\n\nFor the lower boundary (10th percentile):\n\\[ X_{lower} = 167 + (-1.28) \\times 76 \\]\n\\[ X_{lower} = 167 - 97.28 \\]\n\\[ X_{lower} \\approx 69.72 \\]\n\nFor the upper boundary (90th percentile):\n\\[ X_{upper} = 167 + (1.28) \\times 76 \\]\n\\[ X_{upper} = 167 + 97.28 \\]\n\\[ X_{upper} \\approx 264.28 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, the interval containing the middle 80% of durations is approximately 70 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 70 minutes to 264 minutes"
