Since \\(e\\) is approximately 2.718, \\(f(1)\\) is positive.\n\nThe function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers \\(x\\). Its derivative is \\(f'(x) = e^x + 1\\), which is always positive (since \\(e^x > 0\\) for all \\(x\\) and adding 1 keeps it positive). This means \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing.\n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) changes from negative to positive as \\(x\\) goes from 0 to 1, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one point \\(c\\) in \\((0, 1)\\) where \\(f(c) = 0\\). Because \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing, this solution is unique within \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nFor values outside \\([0, 1]\\), consider the limits:\n- As \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), \\(e^x \\to 0\\) and thus \\(f(x) \\to -\\infty\\).\n- As \\(x \\to +\\infty\\), \\(e^x\\) grows much faster than \\(x\\), so \\(f(x) \\to +\\infty\\).\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing and continuous, and considering its behavior at infinity, there cannot be any other real solutions outside \\([0, 1]\\) because the function would have to cross the x-axis again, which contradicts its strictly increasing nature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. k = 1 and n = 0"
