Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.\nB. The technological capacity to wage war with minimal civilian costs has abolished the threat of physical and biological gender victimization. The contemporary gender divide is structured on 'soft' issues associated with socio-economic hardship.\nC. Conflict in warfare and the gender divide between men and women is centred on the historical contract between the individual and the state. The 'right to fight' debate has equal meaning and saliency across the globe, and is universally applicable in all situations.\nD. Nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction have rendered the battlefield gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities. Whilst historically conventional warfare was conducted on the battlefield in which women were particularly vulnerable to violence, and post-conflict sexual violence, these threats no longer exist.\n"

However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while technological capacity to wage war with minimal civilian costs may reduce physical and biological gender victimization, it does not abolish the threat entirely. The contemporary gender divide is still influenced by socio-economic factors.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the \"right to fight\" debate does not have equal meaning and saliency across the globe. Cultural, social, and political contexts vary significantly, affecting how this issue is perceived and addressed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction do not render the battlefield gender-neutral in terms of destructive capabilities. While they pose a significant threat to all individuals, they do not eliminate the specific vulnerabilities and risks faced by women in conflict zones, such as sexual violence and exploitation."
