In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nA. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the couple can prevail on a theory of adverse possession, we need to consider several key elements:\n\n1. **Duration**: The statutory period for adverse possession in the state is 20 years.\n2. **Hostile Possession**: The possession must be hostile, meaning it must be without the permission of the true owner.\n3. **Continuous Possession**: The possession must be continuous and uninterrupted for the entire statutory period.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.**\n   - While they have been on the land for over 20 years, this alone does not guarantee adverse possession. The possession must also be hostile and uninterrupted.\n\nB. **No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.**\n   - Missing tax payments might affect their claim, but it doesn't necessarily disqualify them from adverse possession. The primary issue is whether their possession was hostile and uninterrupted.\n\nC. **No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.**\n   - This is the most critical point. Paying rent to the true owner acknowledges the owner's rights and interrupts the continuity of hostile possession. This interruption resets the clock on the statutory period.\n\nD. **Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.**\n   - Paying taxes is one factor that can support a claim of adverse possession, but it does not alone confer ownership. The key issue here is the interruption caused by paying rent.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.**\n\nThis interruption means that the statutory period did not run continuously for 20 years, thus preventing the couple from prevailing on a theory of adverse possession."
