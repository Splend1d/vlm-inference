The kernel width\n\nThe kernel width (also known as the bandwidth or smoothing parameter) plays a crucial role in determining the flexibility of the model. A smaller kernel width leads to a more flexible model that can capture complex patterns in the data but may also overfit the noise. Conversely, a larger kernel width results in a smoother, less flexible model that may underfit the underlying trend in the data. Therefore, choosing an appropriate kernel width is essential for balancing the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in Kernel Regression."
