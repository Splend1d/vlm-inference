The plaintiff claimed that the defendant drove through a red light and hit her as she was crossing the street. The posted speed limit at the scene of the accident was 25 m. p. h. In his case-in-chief, the defendant testified that the traffic light was green and he was driving carefully at 20 m. p. h. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant. Rather, she called a police officer who testified that the defendant told him immediately after the accident that he was going 30 m. p. h. The police officer's testimony is\n\nA. a prior inconsistent statement and, therefore, admissible to impeach.\nB. hearsay, but admissible as a prior inconsistent statement for any purpose.\nC. admissible, as offered against the defendant.\nD. inadmissible, because the accident report is the best evidence of what the defendant told the police officer.\n"

Under the rules of evidence, statements made by a party to the lawsuit (in this case, the defendant) are generally admissible against that party. This includes statements made to others, such as police officers, about the events in question. Therefore, the police officer's testimony about what the defendant said is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule."
