As the predictor increases, the criterion decreases, and vice versa. This does not necessarily mean the predictor should be eliminated, nor does it imply a mistake in data entry or calculations. It also does not directly indicate that the predictor is uncorrelated with other predictors; it only speaks to its relationship with the criterion variable."
