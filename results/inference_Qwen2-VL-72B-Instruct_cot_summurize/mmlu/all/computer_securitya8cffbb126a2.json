If file descriptors cannot be passed between processes, it might make it difficult for services to establish this communication channel directly. However, they could potentially use other mechanisms like named pipes or shared memory to communicate, so this is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to a database proxy.**\n   - Establishing a TCP connection involves creating a socket and then connecting it to the database proxy. If file descriptors cannot be passed, services would still be able to create their own sockets and connect to the database proxy independently. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- The first statement is false because there are alternative ways for services to communicate with oklogd.\n- The second statement is also false because services can still establish TCP connections independently.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
