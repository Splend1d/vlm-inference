The statement made by the defendant's drinking buddy about the victim having killed five men is hearsay because it is being used to prove that the victim actually committed those killings. For hearsay to be admissible, it must fall under one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. \n\nNeither option A nor B applies here:\n- Option A suggests the statement is admissible to demonstrate its effect on the defendant, but this does not make the statement itself admissible; it only addresses the defendant's state of mind.\n- Option B suggests the statement qualifies under the state of mind exception, which typically allows statements reflecting a person's then-existing mental or emotional condition (e.g., fear, intent) to be admitted. However, the statement about the victim's actions does not directly reflect the defendant's state of mind but rather seeks to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the victim's past actions).\n\nOption D is incorrect because the statement is not self-serving; it is attributed to a third party (the drinking buddy), not the defendant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: the statement is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."
