Hygiene factors can prevent dissatisfaction but do not necessarily motivate employees to perform at their best.\n  \n- **Motivators**: These include achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth. Motivators are intrinsic factors that can lead to higher levels of job satisfaction and increased performance.\n\nIn the scenario described, the employee is pursuing the job solely for the money, which indicates that hygiene factors (like salary) are already meeting their basic needs but are not sufficient to motivate them to perform at a higher level. To increase this worker's self-motivation, it would be more effective to address the motivator factors.\n\nOption B, \"redesign the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment,\" directly addresses the motivator factors by making the job more engaging and fulfilling. This approach aligns with Herzberg's theory by focusing on intrinsic motivators that can lead to higher job satisfaction and improved performance."
