It also involves neglecting the child's well-being and potentially causing significant harm both physically and psychologically.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US, this would be considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I started a forest wild fire and burned some twigs and shrubs.\"\n- Starting a forest fire, even if it only burns twigs and shrubs, can have serious consequences such as spreading uncontrollably, damaging ecosystems, and posing risks to wildlife and human life.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US, starting a forest fire would also be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
