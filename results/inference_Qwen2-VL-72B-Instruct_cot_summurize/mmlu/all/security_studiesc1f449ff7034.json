This definition seems accurate.\n\nB. **Substantive content**: This refers to the specific characteristics and conditions that define security. It involves understanding what it means to be secure and the criteria for achieving security. This definition also appears correct.\n\nC. **Referent object**: This term typically refers to the entity or subject that is being protected or secured. The definition provided here aligns with this concept.\n\nD. **Objective security**: This suggests that security can be determined without subjective interpretation. However, security studies often emphasize that security is inherently subjective and context-dependent, influenced by various interpretations and perceptions. Therefore, defining security as purely objective might not be accurate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the definition that is not correct is:\n\n**D. Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation.**"
