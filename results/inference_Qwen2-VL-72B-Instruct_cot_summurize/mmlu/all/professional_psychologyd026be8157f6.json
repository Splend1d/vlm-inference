By the end of their first year, infants start to lose the ability to distinguish between sounds that are not relevant in their native language. This aligns with the idea that their language-learning ability becomes more focused on the sounds and distinctions present in their environment.\n\nB. **Begin to be sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns**: While this is true for infants, it typically occurs earlier in their development, around 4-6 months of age, rather than during the latter part of their first year.\n\nC. **Begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling**: This is also accurate but pertains more to the beginning stages of their second year rather than the latter part of their first year.\n\nD. **Begin producing more language than they can comprehend**: This is not typical for infants at any stage; usually, children understand more language than they produce.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate description of how children's language-learning ability changes during the latter part of their first year is:\n\n**A. Become less able to perceive sound distinctions not made in their own language**"
