One evening around closing time, the woman took a diamond necklace from a cabinetin the jewelry section of the department store and wrapped it in tissue paper. The woman then surreptitiously stuffed the necklace in a shopping bag, intending to remove it when she left the store. Moments later, the store owner approached the woman and told her she needed to stay late in order to do inventory. While the woman was completing inventory, the owner discovered the necklace and called the police. The woman is most likely guilty of\n\nA. attempted larceny.\nB. larceny.\nC. false pretenses.\nD. embezzlement.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Attempted Larceny (A)**: This involves taking steps towards committing theft but not actually completing the act. In this case, the woman has taken the necklace and hidden it with the intention of leaving the store with it, but she hasn't yet left the store.\n\n2. **Larceny (B)**: This involves the actual theft of property. For larceny to be completed, the person must have taken possession of the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. Since the woman had not yet left the store, she hadn't fully completed the act of theft.\n\n3. **False Pretenses (C)**: This involves obtaining something through deception or misrepresentation. There is no indication that the woman used any deceptive means to obtain the necklace; she simply took it without permission.\n\n4. **Embezzlement (D)**: This involves the fraudulent appropriation of funds placed in one's trust or belonging to one's employer. The woman was an employee, and she took the necklace while working, which could fit under embezzlement if she intended to keep it permanently.\n\nGiven the details provided:\n- The woman took the necklace with the intent to steal it but was caught before she could leave the store.\n- She had not yet completed the act of theft because she hadn't left the premises.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of her actions is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. attempted larceny.**"
