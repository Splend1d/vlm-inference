She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation. She says, \"I know I will die, and this is what I want.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Discharge the patient after she has signed an \"against medical advice\" form\nB. Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian\nC. Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it\nD. Admit to the psychiatric unit\n"

Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it\n\nIn this scenario, the patient appears to have decision-making capacity, as evidenced by her alertness, cooperation, accurate description of her medical history, and understanding of the consequences of refusing insulin. Since there is no evidence of depression or other mental health issues that might impair her judgment, respecting her autonomy is crucial.\n\nHere are some additional considerations:\n\n1. **Documentation**: Ensure that the patient's refusal of treatment is well-documented, including her understanding of the risks and benefits of insulin therapy.\n2. **Consultation**: Consider involving a bioethics committee or ethics consultation to discuss the case and ensure all ethical principles are being respected.\n3. **Support**: Provide emotional support and consider palliative care options to address her comfort and quality of life concerns.\n4. **Legal Advice**: Consult with legal experts to understand the specific legal requirements and protections in place for patients who refuse treatment.\n\nIt's important to balance respect for the patient's autonomy with the need to provide appropriate medical care and support."
