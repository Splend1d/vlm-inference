Both heads attach to the neck of the mandibular condyle and the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to assist in protrusion (protraction) of the mandible, as well as in depression and retraction of the mandible when working bilaterally. It also plays a role in opening the mouth by depressing the mandible."
