This period is characterized by Japan's strict restrictions on foreign contact and trade.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 1749-1945: This range is too broad and extends well beyond the period of Japan's isolation.\nB. 1052-1616: This range is too early and does not align with the historical period of Japan's isolation.\nC. 1641-1853: This range closely matches the period when Japan enforced its isolationist policies, starting from the early 17th century until the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853.\nD. 1517-1870: This range is also too broad and includes periods outside of Japan's isolationist phase.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1641-1853"
