The University considered a student a \"nonresident\" if the student's primary residence was outside the state at any time during the previous school year. Imma Grant transferred from Sunshine State University to Evergreen State in her junior year, and paid nonresident tuition. She filed a declaratory judgment action against the Evergreen Registrar to have her considered a resident and asked for no money damages. Fourteen groups filed amicus briefs in support of Imma, advocating a change in Evergreen's protectionist regulation. Now that she is a senior, and spent the previous year within Evergreen so she is thus now considered a resident student. The federal court should\n\nA. Dismiss the suit as moot.\nB. Dismiss the suit, because Imma lacked standing to sue initially.\nC. Hear the case if it appears that Ms. Grant is diligently prosecuting the matter.\nD. Hear the case due to the amicus interests.\n"

Dismiss the suit as moot.\n\nSince Imma Grant is now considered a resident student after spending the previous year within Evergreen, the issue she originally sued over (being classified as a nonresident) has been resolved. Therefore, the court would likely dismiss the suit as moot because there is no longer an ongoing controversy or dispute to resolve."
