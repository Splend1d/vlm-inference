He emphasized the importance of living a life free from pain and fear, which he believed could be achieved through philosophical contemplation and understanding. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect as Epicurus did not consider philosophy unsuitable for any particular age group. Option C is also incorrect because Epicurus did not view philosophy as unpleasant; rather, he saw it as a means to achieve a happy and fulfilling life."
