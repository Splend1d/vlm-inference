Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Sunflower: Sunflowers were indeed cultivated by various Native American cultures, including those in the Hopewell region.\n\nB. Squash: Squash was also an important crop for many Native American groups, including the Hopewell.\n\nC. Maize (corn): Maize was a staple crop for many Native American cultures, including the Hopewell.\n\nD. Knotweed: Knotweed is not typically associated with ancient agriculture or subsistence farming practices. It is more commonly known as a wild plant rather than a cultivated crop.\n\nGiven this analysis, the crop that was NOT an important component of Hopewell subsistence is:\n\nD. Knotweed"
