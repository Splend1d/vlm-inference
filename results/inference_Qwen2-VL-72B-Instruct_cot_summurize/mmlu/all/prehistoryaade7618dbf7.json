Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved.\n\nNeandertals are better known than other extinct species of premodern humans primarily because their remains have been found in numerous cave sites across Europe and parts of western Asia. These caves provided a protected environment that helped preserve bones and artifacts over tens of thousands of years. Additionally, these sites have often been excavated by archaeologists, leading to a wealth of information about Neandertal life, culture, and biology."
