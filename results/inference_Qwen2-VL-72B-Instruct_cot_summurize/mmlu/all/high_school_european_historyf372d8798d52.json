Instead, it focuses on establishing the king as the supreme head of the Church of England.\n\nB. **A solution to Henry VIII's financial difficulties**: There is no direct reference to financial issues in the passage. The focus is on religious authority and governance.\n\nC. **An attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir**: This option is more plausible. The Act of Supremacy was indeed part of a broader effort by Henry VIII to establish control over the English Church, which included legitimizing his heir. By asserting his authority over the church, Henry aimed to consolidate his power and ensure the legitimacy of his succession.\n\nD. **An attempt to ally England with the Holy Roman Emperor**: The passage does not mention any alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. It is focused on the internal governance of the Church of England.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate inference based on the passage and historical context is:\n\n**C. An attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir**"
