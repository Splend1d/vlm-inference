Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nAuditors typically review subsequent events to ensure that any transactions or events occurring after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements do not materially affect the financial statements. Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end helps identify any such events, such as deposits in transit or outstanding checks, which could impact the financial statements.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not the primary focus of subsequent event procedures:\n\nA. Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year-end but arrived after the year-end is more related to inventory cutoff testing rather than subsequent events.\n\nB. Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate is part of the audit process to assess control risk and does not specifically pertain to subsequent events.\n\nD. Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is useful for understanding trends and changes in the financial position but is not directly related to identifying subsequent events."
