It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia\n\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland, causing it to produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). One of the characteristic features of Graves' disease is ophthalmopathy, which can lead to symptoms such as eye bulging (exophthalmos), redness, swelling, and in some cases, ophthalmoplegia (weakness or paralysis of the muscles that control eye movement). The other options provided are not accurate descriptions of Graves' disease:\n\nB. Graves' disease does not typically cause a large multinodular goitre; rather, it often results in diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.\n\nC. Graves' disease is more common in females than in males.\n\nD. \"Derbyshire Neck\" refers to a historical treatment for tuberculosis, not Graves' disease."
