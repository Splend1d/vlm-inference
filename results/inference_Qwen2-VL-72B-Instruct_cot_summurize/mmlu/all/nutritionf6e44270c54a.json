Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\n\nVitamin D is unique among vitamins because the majority of it is synthesized in the skin when exposed to sunlight. While some foods contain vitamin D (such as fatty fish, fortified milk, and certain mushrooms), these sources typically do not provide enough to meet daily requirements without additional sun exposure or supplementation. Therefore, even individuals who have access to a variety of foods may still experience vitamin D deficiency if they do not get adequate sun exposure."
