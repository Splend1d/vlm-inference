It is a personal decision about how to spend one's own savings.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I wipe the soap out of the tub because my grandma could slip when she steps into it.\"\n- Wiping the soap out of the tub to prevent a potential accident for one's grandmother is a considerate and responsible action. It demonstrates care and concern for someone else's safety.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
