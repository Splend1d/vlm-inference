The results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\n\nThis is because the electoral college system can lead to situations where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most votes nationwide (the popular vote). The electoral college assigns a certain number of electors to each state based on its representation in Congress, and the winner-takes-all principle in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. This can result in a significant difference between the popular vote margin and the electoral vote margin."
