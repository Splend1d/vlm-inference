Both the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are designed to test for serial correlation in time series data. Asymptotically (as the sample size becomes very large), their values should converge.\n\nB. **The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q***:\n   - This statement is incorrect. The Ljung-Box Q* statistic was developed to improve upon the Box-Pierce Q statistic specifically for small-sample situations. Therefore, the Ljung-Box Q* test generally has better small-sample properties compared to the Box-Pierce Q test.\n\nC. **The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples**:\n   - This statement is correct. The Box-Pierce Q test can indeed be oversized for small samples, meaning it may incorrectly reject the null hypothesis more often than it should.\n\nD. **As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients**:\n   - This statement is correct. As the sample size increases, both tests become more powerful and are more likely to detect even small deviations from the null hypothesis, leading to frequent rejections.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\n**B. The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q***"
