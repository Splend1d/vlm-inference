This is because:\n\n- Numbers from 395 to 399 round up to 400.\n- Numbers from 400 to 404 round down to 400.\n\nLet's check each option against this criterion:\n\nA. 382 - This rounds to 380, not 400.\nB. 397 - This rounds to 400.\nC. 406 - This rounds to 410, not 400.\nD. 447 - This rounds to 450, not 400.\n\nTherefore, the only number that could be the actual number of runners at the track meet is B. 397."
