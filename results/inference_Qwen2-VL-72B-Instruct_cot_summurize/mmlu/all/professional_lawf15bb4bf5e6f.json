The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation. He filed a motion to dismiss, relying essentially on proof that he had no intent to steal because he believed in good faith that it was his own property. What will be the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.\nB. The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\nC. The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.\nD. The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.\n"

The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\n\nIn criminal law, the intent to permanently deprive another person of their property is a crucial element of theft or larceny. If the man genuinely believed that the money was rightfully his due to unpaid wages, and there is evidence supporting this belief, then he lacked the requisite intent to steal. This defense could potentially lead to the dismissal of the charges if the court finds that his belief was reasonable and in good faith."
