This radiation is primarily in the form of infrared (IR) radiation, which has longer wavelengths and lower frequencies compared to visible light or ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nSolar radiation, on the other hand, includes a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV), through visible light, to infrared (IR). The majority of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface is in the visible and near-infrared spectrum.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- Terrestrial radiation has longer wavelengths than most solar radiation.\n- Terrestrial radiation has lower frequencies than most solar radiation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
