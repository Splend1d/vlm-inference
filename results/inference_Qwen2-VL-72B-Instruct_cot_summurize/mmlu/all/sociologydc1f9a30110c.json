While some religions do have cultural aspects, this is not a defining characteristic that applies to all the mentioned organizations.\n\nB. **They practice separation of church and state.**\n   - This is not accurate for all the mentioned organizations. For example, the Church of Norway and the Church of Greece are established state churches, meaning they are closely tied with the state rather than being separate from it.\n\nC. **They exclude women as clergy.**\n   - This is also not universally true. The Church of England, for instance, ordains women as priests and bishops, while other organizations may have different policies regarding female clergy.\n\nD. **They are monotheistic.**\n   - All the mentioned religious organizations (the Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece) believe in one God. This makes them monotheistic.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. They are monotheistic.**"
