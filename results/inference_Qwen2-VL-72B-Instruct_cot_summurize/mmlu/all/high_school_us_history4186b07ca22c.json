The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.**\n   - The Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863, not in 1861. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.**\n   - While it is true that Radical Republicans advocated for immediate emancipation, Lincoln did eventually issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which aligned with their goal. This option does not accurately reflect the opposition in 1861.\n\nC. **Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.**\n   - The Ten Percent Plan was proposed by Lincoln in 1863, not in 1861. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\nD. **Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.**\n   - Andrew Johnson was appointed as vice president in 1864, not in 1861. This option is therefore incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the options directly explain why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861. However, if we consider the context and the fact that Radical Republicans were pushing for more aggressive measures against the Confederacy and for stronger civil rights for freed slaves, the closest relevant factor would be related to Lincoln's policies or actions that did not align with their goals. Since none of the provided options correctly address the year 1861, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's timeframe.\n\nIf we had to choose based on the given options and considering the broader context of Radical Republican opposition to Lincoln's policies, the most plausible reason would be related to Lincoln's approach to Reconstruction and civil rights, which often conflicted with the Radical Republicans' more aggressive stance. However, since all options are incorrect regarding the specific year 1861, the question seems to be flawed in its premise."
