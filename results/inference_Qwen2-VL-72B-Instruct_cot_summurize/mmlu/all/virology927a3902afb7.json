According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?\n\nA.

Confounding.\n\nIn this case, smoking is likely a confounding variable because it is associated with both alcohol consumption and lung cancer. When the data is analyzed without considering smoking status, it appears that alcohol consumption is associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). However, when the data is stratified by smoking status (smokers and non-smokers), the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer disappears. This suggests that the apparent association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer was due to the confounding effect of smoking."
