The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?\n\nA. No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.\nB. No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.\nC. Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\nD. Yes, because all repetitive prior statements are important to show the consistency of the witness' testimony.\n"

Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\n\nIn legal proceedings, when a witness's credibility is challenged through impeachment (such as by pointing out prior inconsistent statements), the party that called the witness may attempt to rehabilitate the witness's credibility. This can be done by introducing prior consistent statements made by the witness before the alleged inconsistency arose. These prior consistent statements are admissible for the purpose of rehabilitating the witness's credibility, even though they might otherwise be considered repetitive or cumulative. The rationale behind this exception is to counteract the impeachment and provide context for why the witness's testimony should still be considered reliable."
