Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

                    "text": "The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis is B. Mucosal edema.\n\nSinusitis often results from inflammation and swelling (edema) of the mucous membranes lining the sinuses. This can obstruct the normal drainage of mucus, leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion, clear or purulent discharge, and facial pain or pressure. The patient's symptoms, including nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and tenderness over the maxillary sinus, along with the physical findings of clear fluid behind the tympanic membrane and pain with tapping of the teeth, suggest that there is inflammation and swelling in the sinuses and surrounding areas.\n\nWhile other factors like Eustachian tube dysfunction, nasal polyps, and oral contraceptive use can contribute to sinus issues, they are less likely to be the primary cause based on the presented symptoms and examination findings. Eustachian tube dysfunction typically presents with more prominent ear-related symptoms, nasal polyps would usually show visible masses on examination, and while oral contraceptives can affect hormone levels which might influence mucosal tissues, they are not a common direct cause of acute sinusitis."
