All of these options.\n\nThe USA's strategy for pursuing energy security involves multiple facets:\n\n1. **Deployment of Troops in the Persian Gulf**: This is indeed part of the USA's efforts to maintain influence and control over the oil-rich region, ensuring access to oil supplies and protecting its interests.\n\n2. **Asserting Primacy**: The USA has historically sought to assert its dominance in global affairs, including in regions rich in natural resources like oil. This includes deploying troops and engaging in various interventions to protect its strategic interests.\n\n3. **Stabilizing Friendly Political Actors**: The USA has often supported and stabilized governments in oil-rich countries that are considered friendly to ensure the continuity of oil supply and to maintain a favorable geopolitical environment.\n\nTherefore, all the mentioned options reflect different aspects of the USA's comprehensive approach to securing its energy needs and maintaining its strategic position in the world."
