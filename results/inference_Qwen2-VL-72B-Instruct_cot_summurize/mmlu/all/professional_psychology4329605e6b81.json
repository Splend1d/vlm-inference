When the discrepancy is small, the receiver is more likely to be persuaded because the message is less threatening and easier to accept. Conversely, when the discrepancy is large, the receiver may experience cognitive dissonance or react against the message, reducing the likelihood of persuasion. This principle is known as the \"boomerang effect\" or \"reactance theory,\" where individuals may resist messages that challenge their beliefs too strongly."
