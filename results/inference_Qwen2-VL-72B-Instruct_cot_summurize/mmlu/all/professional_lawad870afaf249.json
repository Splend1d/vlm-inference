This type of behavior falls under the category of theft or larceny.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Larceny**: Larceny generally refers to the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this case, the driver took the gas without intending to pay for it, which fits the definition of larceny.\n\nB. **Larceny by trick**: This involves obtaining possession of another person's property through deceit or trickery. While the driver did not explicitly use deceit or trickery to obtain the gas, the act of driving off without paying could be seen as a form of trickery if the attendant was misled into thinking the driver would pay.\n\nC. **False pretenses**: False pretenses involve obtaining something of value from another person by making a false statement or representation. The driver did not make any explicit false statements to the attendant; he simply asked for the gas and left without paying.\n\nD. **Embezzlement**: Embezzlement involves the fraudulent appropriation of funds placed in one's trust or belonging to one's employer. This does not apply here because the driver was not in a position of trust or employment with the gas station.\n\nGiven these definitions, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**A. Larceny.**\n\nThe driver took the gas without paying for it, which constitutes larceny."
