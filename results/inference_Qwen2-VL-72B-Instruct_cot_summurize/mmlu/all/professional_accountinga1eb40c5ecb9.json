The consignee does not own the goods and is responsible only for selling them on behalf of the consignor.\n\nIn this case, Stone Co. is the consignor for the inventory shipped to Omega Co., and it is the consignee for the inventory received from Gamma Co. Since no sales were made through December 31, year 1, the consigned inventory that should be included in Stone's December 31, year 1 balance sheet is the inventory it has received from Gamma Co., which is valued at $24,000. The freight costs are typically expensed as incurred and do not affect the value of the consigned inventory reported on the balance sheet."
