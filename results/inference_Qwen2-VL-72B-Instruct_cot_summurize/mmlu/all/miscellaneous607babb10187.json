Corporations can issue stocks, which represent ownership in the company, and these stocks can be sold to investors. This allows the corporation to raise capital from a wide range of sources.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. LLC (Limited Liability Company) - Typically used for private businesses where owners do not want to sell shares publicly.\nB. PC (Professional Corporation) - Used by professionals such as doctors, lawyers, or architects, often with restrictions on public share offerings.\nD. LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) - Similar to an LLC but for partnerships, generally not structured for public share offerings.\n\nTherefore, the best choice for their goal is a corporation."
