The period between 1820 and 1854 was marked by significant immigration to the United States. During this time, the largest waves of immigrants came primarily from Europe.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. France\nB. Russia\nC. England\nD. Ireland\n\nWe need to consider which country contributed the most immigrants during this period. Historically, the largest numbers of immigrants during the early to mid-19th century were from Ireland due to the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1852), which led to mass emigration to the United States.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of immigrants to the United States between 1820 and 1854 came from:\n\nD.
