Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

                    "text": "Defining coercive diplomacy success is problematic due to several factors:\n\nA. **Isolation of the Effect**: It is challenging to isolate the specific impact of the threat of force or the limited use of force in a given situation. The effectiveness of coercive measures depends on various factors, including the credibility of the threat, the resolve of the coercing party, and the target's perception of the costs and benefits of compliance versus non-compliance. Determining whether the \"stick\" was sufficient to produce compliance requires careful analysis of these complex interactions.\n\nB. **Independence from Coercion Amount**: Success in coercive diplomacy cannot be solely attributed to the amount of coercion used. While coercion might be necessary to achieve compliance, it is not always sufficient. Other factors such as the legitimacy of the demand, the target's strategic calculus, and external pressures also play crucial roles. Moreover, excessive coercion can lead to counterproductive outcomes, such as increased resistance or escalation.\n\nC. **Protracted Diplomatic Affairs**: In prolonged diplomatic engagements with multiple rounds of negotiations and temporary successes, it becomes difficult to assess overall success. Temporary compliance followed by new acts of non-compliance complicates the evaluation process. From a policy goal perspective, sustained compliance and cessation of undesirable actions are essential for long-term success, making it challenging to declare victory based on short-term achievements.\n\nD. **Cost of Success**: Success in coercive diplomacy can vary significantly in terms of cost. Threats and sanctions might be relatively cheaper compared to the use of limited force, which carries higher risks and costs. However, compliance achieved through limited force might be more durable if it fundamentally alters the target's behavior. Assessing success based solely on the immediate outcome without considering the sustainability and broader implications oversimplifies the issue.\n\nIn summary, defining coercive diplomacy success is problematic because it involves isolating the effects of coercion, accounting for the interplay of various factors, dealing with the complexities of protracted engagements, and balancing the costs and durability of different forms of coercion."
