The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.\n\nThis principle was established by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the 1923 case of S.S. \"Lotus\" (France v. Turkey). It essentially means that states have complete freedom of action unless they are constrained by international law. In other words, if an action is not explicitly forbidden by international law, then it is considered permissible for states to undertake it. This principle has had significant implications for the development of international law and the understanding of state sovereignty."
