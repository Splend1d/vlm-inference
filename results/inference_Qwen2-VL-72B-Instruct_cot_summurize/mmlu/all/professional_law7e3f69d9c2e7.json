The buyer obtained the requisite financing from a bank. At the closing, the buyer executed a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price, which note was not secured by a mortgage. The buyer then executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to the bank, applying the bank loan proceeds to the purchase price of the property. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes. There is no applicable statute. Which party has priority?\n\nA. The bank, because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.\nB. The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.\nC. The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\nD. The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.\n"

                    "text": "The priority between the seller and the bank in this scenario depends on the principles of real estate law, particularly regarding the priority of liens and mortgages.\n\n1. **Financing Contingency**: The fact that the bank's loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale does not directly determine lien priority. It merely indicates that the financing condition of the contract was met.\n\n2. **Purchase Money Mortgage**: A purchase money mortgage typically refers to a mortgage given by the buyer to secure the balance of the purchase price of the property. However, the bank's mortgage was not a purchase money mortgage since it was not given to secure the balance of the purchase price but rather to secure the bank's loan.\n\n3. **Actual Knowledge**: While the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note, this knowledge alone does not necessarily affect lien priority. In many jurisdictions, recording of the mortgage is crucial for establishing priority.\n\n4. **Recording of Mortgages**: The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. Recording is generally critical in determining lien priority. Typically, the first to record their interest (mortgage or lien) has priority over subsequent interests, even if those subsequent interests were known to the first party.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The seller's note was not secured by a mortgage.\n- The bank's mortgage was promptly recorded.\n\nSince the bank's mortgage was recorded, it would generally have priority over the unsecured note held by the seller.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.**\n\n(Note: Although the bank's mortgage was not technically a purchase money mortgage, the principle of recording priority still applies.)"
