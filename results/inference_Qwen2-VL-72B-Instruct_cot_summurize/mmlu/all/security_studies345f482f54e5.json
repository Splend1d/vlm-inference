The different relationship to the concept of security: in Europe the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;' whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation.\nB. The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued. The US is more rationalist, Europe the more reflectivist. In the US security studies debate hypothesis is typically examined as cause-effect relationships, tied into general debates and with measurement of ideational variables.\nC. In the US major competing explanations emphasized, on the one hand, the US's liberal hegemony, and, on the other hand, the purely power based stability of presumed unipolarity in which balancing becomes impossible.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The different relationship to the concept of security: This highlights how European scholars tend to engage in a more self-reflective and critical examination of the concept of security itself, while American scholars often treat it as a given framework within which specific issues are analyzed.\n\nB. The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued: This points out that American security studies tend to favor a more positivist approach, focusing on empirical evidence and causal relationships, whereas European approaches may lean towards a more constructivist or critical perspective, emphasizing the role of ideas, norms, and social constructs.\n\nC. The different geopolitical contexts and theoretical emphases: This reflects the historical and contemporary geopolitical realities that shape security studies in each region. In the US, discussions might focus on its role as a global superpower and the implications of unipolarity, while European debates might be influenced by regional integration, collective security arrangements, and the legacy of World War II.\n\nEach of these factors contributes to the distinct character of security studies in the US and Europe, reflecting not only methodological and epistemological differences but also the unique historical, political, and cultural contexts in which these studies are conducted."
