The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of heat transfer and the concept of specific heat capacity.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the solid (sample) = 25 g\n- Initial temperature of the solid = 100 \u00b0C\n- Mass of water = 100 g\n- Initial temperature of water = 26 \u00b0C\n- Final temperature of the mixture = 37 \u00b0C\n\nWe know that in an isolated system, the total thermal energy remains constant. Therefore, the thermal energy lost by the solid must equal the thermal energy gained by the water.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( c_s \\) as the specific heat capacity of the solid\n- \\( c_w \\) as the specific heat capacity of water (approximately 4.18 J/g\u00b0C)\n\nThe change in temperature for the solid (\\( \\Delta T_s \\)) is:\n\\[ \\Delta T_s = 100 \u00b0C - 37 \u00b0C = 63 \u00b0C \\]\n\nThe change in temperature for the water (\\( \\Delta T_w \\)) is:\n\\[ \\Delta T_w = 37 \u00b0C - 26 \u00b0C = 11 \u00b0C \\]\n\nThe thermal energy lost by the solid (\\( Q_s \\)) is given by:\n\\[ Q_s = m_s \\cdot c_s \\cdot \\Delta T_s \\]\n\\[ Q_s = 25 \\text{ g} \\cdot c_s \\cdot 63 \u00b0C \\]\n\nThe thermal energy gained by the water (\\( Q_w \\)) is given by:\n\\[ Q_w = m_w \\cdot c_w \\cdot \\Delta T_w \\]\n\\[ Q_w = 100 \\text{ g} \\cdot 4.18 \\text{ J/g\u00b0C} \\cdot 11 \u00b0C \\]\n\\[ Q_w = 418 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nSince the system is isolated, \\( Q_s = Q_w \\):\n\\[ 25 \\text{ g} \\cdot c_s \\cdot 63 \u00b0C = 418 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because the thermal energy lost by the sample equals the thermal energy gained by the water due to conservation of energy.\n\nB. \"Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\"\n   - This statement is correct because the thermal energy lost by the sample equals the thermal energy gained by the water.\n\nC. \"The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because the specific heat capacity of the sample cannot be determined solely based on the temperature changes without knowing the actual values of the specific heat capacities.\n\nD. \"The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\"\n   - This statement is irrelevant because it involves concepts not applicable to this scenario. The equilibrium constant is related to chemical reactions, not heat transfer.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained."
