This specialization can indeed only exist in societies that have a food surplus, as it frees up some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities. It also enables sophisticated craft work by allowing individuals to develop expertise and refine their skills in particular trades. Furthermore, specialization of labor is often considered a hallmark of advanced societies or civilizations, where complex social structures and economic systems are present."
