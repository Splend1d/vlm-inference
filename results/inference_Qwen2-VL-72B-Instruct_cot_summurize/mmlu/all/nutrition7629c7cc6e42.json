This is because the body can absorb and utilize these two types of carbohydrates at different rates, allowing for a higher total carbohydrate uptake rate compared to consuming glucose alone. The recommended intake is around 90 grams per hour, which can be achieved by consuming a mix of glucose and fructose. This strategy helps maintain blood glucose levels and provides sustained energy to support performance during extended periods of intense physical activity."
