It is part of competition and striving for excellence.\n- There is no harm done to the other person; they still hold their previous record, and breaking records is a common and expected part of athletic competition.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves doing something clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
