We need to find the probability of rain and sun (\\( P(\\text{Rain and Sun}) \\)).\n\nSince the events \"rain\" and \"sun\" are not mutually exclusive (they can occur together), we can express the total probability of rain as the sum of the probabilities of rain with sun and rain without sun:\n\\[ P(R) = P(\\text{Rain and Sun}) + P(\\text{Rain and No Sun}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[ 0.60 = P(\\text{Rain and Sun}) + 0.30 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{Rain and Sun}) = 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.30.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.3."
