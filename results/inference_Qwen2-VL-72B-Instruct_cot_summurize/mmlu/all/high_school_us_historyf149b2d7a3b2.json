I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nWhich of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\n\nA.

It established a form of self-government but did not specifically encourage church membership.\n\nB. **The Fundamental Orders**: These were adopted by the Connecticut Colony and served as a constitution for the colony. They did not pertain directly to the Massachusetts Bay Colony or encourage church membership.\n\nC. **The Halfway Covenant**: This covenant was adopted by the Puritans in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1662. It allowed the children of baptized but non-member parents to be baptized and become members of the church, thus encouraging broader church membership.\n\nD. **The Cambridge Agreement**: This agreement was made between the Puritan leaders who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It outlined the governance structure of the colony but did not specifically encourage church membership.\n\nGiven this analysis, the document that encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony is:\n\n**C. The Halfway Covenant**"
