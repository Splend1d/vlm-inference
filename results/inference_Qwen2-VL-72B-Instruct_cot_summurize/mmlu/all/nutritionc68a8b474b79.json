Long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, which led to reduced productivity and supply constraints.\nB. The increased use of food crops to produce biofuels, diverting resources away from food production.\nC. Commodity price speculation, where investors bet on rising prices, driving up demand and prices further.\n\nThese combined factors contributed to the significant increase in global food prices during that period."
