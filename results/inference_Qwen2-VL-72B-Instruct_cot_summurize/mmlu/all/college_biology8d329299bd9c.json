Transformation of one segment into another\n\nHomeotic cluster genes, such as those found in the Hox gene family, play crucial roles in specifying the identity of body segments during development. Mutations in these genes can lead to transformations where one segment develops characteristics of another segment, a phenomenon known as homeotic transformation. This is distinct from the other options listed:\n\n- A. Absence of a group of contiguous segments: Homeotic mutations typically do not cause the complete absence of segments but rather their misidentification.\n- C. Polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis: While polarity defects can occur, they are not specific to homeotic gene mutations and usually involve other types of genes.\n- D. Tumor formation in imaginal discs: Homeotic mutations are not directly associated with tumor formation; tumors in Drosophila are more commonly linked to mutations in genes involved in cell cycle control or signaling pathways.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Transformation of one segment into another."
