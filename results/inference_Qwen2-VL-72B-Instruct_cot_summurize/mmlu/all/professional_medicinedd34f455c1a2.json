Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?\n\nA. G0\nB. G1\nC. G2\nD. M\n"

When DNA damage occurs, such as during radiation therapy, p53 can induce cell cycle arrest in G1, allowing time for DNA repair or triggering apoptosis if the damage is irreparable. Inactivation of p53 due to a point mutation would impair this function, leading to defective cell cycle arrest in G1 and allowing cells with damaged DNA to continue through the cell cycle, contributing to tumor progression."
