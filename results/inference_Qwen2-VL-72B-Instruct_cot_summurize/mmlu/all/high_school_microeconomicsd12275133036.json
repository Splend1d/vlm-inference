The average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward.\n\nExplanation: In the short run, capital is considered a fixed input, meaning its quantity cannot be changed quickly in response to changes in production levels. Therefore, an increase in the annual price of capital will raise the fixed costs for the firm. This increase in fixed costs will lead to an upward shift in the average fixed cost (AFC) curve because AFC is calculated as total fixed costs divided by the quantity of output. Consequently, the average total cost (ATC) curve, which includes both fixed and variable costs, will also shift upward due to the higher fixed costs. However, the marginal cost (MC) and average variable cost (AVC) curves, which are primarily influenced by variable inputs like labor, will not be directly affected by the change in the price of capital in the short run."
