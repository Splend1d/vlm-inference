The sentence does not specify any order or grouping, so the simplest and most direct representation would be:\n\n\\[ P \u2228 C \u2228 I \\]\n\nNow let's examine each option:\n\nA. \\( P \u2228 (C \u2228 I) \\)\nThis formula suggests that the restaurant serves pie or (cheesecake or ice cream), but it implies a grouping that isn't necessary based on the original sentence.\n\nB. \\( (P \u2228 C) \u2228 I \\)\nThis formula suggests that the restaurant serves (pie or cheesecake) or ice cream, again implying an unnecessary grouping.\n\nC. \\( P \u2228 C \u2228 I \\)\nThis formula directly represents the sentence without any unnecessary grouping, accurately capturing the idea that the restaurant serves pie, cheesecake, or ice cream.\n\nD. Options A and B\nThis option suggests that either A or B is correct, but both A and B introduce unnecessary groupings that aren't implied by the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is:\n\nC. \\( P \u2228 C \u2228 I \\)"
