This aligns with his broader ethical stance on human dignity and the sanctity of life.\n\n2. **Option B: It threatens identity and individuality.**\n   - Kass has argued that cloning could undermine the uniqueness and individuality of human beings, as it involves creating genetically identical copies. He believes this could lead to a loss of personal identity and individual autonomy.\n\n3. **Option C: It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.**\n   - While Kass does discuss potential biological risks associated with cloning, such as health issues in cloned animals, he does not specifically argue that cloning itself will inherently produce harmful mutations through successive generations of clones. His objections tend to focus more on ethical and philosophical grounds rather than on the specific biological outcomes of cloning over multiple generations.\n\n4. **Option D: It perverts our values concerning parenthood and the raising of children.**\n   - Kass has criticized how cloning could alter traditional concepts of parenthood and family structure. He argues that cloning could lead to a commodification of human reproduction and disrupt the natural bonds between parents and their offspring.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is not an explicit objection made by Kass against cloning is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.**"
