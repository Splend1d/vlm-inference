This type of immunity is typically granted to diplomats, foreign officials, and other representatives of foreign states while they are carrying out their duties.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act\n\nThis means that when an individual performs an act in their official capacity, they are immune from prosecution for that act, which indirectly protects them personally as well."
