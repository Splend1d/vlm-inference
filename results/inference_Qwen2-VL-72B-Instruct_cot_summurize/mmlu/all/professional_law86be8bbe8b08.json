The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.\n\nIn a federal diversity action, where the parties are from different states, the federal court applies the substantive law of the state in which it sits. This means that the federal court must apply the same choice-of-law rules that a state court in the forum state (in this case, State B) would apply. Therefore, the federal court in State B would look to how a state court in State B would resolve the issue of which state's negligence law to apply."
