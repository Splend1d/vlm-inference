And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nUpon the return of Cort\u00e9s's expedition, which of the following was a consequence of the actions described in the memoir?\n\nA.

It focuses more on the distribution of wealth and resources among the soldiers.\n\n2. **Strengthened Agricultural Sector (Option B)**:\n   - There is no mention of agricultural activities or improvements in the agricultural sector in the provided text.\n\n3. **Increased Rate of Inflation (Option C)**:\n   - The memoir mentions the division of gold and the subsequent actions by Cort\u00e9s to collect additional gold from the soldiers. The influx of a large amount of gold into circulation could lead to an increase in prices, which is a characteristic of inflation.\n\n4. **Less Tolerance for Jews and Muslims (Option D)**:\n   - There is no reference to religious tolerance or intolerance towards specific groups like Jews and Muslims in the given text.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most relevant consequence of the actions described in the memoir is related to economic factors, specifically the handling of gold.\n\n**Final Answer: C. An increased rate of inflation**"
