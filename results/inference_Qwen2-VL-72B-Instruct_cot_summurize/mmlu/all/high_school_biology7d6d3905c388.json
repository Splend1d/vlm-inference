Chemiosmosis\n\nChemiosmosis is the process that couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient. This occurs in both mitochondria during cellular respiration and in chloroplasts during photosynthesis."
