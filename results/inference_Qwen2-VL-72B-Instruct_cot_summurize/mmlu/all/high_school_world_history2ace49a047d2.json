It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles \"Diktat\" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.\"\nAdolf Hitler, speech to the Reichstag, September 1, 1939\nSource 2:\n\"We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and the oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\"\nWinston Churchill, speech before Parliament, June 4, 1940\nWhat is the historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1?\n\nA.

It imposed severe penalties on Germany, including the loss of territory, military restrictions, and reparations payments. Many Germans felt that the treaty was unfair and punitive, and this sentiment contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
