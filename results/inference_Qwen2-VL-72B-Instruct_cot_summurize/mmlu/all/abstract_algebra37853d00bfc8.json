Notice that the element 2 appears in both cycles. We combine these cycles into one cycle:\n\\[ p = (1, 2, 5, 4, 3) \\]\n\nNow, \\( p \\) is a single cycle of length 5. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( p^n = e \\) (the identity element). For a cycle of length \\( k \\), the order is \\( k \\).\n\nSince \\( p \\) is a cycle of length 5, its order is 5. This means that \\( p^5 = e \\).\n\nLagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup \\( H \\) of a finite group \\( G \\) divides the order of \\( G \\). In this case, \\( G = S_5 \\), which has \\( 5! = 120 \\) elements. The subgroup generated by \\( p \\), denoted \\( \\langle p \\rangle \\), has order 5 because \\( p \\) has order 5.\n\nThe index of \\( \\langle p \\rangle \\) in \\( S_5 \\) is defined as the number of distinct left cosets of \\( \\langle p \\rangle \\) in \\( S_5 \\), which is equal to \\( |S_5| / |\\langle p \\rangle| \\):\n\\[ \\text{Index} = \\frac{|S_5|}{|\\langle p \\rangle|} = \\frac{120}{5} = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the index of \\( \\langle p \\rangle \\) in \\( S_5 \\) is 24.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 24."
