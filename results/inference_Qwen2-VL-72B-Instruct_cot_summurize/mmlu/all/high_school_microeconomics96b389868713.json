Market failure occurs when the allocation of resources by the market is not efficient, resulting in either underproduction or overproduction of goods and services. This inefficiency can manifest as prices that do not reflect true social costs or benefits, quantities of output that are too low or too high from a societal perspective, or other distortions that prevent the market from achieving an optimal outcome."
