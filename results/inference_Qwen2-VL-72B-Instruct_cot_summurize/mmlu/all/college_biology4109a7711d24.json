Bundle sheath, phloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube\n\nIn the symplastic pathway, sucrose moves through interconnected living cells via plasmodesmata, which are cytoplasmic connections between adjacent plant cells. The pathway typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Mesophyll Cells**: Photosynthesis occurs here, producing sucrose.\n2. **Bundle Sheath Cells**: Sucrose moves from mesophyll cells to bundle sheath cells.\n3. **Phloem Parenchyma**: From bundle sheath cells, sucrose moves to phloem parenchyma cells.\n4. **Companion Cells**: Sucrose then moves to companion cells, which are closely associated with sieve tubes.\n5. **Sieve Tube Elements**: Finally, sucrose is loaded into sieve tube elements for long-distance transport.\n\nThis pathway ensures that sucrose can be efficiently transported throughout the plant."
