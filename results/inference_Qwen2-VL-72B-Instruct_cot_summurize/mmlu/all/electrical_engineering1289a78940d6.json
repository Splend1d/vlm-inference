Zero.\n\nWhen two infinite parallel metal plates are charged with equal surface charge density of the same polarity, the electric fields they produce will be in opposite directions within the gap between them. Since the plates have the same polarity and equal charge density, their individual electric fields will cancel each other out exactly at every point within the gap. Therefore, the net electric field in the gap between the plates is zero."
