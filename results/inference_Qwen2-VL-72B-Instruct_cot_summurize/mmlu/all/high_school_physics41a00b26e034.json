                    "text": "The correct answer is A. ax = 0; ay < g.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Horizontal Acceleration (ax):**\n   - Since there is no friction or air resistance, the only forces acting on the car are due to gravity and the normal force from the incline.\n   - The component of the gravitational force parallel to the incline causes the car to slow down as it moves up the incline.\n   - However, this force does not have a horizontal component because the incline is at an angle \u03b8 to the horizontal. Therefore, the horizontal acceleration \\( a_x \\) is zero.\n\n2. **Vertical Acceleration (ay):**\n   - The vertical component of the gravitational force is \\( mg\\sin(\\theta) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the car and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n   - This vertical component is less than \\( g \\) because \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) is always less than or equal to 1 for any angle \\( \\theta \\).\n   - Thus, the vertical acceleration \\( a_y \\) is less than \\( g \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\nA. ax = 0; ay < g"
