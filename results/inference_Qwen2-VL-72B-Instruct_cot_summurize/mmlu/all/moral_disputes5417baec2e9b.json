Kass argues that reproductive cloning involves an act of despotism because it allows one person (the cloner) to impose their will on another person (the clone) without the latter's consent.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Cloning is inherently morally wrong.**\n   - This statement is a broad moral judgment about cloning but does not specifically address the concept of despotism or the imposition of will.\n\nB. **In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future.**\n   - This directly addresses the idea of despotism by suggesting that cloning involves imposing one's will on another individual's future, which aligns with Kass's argument.\n\nC. **The permissibility of cloning depends on the parent's intent to raise the child.**\n   - This statement focuses on the intent behind cloning and its permissibility, which is more about ethical considerations rather than the specific notion of despotism.\n\nD. **We have a good reason not to clone.**\n   - This is a general statement about having reasons against cloning but does not specify the nature of those reasons in terms of despotism.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that best fits as a premise of Kass's despotism argument is:\n\n**B. In reproductive cloning, one seeks to impose one's will on a child's future.**"
