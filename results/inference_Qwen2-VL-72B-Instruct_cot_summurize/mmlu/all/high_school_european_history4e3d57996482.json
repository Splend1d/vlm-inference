It discusses tolerance and the behavior of Christians but does not explicitly state his stance on atheism.\n\nB. **Tolerance was a value of the Enlightenment**:\n   - The Enlightenment was characterized by values such as reason, individualism, and tolerance. Voltaire's emphasis on mutual forgiveness and the need for tolerance aligns with these Enlightenment ideals.\n\nC. **Voltaire believed tolerance violated the laws of nature**:\n   - The quotation states, \"This is the last law of nature,\" which suggests that tolerance is in accordance with natural laws, not a violation of them.\n\nD. **Voltaire believed tolerance was uniquely English**:\n   - While Voltaire mentions \"Letters on the English Nation,\" he does not explicitly state that tolerance is uniquely English. He uses the example of England to illustrate his point about tolerance but does not limit it to being exclusively English.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate inference is:\n\n**B. Tolerance was a value of the Enlightenment**\n\nThe quotation reflects Voltaire's advocacy for tolerance, which is consistent with the broader values of the Enlightenment period."
