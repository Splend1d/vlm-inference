The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\nB. The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where the owner of a twin home sold one of the lots but did not explicitly reserve the right to use the doorway located on the sold lot. The question revolves around the rights of the owner to continue using the doorway after the sale.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.**\n   - This option suggests that the owner has an implied right to use the doorway due to necessity. However, an exclusive license typically implies permission granted by the owner of the property, which does not seem to fit this context as the buyer now owns the property with the doorway.\n\nB. **The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.**\n   - This option implies that the absence of a reservation in the deed makes it defective and allows the buyer to prevent access. While the deed may not have included a reservation, this does not necessarily mean it is defective or that the buyer can prevent access without considering other legal principles.\n\nC. **The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.**\n   - Courts do not typically draft new deeds or automatically include specific language. This would be an extraordinary measure and is unlikely to occur without a clear legal basis.\n\nD. **The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.**\n   - An implied easement can arise when there is a necessity for continued use of a portion of land that was previously used in conjunction with another parcel. In this case, since the doorway was essential for accessing the owner's residence, an implied easement might be recognized by the court to allow continued use.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the most appropriate decision a court would likely make is:\n\n**D. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the principle that an easement by necessity can be established when there is no reasonable alternative means of access to a property."
