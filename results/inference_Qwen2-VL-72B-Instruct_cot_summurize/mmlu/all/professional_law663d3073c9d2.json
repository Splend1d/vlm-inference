They arranged a meeting to purchase the secrets from an unscrupulous employee of the pharmaceutical company in the company's New York office. The person selling the \"secrets\" was an undercover FBI agent. The envelope that he held, with the word \"Confidential\" typed on the outside of it, contained various recipes and gardening tips. When the defendants turned over the money, they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. Will the federal district court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nB. Yes, factual impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nC. No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nD. No, the defendants were guilty of conspiracy as a matter of law.\n"

No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nIn criminal law, the concept of impossibility can be divided into two types: factual impossibility and legal impossibility. Factual impossibility occurs when the defendant is unable to complete the crime due to circumstances beyond their control (e.g., the target of theft does not actually exist). Legal impossibility occurs when the intended act, even if completed, would not constitute a crime (e.g., attempting to buy a substance that one believes is illegal but is actually legal).\n\nIn the context of conspiracy, the law generally holds that the mere agreement to commit a crime is sufficient for liability, regardless of whether the crime could have been successfully completed. Therefore, even if the defendants believed they were stealing trade secrets but were actually purchasing harmless information, their intent and agreement to commit the crime of stealing trade secrets is enough to sustain a charge of conspiracy.\n\nThus, the federal district court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on the argument of legal impossibility."
