In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will consist of more white matter, while the brains of the rats raised in Group II will consist of more gray matter.\n"

The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that environmental enrichment, such as social interaction and access to toys, can positively impact brain development in animals. Studies have shown that enriched environments can lead to increased brain weight, enhanced neural connectivity, and improved cognitive function compared to animals raised in isolation or impoverished environments. Therefore, it is likely that the rats in Group II, which had social interaction and toys, would exhibit greater brain development and thus heavier forebrains compared to those in Group I."
