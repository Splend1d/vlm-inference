In order to ensure the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant, the state refused to supply electric power to out- of-state purchasers residing in states that would not accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Assume that no federal statute applies. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional?\n\nA. A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\nB. The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\nC. The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n"

The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that states have the authority to regulate activities within their borders to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. By refusing to supply electric power to out-of-state purchasers who do not agree to accept spent fuel for storage or disposal, the state is attempting to ensure that it has available sites for managing the waste generated by its nuclear power plant. This is a legitimate concern given the potential risks associated with nuclear waste and the need for safe and secure storage solutions. Therefore, the state's action can be seen as a rational measure to protect the well-being of its residents."
