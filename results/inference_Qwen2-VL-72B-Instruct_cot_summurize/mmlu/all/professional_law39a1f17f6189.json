The owner told the woman that he was sorry but it was his policy not to cash Social Security checks. Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store. After she left, the owner noticed that the woman had not endorsed the check. The woman has committed which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Attempted robbery.\nD.

                    "text": "The scenario described involves an elderly woman attempting to cash her Social Security check at a convenience store. When the owner refused due to store policy, the woman threatened to detonate a bomb if her request was not met. Although the woman did not actually possess a bomb, the owner, believing the threat, agreed to cash the check. However, the woman did not endorse the check before leaving.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **No crime**: This is incorrect because the woman made a false threat of violence (having a bomb) to obtain money, which constitutes a criminal act.\n\nB. **Robbery**: Robbery typically involves the use of force or intimidation to take property from someone immediately. In this case, the woman did threaten the owner with a bomb, which could be considered intimidation. However, since the owner was not deceived by the threat and the woman did not actually have a bomb, it might not meet the strict legal definition of robbery.\n\nC. **Attempted robbery**: Attempted robbery involves taking steps towards committing robbery but failing to complete the act. Here, the woman attempted to intimidate the owner into giving her money by threatening with a bomb, even though she didn't have one. The owner, knowing the threat was false, still gave her the money. This could be seen as an attempt to commit robbery.\n\nD. **False pretenses**: False pretenses involve obtaining something of value through deception. In this case, the woman used a false threat to get the owner to cash her check. However, since the owner was aware the threat was false, it may not fit neatly under false pretenses either.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting answer would be:\n\n**C. Attempted robbery.**\n\nThis is because the woman attempted to use a threat of violence (the bomb) to obtain money, even though she did not actually have a bomb."
