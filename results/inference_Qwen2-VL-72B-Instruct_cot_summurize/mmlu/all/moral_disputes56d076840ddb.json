This involves respecting the autonomy and dignity of individuals. Promoting the morally permissible ends of others aligns with this principle, as it respects their capacity for rational agency. The goal of self-perfection also aligns with this formulation because it involves developing one's own rational capacities and moral character, which is essential for respecting oneself as an end in itself."
