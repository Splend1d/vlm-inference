Minimizing artificial lighting in the area\n\nHatchling sea turtles rely on natural cues, such as the reflection of moonlight off the ocean, to navigate towards the sea after hatching. Artificial lighting can disorient them, causing them to move inland instead of towards the water. Therefore, minimizing artificial lighting around sea turtle nest sites is the most environmentally sound practice to help ensure that hatchlings orient correctly towards the sea."
