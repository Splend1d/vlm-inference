As a wedding present to the inventor's brother, the inventor wrote on a wedding card she gave to her brother:\"I hereby assign to you 20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production. \"The inventor then borrowed money from creditors and began to promote her automobile engine. She was contacted by a major automobile manufacturer about the possibility of using the engine in a new line of cars the manufacturer intended to release during the next calendar year. While on her way to meet with the representatives of the manufacturer, the inventor was killed in an automobile collision. The manufacturer then contracted with the executor of the inventor's estate to license the use of the automobile engine design for a 10-year period for $500,000, payable to the estate. The creditors from whom the inventor borrowed the money to promote her automobile engine have now attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which have so far been paid into the estate. The brother also asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. In subsequent actions by the creditors and the brother, the court will most probably hold in favor of\n\nA. the brother, because the rights of an assignee are superior to a lien against the assignor subsequently obtained by legallequitable proceedings.\nB. the brother, because any proceeds of the assigned right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee.\nC. the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was unenforceable as a defective assignment.\nD. the creditors, because the rights of creditors/lienors are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.\n"

This is a promise to pay a portion of future earnings, which is generally considered a contractual obligation rather than a transfer of property.\n\n2. **Rights of Creditors**: When the inventor borrowed money from creditors, they had a legal claim to the assets of the inventor, including any future earnings or proceeds from her inventions. Creditors typically have priority over other claims when it comes to the proceeds of an estate, especially if there are outstanding debts.\n\n3. **Attachment of Proceeds**: The creditors have already attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which means they have a legal claim to these funds to satisfy the inventor's debts.\n\n4. **Constructive Trust**: While option B suggests that any proceeds received by the assignor (the inventor) are held in constructive trust for the assignee (the brother), this principle does not apply here because the proceeds were attached by the creditors before they could be distributed according to the assignment.\n\n5. **Defective Assignment**: Option C suggests that the assignment to the brother was unenforceable due to being defective. However, the primary issue here is not the validity of the assignment but the priority of claims between the creditors and the assignee.\n\nGiven these points, the court is more likely to prioritize the claims of the creditors who have a lien on the proceeds over the assignee's claim to a portion of those proceeds. Therefore, the court will most probably hold in favor of the creditors."
