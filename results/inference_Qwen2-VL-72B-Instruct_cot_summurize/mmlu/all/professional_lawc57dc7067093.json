One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the plaintiff (consumer) will prevail in a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, we need to consider several key factors:\n\n1. **Strict Liability in Tort**: Under strict liability in tort, a manufacturer or seller is liable for injuries caused by a defective product, regardless of fault or negligence. This means that the plaintiff does not have to prove that the defendant was negligent; they only need to show that the product was defective and that the defect caused their injury.\n\n2. **Defective Product**: The consumer's brakes failed due to a defect in the brake mechanism. This indicates that the product (the car) had a defect at the time of purchase.\n\n3. **Causation**: The defect in the brake mechanism directly led to the consumer's inability to stop the car, causing the accident and resulting injuries.\n\n4. **Contributory Negligence**: While the consumer sped up and attempted to beat the red light, this behavior does not necessarily negate the claim under strict liability. Contributory negligence might reduce damages but does not bar recovery entirely in many jurisdictions.\n\n5. **Inspection by the Car Dealer**: The fact that the car dealer performed a thorough inspection before the sale does not absolve them of liability if the defect was present and caused the injury. Inspections can sometimes miss defects, especially if they are latent or not easily detectable.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the core issue: the presence of a defect in the brake mechanism at the time of purchase, which led to the failure and subsequent injuries."
