It eventually collapsed due to climate change and drought.\n\nThe analysis of oxygen isotope ratios in the shells of gastropods can provide insights into past climatic conditions. In the context of the Indus Valley Civilization, studies have suggested that a shift towards drier conditions, indicated by changes in these isotopes, contributed to the decline of the civilization. This shift likely led to reduced agricultural productivity and water scarcity, which could have been significant factors in the eventual collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization."
