Genetic enhancement is always morally permissible.\n- This statement is about the moral permissibility of genetic enhancement and does not directly relate to the concept of imagination or the limitations thereof.\n\nB. Nature ought to be honored over personal choice.\n- This statement suggests a preference for natural processes over human intervention but does not specifically address the scope of imagination or the variety of goods people can conceive.\n\nC. Most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited.\n- This statement directly addresses the idea that people have a limited understanding or imagination regarding the different types of goods (benefits or values) that could exist. It implies that our current conceptions might not encompass all possible goods, which aligns well with the notion of a \"lack of imagination.\"\n\nD. We ought to always leave the development of valuable traits up to chance.\n- This statement suggests a reliance on chance rather than deliberate action in developing valuable traits, but it does not directly relate to the limitation of imagination concerning the varieties of goods.\n\nGiven this analysis, the premise that best fits the \"lack of imagination\" argument discussed by Kamm is:\n\nC. Most people's conception of the varieties of goods is limited."
