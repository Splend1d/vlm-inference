This concept suggests that children are born with a biological predisposition to learn any human language. In contrast, B.F. Skinner believed that language acquisition was primarily a result of environmental factors and reinforcement. Therefore, the concept of the Language Acquisition Device is most relevant to the differences between their theories."
