                    "text": "To determine which option best fits the statement \"The biblical account of the soul is at odds with _____,\" let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. **a unitary concept of the soul**: This refers to the idea that the soul is a single, indivisible entity. The biblical account often emphasizes the unity and indivisibility of the soul, so it would not be at odds with this concept.\n\nB. **the identity theory**: This theory posits that mental states are identical to brain states. The biblical account does not delve into such scientific or philosophical distinctions between mind and brain, so it wouldn't necessarily conflict with this theory either.\n\nC. **soul-body dualism**: This is the belief that the soul and body are separate entities. The biblical account, particularly in the Old Testament, often portrays a more holistic view where the soul (nephesh) is closely tied to the physical life and existence rather than being entirely separate from the body. Therefore, the biblical account could be seen as conflicting with strict soul-body dualism.\n\nD. **the idea of a monistic soul**: This suggests that there is only one soul or essence. The biblical account, especially in the New Testament, can sometimes imply a more complex understanding of the human being involving spirit, soul, and body, which might not align perfectly with a purely monistic view.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**C. soul-body dualism**"
