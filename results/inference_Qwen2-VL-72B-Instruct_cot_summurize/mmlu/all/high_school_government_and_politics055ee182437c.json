Allowing states to decide how to meet federally mandated greenhouse gas emissions targets\n\nDevolution refers to the transfer of powers and responsibilities from a central government to regional or local authorities. Option A illustrates this concept, as it involves the federal government setting a goal (greenhouse gas emissions targets) but allowing states the autonomy to determine how they will achieve those goals. This approach gives states flexibility while still ensuring compliance with federal mandates."
