                    "text": "To determine whether Dr. Vasquez's actions are ethical according to the ethics codes published by the American and Canadian Psychological Associations, we need to analyze each option carefully.\n\n**Option A: \"unethical because it violates the prohibition against 'fee splitting.'\"\"\"\n- Fee splitting typically refers to the practice where one professional receives a portion of another professional's fee for referring clients or providing services. However, the specific context here involves different percentages based on the source of the client (existing vs. referred). This distinction might not necessarily constitute traditional fee splitting as defined by the ethics codes.\n\n**Option B: unethical because it creates an unacceptable multiple relationship.**\n- A multiple relationship occurs when a psychologist has more than one type of relationship with a client, which can create conflicts of interest or impair objectivity. In this case, Dr. Vasquez is providing secretarial services and office space to Dr. Banquist, but there is no indication that he is also providing psychological services to Dr. Banquist's clients. Therefore, this does not seem to be a multiple relationship issue.\n\n**Option C: ethical only if the higher fee for referred clients reflects the actual costs associated with the referrals.**\n- This option suggests that the higher fee charged for referred clients could be justified if it accurately reflects additional costs incurred due to the referral process. If Dr. Vasquez incurs extra costs for referring clients (e.g., administrative work, additional time spent), then charging a higher percentage might be considered reasonable.\n\n**Option D: \"ethical because referral fees are prohibited only when they are 'clearly exploitative.'\"\"\"\n- This option implies that referral fees are generally acceptable unless they are exploitative. The term \"exploitative\" would imply that the fees are excessive or take unfair advantage of Dr. Banquist or her clients. Without evidence of exploitation, charging a higher fee for referred clients might be seen as permissible.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer seems to be:\n\n**Option C: ethical only if the higher fee for referred clients reflects the actual costs associated with the referrals.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that the higher fee should be justified by additional costs incurred through the referral process, making it ethically acceptable under those circumstances."
