Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used.\n\nIn animal toxicity studies, higher doses are often used to ensure that any potential harmful effects of a substance are detected within the constraints of using a limited number of animals. This approach allows researchers to identify significant risks at an early stage, even though it may not precisely mimic human exposure levels."
