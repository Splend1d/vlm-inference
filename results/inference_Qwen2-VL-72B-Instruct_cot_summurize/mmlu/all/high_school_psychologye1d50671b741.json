The purpose is to compare the performance of students from different schools.\n\nB. **The psychologist is comparing the same grade in each school.**\n   - This is not a confounding variable because it ensures comparability between the groups being studied. It is a controlled aspect rather than a confounding one.\n\nC. **The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.**\n   - This is a potential confounding variable. Testing at different times of the day could introduce variability due to factors such as students' energy levels, attention spans, or environmental conditions (e.g., noise levels, lighting) which might differ between morning and afternoon sessions.\n\nD. **The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools on the same day.**\n   - This is not a confounding variable because it helps control for day-to-day variations that could affect student performance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best identification of a confounding variable in the psychologist's research is:\n\n**C. The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times.**\n\nThis option highlights a variable that could potentially influence the results independently of the school factor, thereby confounding the comparison."
