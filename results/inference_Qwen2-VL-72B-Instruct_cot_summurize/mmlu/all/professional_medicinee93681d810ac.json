She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\n"

The most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, which is a rare type of ovarian tumor that can produce androgens such as testosterone. This would explain the patient's increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, clitoral enlargement, and elevated serum testosterone concentration. The other options listed (granulosa tumor, ovarian carcinoid, teratoma) do not typically secrete androgens and would not be consistent with the patient's presentation."
