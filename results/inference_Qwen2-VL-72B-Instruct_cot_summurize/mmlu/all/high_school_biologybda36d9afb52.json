Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. Which inference(s) about this population might be true?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which inference(s) about the squirrel population might be true, let's analyze each option based on the given information:\n\n1. **The amount of available food may have increased.**\n   - If there is an increase in the amount of available food, it could support a larger population by reducing competition for resources. This could lead to higher survival rates and thus an increase in the population size.\n\n2. **The number of predators may have decreased.**\n   - A decrease in the number of predators would reduce predation pressure, allowing more squirrels to survive to reproductive age. This could also contribute to an increase in the population size.\n\n3. **The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.**\n   - If more squirrels are surviving to reproductive age due to increased food availability or reduced predation, there would be a broader gene pool contributing to the next generation. This could result in greater genetic variation within the population.\n\nGiven these points, all three options (A, B, and C) seem plausible explanations for the observed increase in the squirrel population from 45 to 80 in a single generation. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**D. A, B, and C**\n\nThis choice encompasses all potential factors that could contribute to the observed increase in the squirrel population."
