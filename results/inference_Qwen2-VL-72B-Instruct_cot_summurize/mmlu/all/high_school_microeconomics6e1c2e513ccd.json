This allows the employer to pay lower wages than in a perfectly competitive labor market, where many employers compete for workers.\n\nWhen a monopsony labor market is transformed into a perfectly competitive labor market, the following changes occur:\n\n1. **Wage Increase**: In a perfectly competitive labor market, wages are determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves for labor. Since there are many employers competing for workers, they must offer higher wages to attract and retain employees. Therefore, the wage rate increases compared to the monopsony situation.\n\n2. **Employment Increase**: With higher wages in a perfectly competitive market, more workers are willing to work (the supply of labor increases). Additionally, because firms now face a higher marginal cost of hiring additional workers, they will hire more workers up to the point where the marginal revenue product equals the new, higher wage rate. Thus, employment also increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Both would increase."
