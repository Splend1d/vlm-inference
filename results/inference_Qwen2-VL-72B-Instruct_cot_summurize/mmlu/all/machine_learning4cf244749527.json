In other words, the set of rectangles must be able to perfectly classify every possible configuration of the points.\n\nFor a set of 5 points in the 2D plane, consider the following:\n\n1. **Non-axis-aligned rectangles**: These rectangles can rotate and translate freely.\n2. **Separation capability**: With enough flexibility, non-axis-aligned rectangles can indeed separate any configuration of 5 points in the plane.\n\nGiven this flexibility, it is possible to find a rectangle that can separate any arbitrary labeling of 5 points. Therefore, the set of all rectangles in the 2D plane can shatter a set of 5 points.\n\n### Statement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThe VC-dimension measures the capacity of a hypothesis space. For the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classifier with \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n1. **Definition**: In a 1-NN classifier, each point is classified based on its nearest neighbor.\n2. **Shattering capability**: Given any finite set of points, a 1-NN classifier can always find a way to separate them by choosing appropriate labels for the points themselves. This is because each point will be its own nearest neighbor, allowing perfect classification for any labeling.\n\nSince the 1-NN classifier can perfectly classify any finite set of points, its VC-dimension is infinite.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
