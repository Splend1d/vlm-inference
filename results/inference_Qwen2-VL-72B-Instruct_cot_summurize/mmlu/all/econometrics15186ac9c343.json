                    "text": "To determine which statements are true concerning information criteria, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(i) **Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion**:\n   - Adjusted R-squared is not considered an information criterion. It is a measure used in regression analysis to assess the goodness of fit of a model while penalizing for the number of predictors. Information criteria like AIC and BIC explicitly incorporate a penalty for model complexity.\n\n(ii) **If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall**:\n   - This statement is generally false. While adding more terms can decrease the residual sum of squares, information criteria also penalize for the number of parameters. Therefore, the overall value of the information criterion might increase if the penalty outweighs the reduction in the residual sum of squares.\n\n(iii) **Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion**:\n   - This statement is true. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) typically selects models with fewer parameters compared to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as Schwarz's criterion, because BIC imposes a stronger penalty for additional parameters.\n\n(iv) **Akaike's information criterion is consistent**:\n   - This statement is false. AIC is not a consistent estimator; it tends to overfit by selecting overly complex models. Consistency in this context means that as the sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter value, which AIC does not guarantee.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only"
