                    "text": "To determine which option has the negative end of the bond written last, we need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms involved in each bond. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself within a chemical bond. The more electronegative atom will have a partial negative charge, while the less electronegative atom will have a partial positive charge.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. O\u2014S\n- Oxygen (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S). Therefore, the negative end of the bond would be on the oxygen atom, and the sulfur atom would have the positive end. So, this option does not have the negative end written last.\n\nB. Br\u2014N\n- Nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than bromine (Br). Therefore, the negative end of the bond would be on the nitrogen atom, and the bromine atom would have the positive end. So, this option does not have the negative end written last.\n\nC. N\u2014C\n- Nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than carbon (C). Therefore, the negative end of the bond would be on the nitrogen atom, and the carbon atom would have the positive end. So, this option does not have the negative end written last.\n\nD. P\u2014Cl\n- Chlorine (Cl) is more electronegative than phosphorus (P). Therefore, the negative end of the bond would be on the chlorine atom, and the phosphorus atom would have the positive end. So, this option has the negative end written last.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. P\u2014Cl."
