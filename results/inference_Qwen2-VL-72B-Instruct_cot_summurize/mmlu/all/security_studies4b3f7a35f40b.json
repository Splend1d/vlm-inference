All of these options.\n\nRealist arguments against humanitarian intervention often face several criticisms:\n\n1. **Assumptions about State Protection**: Critics argue that realists assume all states will protect their citizens, which is not always the case, especially in situations of gross human rights violations or civil war.\n\n2. **Responsibilities of Sovereignty**: The realist position can be criticized for overlooking the responsibilities that come with sovereignty, including the duty to protect one's own citizens from harm.\n\n3. **International Law and Consensus**: Critics point out that realists often ignore the extensive body of international law and the global consensus on issues like genocide and other grave crimes, which provide a legal basis for humanitarian intervention under certain circumstances.\n\nTherefore, all of the provided options highlight valid criticisms of the realist argument against humanitarian intervention."
