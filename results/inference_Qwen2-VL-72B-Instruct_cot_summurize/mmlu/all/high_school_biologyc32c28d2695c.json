Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria.\nC. The similarity of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts is an example of convergent evolution.\nD.

Mitochondria are derived from ancient aerobic bacteria, and chloroplasts are derived from ancient photosynthetic bacteria.\n\nThis hypothesis is supported by the endosymbiotic theory, which posits that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by larger host cells but managed to survive inside them, eventually evolving into organelles within the eukaryotic cells. The similarity in the structure of ATP synthase between these organelles and bacteria supports this theory, as it suggests a shared evolutionary history."
