                    "text": "A developer recently acquired a large vacant lot and wished to build a series of 10 tract homes on the lot to offer for sale. On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?\n\nA. The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\nB. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.\nC. The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n"

To determine the best support for a claim by the contractor against the plumber, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance:**\n   - The plumber submitted a bid to the contractor, which can be considered an offer to perform the plumbing work for $50,000.\n   - The contractor used this bid in preparing his own bid to the developer, which can be seen as an acceptance of the plumber's offer.\n\n2. **Revocation of Offer:**\n   - Generally, an offer can be revoked before it is accepted. However, there are exceptions, such as when the offer is made irrevocable or when reliance has been placed on the offer.\n\n3. **Firm Offer Rule (UCC \u00a7 2-205):**\n   - Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a firm offer made by a merchant to another merchant cannot be revoked within three months if it states that it will be held open or if it is reasonable to induce reliance and the offeree relies on it in good faith.\n\n### Evaluating Each Option:\n\n**A. The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.**\n\n- This statement correctly identifies that the plumber made an offer and the contractor accepted it by incorporating the plumber's bid into his own bid. However, it does not address whether the offer was irrevocable or if reliance was placed on it.\n\n**B. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.**\n\n- This statement invokes the UCC\u2019s firm offer rule. If both parties are merchants, and the plumber's bid was intended to be held open, it would indeed be a firm offer and not revocable. This would support the contractor's claim.\n\n**C. The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.**\n\n- This statement incorrectly frames the transaction. It was the plumber who made the offer (the bid) and the contractor who accepted it by using the bid in his own proposal.\n\n**D. An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.**\n\n- An option contract requires consideration to hold an offer open. While the plumber knew his bid would be used, there is no indication that any additional consideration was provided to create an option contract.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B provides the strongest legal basis for the contractor's claim. By invoking the firm offer rule under the UCC, it establishes that the plumber's bid was irrevocable, and thus the plumber cannot revoke it after the contractor relied on it in good faith.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.**"
