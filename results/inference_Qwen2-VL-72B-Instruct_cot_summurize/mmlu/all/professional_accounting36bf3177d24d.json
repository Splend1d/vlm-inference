Given the standard rules for calculating basis in a partnership when contributing property with liabilities, the correct basis should reflect the net result after accounting for the liability assumption.\n\nGiven the options provided and the standard calculation method, the closest and most logical interpretation based on typical partnership basis calculations would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final Basis} = \\$16,000 + \\$24,000 = \\$40,000 \\]\n\nBut since this option isn't listed, and considering the potential for a misinterpretation or error in the question setup, the closest provided option that aligns with the typical calculation method (though not exactly matching the precise calculation) would be:\n\nC. $26,000\n\nThis choice reflects an attempt to reconcile the basis calculation with the given options, acknowledging the complexity and potential for misinterpretation in the scenario presented."
