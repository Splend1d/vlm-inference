                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the role of ZP3 in the fertilization process and how each experimental observation relates to it.\n\n1. **Understanding the Role of ZP3:**\n   - ZP3 is a glycoprotein present in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs.\n   - Mouse sperm have receptor proteins that specifically bind to ZP3.\n   - This binding triggers the acrosomal reaction in the sperm, which is essential for fertilization.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n   **A. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.**\n   - If antibodies bind to ZP3, they will block the sperm's receptors from binding to ZP3.\n   - This would prevent the acrosomal reaction and thus block fertilization.\n   - Therefore, this observation is expected.\n\n   **B. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.**\n   - If sperm are incubated with purified ZP3, their receptors will bind to the free ZP3.\n   - This will prevent the sperm from binding to ZP3 on the egg's zona pellucida.\n   - Consequently, the acrosomal reaction won't occur, and fertilization will be blocked.\n   - Thus, this observation is also expected.\n\n   **C. Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.**\n   - If antibodies bind to ZP3 on the egg, they will block the sperm's receptors from binding to ZP3.\n   - This will prevent the acrosomal reaction and block fertilization.\n   - Hence, this observation is expected.\n\n   **D. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.**\n   - Sperm receptors specifically bind to ZP3, not ZP2.\n   - Therefore, coating beads with ZP2 should not cause sperm aggregation because the receptors do not recognize ZP2.\n   - This observation is expected as well.\n\nGiven the analysis above, all the experimental observations listed are expected except one. However, upon reevaluation, it appears there might have been an oversight in the initial interpretation of the question. The correct approach should be to identify the observation that does not align with the described mechanism.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- **Option D** suggests that sperm do not aggregate on beads coated with ZP2, which aligns with the specificity of sperm receptors for ZP3. This observation is consistent with the known biology.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.**"
