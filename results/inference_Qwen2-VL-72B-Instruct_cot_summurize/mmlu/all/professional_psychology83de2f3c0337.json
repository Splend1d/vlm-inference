These factors are:\n\n1. **Hygiene Factors**: These include aspects such as salary, working conditions, company policies, and interpersonal relationships. According to the theory, these factors can prevent dissatisfaction but do not necessarily lead to higher levels of motivation or satisfaction.\n\n2. **Motivators**: These include recognition, achievement, responsibility, and personal growth. These factors are believed to be more directly linked to increasing motivation and job satisfaction.\n\nIn this scenario, the company president implemented a financial incentive program, which falls under the category of hygiene factors. The theory suggests that while such measures might address dissatisfaction, they are unlikely to significantly increase motivation or satisfaction on their own. Therefore, the lack of improvement in employee motivation and satisfaction aligns with the predictions of the two-factor theory."
