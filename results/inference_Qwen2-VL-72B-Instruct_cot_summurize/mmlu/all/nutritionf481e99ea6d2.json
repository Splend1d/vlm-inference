BMR is typically measured in a resting state, not necessarily in a comfortable sitting position.\n- B. BMR can be altered in conditions like hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) and hyperthyroidism (high thyroid function), as thyroid hormones play a significant role in metabolic rate.\n- C. This statement is correct because when someone gains weight, part of that weight may be muscle or other metabolically active tissue, which increases BMR.\n- D. BMR can be altered after weight loss, especially if the weight loss includes a significant amount of lean body mass, which can decrease BMR."
