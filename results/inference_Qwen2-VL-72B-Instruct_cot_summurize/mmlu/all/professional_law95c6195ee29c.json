As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?\n\nA. No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.\nB. No, because the city's action was reasonable.\nC. Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because responsible government officials cannot conduct or formulate their decisionmaking processes by means of coin flips.\n"

However, this immunity does not apply when the suit seeks prospective injunctive relief rather than monetary damages. Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment would not necessarily bar the suit if the plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief.\n\n2. **Reasonableness of the City's Action**: The city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the street was made to comply with state highway regulations aimed at ensuring safety. This decision appears to be a reasonable exercise of the city's regulatory authority to maintain public safety.\n\n3. **Equal Protection Clause**: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The plaintiff might argue that the coin flip method used to decide which side of the street would have parking prohibited was arbitrary and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause. However, the coin flip was a neutral method used to make an otherwise difficult decision, and it did not discriminate against any particular group or individual based on a suspect classification.\n\n4. **Coin Flip Decision-Making**: While it may seem unusual to use a coin flip to make a decision affecting businesses, the fact that it was done impartially and without discrimination does not necessarily render the decision unconstitutional. The coin flip was a last resort after the city council could not reach a consensus, and it was applied equally to both sides of the street.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling argument is that the city's action was reasonable and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The use of a coin flip, while unconventional, does not appear to be discriminatory or irrational.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the city's action was reasonable.**"
