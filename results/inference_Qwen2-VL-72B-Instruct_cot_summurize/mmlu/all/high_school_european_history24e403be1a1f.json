Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nBy 1917, which idea in this pamphlet had become a reality in Russia?\n\nA.

This document outlines the principles of communism and the revolutionary goals of the working class (proletariat) against the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class). By 1917, the idea of the violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat had become a reality in Russia with the Bolshevik Revolution led by Vladimir Lenin. This revolution resulted in the establishment of the Soviet Union, a communist state where the working class was theoretically in control of the means of production."
