An additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy.\n\nDuring pregnancy, a woman's energy needs increase to support the growth and development of the fetus. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women consume an additional 340-452 calories per day during the second trimester and an additional 452-510 calories per day during the third trimester. However, these recommendations may vary depending on factors such as the woman's pre-pregnancy weight, age, and activity level. It is important for pregnant women to consult with their healthcare provider to determine their individual nutritional needs."
