This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves lying and potentially defrauding the seller.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character sets up a feast for the rich.\n- This feast is held in front of homeless people.\n\nThis scenario highlights a stark contrast between wealth and poverty but does not inherently involve a direct moral wrongdoing such as harming or deceiving someone. While it may be seen as insensitive or morally questionable due to the juxtaposition of luxury and suffering, it does not necessarily violate ordinary moral standards in the same way that deception or fraud does.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
