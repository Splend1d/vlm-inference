He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhich best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage?\n\nA. Uneasy allies\nB. Comrades-in-arms\nC. Mortal enemies\nD. Distant strangers\n"

Uneasy allies\n\nThe passage describes a situation where the United States and the Soviet Union are working towards a common goal (the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea) but with underlying tensions and strategic concerns. The United States is trying to limit Soviet influence in Korea by proposing a surrender zone along the 38th parallel, indicating a cooperative yet cautious relationship. This suggests that they are allies, but with significant reservations and strategic maneuvering, making \"uneasy allies\" the most appropriate description."
