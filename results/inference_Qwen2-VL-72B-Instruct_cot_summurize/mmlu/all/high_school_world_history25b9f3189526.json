Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe two letters best support which of the following conclusions?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion supported by the two sources, let's analyze each letter:\n\n**Source 1 (King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal):**\n- The letter expresses concern about the practice of seizing and kidnapping Kongolese people, including noblemen and relatives, for sale to Portuguese traders.\n\n**Source 2 (King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo):**\n- This instruction emphasizes the importance of filling ships with goods, including slaves, copper, or ivory, to justify the costs of the expedition.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these analyses:\n\nA. **Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.**\n   - Neither source directly supports this conclusion. Source 1 indicates tension due to the kidnapping of Kongolese people, and Source 2 focuses on trade rather than diplomatic relations.\n\nB. **Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.**\n   - Source 1 mentions that noblemen and relatives were kidnapped and sold to Portuguese traders, supporting this conclusion.\n\nC. **Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.**\n   - Neither source provides evidence of regulation. Source 2 suggests a focus on maximizing profits without mentioning regulatory measures.\n\nD. **Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.**\n   - While Source 2 implies a desire to maximize profits through trade, Source 1 does not provide direct evidence of brisk trade but rather highlights the negative consequences of the trade practices.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most supported conclusion is:\n\n**B. Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.**"
