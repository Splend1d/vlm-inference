He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Carotid duplex ultrasonography\nB. CT scan of the head\nC. EEG\nD. Lumbar puncture\n"

The patient's symptoms of word-finding difficulty, weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg, along with his medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, suggest that he may have had a stroke. A CT scan of the head can help determine if there is any bleeding or damage to the brain tissue, which would confirm the diagnosis of a stroke. Carotid duplex ultrasonography, EEG, and lumbar puncture are not typically used as initial diagnostic tests for stroke."
