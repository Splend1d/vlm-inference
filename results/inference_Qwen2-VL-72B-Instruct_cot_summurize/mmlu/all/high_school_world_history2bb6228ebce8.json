They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico\n"

It did not significantly impact the trade routes between Portugal, China, and Japan as described.\n\nB. **The Portuguese conquest of India**: While significant, the Portuguese conquest of India was part of the broader context of Portuguese exploration and trade, which actually facilitated the trade patterns described in the passage rather than undoing them.\n\nC. **The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate**: The Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (1603-1868) implemented a policy of national seclusion known as sakoku, which severely restricted foreign trade and contact with the outside world. This would directly impact the trade patterns described, as it would limit or halt the Portuguese trade with Japan.\n\nD. **The Spanish conquest of Mexico**: This event had a significant impact on global trade, especially in the Americas and Europe, but it did not directly affect the specific trade routes between Portugal, China, and Japan as described in the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is:\n\n**C. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate**"
