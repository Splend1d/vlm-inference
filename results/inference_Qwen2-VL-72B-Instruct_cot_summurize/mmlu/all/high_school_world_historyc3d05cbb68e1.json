He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhat was the world history event occurring in the stated time frame that caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea?\n\nA. The Crimean War\nB. World War I\nC. World War II\nD. The Seven Years\u2019 War\n"
