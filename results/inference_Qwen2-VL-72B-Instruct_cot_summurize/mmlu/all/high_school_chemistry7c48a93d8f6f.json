According to VSEPR theory, this would result in a trigonal bipyramidal shape, not a tetrahedral shape.\n\n2. **BF3**: This molecule has 3 atoms bonded to the central boron (B) atom and no lone pairs on the central atom. According to VSEPR theory, this results in a trigonal planar shape, not a tetrahedral shape.\n\n3. **CO2**: This molecule has a linear shape due to the double bonds between carbon (C) and each oxygen (O) atom, resulting in two lone pairs on the central carbon atom. It does not have a tetrahedral shape.\n\n4. **CBr4**: This molecule has 4 atoms bonded to the central carbon (C) atom and no lone pairs on the central atom. According to VSEPR theory, this results in a tetrahedral shape.\n\nTherefore, the molecule with a tetrahedral shape is:\n\n**D. CBr4**"
