Therefore, there are \\( 1000 \\times 100 = 100,000 \\) weights.\n- **Biases**: There are 1000 biases, one for each activation in the first hidden layer.\n\n### Second Hidden Layer\n- **Weights**: Each of the 10 activations in the second hidden layer is connected to each of the 1000 activations from the first hidden layer. Therefore, there are \\( 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000 \\) weights.\n- **Biases**: There are 10 biases, one for each activation in the second hidden layer.\n\n### Output Layer\n- **Weights**: The single output node is connected to each of the 10 activations from the second hidden layer. Therefore, there are \\( 1 \\times 10 = 10 \\) weights.\n- **Biases**: There is 1 bias for the output node.\n\nNow, summing up all the weights and biases:\n\n- Weights: \\( 100,000 + 10,000 + 10 = 110,010 \\)\n- Biases: \\( 1000 + 10 + 1 = 1011 \\)\n\nTotal parameters = Weights + Biases = \\( 110,010 + 1011 = 111,021 \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 111021"
