Paget's disease often leads to deformities such as bowing of long bones due to the abnormal bone remodeling process.\n\nB. **Spinal cord compression is a common complication**\n   - False. While spinal cord compression can occur in severe cases, it is not a common complication of Paget's disease.\n\nC. **Heart failure is not a recognized complication**\n   - False. Paget's disease can lead to high blood flow through the affected bones, which can increase the workload on the heart and potentially cause heart failure.\n\nD. **Pathological fractures are not a feature**\n   - False. Pathological fractures are indeed a feature of Paget's disease due to the weakened bone structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature**"
