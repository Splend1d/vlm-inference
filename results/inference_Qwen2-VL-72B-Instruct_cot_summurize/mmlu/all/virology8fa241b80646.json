Seroconverters\n\nSeroconverters are individuals who have been documented to change from being seronegative (testing negative for HIV antibodies) to seropositive (testing positive for HIV antibodies). This transition marks the point at which an individual becomes infected with HIV. Studying seroconverters allows researchers to analyze the entire natural history of HIV/AIDS because they can track the progression of the disease from the moment of infection onward, including the acute phase, the asymptomatic phase, and the development of AIDS."
