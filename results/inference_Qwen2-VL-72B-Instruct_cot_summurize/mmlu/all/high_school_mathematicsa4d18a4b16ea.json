                    "text": "To determine the greatest number of bricks Zoey can buy without having any extra bricks, we need to calculate how many bricks fit into the patio area.\n\nFirst, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the dimensions of the bricks are given in inches, we'll convert the patio dimensions from feet to inches:\n- 12 feet = 12 * 12 inches = 144 inches\n- 10 feet = 10 * 12 inches = 120 inches\n\nThe area of the patio in square inches is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 144 \\text{ inches} \\times 120 \\text{ inches} = 17,280 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nEach brick covers an area of:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ inches} \\times 6 \\text{ inches} = 24 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nTo find out how many bricks fit into the patio area, we divide the total area of the patio by the area covered by one brick:\n\\[ \\frac{17,280 \\text{ square inches}}{24 \\text{ square inches/brick}} = 720 \\text{ bricks} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation only considers the area coverage and not the thickness. Since the bricks have a thickness of 2 inches and the patio needs to be covered with a thickness of one brick, we don't need to adjust our calculation further for thickness because it's already accounted for in the area calculation.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of bricks Zoey can buy without having any extra bricks is 720. This option is not listed among the provided choices (A. 5,760, B. 2,880, C. 2,160, D. 1,440), indicating there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, none of the given options match the correct answer of 720 bricks."
