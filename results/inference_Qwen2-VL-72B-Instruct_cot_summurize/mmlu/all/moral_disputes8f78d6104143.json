While important, it doesn't directly address Hardin's concerns regarding resource management and overpopulation.\n\nB. **Only the richer countries have some moral obligation to make deposits in the world food banks.**\n   - This statement focuses on the moral obligations of richer countries. Hardin might agree with this from a moral standpoint, but his primary concern was more about the sustainability and long-term effects rather than just moral obligations.\n\nC. **It would be subject to the tragedy of the commons.**\n   - This statement aligns closely with Hardin's famous essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" where he discusses how shared resources can be overused and depleted when individuals act in their own self-interest without considering the collective impact. Establishing world food banks could indeed fall into this trap if not managed properly.\n\nD. **We need to go with the idea because we ought not to punish poor people who are caught in an emergency.**\n   - This statement emphasizes compassion for those in need, which is a noble sentiment. However, Hardin's focus was more on the practical and ecological implications of such proposals rather than purely humanitarian reasons.\n\nGiven Hardin's emphasis on the potential for overuse and depletion of shared resources, the most fitting response is:\n\n**C. It would be subject to the tragedy of the commons.**"
