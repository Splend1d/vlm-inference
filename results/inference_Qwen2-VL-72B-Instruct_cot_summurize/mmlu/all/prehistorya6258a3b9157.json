It had a rich history that dates back to around 2500 BCE, which predates the rise of the ancient Egyptian civilization. The Nubians had significant interactions with the Egyptians, including trade, cultural exchanges, and at times, political dominance over Egypt. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the Nubian civilization predated and influenced the development of Egyptian culture."
