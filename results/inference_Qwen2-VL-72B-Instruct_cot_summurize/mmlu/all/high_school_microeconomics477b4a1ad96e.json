This principle states that a consumer maximizes their utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods they consume.\n\nGiven:\n- Price of potato chips = $1\n- Price of onion dip = $2\n- Marginal utility of chips = 12\n- Marginal utility of dip = 30\n\nFirst, calculate the marginal utility per dollar for each good:\n\nFor potato chips:\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Dollar} = \\frac{\\text{Marginal Utility of Chips}}{\\text{Price of Chips}} = \\frac{12}{1} = 12 \\]\n\nFor onion dip:\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Dollar} = \\frac{\\text{Marginal Utility of Dip}}{\\text{Price of Dip}} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\]\n\nSince the marginal utility per dollar for onion dip (15) is greater than that for potato chips (12), Mrs. Johnson is not currently maximizing her utility. To maximize her utility, she should reallocate her spending so that the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Johnson should:\n\nD. Decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods."
