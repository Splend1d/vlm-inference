Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mexican Americans and whites; African Americans\n- This suggests that both Mexican Americans and whites start having sex later than African Americans.\n  \nB. Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites\n- This suggests that Mexican Americans start having sex later than both African Americans and whites.\n  \nC. African Americans; whites and Latinos\n- This suggests that African Americans start having sex later than both whites and Latinos.\n  \nD. Whites; African Americans and Latinos\n- This suggests that whites start having sex later than both African Americans and Latinos.\n\nGiven the context and typical demographic data, it is generally observed that African American males tend to start having sex at an earlier age compared to other groups. Therefore, the correct answer should indicate that African Americans start having sex earlier than others.\n\nThe most appropriate choice based on this reasoning is:\n\nB. Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites\n\nThus, the final answer is B. Mexican Americans; African Americans and whites."
