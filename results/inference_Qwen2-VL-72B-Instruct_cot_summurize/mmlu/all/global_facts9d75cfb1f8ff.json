However, considering potential political tensions or recent events that might affect public opinion, it is less likely that an overwhelming majority (79%) would hold this view.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**Option C: 64%**\n\nThis suggests a majority but not an overwhelming majority, which aligns with typical public opinion trends in international relations."
