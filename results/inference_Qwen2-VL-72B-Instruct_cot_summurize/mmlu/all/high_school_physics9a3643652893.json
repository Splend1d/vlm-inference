The mass of an object is directly proportional to its volume if the density remains constant.\n\nGiven that the original block has dimensions \\( l \\times w \\times h \\), its volume \\( V \\) is:\n\n\\[ V = l \\times w \\times h \\]\n\nIf we have a new block with half the height and twice the length, its dimensions will be \\( 2l \\times w \\times \\frac{h}{2} \\). The volume \\( V' \\) of this new block is:\n\n\\[ V' = 2l \\times w \\times \\frac{h}{2} = l \\times w \\times h \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the new block is the same as the original block. Since the density is assumed to be constant, the mass of the new block will also be the same as the original block. Consequently, the normal force \\( N' \\) exerted by the new block on the table will be the same as the original normal force \\( N \\).\n\nSince both blocks have the same normal force and the coefficient of friction \\( \\mu \\) is a property of the materials in contact and does not change, the frictional force \\( F_f' \\) for the new block will be the same as the original frictional force \\( F_f \\):\n\n\\[ F_f' = \\mu N' = \\mu N = F_f \\]\n\nTherefore, the frictional force experienced by the new block is the same as the original block.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. f"
