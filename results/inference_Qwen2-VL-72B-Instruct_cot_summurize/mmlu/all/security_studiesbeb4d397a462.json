Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.\nB. Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.\nC. Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.\nD. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.\n"

This has led to the emergence of TNC as a distinct phenomenon, characterized by the involvement of actors operating across multiple countries.\n\n2. **Technology**: Advances in technology, particularly in communication and transportation, have facilitated the growth of TNC. Criminals can now operate more efficiently and effectively across borders, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track and apprehend them.\n\n3. **Complexity of Crimes**: TNC often involves sophisticated schemes that require coordination among various actors in different countries. This complexity makes it difficult to address using traditional methods of law enforcement and requires a more integrated and collaborative approach.\n\n4. **Economic Motivation**: TNC is often driven by the pursuit of significant financial gains. This economic motivation leads to the development of elaborate networks and structures that can adapt quickly to changing circumstances.\n\n5. **Involvement of Legitimate Businesses**: As mentioned in option D, TNC can involve legitimate businesses engaging in occasional criminal activities. This blurring of lines between legitimate and illegitimate operations complicates the identification and prosecution of TNC.\n\n6. **Impact on National Security**: TNC poses a threat to national security by undermining the rule of law, corrupting public officials, and destabilizing economies. This has led to a greater recognition of TNC as a serious global issue requiring international cooperation.\n\n7. **New Forms of Crime**: TNC encompasses a wide range of criminal activities, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, cybercrime, and environmental crimes. These new forms of crime require specialized knowledge and resources to combat effectively.\n\n8. **Regulatory Challenges**: The regulatory frameworks in many countries are not equipped to handle the complexities of TNC. This has necessitated the development of new policies and strategies to address this emerging threat.\n\nIn summary, TNC can be regarded as a new concept due to its global reach, technological sophistication, economic motivations, involvement of legitimate businesses, impact on national security, new forms of crime, and the regulatory challenges it presents."
