Gender security is essentially an extension of the way in which we conceptualize the international political system. The analysis of gender security relations has only been made possible by the expansion of the traditional military definition of security in which national security in anarchical international society was the exclusive province of the male.\nB. To study gender security is to focus on the role of adult women in modern warfare, including industries related to warfare, and their inclusion or exclusion from combat roles.\nC. The issue of gender and security is understood as the practical conceptualization of ways in which women have a role in security related issues, and their relative inclusion and exclusion in military conflict and militarization.\nD. The study of gender and of gender security issues is a complex task, and both terms elude a uniform definition. The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'.\n"

The concept of gender security broadens the traditional understanding of security beyond the military sector to encompass human security, which includes aspects such as economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. This approach recognizes that security is not just about the absence of armed conflict but also about the well-being and protection of individuals and communities, taking into account the different experiences and vulnerabilities of men and women."
