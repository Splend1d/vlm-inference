It violates social norms of sensitivity and empathy during a time of mourning.\n\n**Scenario 2: Wrunging the wet salamander**\n- Context: Handling a wet salamander.\n- Action: Wrunging it.\n- Impact: This could potentially harm the salamander if done improperly.\n\nOrdinary moral standards in the US emphasize the humane treatment of animals. If \"wrunging\" implies a harmful or abusive action towards the salamander, it would be considered morally wrong. However, if \"wrunging\" simply means handling it gently to remove excess water without causing harm, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the term \"wrunging\" could imply harm, it is reasonable to consider this action potentially morally wrong unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
