He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided, the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time would be D. Phentolamine.\nPhentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that can be used to treat hypertension and chest pain associated with cocaine use. It works by blocking the effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which are released in response to cocaine use and can cause vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Phentolamine can help to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow to the heart, which may help to alleviate the patient's symptoms.\nCarvedilol and metoprolol are beta-blockers that can also be used to treat hypertension and chest pain, but they may not be as effective in this case since the patient's symptoms are likely due to the effects of cocaine on the sympathetic nervous system. Furosemide is a diuretic that can be used to treat fluid overload and pulmonary edema, but it is not typically used to treat hypertension or chest pain associated with cocaine use."
