Category B agents indeed include food and water security threats and typically cause moderate morbidity.\n\nD. **Category B agents are characterised by high mortality rates and include agents which are difficult to treat medically.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. High mortality rates and difficulty in medical treatment are characteristics of Category A agents, not Category B agents.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.**"
