How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.\nB. The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.\n"

However, the offer to pay for the ambulance and hospital bill is typically excluded as it may be seen as an attempt to settle or mitigate damages, which is generally not admissible to prove liability."
