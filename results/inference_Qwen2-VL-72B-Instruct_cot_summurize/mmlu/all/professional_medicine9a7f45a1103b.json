Pelvic examination shows a 4 x 3-cm, tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus compromising the introital opening. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Administration of intravenous metronidazole\nB. Administration of intravenous penicillin G\nC. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass\nD. Incision and drainage\n"

The description of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that she may have a Bartholin gland abscess, which is a common cause of pain and swelling in the labia. Incision and drainage is the standard treatment for a Bartholin gland abscess, as it allows for the release of pus and provides relief from symptoms. Antibiotics may also be prescribed to treat any underlying infection. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration may be used to confirm the diagnosis or to drain the abscess if it is not easily accessible for incision and drainage. Intravenous antibiotics such as metronidazole or penicillin G may be used if there is evidence of systemic infection or if the patient is immunocompromised."
