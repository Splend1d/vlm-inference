His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Obtain a CT scan of the head\nB. Administer sodium chloride tablets\nC. Administer intravenous fluids\nD. Immerse the patient in an ice water bath\n"

Administer intravenous fluids.\n\nGiven the patient's history of playing football in full uniform on a hot day, along with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and faintness, it is likely that he is experiencing heat-related illness, possibly heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The elevated body temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension further support this diagnosis.\n\nImmediate cooling and rehydration are critical steps in managing heat-related illnesses. Intravenous fluids can help restore hydration and stabilize blood pressure. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath (option D) might also be considered if the patient has signs of heat stroke, which is a medical emergency requiring rapid cooling. However, IV fluids should be initiated immediately to address dehydration and circulatory collapse.\n\nA CT scan of the head (option A) is not indicated at this point because there is no evidence of trauma or neurological deficit that would suggest an intracranial pathology. Sodium chloride tablets (option B) are not typically used in the acute management of heat-related illness; they could potentially worsen dehydration if not accompanied by adequate fluid replacement.\n\nTherefore, the immediate priority is to administer intravenous fluids to address dehydration and circulatory compromise."
