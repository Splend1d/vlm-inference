The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the origin (0, 0) and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the center of the circle (12, -5).\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{144 + 25}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{169}\\]\n\\[d = 13\\]\n\nSubtracting the radius from this distance gives us the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\\[13 - 3 = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10 units, which corresponds to option A."
