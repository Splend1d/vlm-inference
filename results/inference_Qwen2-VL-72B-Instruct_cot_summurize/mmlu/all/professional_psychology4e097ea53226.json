In this case, the woman cannot remember events that occurred after the traumatic event (sexual assault), which fits the definition of anterograde amnesia.\n\nLet's briefly analyze each option:\n\nA. This describes retrograde amnesia, where the individual cannot remember events that occurred before the traumatic event (the car accident).\n\nB. This is an example of anterograde amnesia, as the woman cannot recall events that happened after the traumatic event (the sexual assault).\n\nC. This describes interference in learning a new language due to previously learned material, not amnesia.\n\nD. This describes source amnesia, where the individual remembers the information but not the source of acquiring it, not anterograde amnesia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
