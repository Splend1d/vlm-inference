Emphysema is a lung disease characterized by the destruction of alveoli in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing. It does not directly cause hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver).\n\nB. The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium: This statement is incorrect. The liver is located primarily in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, so it would enlarge downwards from the right hypochondrium, not the left.\n\nC. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause: This statement is true. Jaundice, spider naevi (spider-like blood vessels on the skin), and purpura (bruising) can be signs of chronic liver disease, which can be caused by long-term alcohol abuse.\n\nD. The liver is usually resonant to percussion: This statement is incorrect. Normally, the liver is dull to percussion, not resonant. Resonance is typically associated with air-filled structures like the lungs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause."
