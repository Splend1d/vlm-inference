One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\n\nA. Strict scrutiny, since drug users are a special class of persons often discriminated against by the public.\nB. Intermediate scrutiny, because, like gender, this can be a sensitive area where discrimination is common.\nC. The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n"

                    "text": "The regulation described in the question involves a restriction on employment based on criminal history and ongoing treatment for drug abuse. To determine which test of constitutional validity would be applied to this regulation, we need to consider the nature of the classification involved and the level of scrutiny typically applied to such classifications.\n\n1. **Strict Scrutiny**: This is applied when a law discriminates based on race, national origin, or alienage. It requires the government to show that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. Drug users are not considered a suspect class under strict scrutiny standards.\n\n2. **Intermediate Scrutiny**: This is used for laws that discriminate based on gender or involve quasi-suspect classes. While drug use might be a sensitive issue, it does not fall into the category of quasi-suspect classifications that trigger intermediate scrutiny.\n\n3. **Rational Basis Test**: This is the least stringent standard of review and applies to most economic and social regulations. Under this test, the law must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. In this case, the regulation aims to protect public safety by preventing individuals with a history of drug-related issues from working in certain state-run facilities.\n\nGiven these considerations, the regulation would most likely be subject to the rational basis test because it is related to a legitimate state interest (public safety) and does not involve a suspect or quasi-suspect classification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.**"
