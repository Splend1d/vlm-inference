The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n"

A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus.\n\nAlgal blooms are often fueled by an excess of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, which can originate from agricultural runoff containing chemical fertilizers. These nutrients stimulate the rapid growth of phytoplankton, leading to algal blooms. When these algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen, creating hypoxic or \"dead\" zones where aquatic life cannot survive due to the lack of oxygen. This scenario aligns with the description provided for the seasonal dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico."
