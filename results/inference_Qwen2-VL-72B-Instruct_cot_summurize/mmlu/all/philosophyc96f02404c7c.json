He believed that ethical knowledge should be based on careful study of human behavior and the conditions under which people flourish. This suggests that Aristotle viewed his theory of the virtues as an ongoing process of inquiry and refinement rather than a fixed set of principles. Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of Aristotle's view on his theory of the virtues."
