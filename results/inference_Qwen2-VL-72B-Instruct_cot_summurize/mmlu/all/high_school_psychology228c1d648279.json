This method gradually exposes the individual to the feared stimulus (in this case, airplanes and flying) while using relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety. Psychoanalysis, humanistic therapy, and existential therapy typically involve different approaches and do not focus on such structured exposure and relaxation exercises."
