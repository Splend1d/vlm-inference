As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40000.\n\nWhen a company discovers that it has failed to record depreciation in a prior period, it should correct this error by adjusting the accumulated depreciation account directly. This is because depreciation is a non-cash expense that affects the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet over time. Since the error relates to a prior period and the tax effect has already been accounted for in the tax return, the correction should be made to the financial statements without affecting the income statement for the current period.\n\nTherefore, Holt Co. should report the correction as an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40000, which will reduce the net book value of the building on the balance sheet to reflect the correct amount of depreciation that should have been recorded."
