Adolescents often adapt more quickly to new cultures and environments than adults, which can lead to generational and cultural gaps within the family. This can result in misunderstandings, conflicts, and challenges in communication as the adolescent may adopt new values, behaviors, and ways of thinking that differ from those of their parents."
