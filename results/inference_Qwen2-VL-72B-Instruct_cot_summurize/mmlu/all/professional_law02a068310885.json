The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n"

Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document.\"\n\nThis argument is based on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which allows for the introduction of extrinsic evidence to clarify or supplement the terms of a written contract, provided that the additional terms do not contradict the written terms. In this case, the videographer could argue that there was an understanding or agreement about the additional charge for high definition equipment that was not explicitly stated in the written contract but does not necessarily contradict the payment clause. If the videographer can provide evidence (such as emails, witness testimony, or industry standards) that supports the existence of this additional agreement, it could bolster their claim for the extra $5,000.\n\nArguments A, B, and D are less persuasive because:\n\nA. Customary trade practices alone may not be sufficient to override the explicit terms of the written contract without additional evidence showing that both parties were aware of and agreed to these practices.\n\nB. While an oral agreement might supplement the written contract, proving its existence and that it was agreed upon by both parties could be challenging without direct evidence.\n\nD. Equitable considerations are generally not enough to override the clear terms of a written contract. The principle of equity would typically not allow for the introduction of extrinsic evidence to alter the terms of a fully integrated contract unless there is evidence of fraud, mistake, or some other compelling reason to do so.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the strongest legal basis for admitting extrinsic evidence to support the videographer's claim for the additional $5,000."
