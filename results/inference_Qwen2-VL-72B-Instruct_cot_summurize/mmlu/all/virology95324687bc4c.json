Fragmented, uncoordinated approach\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is often characterized by its fragmented nature, with various stakeholders including private insurers, government programs (like Medicare and Medicaid), hospitals, and individual providers operating somewhat independently. This can lead to inefficiencies and difficulties in coordinating care for patients. While there have been efforts to improve coordination and streamline the system, it remains a complex and decentralized network compared to more centralized systems found in other countries."
