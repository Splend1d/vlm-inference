Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is indeed associated with a Herpes Zoster infection, but it affects the geniculate ganglion and can involve both motor and sensory components of the facial nerve, making it a lower motor neuron lesion rather than an upper motor neuron lesion.\n\nC. An inability to close the eyelid on the paralyzed side is a classic sign of a lower motor neuron lesion, as it indicates damage to the facial nerve itself or its nucleus.\n\nD. In Bell's Palsy, the sense of taste can be affected because the facial nerve carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion"
