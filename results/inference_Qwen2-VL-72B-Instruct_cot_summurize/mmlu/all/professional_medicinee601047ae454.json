He is receiving fentanyl via systemic patient-controlled analgesic pump for pain management. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, for which he takes atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, and 81-mg aspirin. Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs now are temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities. Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient?\n\nA. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices\nB. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value\nC. Oral warfarin\nD. Subcutaneous enoxaparin\n"

Subcutaneous enoxaparin\n\nIn this scenario, the patient has undergone a total knee replacement and has multiple risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), including age, surgery, and a history of coronary artery disease. The most appropriate regimen for prophylaxis of DVT in this patient would be subcutaneous enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that is effective in preventing DVT and has a more predictable anticoagulant effect compared to unfractionated heparin. It can be administered once or twice daily, depending on the dose, and does not require monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices may also be used as an adjunctive measure to reduce the risk of DVT. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value is typically reserved for patients with active DVT or pulmonary embolism, rather than for prophylaxis. Oral warfarin is less commonly used for prophylaxis of DVT in the postoperative setting due to its slower onset of action and need for frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR)."
