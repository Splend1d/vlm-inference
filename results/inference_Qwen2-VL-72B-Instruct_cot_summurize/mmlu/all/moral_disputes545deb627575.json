He has expressed concerns about the ethical implications of SCNT, particularly regarding its potential use in human cloning.\n\nGiven this context, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **There should be no standards for safety.**\n   - This option suggests a complete lack of regulation, which is unlikely given Pence's cautious approach to new technologies.\n\nB. **SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed.**\n   - This option implies an extremely high standard that might be practically unattainable due to the inherent risks associated with any reproductive technology.\n\nC. **SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.**\n   - This option suggests a more pragmatic approach, aligning the risks of SCNT with those accepted in natural reproduction. Given Pence's conservative stance, he might consider this a reasonable compromise.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option leaves open the possibility that Pence might have a different or more nuanced view that isn't captured by the other options.\n\nConsidering Pence's known positions and the nature of the question, the most likely answer is:\n\n**C. SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.**\n\nThis option reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the risks but also considers the benefits and societal acceptance of similar reproductive technologies."
