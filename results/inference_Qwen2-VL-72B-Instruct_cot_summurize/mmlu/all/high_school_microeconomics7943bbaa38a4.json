The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nIn this scenario, when the price of an inferior good decreases, the income effect causes consumers to buy less of it because they can now afford better substitutes. If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect (which would normally lead to increased consumption due to the lower price), the overall quantity demanded decreases. This results in an upward-sloping demand curve for that good."
