If the initial model is mis-specified, all subsequent steps will be invalid.\n\nThis is a key disadvantage of the general-to-specific (GETS) approach, also known as the Hendry approach. In this method, you start with a large, general model that includes many potential explanatory variables and then systematically remove variables that are not statistically significant until you arrive at a more parsimonious model. However, if the initial model is misspecified (i.e., it does not correctly capture the underlying data-generating process), the process of simplifying the model can lead to incorrect conclusions because the subsequent steps are based on an incorrect starting point. This can result in a final model that is not only statistically inadequate but also theoretically flawed."
