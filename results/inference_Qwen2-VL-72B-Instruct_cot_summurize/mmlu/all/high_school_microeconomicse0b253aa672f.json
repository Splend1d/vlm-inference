This situation attracts new firms to enter the market because they see an opportunity to earn profits. As more firms enter, the industry expands. Over time, this entry of new firms will increase the supply in the market, which can lead to a decrease in the market price until it reaches the level where firms are only earning normal profits (where price equals average total cost)."
