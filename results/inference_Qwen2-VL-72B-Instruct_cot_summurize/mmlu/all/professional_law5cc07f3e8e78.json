The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice\" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?\n\nA. Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where \"time is of the essence\" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\nC. No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.\nD. No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the Equity Court is likely to grant the request for specific performance, we need to analyze the key aspects of the case:\n\n1. **Option Contract Terms**: The option contract stipulated that all notices required under it must be given in writing and delivered personally, by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail with return receipt requested. The notice was required by September 1.\n\n2. **Notice Delivery**: The Buyer exercised the option verbally on August 25 and sent written notice via first-class mail on August 29. The Seller received this notice on September 3, which was beyond the deadline specified in the contract.\n\n3. **Equity Court Considerations**:\n   - **Time Sensitivity**: Generally, in option contracts, time is often considered of the essence. However, courts may consider whether strict adherence to the deadline is necessary or if there were mitigating circumstances.\n   - **Prejudice to Seller**: If the Seller would suffer significant prejudice by having to sell after the option date, this could weigh against granting specific performance.\n   - **Hardship to Buyer**: The Buyer has made substantial improvements to the property, indicating potential hardship if the option is not honored.\n   - **Strict Enforcement vs. Liberal Enforcement**: Option contracts can be strictly enforced to ensure commercial predictability, but courts also aim to enforce agreements in a way that does not unjustly deprive parties of their bargained-for benefits.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where \"time is of the essence\" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.**\n   - This statement is generally true, but it overlooks the specific terms of the contract regarding notice requirements. While courts may be liberal in enforcing options, they still respect contractual terms.\n\nB. **Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.**\n   - This option acknowledges the minimal delay and the potential hardship to the Buyer. It also suggests that the notice requirement might not be strictly binding. However, the contract explicitly states the methods of notice, and failure to comply with those methods could be seen as a breach.\n\nC. **No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.**\n   - This option focuses on the potential prejudice to the Seller. If the Seller can demonstrate significant prejudice from selling after the option date, this could be a strong argument against specific performance.\n\nD. **No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.**\n   - This option emphasizes strict enforcement and commercial predictability. Given the explicit notice requirements and the deadline, a strict interpretation could lead to denial of specific performance.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most balanced approach seems to be option B. The delay was minimal, the Buyer would suffer hardship, and while the notice requirement was specific, the court might consider whether strict adherence to the deadline was necessary given the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.**"
