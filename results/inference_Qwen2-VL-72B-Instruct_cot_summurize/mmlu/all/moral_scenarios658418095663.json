I try to keep my patients from getting sick by getting them the treatments they need.\"\n- This scenario describes a nurse performing their duties responsibly and ethically.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US, providing necessary medical treatment to prevent patients from getting sick is considered a morally right action.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 involves a morally right action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
