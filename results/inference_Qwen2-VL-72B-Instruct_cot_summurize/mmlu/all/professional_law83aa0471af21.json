The purchaser noticed that the car made a squeaking noise when the brakes were applied, so the purchaser took the car back to the dealership to have the mechanic there take a look at it. The mechanic worked on the car and then told the purchaser that the problem had been fixed. A few days later, the brakes failed, causing the purchaser to crash into a tree. The purchaser suffered a serious head injury in the crash. If the purchaser asserts a claim against the car dealership for damages for his injuries, will the purchaser prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\nB. Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\nC. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.\nD. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n"

No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n\nIn this scenario, the key issue revolves around whether the dealership's mechanic was negligent in fixing the squeaking noise associated with the brakes. If the mechanic negligently repaired the brakes, leading to their failure and subsequent accident, the purchaser may have grounds for a negligence claim against the dealership. However, simply returning the car for repair does not automatically mean the dealership is liable; the purchaser must demonstrate that the dealership's actions or inactions directly caused the harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the question focuses on the repair after the initial purchase, not the condition of the brakes at the time of sale.\n\nOption B is incorrect because strict liability typically applies to manufacturers for defective products, not necessarily to dealerships for repairs.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the mileage driven does not inherently affect the dealership's liability in this context.\n\nTherefore, the purchaser's claim would hinge on proving the dealership's negligence in the repair process."
