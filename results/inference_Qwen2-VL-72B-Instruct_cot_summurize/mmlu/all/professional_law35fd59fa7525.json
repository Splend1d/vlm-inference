The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.\nB. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.\nC. excluded as lacking any probative value.\nD. excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\n"

However, such evidence can also be prejudicial because it may suggest to the jury that the defendant has a propensity for criminal behavior. To balance the probative value of this evidence with its potential prejudice, the court should admit the evidence but provide a limiting instruction to the jury. This instruction would direct the jury to consider the evidence only as it relates to the defendant's motive and not as proof of the defendant's general character or propensity to commit crimes."
