                    "text": "To determine which statement is false, we need to analyze the given system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z &= 0 \\\\\nw + 4x + y &= 0 \\\\\n3w + 5x + 10y + 14z &= 0 \\\\\n2w + 5x + 5y + 6z &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's check if the system is consistent by reducing it to row echelon form or reduced row echelon form (RREF). We can use Gaussian elimination for this purpose.\n\nLet's represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix into RREF:\n\n1. Subtract the first row from the second row:\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n2. Replace the third row with the third row minus three times the first row:\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n3. Replace the fourth row with the fourth row minus twice the first row:\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n4. Add four times the second row to the third row:\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0\n\\]\n\n5. Add the second row to the fourth row:\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThe matrix is now in RREF. Since there are no rows of the form [0 0 0 0 | k] where k \u2260 0, the system is consistent (statement A is true).\n\nSince there are more variables than equations, the system has free variables, which means it has infinitely many solutions (statement B is true).\n\nFor statement C, the sum of any two solutions of a homogeneous system (where all constants on the right-hand side are zero) is also a solution because the system is linear. So statement C is true.\n\nFinally, for statement D, we need to find the general solution to see if every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). From the RREF, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z &= 0 \\\\\nx - y - 2z &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can express w and x in terms of y and z:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nw &= -3x - 2y - 2z \\\\\nx &= y + 2z\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting x in the equation for w gives:\n\n\\[\nw = -3(y + 2z) - 2y - 2z = -3y - 6z - 2y - 2z = -5y - 8z\n\\]\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\n\\[\n(w, x, y, z) = (-5y - "
