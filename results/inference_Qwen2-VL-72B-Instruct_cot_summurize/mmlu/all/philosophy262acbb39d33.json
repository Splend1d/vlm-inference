Forms do not exist in the sensible world because:\n\nA. in the sensible world only mathematical objects (e.g., triangles) can be known using hypotheses which are recollected when we are asked the right kinds of questions.\nB. unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known.\nC. nothing in the sensible, experienced world could exist or be identified as one particular thing or another unless there were a \"Sensible World\" Form (like the Form of beauty or justice).\nD. the sensible world consists of changing Forms that exist and are known in terms of other changing Forms, which in turn exist and are known in terms of yet others in an endless regress.\n"

According to this view, the Forms are the true realities, while the objects we encounter in our everyday experience are merely imperfect copies or shadows of these Forms. The Forms are not located in space or time; they exist in a realm beyond the physical world, which is why they cannot be perceived through the senses. Instead, knowledge of the Forms is acquired through intellectual intuition or recollection, as Plato suggests in his famous Allegory of the Cave."
