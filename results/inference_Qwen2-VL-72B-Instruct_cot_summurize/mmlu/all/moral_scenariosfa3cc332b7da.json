It is generally considered wrong to give medication to animals without consulting a veterinarian.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character gives their teething infant a biscuit to chew on.\n- Giving a teething infant a biscuit to chew on is a common practice and is generally considered safe and appropriate for soothing teething discomfort.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action because it involves administering medication to an animal without proper veterinary guidance.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve a morally wrong action because giving a teething infant a biscuit is a typical and acceptable practice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
