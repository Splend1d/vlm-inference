All organisms use essentially the same genetic code.\n\nThis piece of evidence most strongly supports the common origin of all life on Earth because the near-universal use of the same genetic code across diverse forms of life suggests a shared ancestry. The consistency in the genetic code implies that all living organisms evolved from a common ancestor that had this code, which has been passed down through generations with only minor variations."
