According to the First Isomorphism Theorem in group theory, if \\( f: G \\rightarrow H \\) is a surjective (onto) homomorphism from group \\( G \\) to group \\( H \\), then \\( H \\) is isomorphic to the factor group \\( G / \\ker(f) \\), where \\( \\ker(f) \\) is the kernel of \\( f \\).\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\"The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\).\"\n\nThis statement is also true. The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) correspond precisely to its factor groups up to isomorphism. Specifically, every factor group \\( G/N \\) for some normal subgroup \\( N \\) of \\( G \\) can be realized as the image of a homomorphism from \\( G \\), and conversely, every homomorphic image of \\( G \\) is isomorphic to such a factor group.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
