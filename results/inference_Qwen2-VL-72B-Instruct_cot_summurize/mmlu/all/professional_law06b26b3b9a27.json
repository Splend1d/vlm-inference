                    "text": "To determine the son's ownership interest in the land after the deaths of Hunter, Willa, and Brandon, we need to analyze the legal nature of the interests held by each party and how those interests would pass upon death.\n\n1. **Initial Ownership Structure:**\n   - Ann originally owned the entire tract of land.\n   - On August 1, 2005, Ann sold an undivided one-half interest to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n   - On August 1, 2006, Ann sold her remaining one-half interest to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\n2. **Tenants by the Entirety (Hunter and Willa):**\n   - Tenancy by the entirety is a form of co-ownership available only to married couples. It includes rights of survivorship, meaning if one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically inherits the deceased spouse's interest.\n   - Since Hunter and Willa were tenants by the entirety, if either died first, the other would inherit the entire interest.\n\n3. **Joint Tenancy (Hunter and Brandon):**\n   - Joint tenancy also includes rights of survivorship. If one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant inherits the deceased's interest.\n   - Hunter and Brandon were joint tenants, so if either died first, the other would inherit the entire interest.\n\n4. **Common Disaster (August 1, 2007):**\n   - Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die simultaneously, and the order of their deaths cannot be determined.\n   - In such cases, the law typically presumes that the younger person survived the older person. However, since all three are presumed to have died simultaneously, we must consider the legal implications of their respective tenancies.\n\n5. **Analysis of Interests:**\n   - Initially, Hunter and Willa had a one-half interest as tenants by the entirety.\n   - Hunter and Brandon had another one-half interest as joint tenants.\n   - Upon simultaneous death, the presumption of survivorship does not apply because the order of death is unknown.\n\n6. **Application of Law:**\n   - Since Hunter and Willa were tenants by the entirety, their interest would pass to the surviving spouse if they died separately. However, since they died simultaneously, their interest would be divided equally among their heirs.\n   - Similarly, Hunter and Brandon's joint tenancy interest would pass to the surviving joint tenant if they died separately. But since they died simultaneously, their interest would also be divided equally among their heirs.\n\n7. **Final Ownership Calculation:**\n   - Hunter and Willa's one-half interest would be divided equally between their son and any other heirs (if any).\n   - Hunter and Brandon's one-half interest would be divided equally between their son and any other heirs (if any).\n\nGiven that Hunter and Willa's wills specifically devise their interests to their son, and assuming no other heirs are involved:\n\n- The son would inherit Hunter and Willa's one-half interest.\n- The son would also inherit Hunter and Brandon's one-half interest.\n\nTherefore, the son would own the entire tract of land.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe son owns an undivided one-half interest in the land. \n\nSo, the correct option is:\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land."
