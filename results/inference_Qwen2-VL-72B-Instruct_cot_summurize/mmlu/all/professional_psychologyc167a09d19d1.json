The scenario you've described indicates that the family members are not actively participating in addressing the issues faced by the 14-year-old boy. The mother's dismissive attitude, the father's decision to go fishing during the court hearing, and the sister's prioritization of her homework over attending the court hearing all suggest a lack of engagement and concern for the boy's well-being and the seriousness of his situation. This lack of involvement and support from family members is characteristic of a disengaged family structure."
