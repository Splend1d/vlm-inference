If Stan only consumes 1 beer instead of more, his level of inhibition is likely to remain higher compared to if he had consumed more alcohol. The other options (arousal, erection, and orgasm) can also be affected by alcohol, but typically in a negative way as well, meaning that consuming less alcohol might actually help maintain or improve these aspects of sexual function. However, the question seems to focus on the effect of decreased alcohol consumption on inhibition, which would indeed be increased (or, inversely, decreased inhibition would be reduced)."
