At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: \"Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?\" He answered, \"Yes. \"The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects to this proffer of evidence. The objection at trial will be\n\nA. granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. granted, because the questioning of the witness was leading.\nC. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.\nD. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning of the witness was leading.\n"

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. In this scenario, the witness's statement from the grand jury hearing is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the defendant's car went through the red light). Since there is no indication that this statement fits into any recognized hearsay exception, the objection would likely be sustained, and the statement would not be admissible at trial."
