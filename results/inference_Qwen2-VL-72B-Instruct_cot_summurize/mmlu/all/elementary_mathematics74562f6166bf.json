Since you cannot subtract a larger number from a smaller one in this position, you need to borrow from the tens place.\n2. The tens place is now \\( 9 \\) (since you borrowed 1 from the hundreds place), and the ones place becomes \\( 10 \\).\n3. Subtract in the ones place: \\( 10 - 1 = 9 \\).\n4. Move to the tens place: \\( 9 - 0 = 9 \\).\n5. Finally, subtract in the hundreds place: \\( 7 - 3 = 4 \\).\n\nPutting it all together, \\( 800 - 301 = 499 \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 499"
