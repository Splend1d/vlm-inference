                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nB. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Low Haemoglobin**: This is a hallmark of iron deficiency anaemia.\n2. **Low Ferritin**: Ferritin levels are typically low in iron deficiency. However, ferritin is also an acute phase reactant, so it may be elevated during infections. In this case, the combination of iron deficiency and infection might result in a lower than expected ferritin level due to the iron deficiency overshadowing the infection-induced increase.\n3. **High Serum Transferrin Receptors (sTfR)**: sTfR levels rise in iron deficiency because the body tries to compensate for the lack of iron by increasing the number of transferrin receptors on red blood cells.\n4. **Low Hepcidin**: Hepcidin levels are usually low in iron deficiency as the body attempts to increase iron absorption. During infections, hepcidin levels would typically rise to limit iron availability to pathogens. However, in the context of iron deficiency, the low hepcidin reflects the body's attempt to increase iron absorption despite the infection.\n\nTherefore, option B best fits the scenario described."
