It can help reduce binge-eating and purging behaviors. However, it's important to note that treatment for Bulimia Nervosa often involves a combination of approaches, including psychotherapy, nutritional counseling, and sometimes medication. Discussing body image and weight can also be important components of therapy, but they are typically addressed within a comprehensive treatment plan rather than being the sole focus."
