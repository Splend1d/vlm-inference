It was not seen as a positive identity or something to take pride in (option A). Nor was it an absolute taboo that led to the isolation of all homosexuals (option B), although it was certainly stigmatized and often hidden due to societal pressures. The concept of \"compulsory heterosexuality\" is a term coined by Adrienne Rich in the late 20th century, but the idea that homosexuality was seen as a threat to the dominant heterosexual norm can be traced back to earlier periods, including the 19th century (option C). Finally, it wasn't viewed as confirmation of the two-sex model (option D); rather, discussions around gender and sexuality in the 19th century were complex and varied, with some scientific and cultural debates challenging traditional views."
