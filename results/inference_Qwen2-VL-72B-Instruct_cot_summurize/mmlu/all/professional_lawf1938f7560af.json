He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.**\n   - This option suggests that since the driver was already secured in the squad car, the officer could not reasonably expect to find evidence related to the current arrest (driving under suspension) in the car. However, the officer may still have reasonable grounds to believe that evidence of other crimes might be present in the vehicle.\n\nB. **No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.**\n   - This statement is generally true; individuals do have a reduced expectation of privacy in their vehicles compared to their homes. However, this alone does not justify every search without a warrant or probable cause.\n\nC. **No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.**\n   - Searches incident to arrest are permissible under certain conditions. Typically, such searches are justified if they are conducted to protect the arresting officer from danger or to prevent the destruction of evidence. In this case, the officer may argue that the search was incident to the arrest for driving under suspension, especially if he had reason to believe that evidence of other crimes might be found in the vehicle.\n\nD. **Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.**\n   - While it is true that a warrantless search of a vehicle typically requires exigent circumstances (such as the risk of evidence being destroyed), the arrest of the driver for driving under suspension could provide sufficient justification for the search if the officer had reasonable suspicion that evidence of another crime might be found in the vehicle.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer would be:\n\n**C. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that a search incident to arrest can be justified if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that evidence of other crimes might be present in the vehicle, even after the driver has been secured in the squad car."
