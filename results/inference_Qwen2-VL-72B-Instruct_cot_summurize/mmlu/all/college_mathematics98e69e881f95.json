                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which three segments can form a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for any three lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to form a triangle, they must satisfy:\n\n\\[ a + b > c \\]\n\\[ a + c > b \\]\n\\[ b + c > a \\]\n\nGiven a segment of length 10, let's denote the points where it is divided as follows:\n- Point A divides the segment into two parts: \\(x\\) and \\(10 - x\\).\n- Point B divides the segment into two parts: \\(y\\) and \\(10 - y\\).\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume \\(x < y\\). Then, the three segments formed by points A and B are:\n1. The segment from the start to point A: \\(x\\)\n2. The segment between points A and B: \\(y - x\\)\n3. The segment from point B to the end: \\(10 - y\\)\n\nFor these segments to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:\n\\[ x + (y - x) > 10 - y \\]\n\\[ x + (10 - y) > y - x \\]\n\\[ (y - x) + (10 - y) > x \\]\n\nSimplifying each inequality:\n1. \\( y > 5 \\)\n2. \\( 10 > 2y - 2x \\)\n3. \\( 10 > 2x \\)\n\nFrom the first inequality (\\( y > 5 \\)), we know that \\( y \\) must be greater than 5.\n\nThe second inequality simplifies to \\( 10 > 2y - 2x \\), or \\( 5 > y - x \\). This means \\( y - x < 5 \\).\n\nThe third inequality simplifies to \\( 10 > 2x \\), or \\( x < 5 \\).\n\nSo, the conditions for forming a triangle are:\n1. \\( x < 5 \\)\n2. \\( y > 5 \\)\n3. \\( y - x < 5 \\)\n\nNow, let's visualize this on a coordinate plane with \\( x \\) on the horizontal axis and \\( y \\) on the vertical axis. The segment is divided into three parts, so \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) range from 0 to 10.\n\nThe region satisfying all three conditions forms a triangle within the square defined by \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq 10 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq y \\leq 10 \\):\n- \\( x < 5 \\) restricts the region to the left of the line \\( x = 5 \\).\n- \\( y > 5 \\) restricts the region above the line \\( y = 5 \\).\n- \\( y - x < 5 \\) restricts the region below the line \\( y = x + 5 \\).\n\nThe area of the square is \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\).\n\nThe area of the triangle formed by these lines is:\n- Base along \\( x = 5 \\): length 5.\n- Height along \\( y = 5 \\): height 5.\n\nArea of the triangle = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 5 = 12.5 \\).\n\nThus, the probability that the three segments can form a triangle is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square:\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the triangle}}{\\text{Area of the square}} = \\frac{12.5}{100} = 0.125 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\\[ 0.125 \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\% \\]\n\nNone of the provided options exactly match this result, but the closest option is:\n\nB. 10%"
