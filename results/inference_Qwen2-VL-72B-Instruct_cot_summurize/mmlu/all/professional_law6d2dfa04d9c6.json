When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario involves a legal dispute over the sale of land where the deed contains a restriction on transferring the property for 10 years. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.**\n   - This option suggests that the restriction in the deed is enforceable and prevents the woman from selling the land. However, the enforceability of such restrictions depends on the jurisdiction and whether they are considered unreasonable restraints on alienation.\n\nB. **The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.**\n   - This option is irrelevant since the contract was between the woman and the investor, and there is no indication that the heirs' involvement is necessary or relevant to the contract's validity.\n\nC. **The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.**\n   - This option implies that the contract does not require the woman to provide marketable title, which means she could still sue for specific performance even if her title is defective. However, the standard practice in real estate transactions is that the seller must provide marketable title unless otherwise stated.\n\nD. **The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.**\n   - This option suggests that the restriction in the deed is unenforceable due to being against public policy or otherwise void under applicable law. If the restriction is indeed void, then the woman would be able to sell the land, and the investor's refusal to close would be unjustified.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**D. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the restriction in the deed is unenforceable, allowing the woman to proceed with the sale."
