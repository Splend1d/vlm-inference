Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.\n\nVariable ratio schedules of reinforcement involve delivering reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses, which makes them highly effective in maintaining behavior over long periods because the subject cannot predict when the next reward will come. This unpredictability leads to higher resistance to extinction compared to fixed ratio schedules, where reinforcement is given after a set number of responses, making it easier for the subject to anticipate rewards and thus more susceptible to extinction when reinforcement stops."
