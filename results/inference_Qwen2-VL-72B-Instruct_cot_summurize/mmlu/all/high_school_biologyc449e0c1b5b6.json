During transcription, the DNA template strand is read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction, and the mRNA is synthesized in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. Therefore, the mRNA codon will be complementary to the DNA sequence.\n\n   - DNA: 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032\n   - mRNA: 3\u2032-G-U-A-5\u2032 (complementary to DNA)\n\n2. **Determine the tRNA anticodon**: The tRNA anticodon pairs with the mRNA codon via complementary base pairing. In RNA, T (thymine) is replaced by U (uracil).\n\n   - mRNA codon: 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032\n   - tRNA anticodon: 3\u2032-C-A-U-5\u2032\n\nTherefore, the correct nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is:\n\n**C. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032**"
