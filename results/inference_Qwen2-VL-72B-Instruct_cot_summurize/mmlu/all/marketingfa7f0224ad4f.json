Reduce prices through new production and distribution methods.\n\nNew technology often leads to more efficient production processes and innovative distribution methods, which can result in cost savings for businesses. These savings can then be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. While options A and B might occur in specific instances, they are not typical outcomes of technological advancements. Option D is less common as well, though technology can sometimes revive interest in older products by improving them or finding new uses."
