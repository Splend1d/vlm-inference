Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood\n\nThis diagnosis fits because the patient's symptoms (pounding heart, poor sleep, restlessness, inability to concentrate, and worry) have developed in response to a significant life stressor (relocating for a job promotion). Adjustment Disorders typically occur when an individual experiences difficulty coping with or adjusting to a particular source of stress, leading to emotional or behavioral symptoms.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder could also present with some overlapping symptoms but would not necessarily be directly linked to a recent life change as prominently as Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood."
