Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome carries genes that trigger the development of male characteristics. Therefore, the sex of a child is determined by whether the sperm cell that fertilizes the egg contains an X chromosome (resulting in XX, or female) or a Y chromosome (resulting in XY, or male). Since the egg always contributes an X chromosome, it is the sperm that determines the sex of the offspring."
