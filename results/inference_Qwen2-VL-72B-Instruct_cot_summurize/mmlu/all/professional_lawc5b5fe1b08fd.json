They claimed receiving promises from the broker that if they bought the home immediately a $15,000 rebate would be given to them at closing by the sellers. At closing, the sellers claimed no knowledge and didn't pay. At trial against the broker, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents who testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and he heard the broker make the same promise. The broker objected that the testimony was hearsay. What will the court most likely decide regarding the admissibility of the testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.\nD. The testimony is admissible \u0080\u0094 even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n"

The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nIn legal proceedings, statements made by an authorized agent or representative of a party can be considered admissions by the party. This means that if the agent was acting within the scope of their employment when making the statement, the statement can be admitted as evidence against the party they represent. In this case, the broker's agent was present during the meeting where the promise was made, and if the agent was authorized to speak on behalf of the broker regarding the sale, the statement qualifies as an admission by the broker. Therefore, the court is likely to find the testimony admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule."
