This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.\n\nThis clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\" This provision is designed to ensure that citizens of one state receive the same treatment as citizens of another state when they travel or do business across state lines. \n\nIn the context of the given situation, the tax imposed by the city on nonresidents' city-derived income could potentially violate the privileges and immunities clause if it discriminates against nonresidents in favor of residents. The fact that residents are exempt from taxation on their in-city earned income while nonresidents are subject to taxation could be seen as an unequal treatment based on residency status, which might be challenged under this clause.\n\nWhile other clauses such as the equal protection clause (part of the Fourteenth Amendment) and the commerce clause could also be relevant, the privileges and immunities clause directly addresses the issue of interstate discrimination and would likely provide the strongest basis for the constitutional challenge in this specific context."
