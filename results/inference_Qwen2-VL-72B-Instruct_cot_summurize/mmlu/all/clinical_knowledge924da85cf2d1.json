Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration.\n\nBronchial breathing, also known as tubular breathing, is an abnormal breath sound that can be heard over areas of the lungs where air movement is increased or where there is consolidation of lung tissue. It is characterized by a loud, high-pitched, hollow sound during both inspiration and expiration, with the expiratory phase being louder and longer than the inspiratory phase. There is often a pause between the end of expiration and the beginning of inspiration, which is referred to as a \"gap\" in the breathing cycle. This type of breathing is typically associated with conditions such as pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis."
