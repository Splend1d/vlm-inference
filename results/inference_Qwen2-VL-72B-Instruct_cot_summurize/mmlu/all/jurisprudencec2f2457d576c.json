                    "text": "The principal difference between the positions adopted by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke lies in their accounts of life before the social contract, which is often referred to as the \"state of nature.\"\n\nHobbes, in his work \"Leviathan,\" describes the state of nature as a condition of constant fear and insecurity, where life is \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" He argues that without a strong central authority, humans would be in a perpetual state of war with one another. Therefore, Hobbes advocates for an absolute sovereign who has complete control over the laws and the people to maintain peace and order.\n\nLocke, on the other hand, in his \"Second Treatise of Government,\" portrays the state of nature as a more peaceful and orderly condition where individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. According to Locke, people enter into a social contract not because they need to escape a brutal existence but rather to better protect their natural rights. Locke's view of government is more limited; he believes in a government that protects individual rights and is subject to the consent of the governed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. They differ in respect of their account of life before the social contract."
