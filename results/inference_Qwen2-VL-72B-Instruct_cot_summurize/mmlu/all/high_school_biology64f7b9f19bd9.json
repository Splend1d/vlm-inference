BB Bb - One parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). All offspring will either be BB or Bb, meaning they will all have brown fur.\n\nC. Bb Bb - Both parents are heterozygous. The possible genotypes for the offspring are:\n   - BB (brown fur)\n   - Bb (brown fur)\n   - bb (silver fur)\n\nSince there is a possibility of producing offspring with the genotype bb, this option can result in offspring with silver fur.\n\nD. Bb bb - One parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). The possible genotypes for the offspring are:\n   - Bb (brown fur)\n   - bb (silver fur)\n\nThis option also results in offspring with silver fur.\n\nTherefore, the sets of genotypes that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur are:\n\nC.
