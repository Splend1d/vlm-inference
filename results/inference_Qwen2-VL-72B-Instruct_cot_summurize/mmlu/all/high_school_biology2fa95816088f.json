It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.\n\nGenetic variation is essential for natural selection to occur because it provides the raw material upon which natural selection acts. Without genetic variation, there would be no differences among individuals that could be selected for or against based on their fitness in a given environment. Genetic variation can arise through various mechanisms such as mutation, sexual reproduction, and gene flow, and it is this variation that allows populations to adapt and evolve over time."
