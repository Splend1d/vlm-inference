There is substantial evidence suggesting that abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission play a role in schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications that block dopamine receptors are effective in treating many symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\nB. **White patients are more symptomatic.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. There is no evidence to suggest that white patients are inherently more symptomatic than patients of other racial backgrounds. Symptom severity can vary widely among individuals regardless of race.\n\nC. **Remission from the condition in the Third World is 65%.**\n   - This statement is correct. Research has shown that recovery rates for schizophrenia can vary significantly by region, with some studies indicating higher remission rates in developing countries compared to developed ones.\n\nD. **A lower rate of Schizophrenia diagnosed among African Americans.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Studies have shown that African Americans may actually have higher rates of diagnosis for schizophrenia compared to other racial groups in the United States, although this may be influenced by various factors including access to healthcare and diagnostic biases.\n\nBased on the analysis, the incorrect statement is:\n\n**B. White patients are more symptomatic.**"
