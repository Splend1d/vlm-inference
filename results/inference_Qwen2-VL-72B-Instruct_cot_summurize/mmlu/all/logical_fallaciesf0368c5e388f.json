Therefore, there won't be rain.\"\n\nTo analyze this argument, we need to identify its logical structure and determine whether it is valid or invalid.\n\n1. **Identify the logical form:**\n   - The argument is in the form of a conditional statement followed by an assertion and a conclusion.\n   - The conditional statement is \"If the sky is blue, then there won't be rain.\"\n   - The assertion is \"The sky is blue today.\"\n   - The conclusion is \"Therefore, there won't be rain.\"\n\n2. **Translate into formal logic:**\n   - Let \\( P \\) represent \"the sky is blue.\"\n   - Let \\( Q \\) represent \"there won't be rain.\"\n   - The conditional statement can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n   - The assertion is \\( P \\).\n   - The conclusion is \\( Q \\).\n\n3. **Analyze the validity:**\n   - The argument follows the pattern:\n     1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     2. \\( P \\)\n     3. Therefore, \\( Q \\)\n\n   This is a classic example of modus ponens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\n4. **Check the options:**\n   - A. It is a formally valid categorical syllogism: This option is incorrect because the argument does not follow the structure of a categorical syllogism.\n   - B. It is a formally invalid disjunctive syllogism: This option is incorrect because the argument is not a disjunctive syllogism.\n   - C. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism: This option is correct because the argument follows the valid form of modus ponens.\n   - D. It is a formally invalid conditional syllogism: This option is incorrect because the argument is valid.\n\n**Final Answer:** C. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism"
