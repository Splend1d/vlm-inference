Median\n\nThe median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. It is less affected by outliers or skewed data compared to the mean, making it a good measure of central tendency for this dataset. The mode (the most frequently occurring score) could also be considered, but since there are multiple modes (10 and 11), the median provides a clearer single value representing the center of the distribution."
