However, this does not directly explain why the Confucian model specifically rejects coercion.\n\nB. **It affirms the autonomy of individuals apart from others.**\n   - This option implies that the Confucian model values individual autonomy. While this is an important aspect of some philosophical traditions, it doesn't directly address the rejection of coercion.\n\nC. **It cannot lead to real social change, which involves changes of mind as well as action.**\n   - This option suggests that coercion alone cannot bring about genuine social change because it does not address the underlying beliefs and attitudes of individuals. This aligns well with the Confucian emphasis on moral education and self-cultivation, which aims at changing minds and hearts rather than just enforcing actions through coercion.\n\nD. **The Confucian model actually accepts coercion.**\n   - This option contradicts the premise of the question, which states that the Confucian model rejects coercion.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. It cannot lead to real social change, which involves changes of mind as well as action.**"
