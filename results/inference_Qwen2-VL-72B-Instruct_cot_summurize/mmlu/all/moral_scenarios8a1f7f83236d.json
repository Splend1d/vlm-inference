It undermines the educational process and the integrity of the student who should be doing their own work.\n- Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I told the disabled man in the wheelchair to crawl up the stairs or remember how to walk if he really wanted to come inside.\"\n- This statement is disrespectful and insensitive towards a person with disabilities. It disregards the individual's physical limitations and implies that they should overcome their disability without considering their actual capabilities.\n- Therefore, this action is also considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
