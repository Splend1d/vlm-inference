During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nA sympathetic reader of Logan's Address in the early years of the United States would be most likely to support which of the following Indian policies?\n\nA. Exterminating all Indians\nB. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty\nC. Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico\nD. Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways\n"

                    "text": "To determine the policy a sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would most likely support, let's analyze the context and content of the address.\n\nLogan's Address expresses deep sorrow and anger over the murder of his family by Colonel Cresap, highlighting the betrayal and injustice faced by Native Americans. The speech emphasizes Logan's peaceful intentions and his eventual resort to violence as a response to extreme provocation. It also underscores the humanity and dignity of Native Americans, suggesting that they should be treated with respect and justice.\n\nGiven this context, a sympathetic reader would likely be moved by the injustices described and would seek policies that promote fairness and respect towards Native Americans. Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Exterminating all Indians** - This option is clearly contrary to the themes of respect and justice expressed in Logan's Address. A sympathetic reader would not support such a brutal and inhumane policy.\n\nB. **Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty** - This option aligns well with the themes of Logan's Address. It advocates for recognizing and respecting the rights and territories of Native Americans, which would be consistent with a sympathetic response to Logan's plea for justice and fair treatment.\n\nC. **Encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico** - This option suggests displacement rather than respect for Native American lands and sovereignty. It does not align with the sentiment of Logan's Address, which emphasizes the importance of Native American lands and the injustices faced due to encroachment.\n\nD. **Building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways** - While this option might seem like an attempt at accommodation, it implies a forced assimilation and loss of cultural identity, which would not resonate with the themes of respect and justice in Logan's Address.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the policy that a sympathetic reader of Logan's Address would most likely support is:\n\n**B. Respecting Indian territory and sovereignty**"
