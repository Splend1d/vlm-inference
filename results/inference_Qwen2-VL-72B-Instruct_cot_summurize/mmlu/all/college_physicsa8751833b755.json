Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\n\nWhen high-energy electrons bombard a metal target, they can knock out electrons from the inner shells of the metal atoms, creating vacancies. These vacancies are then filled by electrons from higher energy levels, and the energy difference between these levels is emitted as characteristic X-rays. This process is known as fluorescence and is specific to the element being bombarded, which is why characteristic X-rays have distinct energies for different elements."
