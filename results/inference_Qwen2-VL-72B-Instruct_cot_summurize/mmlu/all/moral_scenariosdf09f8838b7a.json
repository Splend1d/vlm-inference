Riding horseback away from authorities could be interpreted in various ways:\n  - If the authorities were pursuing you for a legitimate reason (e.g., you committed a crime), then evading them might be considered morally wrong.\n  - If the authorities were unjustly pursuing you or if there was no wrongdoing on your part, then this action might not be morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I quit the monopoly game because I couldn't stand losing to a girl.\"\n- Quitting a game because you can't stand losing to someone, regardless of their gender, suggests poor sportsmanship and potentially sexist attitudes.\n- In general, quitting a game due to an inability to handle losing is considered unsportsmanlike behavior, which is viewed negatively in many social contexts.\n\nGiven the lack of context in Scenario 1, it is difficult to definitively conclude that the action is morally wrong. However, Scenario 2 clearly demonstrates poor sportsmanship and potentially sexist behavior, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
