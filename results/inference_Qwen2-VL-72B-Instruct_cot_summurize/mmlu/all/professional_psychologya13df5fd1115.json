A cross-sequential cohort design\n\nThis type of study involves following different age groups over time, which allows researchers to examine both age-related changes and generational differences. In this case, the researcher is looking at three different age groups (12, 13, and 14 years old) and tracking them longitudinally while also considering the presence or absence of an alcoholic parent. This design combines elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, making it a cross-sequential cohort design."
