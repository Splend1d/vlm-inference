This group can be constructed as \\( \\mathbb{Z}^n \\), which is the direct product of \\( n \\) copies of the integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n### Statement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\n- **Finitely Generated Abelian Groups**: These are abelian groups that can be generated by a finite set of elements.\n- **Betti Number**: In the context of algebraic topology and homological algebra, the Betti number \\( b_0 \\) of a finitely generated abelian group is the rank of its torsion-free part.\n- **Condition**: For a finitely generated abelian group to be free abelian, it must have no torsion elements (i.e., all elements have infinite order) and its rank must equal the number of elements in any minimal generating set.\n\nHowever, the condition given in **Statement 2** is not sufficient. The Betti number \\( b_0 \\) being equal to the number of elements in some generating set does not necessarily imply that the group is free abelian. It could still contain torsion elements, making it not free abelian.\n\nThus, **Statement 2** is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
