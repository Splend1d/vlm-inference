This involves drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and then adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test. The equidistance line is a line drawn equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each state is measured. However, this line may need to be adjusted to achieve an equitable result, taking into account various factors such as the relative length of the coasts of the states involved, the presence of islands, and the economic interests of the states.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no single method of delimitation that international courts and tribunals follow; rather, they apply principles of equity and fairness to reach an equitable result.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete. While judges or arbitrators do have some discretion in applying the principle of equity, the process is guided by established legal principles and precedents, not solely based on personal discretion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because achieving an equitable result remains a relevant and applicable method in contemporary maritime delimitation cases."
