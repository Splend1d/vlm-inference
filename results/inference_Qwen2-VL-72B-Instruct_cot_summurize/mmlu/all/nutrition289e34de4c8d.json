Tapering\n\nTapering refers to the reduction of training volume and intensity in the days leading up to an event, which is aimed at allowing the body to recover and peak for performance. While tapering is an important strategy for optimizing performance, it is not a nutritional strategy. Nutritional strategies such as carbohydrate loading, the classic glycogen loading regime, and exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise are all aimed at improving energy availability and can enhance performance during prolonged endurance type exercise."
