Information can be recalled from long-term memory without being currently in working memory.\n\nC. **People have no ability to recall information that has been extinguished.**\n   - Extinction refers to the process where a learned response diminishes over time when it is no longer reinforced. However, even extinguished memories can sometimes be retrieved under certain conditions (e.g., through priming or context reinstatement).\n\nD. **People will recall nonsense syllables more rapidly than they will sets of numbers.**\n   - Generally, people find it easier to recall meaningful information rather than meaningless information like nonsense syllables. Sets of numbers, especially if they form recognizable patterns, might be recalled more easily than random nonsense syllables.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**A. People are more likely to recall information that is congruent with their prior schemas.**"
