Theory of constraints.\n\nThe theory of constraints (TOC) is particularly useful in situations where there are limitations or bottlenecks that restrict the overall performance of a system. In this case, the manager is dealing with limited capacity for a critical machine, which is a constraint on the profitability of the area. TOC focuses on identifying these constraints and developing strategies to optimize them, thereby improving overall system performance and profitability."
