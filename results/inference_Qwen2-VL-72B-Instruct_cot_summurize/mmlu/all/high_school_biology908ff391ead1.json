The equation for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is:\n\n\\[ p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p \\) is the frequency of the dominant allele,\n- \\( q \\) is the frequency of the recessive allele,\n- \\( p^2 \\) represents the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals,\n- \\( 2pq \\) represents the frequency of heterozygous individuals (carriers),\n- \\( q^2 \\) represents the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals.\n\nGiven that the autosomal recessive trait is expressed in 1% of the population, we can say:\n\n\\[ q^2 = 0.01 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ q = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1 \\]\n\nSince \\( p + q = 1 \\), we can find \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage of the population that are carriers (heterozygous individuals), which is represented by \\( 2pq \\):\n\n\\[ 2pq = 2 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.1 = 0.18 \\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.18 \\times 100\\% = 18\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 18%"
