Water is split apart, providing hydrogen ions and electrons to NADP for temporary storage.\n\nThis statement correctly describes one of the key processes in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, which occurs in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. During these reactions, light energy is used to split water molecules (H2O), releasing oxygen gas (O2) as a byproduct. The hydrogen ions (H+) and electrons are then used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, which serves as an electron carrier and provides reducing power for the subsequent light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle)."
