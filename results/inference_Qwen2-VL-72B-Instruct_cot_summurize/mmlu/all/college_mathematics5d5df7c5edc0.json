The complement of \\( S \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) consists of all points \\((x, y)\\) where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are rational numbers. This complement is countable because it can be written as the Cartesian product of two countable sets (the set of all rational numbers). However, any non-empty open set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) contains uncountably many points. Therefore, the complement of \\( S \\) cannot be open, so \\( S \\) is not closed.\n\n### B. Open\nA set is open if every point in the set has an open neighborhood contained entirely within the set. Consider a point \\((x, y)\\) in \\( S\\) where either \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) is irrational. Any open ball around this point will contain points with both coordinates rational, since the rationals are dense in the reals. Thus, no such open ball can be fully contained in \\( S \\), making \\( S \\) not open.\n\n### C. Connected\nA set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Since \\( S \\) includes points with one coordinate rational and the other irrational, it is not possible to separate these points into two disjoint open sets without including points that have both coordinates rational. Hence, \\( S \\) is connected.\n\n### D. Totally Disconnected\nA set is totally disconnected if every connected component is a single point. Since \\( S \\) is connected (as shown above), it cannot be totally disconnected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. connected"
