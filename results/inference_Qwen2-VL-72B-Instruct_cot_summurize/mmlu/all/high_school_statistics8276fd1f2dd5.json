We will convert these values to Z-scores using the formula:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{\\text{Sample value} - \\text{Sample mean}}{SE} \\]\n\nFor the lower bound (80 days):\n\\[ Z_{\\text{lower}} = \\frac{80 - 83}{3.11} \\approx \\frac{-3}{3.11} \\approx -0.96 \\]\n\nFor the upper bound (90 days):\n\\[ Z_{\\text{upper}} = \\frac{90 - 83}{3.11} \\approx \\frac{7}{3.11} \\approx 2.25 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores:\n\n- \\( P(Z < -0.96) \\approx 0.1685 \\)\n- \\( P(Z < 2.25) \\approx 0.9878 \\)\n\nThe probability that the sample mean falls between 80 and 90 days is the difference between these two probabilities:\n\\[ P(-0.96 < Z < 2.25) = P(Z < 2.25) - P(Z < -0.96) \\]\n\\[ P(-0.96 < Z < 2.25) = 0.9878 - 0.1685 \\approx 0.8193 \\]\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage:\n\\[ 0.8193 \\times 100 \\approx 81.93\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 82.1%"
