                    "text": "To determine which statement is true given the assumption that write-allocation is always used, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.**\n   - In write-back, a write operation to a line found in the cache does not update main memory immediately; instead, the update occurs only when the line is evicted from the cache. This can potentially reduce the number of main memory accesses, leading to a higher hit ratio because more data remain in the cache longer.\n\nB. **Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**\n   - In write-through, every write operation updates main memory immediately. This means that the cache might have fewer up-to-date copies of data, potentially leading to more misses and thus a lower hit ratio compared to write-back.\n\nC. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**\n   - Write-back delays the update to main memory until the cache line is evicted. Therefore, not all write operations result in an immediate main memory operation. In contrast, write-through always updates main memory immediately upon a write operation. Hence, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation is always higher for write-through than for write-back.\n\nD. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.**\n   - This statement contradicts the nature of write-through and write-back policies. Since write-through always updates main memory immediately, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation is always higher for write-through than for write-back.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**"
