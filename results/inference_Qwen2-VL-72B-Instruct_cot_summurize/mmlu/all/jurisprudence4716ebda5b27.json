This approach emphasizes coherence, consistency, and moral reasoning within the legal system. It aims to ensure that legal decisions are not arbitrary but are grounded in principles that reflect the best understanding of justice and fairness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It is likely to generate more individual rights and greater liberty.**\n   - This aligns with Dworkin's emphasis on moral reasoning and fairness, which would support individual rights and liberties.\n\nB. **It renders a community more genuine.**\n   - This also fits well with Dworkin's idea, as it suggests that the community's laws and practices are more authentic when they are based on coherent and morally justified principles.\n\nC. **It opens the door to authoritarianism.**\n   - This contradicts Dworkin's theory. Law as integrity seeks to avoid arbitrariness and promote fairness, which are antithetical to authoritarianism.\n\nD. **It improves the moral justification for the exercise of political power.**\n   - This is consistent with Dworkin's view, as his theory aims to ground legal decisions in moral principles, thereby enhancing their moral justification.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is the least likely to follow logically from Dworkin's notion of law as integrity is:\n\n**C. It opens the door to authoritarianism.**"
