The Song dynasty actually expanded and refined the civil service examination system, making it more accessible and meritocratic.\n\nB. **The Song sponsored Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism**: This is also incorrect. While Buddhism was influential during both the Tang and Song periods, the Song dynasty did not sponsor Buddhism to the detriment of Taoism and Confucianism. In fact, the Song period saw a revival of Confucianism known as Neo-Confucianism.\n\nC. **The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy**: This is correct. The Song dynasty was known for its relatively defensive and less expansive foreign policy compared to the Tang dynasty, which was characterized by extensive military campaigns and territorial expansion.\n\nD. **The Song dynasty was originally from outside of China**: This is incorrect. The Song dynasty was founded by Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu), who was Chinese and originated from within China.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy**"
