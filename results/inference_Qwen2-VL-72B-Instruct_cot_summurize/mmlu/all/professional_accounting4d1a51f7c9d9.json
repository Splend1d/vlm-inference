Planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nWhen an auditor finds that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it indicates that the control being tested may not be operating effectively. As a result, the auditor would most likely reduce the planned reliance on this control because the evidence suggests that the control may not be functioning as intended. This reduction in reliance on the control would lead to an increase in the assessed level of control risk and, consequently, an increase in substantive testing to gather more evidence about the financial statements."
