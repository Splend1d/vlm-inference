Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets\n\nA corporation is considered independent from its managers, employees, investors, and customers because it is a separate legal entity with its own rights and responsibilities. This independence allows for perpetual succession, meaning the corporation can continue to exist even if its owners or management change. Additionally, a corporation owns its own assets, which are distinct from those of its owners or shareholders."
