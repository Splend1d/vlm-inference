The position required the engineer to work underground each workday. After one week on the job, the engineer became very ill. He requested testing of the mine air system, which revealed the presence of a chemical agent to which the engineer had a rare allergic reaction. The engineer promptly quit. The coal mine then hired a qualified replacement for the remainder of the engineer's contract at a salary of $7,500 per month. Assume that no statute or regulation applies. If the coal mine sues the engineer for breach of contract, is the coal mine likely to recover damages?\n\nA. No, because an at-will employee has the right to terminate an employment contract.\nB. No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the coal mine acted in good faith in mitigating the effect of the engineer's failure to finish the contract term.\nD. Yes, because the mine is reasonably safe for most people.\n"

No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the engineer discovered a chemical agent in the mine air system to which he had a rare allergic reaction, posing a significant risk to his health. This health risk can be considered a valid reason for the engineer to terminate the contract and cease working in the mine. The principle of \"impossibility of performance\" due to unforeseen circumstances that make it impossible or extremely hazardous for the engineer to fulfill his contractual obligations would likely excuse him from further performance. Therefore, the coal mine is unlikely to recover damages if they sue the engineer for breach of contract."
