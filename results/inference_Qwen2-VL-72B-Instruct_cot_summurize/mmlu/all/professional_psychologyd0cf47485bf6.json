Seeking professional consultation can help address the issues they are facing, such as depression and substance use. Additionally, considering a temporary suspension of their practice ensures that they do not compromise the quality of care they provide to their clients due to their personal struggles. This approach allows the psychologist to receive the necessary support while also safeguarding the welfare of their clients."
