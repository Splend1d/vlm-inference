This means that if an error relates to a prior period, it should be reflected in the financial statements of that period. In this case, the $40,000 loss accrual related to a Year 1 event should be reported in the Year 1 statement of financial position as a correction of an error. The $50,000 loss accrual related to a Year 2 event would be recognized in the Year 2 financial statements. Therefore, the amount of loss accrual that should be reported in the December 31, Year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000."
