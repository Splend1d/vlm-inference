This condition primarily affects children under the age of five and can lead to serious complications, particularly involving the heart.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of Kawasaki disease is:\n\nA. Intravenous immune globulin\n\nIntravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease. It is administered to reduce inflammation and prevent coronary artery abnormalities, which are a significant complication of the disease. IVIG is typically given within the first 10 days of the onset of fever, although it may still be beneficial if given later.\n\nPenicillin (option B) is not indicated for Kawasaki disease as it is not caused by bacterial infection. Prednisone (option C) is a corticosteroid that may be used in some cases of refractory Kawasaki disease but is not the first-line treatment. Isoniazid (option D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis and is not relevant to the treatment of Kawasaki disease."
