Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/85 mm Hg. Crackles are heard in both lower lung fields. Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. Histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\nA. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis\nB. Intra-alveolar exudates\nC. Multiple thromboemboli\nD. Necrotizing vasculitis\n"

Diffuse interstitial fibrosis\n\nIn the context of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), the presence of progressive shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and abnormal pulmonary function tests (reduced total lung capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) suggest interstitial lung disease. Systemic sclerosis can lead to diffuse interstitial fibrosis, which is characterized by thickening and scarring of the lung tissue. This histologic finding would be consistent with the patient's symptoms and pulmonary function test results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis"
