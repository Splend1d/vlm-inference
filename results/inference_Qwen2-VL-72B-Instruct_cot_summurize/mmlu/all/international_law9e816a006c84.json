Such conduct is a public act (jure imperii)\n\nIn international law, acts performed in an official capacity by a state's representatives, including ministers, are considered acts jure imperii. These acts are typically immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts. Unlawful homicide committed by a minister abroad would generally be considered an act of state and thus an act jure imperii. However, it's important to note that the specifics of the situation, including the circumstances under which the homicide occurred and the laws of the countries involved, could influence the legal analysis."
