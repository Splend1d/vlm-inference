The CEO of the new business told the widget maker's manager that a substantial profit hinged on receiving the widgets. The manufacturer discovered it could not produce the widgets due to equipment failures. The business sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming lost profits of $10 million. The CEO testified to the company's projected sales in detail. A qualified expert supported his lost profit projections; there was no expert testimony by the manufacturer. Will the court allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages?\n\nA. No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are not awarded.\nB. No, because the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence that the manufacturer could not foresee.\nC. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages, we need to consider several legal principles related to contract law and damages.\n\n1. **Breach of Contract**: The manufacturer failed to deliver the widgets as per the contract, which constitutes a breach of contract.\n2. **Lost Profits as Damages**: Lost profits are a type of compensatory damage that can be awarded if they are proven with reasonable certainty.\n3. **Speculative Nature of Lost Profits**: For a new business, proving lost profits can be more challenging due to the speculative nature of projecting future earnings, especially without historical data or established market presence.\n4. **Expert Testimony**: Expert testimony can support the claim of lost profits by providing a basis for the calculations and projections.\n5. **Excusable Occurrence**: Equipment failures might be considered an unforeseeable event, but this does not necessarily excuse the manufacturer from liability under the contract terms.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A**: This suggests that the court will not award the claimed lost profits because they are too speculative for a new company. While this is a common argument, the presence of detailed projections and expert testimony can mitigate this concern.\n  \n- **Option B**: This implies that the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence. However, excusable occurrences typically do not absolve the breaching party from all liability, particularly if the contract includes provisions for such contingencies.\n\n- **Option C**: This indicates that the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony. If the expert testimony provides a solid foundation for the lost profit projections, this could be persuasive to the court.\n\n- **Option D**: This suggests that a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts complicating its projections. This reasoning is flawed because the opposite is generally true; it is harder for a new company to prove lost profits due to lack of historical data.\n\nConsidering the details provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.**\n\nThis option acknowledges that while lost profits for a new company can be speculative, the detailed projections and expert testimony can provide sufficient evidence to support the claim."
