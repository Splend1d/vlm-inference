Exclusively breast fed for six months\n\nBreastfeeding is highly recommended for newborns, especially in areas with limited access to safe water and low levels of education. Breast milk provides essential nutrients, antibodies, and hormones that support the baby's growth and development. It also helps protect against infections and diseases, which can be particularly important in environments where clean water and sanitation may be scarce. Formula feeding requires clean water and proper preparation, which might not always be available or done correctly in such settings."
