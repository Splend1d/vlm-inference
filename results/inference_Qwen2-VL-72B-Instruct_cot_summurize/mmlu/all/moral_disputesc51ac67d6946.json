                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the context provided by Norcross regarding the justification for the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals based on rationality.\n\nNorcross argues against the idea that rationality alone can justify the higher moral status of humans over animals. He suggests that if rationality were the sole criterion, it would exclude certain humans (such as infants, the severely mentally disabled, or those in comas) who lack full rational capabilities but are still considered to have significant moral status.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Fail to give an adequate answer to the argument from marginal cases.**\n   - The \"argument from marginal cases\" refers to the challenge posed by comparing the moral status of humans with diminished rational capacities (e.g., infants, the severely mentally disabled) to non-human animals. If rationality is the only basis for moral status, then these marginal cases would pose a problem because they lack full rational capabilities yet are typically granted high moral status.\n\nB. **Fail to make the case that such a difference is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients as opposed to their status as moral agents.**\n   - This option suggests that even if rationality is used to differentiate humans from animals, it does not adequately address whether this difference is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients (entities deserving moral consideration due to their ability to experience pain and pleasure).\n\nGiven Norcross's critique, both points A and B are valid concerns. Rationality-based justifications do indeed struggle with the argument from marginal cases and also fail to sufficiently address the moral relevance of rationality to the status of animals as moral patients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. both A and B**"
