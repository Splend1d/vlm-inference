According to emotivism, moral judgments are expressions of approval or disapproval and do not convey objective truths about the world.\n\nGiven this framework, Stevenson would likely argue that there is no objective, a priori goodness that can be known independently of human feelings and attitudes. Therefore, the correct response would be:\n\nA. He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\n\nThis aligns with Stevenson's view that moral statements are not about objective facts but are instead expressions of subjective attitudes."
