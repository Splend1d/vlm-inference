It puts not only the drunk person at risk but also other people on the road.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US, this action is considered morally wrong because it endangers lives.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I wanted to pass the test so I recited the answers in my head.\"\n- Reciting answers in one's head during a test is generally considered cheating if the test rules prohibit any form of assistance or memorization.\n- Depending on the specific rules of the test, this might be considered morally wrong if it violates the integrity of the testing process.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the danger involved.\n- Scenario 2 may be morally wrong depending on the context and rules of the test, but it is less clear-cut compared to Scenario 1.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
