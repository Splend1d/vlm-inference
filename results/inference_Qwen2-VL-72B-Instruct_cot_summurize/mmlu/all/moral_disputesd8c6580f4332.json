Option B includes both harm arguments and arguments from divine command, which are frequently used in anti-homosexuality discourse. However, option C directly addresses both the concept of unnaturalness (a common theme) and harm arguments, which are also prevalent.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and accurate response is:\n\n**Option C: Unnaturalness arguments and harm arguments.**"
