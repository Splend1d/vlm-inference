It implies that equality is achievable and not solely determined by male dominance.\n\nB. **Equality is impossible because men define women as different.**\n   - This proposition aligns closely with MacKinnon's view that men hold power over women and define them in ways that perpetuate inequality.\n\nC. **The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined.**\n   - This proposition suggests a need for a fundamental shift in how we understand gender, which could be seen as addressing the power dynamics at play. It does not directly contradict the notion that men dominate women but rather proposes a solution.\n\nD. **The world is phallocentric and oppressive.**\n   - This proposition reinforces the idea that the world is structured around male dominance and oppression, which is consistent with MacKinnon's argument.\n\nGiven this analysis, the proposition that is most inconsistent with MacKinnon's argument is:\n\n**A. Women can achieve equality through political pressure.**\n\nThis option implies that women have the ability to overcome male dominance and achieve equality, which contrasts with the core of MacKinnon's argument that the issue is fundamentally about entrenched power dynamics where men dominate women."
