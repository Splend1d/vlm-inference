The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nD.

The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.**"
