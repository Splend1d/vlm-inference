Compel production of the records, because the Fifth Amendment is inapplicable.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in any criminal case. However, this protection generally does not extend to documents or records that are held by a business entity. In the context of a business, the records are considered the property of the business rather than the individual, and thus the individual cannot claim Fifth Amendment protection for those records. Therefore, the court would most likely compel the production of the records."
