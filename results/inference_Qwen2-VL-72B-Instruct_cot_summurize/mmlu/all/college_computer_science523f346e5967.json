                    "text": "To determine which statements are true about the \"Magic memory,\" let's analyze each statement in detail:\n\nI. **It can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.**\n   - An atomic Test-and-Set operation typically involves checking a flag and setting it in one indivisible operation. The \"Magic memory\" does not inherently perform such a check and set operation; it merely counts the number of read operations since the last clear. Therefore, it cannot directly provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.\n\nII. **It can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.**\n   - The \"Magic memory\" allows for counting the number of read operations since the last clear, which can be useful in coordinating processes. For example, if multiple processes need to know how many other processes have read from the memory since it was cleared, this information could be used for synchronization or coordination purposes. Thus, it can indeed be used to coordinate processes on a shared-memory multiprocessor.\n\nIII. **It is only useful on a multiprocessor.**\n   - While the \"Magic memory\" might be particularly useful in a multiprocessor environment where coordination between processes is necessary, it is not exclusively useful only in such environments. In a single-processor system, it could still be used to track the number of reads since the last clear, albeit with less complex coordination needs.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**\n\nThe \"Magic memory\" can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor."
