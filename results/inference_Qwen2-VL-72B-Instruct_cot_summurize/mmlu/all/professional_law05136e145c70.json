In 1974, the landowner conveyed the tract to the town development association \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and, in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns. \" Subsequently, a ski lodge was built and the land was continuously used as a ski resort for more than 20 years. In 1979, a neighbor, owner of a farm abutting the northeast corner of the 10-acre tract, began to use a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this particular jurisdiction was 20 years. In March 2000, the neighbor decided to sell the farm to a skier. Thereupon, the neighbor and the skier entered into a written real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000. On April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association was approached by the skier with the request that a written easement be given over the used area and that an appropriate instrument be delivered to the skier concurrently with the skier's closing with the neighbor. Following the president's meeting with the skier, the town development association held a duly announced meeting and voted unanimously to authorize its trustees to grant such an easement. On April 15, 2000, the landowner died. The landowner's sole descendant and successor in interest was his wife. Upon her husband's death, the wife immediately notified the town development association that if it granted the easement to the skier, the 10-acre tract would revert to her. The skier then brought an appropriate action, joining the neighbor, the wife, and the town development association, seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract. In this action, judgment should be in favor of which of the following parties?\n\nA. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\nB. The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\nC. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\nD. The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the key issue revolves around the creation and validity of an easement by prescription and the impact of the original deed's conditions on the current situation.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Easement by Prescription:**\n   - The neighbor used a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm openly, visibly, and notoriously from 1979 to 2000, which is a period of 21 years.\n   - The period of prescription in this jurisdiction is 20 years. Therefore, the neighbor has established a prescriptive easement over the used portion of the 10-acre tract.\n\n2. **Negative Restriction in Original Deed:**\n   - The original deed conveyed the land to the town development association with the condition that the land be used solely for skiing purposes.\n   - If the land is not used as a ski resort, it reverts to the grantor (the landowner) or their heirs/assigns.\n\n3. **Death of Landowner and Notice to Town Development Association:**\n   - The landowner died on April 15, 2000, and his wife became the sole heir.\n   - The wife notified the town development association that granting the easement would cause the land to revert to her.\n\n### Legal Considerations:\n\n- **Prescriptive Easement:** The neighbor's continuous use for over 20 years establishes a valid prescriptive easement. This easement is independent of the original deed's conditions and is appurtenant to the neighbor's farm.\n- **Negative Restriction:** The negative restriction in the original deed does not affect the validity of the prescriptive easement. The easement is based on the neighbor's long-term use, not on the original deed's terms.\n- **Reversionary Interest:** The wife's notice about the reversionary interest does not negate the prescriptive easement already established by the neighbor.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these considerations, the prescriptive easement established by the neighbor is valid and enforceable. The skier, who is purchasing the farm from the neighbor, would inherit this easement. Therefore, the judgment should be in favor of the skier.\n\n**Final Answer: C. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.**"
