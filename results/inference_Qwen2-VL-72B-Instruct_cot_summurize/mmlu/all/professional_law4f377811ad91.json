Pete is incensed because it will probably take years to use up the inventory of so many toilets and seeks your advice. The best advice is\n\nA. Bill can bind the partnership by his act.\nB. silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership.\nC. unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are \"on notice\" that he is unauthorized to contract for the partnership.\nD. Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\n"

Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\n\nIn a general partnership, silent partners typically do not have authority to make decisions or enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership without express authorization from the active partners. Since Bill has been uninvolved in the management of the business for six years and made a significant purchase without Pete's consent, it is likely that he exceeded his authority. As such, the purchase could potentially be set aside if it was made without proper authorization."
