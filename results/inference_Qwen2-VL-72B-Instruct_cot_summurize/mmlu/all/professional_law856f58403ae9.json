Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2002, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2008, a man who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder placed a mobile home on his property. A woman who owns a lot in the subdivision initiates suit against the man to force him to remove the mobile home. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement of law?\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land. \"\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n"

The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a developer creates a subdivision and imposes restrictions (such as the prohibition of mobile homes) on the initial parcels, those restrictions can generally be enforced against subsequent owners if they are part of a common development scheme. This means that even if the specific restriction is not included in the deeds of later purchasers, it may still be enforceable if it was part of the original plan and was intended to apply uniformly across the entire subdivision.\n\nIn this case, the original developer imposed the mobile home restriction on the first 60 lots, and the builder who purchased the remaining 40 lots was subject to the same restriction. Although the later deeds did not explicitly include the mobile home restriction, the fact that the restriction was part of the original subdivision plan and was intended to apply to all lots suggests that it could be considered part of a common development scheme. Therefore, the restriction would likely be enforceable against the man who placed the mobile home on his property, even though his deed did not specifically mention it."
