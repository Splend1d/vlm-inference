Establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem\n\nChild interviews within a multimethod model of assessment are particularly useful for establishing rapport with the child. This allows the interviewer to gain a deeper understanding of the child's perspective on the issues at hand, which can provide valuable insights into their experiences, feelings, and thoughts. While child interviews can also contribute to other aspects such as incorporating a strength-based perspective or providing an accurate timeline, their primary benefit is in building a connection that facilitates open communication and a more nuanced understanding of the child's viewpoint. Legal guidelines for comprehensive assessments typically require multiple sources of information, not just child interviews."
