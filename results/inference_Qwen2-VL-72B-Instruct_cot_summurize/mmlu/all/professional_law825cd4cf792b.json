All the witnesses at each bank had described a man with a gun who said, \"Get down on the floor and no one has to die today!\" Following a series of leads, the detectives in the case finally made an arrest. At the police station, the suspect was placed in a lineup. One of the victims observed the lineup, and after each of the six participants stated, \"Get down on the floor and no one has to die today,\" the victim identified the suspect as the perpetrator. The defendant's attorney subsequently moved to suppress the out-of-court identification, arguing that because the defendant was forced to speak, this violated his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, which had been invoked previously by the defendant. The police requirement that the defendant state at the lineup, \"Get down on the floor and no one has to die today\"\n\nA. invalidated the lineup.\nB. violated the defendant's right against self-incrimination.\nC. tainted the victim's identification of the defendant.\nD. would not prohibit the defendant's lineup identification from being introduced at trial.\n"

However, it does not protect against non-testimonial evidence, such as physical characteristics or actions that do not involve testimonial communication. In the context of a lineup, requiring a suspect to repeat a phrase is generally considered non-testimonial because it involves a physical act rather than a communicative act. Therefore, while it may be argued that the requirement to speak could potentially influence the witness's identification, it does not invalidate the lineup or violate the defendant's right against self-incrimination in the same way that compelling testimony would. As such, the lineup identification would likely still be admissible at trial."
