There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nB. Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.\nC. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nD. Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n"

This statement suggests that the perception of an increasing threat from TNC during the 1980s to 1990s was influenced by the military's reevaluation of its role after the Cold War. It implies that the concern might not have been based on substantial evidence but rather on a shift in strategic focus.\n\nB. This statement highlights a change in the nature of illicit markets, indicating that they have become more interconnected and embedded within the legal economy. This suggests a transformation in how TNC operates rather than its emergence as a new phenomenon.\n\nC. This statement posits that TNC is a reaction to economic disparities and environmental constraints. While it provides context for why TNC might be prevalent, it does not directly address whether TNC is a new phenomenon.\n\nD. This statement indicates that TNC has become more widespread and globalized, affecting more groups and countries. It suggests an increase in the scale and scope of TNC but does not necessarily imply that TNC itself is a recent development.\n\nBased on these analyses, none of the statements definitively state that TNC is a new phenomenon. Instead, they describe changes in the nature, scale, and scope of TNC, suggesting that while TNC may have evolved, it is not necessarily a recent invention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nNo, TNC is not a new phenomenon."
