This is because any number from 1,450 to 1,499 rounds up to 1,500, and any number from 1,500 to 1,549 rounds down to 1,500.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. 1,399 and 1,599\n- 1,399 rounds to 1,400.\n- 1,599 rounds to 1,600.\nNeither of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nB. 1,449 and 1,549\n- 1,449 rounds to 1,400.\n- 1,549 rounds to 1,500.\nOnly one of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nC. 1,457 and 1,547\n- 1,457 rounds to 1,500.\n- 1,547 rounds to 1,500.\nBoth of these numbers round to 1,500.\n\nD. 1,489 and 1,589\n- 1,489 rounds to 1,500.\n- 1,589 rounds to 1,600.\nOnly one of these numbers rounds to 1,500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1,457 and 1,547."
