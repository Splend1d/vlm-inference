The congressional statute stipulates that the religious organization must use the buses to travel across America to spread the moral message of sexual abstinence to teenagers at school assemblies. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional grounds for invalidating the gift of the buses to the religious organization?\n\nA. The gift violates the equal protection rights of secular organizations.\nB. The gift violates the establishment clause.\nC. The gift is a taking of federal property without just compensation.\nD. The gift violates the commerce clause.\n"

The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from making any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" This means that the government cannot favor one religion over another or promote religion in general over non-religion. In this case, providing federally owned buses specifically to a religious organization for the purpose of spreading a religious message (sexual abstinence) at school assemblies could be seen as an endorsement of religion by the government, which would violate the Establishment Clause."
