Therefore, if variation is truly neutral, it should have no effect on relative fitness. The other options (nucleotide diversity, average heterozygosity, and our ability to measure the rate of evolution) can still be influenced by neutral variation because these metrics relate to genetic diversity and evolutionary processes, which can occur independently of fitness effects."
