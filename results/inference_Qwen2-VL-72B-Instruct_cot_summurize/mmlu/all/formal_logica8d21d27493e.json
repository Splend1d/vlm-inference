The argument consists of the premises:\n\n1. ~A \u00b7 ~B\n2. (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B\n\nAnd the conclusion:\n\n3. C\n\nLet's create the truth table step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the variables\nWe have three variables: A, B, and C.\n\n### Step 2: Create all possible combinations of truth values\nEach variable can be either True (T) or False (F). Therefore, there are \\(2^3 = 8\\) possible combinations.\n\n| A | B | C |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T |\n| T | T | F |\n| T | F | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | T |\n| F | T | F |\n| F | F | T |\n| F | F | F |\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the premises\nNow, let's evaluate the premises for each combination of A, B, and C.\n\n#### Premise 1: ~A \u00b7 ~B\nThis means \"not A and not B\".\n\n| A | B | ~A | ~B | ~A \u00b7 ~B |\n|---|---|----|----|---------|\n| T | T | F  | F  | F       |\n| T | T | F  | F  | F       |\n| T | F | F  | T  | F       |\n| T | F | F  | T  | F       |\n| F | T | T  | F  | F       |\n| F | T | T  | F  | F       |\n| F | F | T  | T  | T       |\n| F | F | T  | T  | T       |\n\n#### Premise 2: (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B\nThis means \"(A or C) or B\".\n\n| A | B | C | A \u2228 C | (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B |\n|---|---|---|-------|-------------|\n| T | T | T | T     | T           |\n| T | T | F | T     | T           |\n| T | F | T | T     | T           |\n| T | F | F | T     | T           |\n| F | T | T | T     | T           |\n| F | T | F | F     | T           |\n| F | F | T | T     | T           |\n| F | F | F | F     | F           |\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion is simply C.\n\n| A | B | C | Conclusion |\n|---|---|---|------------|\n| T | T | T | T          |\n| T | T | F | F          |\n| T | F | T | T          |\n| T | F | F | F          |\n| F | T | T | T          |\n| F | T | F | F          |\n| F | F | T | T          |\n| F | F | F | F          |\n\n### Step 5: Determine validity\nAn argument is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time. Let's check this condition in our truth table.\n\n- For row 1: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is also true (T).\n- For row 2: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is false (F).\n- For row 3: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is true (T).\n- For row 4: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is false (F).\n- For row 5: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is true (T).\n- For row 6: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is false (F).\n- For row 7: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is true (T).\n- For row 8: Both premises are true (T), but the conclusion is false (F).\n\nIn rows 2, 4, 6, and 8, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This means the argument is invalid.\n\n### Step 6: Identify counterexamples\nCounterexamples occur when both premises are true and the conclusion is false. We see these in rows 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n- Row 2: A is true, B is true, C is false.\n- Row 4: A is true, B is false, C is false.\n- Row 6: A is false, B is true, C is false.\n- Row 8: A is false, B is false, C is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe argument is"
