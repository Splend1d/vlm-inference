                    "text": "To determine the weight of the box on the Moon, we need to consider the gravitational force acting on it. The weight of an object is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = mg \\]\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the weight, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nOn Earth, the weight of the box is 80 N. We can express this as:\n\n\\[ 80 = m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( g_{\\text{Earth}} \\) is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2).\n\nNow, let's find the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon (\\( g_{\\text{Moon}} \\)). The gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two objects, and \\( r \\) is the distance between their centers.\n\nFor the Moon, the mass is \\( \\frac{1}{80} \\) that of Earth, and the radius is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) that of Earth. Let's denote the mass of the Earth as \\( M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) and the radius of the Earth as \\( R_{\\text{Earth}} \\). Then, the mass of the Moon (\\( M_{\\text{Moon}} \\)) and the radius of the Moon (\\( R_{\\text{Moon}} \\)) are:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{Moon}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{Earth}}}{80} \\]\n\\[ R_{\\text{Moon}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{Earth}}}{4} \\]\n\nThe gravitational force on the Moon can be expressed in terms of the gravitational force on Earth:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{Moon}} = G \\frac{M_{\\text{Moon}}}{R_{\\text{Moon}}^2} \\]\n\\[ g_{\\text{Moon}} = G \\frac{\\frac{M_{\\text{Earth}}}{80}}{\\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{Earth}}}{4}\\right)^2} \\]\n\\[ g_{\\text{Moon}} = G \\frac{M_{\\text{Earth}}}{80} \\cdot \\frac{16}{R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\\[ g_{\\text{Moon}} = \\frac{16}{80} \\cdot G \\frac{M_{\\text{Earth}}}{R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\\[ g_{\\text{Moon}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} \\]\n\nSo, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) that of Earth.\n\nNow, we can calculate the weight of the box on the Moon:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{Moon}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{Moon}} \\]\n\\[ W_{\\text{Moon}} = m \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} \\]\n\\[ W_{\\text{Moon}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 80 \\]\n\\[ W_{\\text{Moon}} = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the box on the Moon is 16 N.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 16 N."
