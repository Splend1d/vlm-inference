In accordance with the supplier's customary business practice, the sales agent then mailed the following confirmation letter, which he signed and dated:\"As per your telephone order, this letter serves to confirm the purchase of 36 dozen cashmere socks, color purple, size 10 \u0080\u009413, at the agreed price of $250 per dozen. Total sales price: $9,000. \"This letter was received by the man, who briefly glanced at it but failed to notice the \"36 dozen\" wording or the total price. The man placed the letter in his files and did not respond to it. Three weeks later, the supplier tendered 36 dozen purple cashmere socks, which the man rejected on the grounds that he had ordered only three dozen. The supplier resold the same purple cashmere socks to another buyer for a total price of $8,000. The supplier sued the man for the $1,000 difference. If the man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense, will such a defense be successful?\n\nA. Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\nB. Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.\nC. No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisf' the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\nD. No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.\n"

No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\n\nExplanation:\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), particularly Article 2, which governs the sale of goods, there is a requirement known as the Statute of Frauds. This statute requires certain contracts, including those involving the sale of goods valued at $500 or more, to be in writing to be enforceable. However, there are exceptions and provisions that allow for the enforcement of oral agreements under certain circumstances.\n\nIn this scenario, the supplier sent a written confirmation of the order, which is considered a written memorandum under the UCC. This memorandum satisfies the Statute of Frauds because it includes the essential terms of the contract (quantity, price, and description of the goods) and is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought (the supplier).\n\nMoreover, the UCC provides that if a party receives a written confirmation of a contract and has reason to know its contents, they must notify the other party of any objection to the terms within a reasonable time, typically 10 days. Failure to do so can result in the terms of the confirmation becoming part of the contract. Since the man received the confirmation letter, glanced at it, and did not object within the required timeframe, he cannot successfully plead the Statute of Frauds as a defense.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly states that the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, and the man's failure to object within the required timeframe means the defense would not be successful."
