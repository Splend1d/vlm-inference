It doesn't directly address the issue of voluntariness.\n\nB. **we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.**\n   - This suggests that while direct control over attitudes might be limited, there are indirect ways to cultivate and develop caring attitudes. This aligns well with addressing the concern about voluntariness, as it implies that one can influence their attitudes through other means.\n\nC. **when we fail to have attitudes of care this means that no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person.**\n   - This response shifts the focus away from the issue of voluntariness and instead suggests that the absence of caring attitudes indicates that such attitudes were not necessary. This does not directly address the objection regarding control over attitudes.\n\nD. **Collins agrees with the objection.**\n   - This option would mean that Collins accepts the criticism without providing any counter-argument or solution, which contradicts the idea of responding to an objection.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate response to the objection is:\n\n**B. we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the challenge posed by the objection but offers a practical way to address it by suggesting indirect methods to foster caring attitudes."
