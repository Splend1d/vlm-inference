This weight is due to the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the textbook. The weight \\( W \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ W = mg \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the textbook and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W_{\\text{sea level}} = 30 \\, \\text{N} \\)\n- \\( r_{\\text{sea level}} = 6,400 \\, \\text{km} = 6,400,000 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nOn the mountain peak, the distance from the center of the Earth to the textbook increases by 6,000 meters:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{mountain peak}} = 6,400,000 \\, \\text{m} + 6,000 \\, \\text{m} = 6,406,000 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe change in gravitational force due to this increase in distance can be approximated using the inverse square law. The ratio of the weights at the two altitudes is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{mountain peak}}}{W_{\\text{sea level}}} = \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{sea level}}}{r_{\\text{mountain peak}}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{mountain peak}}}{30 \\, \\text{N}} = \\left( \\frac{6,400,000 \\, \\text{m}}{6,406,000 \\, \\text{m}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \\approx 0.99875 \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.99875)^2 \\approx 0.9975 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{mountain peak}} \\approx 30 \\, \\text{N} \\times 0.9975 \\approx 29.925 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSince the options provided are not very precise, the closest estimate to 29.925 N is:\n\nC. 30 N\n\nTherefore, the best estimate of the textbook's weight on the mountain peak is:\n\nC. 30 N"
