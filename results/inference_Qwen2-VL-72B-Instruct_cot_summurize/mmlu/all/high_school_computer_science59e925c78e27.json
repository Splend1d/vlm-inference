Such systems can handle routine inquiries without human intervention.\n\nB. **The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call.**\n   - This statement suggests that every call will be handled by a human representative, which contradicts the purpose of upgrading to a more automated system. Upgraded systems typically aim to reduce the need for human intervention in handling routine tasks.\n\nC. **Customers are likely to spend less time listening to information not relevant to their issue.**\n   - An upgraded system with improved navigation and targeted responses would likely reduce the time customers spend on irrelevant information.\n\nD. **Customers will be unable to mistakenly select the incorrect department for their particular issue.**\n   - Enhanced systems often include better routing mechanisms to ensure customers are directed to the appropriate department, reducing errors in selection.\n\nGiven this analysis, the least likely benefit to be provided by an upgraded system is:\n\n**B.
