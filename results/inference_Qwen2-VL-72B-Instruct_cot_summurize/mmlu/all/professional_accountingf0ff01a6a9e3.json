Bonds**: These were classified as available-for-sale securities. The purchase of these bonds is considered an investing activity.\n   - Amount: $200,000\n\n2. **U.S. Treasury Bills**: These were classified as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are typically included under operating activities rather than investing activities because they are highly liquid and can be readily converted into cash within three months or less.\n\nGiven this information, only the purchase of the Otra Co. bonds ($200,000) should be reported as net cash used in investing activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $200,000"
