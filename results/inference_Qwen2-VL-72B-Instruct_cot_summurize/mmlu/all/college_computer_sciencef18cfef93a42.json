A set of Boolean operators is considered complete if every possible Boolean function can be expressed using only those operators.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. {AND, NOT}\n- AND and NOT together are complete because you can express OR using them: \\( A \\text{ OR } B = (A \\text{ AND } (\\text{NOT } B)) \\text{ OR } ((\\text{NOT } A) \\text{ AND } B) \\).\n\nB. {NOT, OR}\n- NOT and OR together are complete because you can express AND using them: \\( A \\text{ AND } B = \\text{NOT}((\\text{NOT } A) \\text{ OR } (\\text{NOT } B)) \\).\n\nC. {AND, OR}\n- AND and OR alone are not complete because there is no way to express NOT using just AND and OR. For example, you cannot create a function that outputs 1 when the input is 0 and 0 when the input is 1 using only AND and OR.\n\nD. {NAND}\n- NAND alone is complete because any Boolean function can be expressed using only NAND gates. This is known as functional completeness.\n\nTherefore, the set that is NOT complete is:\n\nC. {AND, OR}"
