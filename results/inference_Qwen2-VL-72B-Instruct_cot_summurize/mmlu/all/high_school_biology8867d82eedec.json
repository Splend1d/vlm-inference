                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic.\n- This statement is incorrect. Water actually flows from a hypotonic solution (lower solute concentration) to a hypertonic solution (higher solute concentration) due to osmosis.\n\nB. Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\n- This statement is incorrect. Germinating seeds typically use more oxygen as they become metabolically active and require energy for growth and development.\n\nC. The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement.\n- This statement is incorrect. Transpiration, which is the evaporation of water from plants, generally increases with an increase in air movement because it helps remove the water vapor from the leaf surface, driving further evaporation.\n\nD. Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\n- This statement is correct. In gel electrophoresis, smaller DNA fragments move faster through the gel matrix compared to larger fragments due to their size and shape.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D."
