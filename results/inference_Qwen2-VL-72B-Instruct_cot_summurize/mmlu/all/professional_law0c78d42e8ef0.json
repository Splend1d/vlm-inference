Two of the guests got into an argument, and one of them got up from the table and lunged at the other with a large hunting knife. The host stepped in with a baseball bat and hit the attacker in the chest with it, preventing the imminent contact by the attacker with his target. The blow knocked the attacker down and caused several broken ribs. The injured guest sued the host for aggravated assault and battery. Is the court likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a sufficient claim for relief?\n\nA. Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\nB. No, because the host's use of force was excessive under the circumstances.\nC. Yes, because the host has the privilege of host immunity.\nD. No, because the host escalated the conflict by getting involved.\n"

Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the host intervened to prevent an imminent attack on another person using a large hunting knife. The host's action can be justified under the legal principle of \"defense of others,\" which allows an individual to use reasonable force to protect another person from an immediate threat of harm. Given that the attacker posed a significant danger to the other guest, the host's intervention with a baseball bat could potentially be seen as a reasonable response to prevent serious injury or death. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim based on the privilege of defense of others."
