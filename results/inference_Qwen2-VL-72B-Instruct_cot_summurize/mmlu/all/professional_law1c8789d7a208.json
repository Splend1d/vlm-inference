The court will require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records.\n\nFor computer-generated business records to be admissible in court, they must meet certain criteria under the rules of evidence. The defendant's testimony that the records were kept in the ordinary course of business is a step towards establishing their admissibility under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. However, this alone may not be sufficient. The court typically requires additional information to authenticate the records and ensure their reliability. This might include details about how the records were created, maintained, and accessed, as well as evidence that the records are accurate representations of the transactions or events they purport to document. Therefore, the court would likely require a more substantial foundation to establish the authenticity and reliability of the computer business records before admitting them as evidence."
