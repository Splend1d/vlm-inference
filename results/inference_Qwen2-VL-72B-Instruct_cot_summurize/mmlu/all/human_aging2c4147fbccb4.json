While there are several theories attempting to explain the mechanisms of aging, such as programmed theories (e.g., genetic programming), damage accumulation theories (e.g., free radical theory), and others, no single theory can fully account for all aspects of senescence. It is likely that a combination of different theories will be necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the aging process."
