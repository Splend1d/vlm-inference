Factor VIII is subject to detergent \"washing\" prior to release.\n\nIn the United States, factor VIII products used to treat hemophilia have been treated with methods such as solvent-detergent treatment to inactivate viruses, including HIV. This process significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission through these products. Additionally, modern factor VIII products may also undergo other viral inactivation and removal steps during manufacturing, further enhancing their safety. While donor screening is an important part of the blood product safety system, it is the viral inactivation processes that have largely eliminated the risk of HIV transmission from factor VIII in recent years."
