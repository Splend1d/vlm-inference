                    "text": "The logical reasoning involved in this problem is understanding the relationship between environmental influences (in this case, exposure to songs) and innate behaviors (the development of species-specific songs). The context is based on experiments showing how the song development of a young male bird is affected by what it hears during its formative period.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Entirely learned during development**: If the song were entirely learned, then any song heard during development would be incorporated into the adult repertoire. However, the experiment shows that hearing a different species' song results in a lack of certain characteristics typical of his own species, suggesting that there are innate components that need to be reinforced or developed through exposure to conspecific songs.\n\nB. **Entirely instinctive**: If the song were entirely instinctive, then the young male should develop a full repertoire of his species' song regardless of what he hears during development. The fact that hearing a different species' song affects the development of his own species' song indicates that learning plays a role.\n\nC. **Both instinctive and learned**: This option suggests that the song has both innate and learned components. The experiment supports this because the young male develops some aspects of his species' song but lacks others when exposed to a different species' song. This implies that while some parts of the song may be innate, they require reinforcement or development through exposure to conspecific songs.\n\nD. **Dependent upon hormones for proper development**: While hormones can play a role in various developmental processes, the experiment focuses on the influence of auditory input rather than hormonal factors. Therefore, this option does not directly address the experimental findings.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is that the song of his species is most likely both instinctive and learned.\n\n**Final answer: C. both instinctive and learned**"
