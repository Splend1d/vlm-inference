However, the statement specifies that the policy does not negatively affect human beings, which might imply that Baxter prioritizes human interests over environmental concerns.\n\n2. **Option B: This policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem.**\n   - Similar to Option A, this option implies that Baxter values the ecosystem's integrity. However, it again assumes that Baxter places significant moral weight on non-human aspects of the environment.\n\n3. **Option C: This policy is morally obligatory because the environment ought not to exist.**\n   - This option seems extreme and unlikely. It suggests that Baxter believes the environment should not exist at all, which is an unusual stance and doesn't align well with typical ethical considerations.\n\n4. **Option D: This policy is morally unproblematic.**\n   - This option indicates that Baxter does not find any moral issue with the policy since it does not harm humans. If Baxter prioritizes human welfare above all else, this could be a plausible stance.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Baxter prioritizes human interests and does not find moral issues in actions that do not harm humans, then:\n\n**The final answer is D: This policy is morally unproblematic.**"
