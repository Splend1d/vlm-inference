Over time, typically within several months, these muscles can undergo atrophy, which is a wasting away or decrease in size due to disuse or lack of stimulation. This process occurs because muscle fibers require regular neural input for maintenance of their structure and function. Without this input, the muscles gradually weaken and shrink."
