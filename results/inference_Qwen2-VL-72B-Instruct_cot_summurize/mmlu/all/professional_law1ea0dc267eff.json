The friend was angry with the young man and decided to use the opportunity to get even with him by having him arrested. The friend said he would help, and that night, he drove the young man to the neighbor\u00d5s house. The young man broke in while the friend remained out-side. The friend called the police on his cell phone and then drove away. Police officers arrived at the scene just as the young man was carrying the TV out the back door. The jurisdiction defines crimes as at common law. Of what crime, if any, can the friend properly be convicted?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Conspiracy.\nC. Burglary.\nD. Conspiracy and larceny.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the crime for which the friend can be properly convicted, we need to analyze the situation based on common law principles.\n\n1. **Conspiracy**: Under common law, conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a criminal offense. For a conspiracy charge, there must be an agreement and some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. In this case, the friend agreed to help the young man steal the TV and drove him to the neighbor's house. This constitutes an agreement and an overt act (driving to the location), fulfilling the elements of conspiracy.\n\n2. **Burglary**: Common law defines burglary as breaking and entering into a building with intent to commit a felony therein. The friend did not enter the neighbor's house; therefore, he cannot be charged with burglary.\n\n3. **Larceny**: Larceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. The friend did not take or carry away the TV himself, so he cannot be charged with larceny.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The friend can be convicted of conspiracy because he agreed to help and took an overt act by driving the young man to the neighbor's house.\n- He cannot be convicted of burglary since he did not enter the building.\n- He cannot be convicted of larceny since he did not take or carry away the TV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Conspiracy.**"
