It is a hierarchical model that explains the stages through which a consumer goes before making a purchase decision. The model suggests that an advertisement must first capture the attention of the consumer, then generate interest in the product or service being advertised, followed by creating a desire for it, and finally prompting the consumer to take action (such as making a purchase). This model is widely used in marketing and advertising to understand how consumers respond to advertising messages."
