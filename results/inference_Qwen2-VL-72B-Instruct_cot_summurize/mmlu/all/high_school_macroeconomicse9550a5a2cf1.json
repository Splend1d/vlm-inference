According to this theory, an increase in the money supply leads to lower interest rates, which in turn stimulates borrowing and spending. This increased spending can lead to higher output and employment in the short run.\n\nHowever, Monetarists also argue that in the long run, increases in the money supply primarily lead to inflation rather than sustained increases in real output or employment. The theory suggests that the relationship between the money supply and economic activity is complex and involves multiple channels beyond just interest rates.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. because interest rates change and so do many other factors that affect spending.\n\nThis option acknowledges that while interest rates play a crucial role, there are other mechanisms through which changes in the money supply impact the economy."
