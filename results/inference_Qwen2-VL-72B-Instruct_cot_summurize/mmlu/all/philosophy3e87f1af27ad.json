Moore's ethical philosophy, particularly as presented in his work \"Principia Ethica,\" he argues for a form of ethical non-naturalism. Moore posits that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality or property that can be perceived through intuition. He distinguishes between intrinsic value and instrumental value, suggesting that when we think about something as being good, we are thinking about its intrinsic value\u2014its value in itself, not merely as a means to an end. Therefore, according to Moore, we are thinking about good whenever we think about intrinsic value."
