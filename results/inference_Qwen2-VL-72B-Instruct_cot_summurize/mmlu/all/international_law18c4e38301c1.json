Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute, there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals.\n\nIn international law, the jurisdiction of courts and tribunals is based on the consent of the parties involved in a dispute. There is no inherent hierarchy or priority among international courts and tribunals, as their authority is derived from the specific agreements or treaties that establish their jurisdiction. This means that the consent of the parties to a dispute determines which court or tribunal will hear the case, rather than any predetermined order of precedence."
