The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n"

No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nIn this scenario, the original lawsuit involves a claim between parties from different states (the shop owner from State A and the distributor from State B), which establishes diversity jurisdiction. When the distributor brings in the wholesaler as a third-party defendant, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over claims related to the original dispute. This means the court can hear the wholesaler's counterclaim against the distributor even if there isn't direct diversity between them, as long as it arises out of the same case or controversy as the original action. Therefore, the motion to dismiss should not be granted based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction."
