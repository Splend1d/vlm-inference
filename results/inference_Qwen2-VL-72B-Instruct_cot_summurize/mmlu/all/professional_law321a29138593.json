                    "text": "A company incorporated and headquartered in State A sued a plumber domiciled in State B in a federal court in State A, alleging that the plumber had negligently installed pipes in a manner that resulted in $250,000 in damage to the company's headquarters building. In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment, we need to consider several factors related to procedural rules and the circumstances surrounding the case.\n\n1. **Personal Jurisdiction**: The court initially denied the plumber's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, indicating that it found sufficient grounds to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. This suggests that the issue of personal jurisdiction has already been addressed and resolved in favor of the court's authority to proceed with the case.\n\n2. **Failure to Defend**: The plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action after the denial of the motion to dismiss. This failure to defend can lead to a default judgment being entered against the plumber.\n\n3. **Notice of Default Judgment Hearing**: The company notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. Generally, courts require reasonable notice to be given to the defendant before entering a default judgment. Whether three days is considered adequate notice depends on the specific rules of the court and the circumstances of the case. However, if the court finds that this notice was inadequate, it might be a basis for setting aside the default judgment.\n\n4. **Evidence on Damages**: The court heard evidence on the damages amount during an ex parte hearing (a hearing where only one party is present). While courts have discretion to fix the amount of damages even without hearing from the defendant, the adequacy of the notice provided to the defendant regarding the hearing on damages is crucial.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- Option A: \"No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\" This statement is true but does not address the issue of notice for the default judgment hearing.\n\n- Option B: \"No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\" This is also true but does not directly address the adequacy of the notice provided for the default judgment hearing.\n\n- Option C: \"Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\" This option directly addresses the potential procedural flaw in the process leading to the default judgment. If the court determines that the notice provided was inadequate, it may grant the motion to set aside the default judgment.\n\n- Option D: \"Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\" This option is incorrect because the court already ruled on the issue of personal jurisdiction and denied the motion to dismiss based on it.\n\nTherefore, the most compelling reason for the court to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment would be if the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.**"
