These craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury.\n\nMercury has an axial tilt of about 2.11 degrees, which means that sunlight never reaches the floors of some craters near its poles. These permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) can trap water ice because they remain extremely cold, even though Mercury's surface temperature can reach up to 430 degrees Celsius during the day. The presence of water ice in these PSRs was confirmed by data from NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft, which detected radar-bright areas consistent with ice deposits."
