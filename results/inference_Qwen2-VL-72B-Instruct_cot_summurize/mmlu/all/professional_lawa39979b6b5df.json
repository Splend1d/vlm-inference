The parties entered into a contract whereby the seller agreed to deliver to the buyer 1,000 flanges for $10,000. The contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller then delivered the flanges to a delivery company, which was to transport them to the buyer. While en route, the vehicle that was transporting the flanges was involved in an accident and the flanges were destroyed. When the buyer received notice of the accident, the buyer immediately contacted the seller and demanded that it ship replacement flanges. The seller refused to do so. In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\nB. succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\nC. not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\nD. not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n"

This means that any damage or loss that occurs after the goods leave the seller's premises is the responsibility of the buyer. Since the flanges were destroyed while they were in transit and under the control of the carrier, the risk of loss had already passed to the buyer. Therefore, the buyer would not succeed in an action against the seller for breach of contract due to the destruction of the flanges."
