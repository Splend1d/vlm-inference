Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nPublication of the first passage was followed by which of the political outcomes described below?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and historical background provided by the passages.\n\nThe first passage is from Olympe de Gouges' \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\" published in 1791 during the French Revolution. This document was a call for women's rights and equality, challenging the status quo of the time.\n\nThe second passage is from an interview with Halima Ghomri in the 1970s, discussing the aftermath of Algeria's war of independence. This passage highlights the lack of significant change in the lives of Algerian women despite gaining independence.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay.\n- This statement is incorrect because French women did not achieve political equality shortly after the French Revolution. Women's suffrage was not granted until much later.\n\nB. French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office.\n- This statement is also incorrect. French women did not gain the right to vote quickly after the French Revolution. In fact, they did not gain the right to vote until 1944.\n\nC. French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution.\n- This statement is not accurate. While the French Revolution did not immediately grant women equal rights, it did not necessarily lower their status compared to before the revolution.\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.\n- This statement is correct. French women did not gain full political rights, including the right to vote, until the mid-20th century, long after the French Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century."
