                    "text": "B. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will\n\nThe poem \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" by Du Fu provides insight into the experiences of soldiers during the Tang Dynasty, particularly focusing on the hardships faced by those stationed on the frontier. The poem highlights the constant state of unrest and the heavy toll of military service on both soldiers and their families. It suggests that the Tang Dynasty's relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples were characterized by the need for military presence and control.\n\nThe lines \"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen, And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west\" indicate the continuous deployment of soldiers to frontier regions. Additionally, the mention of \"the frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean\" implies frequent conflicts and the use of military force to maintain control over these areas.\n\nTherefore, based on the poem and historical knowledge, the correct answer is B. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will. This reflects the Tang Dynasty's strategy of maintaining control through military might rather than diplomacy, permanent settlement, or tribute payments."
