Unknown to the defendant, the girl suffered a fractured skull when her head struck the pavement. She subsequently died from her head injuries.

Under many legal systems, this situation falls under the \"felony murder rule,\" which states that if a death occurs during the commission or attempted commission of certain felonies (such as robbery), the perpetrator can be charged with murder.\n\nGiven the details provided:\n\n- The defendant intended to rob the victim.\n- During the robbery, the defendant punched the victim, causing her to fall and suffer fatal injuries.\n- The defendant did not intend to kill the victim but death resulted from the actions taken during the felony.\n\nThe most serious crime for which the defendant can be found guilty, based on these circumstances, is:\n\nB. Felony murder.\n\nThis charge reflects the principle that a death occurring during the commission of a felony can elevate the crime to murder, even if the death was unintentional."
