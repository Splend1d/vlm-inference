The reduced mass (\\(\\mu\\)) for a diatomic molecule is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{m_1 \\cdot m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two atoms.\n\nIn the case of HCl, one atom is hydrogen (H) with a mass of approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and the other is chlorine (Cl) with a mass of approximately 35 amu. For DCl, the hydrogen atom is replaced by deuterium (D), which has a mass of approximately 2 amu.\n\nSince the mass of deuterium is greater than that of hydrogen, the reduced mass of DCl will be higher than that of HCl. This increase in reduced mass leads to a decrease in the vibrational frequency of DCl compared to HCl. Therefore, the infrared absorption frequency of DCl is shifted from that of HCl due to the difference in their reduced masses."
