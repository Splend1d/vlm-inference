It would have involved compromising opposition to slavery\n\nLincoln opposed the southward expansion of the United States because it would have involved compromising opposition to slavery. He believed that allowing slavery to expand into new territories would strengthen the institution and make it more difficult to eventually abolish. Lincoln's stance on this issue was a key factor in his election as President and the subsequent outbreak of the Civil War."
