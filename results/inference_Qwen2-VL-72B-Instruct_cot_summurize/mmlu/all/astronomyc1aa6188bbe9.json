The solar flux \\( F \\) received by an object at a distance \\( d \\) from the Sun is inversely proportional to the square of the distance:\n\n\\[ F \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Earth's distance from the Sun: \\( d_{\\text{Earth}} = 1 \\text{ AU} \\)\n- Europa's distance from the Sun: \\( d_{\\text{Europa}} = 5 \\text{ AU} \\)\n\nThe solar flux \\( F_{\\text{Earth}} \\) at Earth is given as 1380 W/m\u00b2. We want to find the solar flux \\( F_{\\text{Europa}} \\) at Europa such that it equals \\( F_{\\text{Earth}} \\).\n\nUsing the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{Europa}} = F_{\\text{Earth}} \\left( \\frac{d_{\\text{Earth}}}{d_{\\text{Europa}}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{Europa}} = 1380 \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ F_{\\text{Europa}} = 1380 \\left( \\frac{1}{25} \\right) \\]\n\\[ F_{\\text{Europa}} = 1380 \\times \\frac{1}{25} \\]\n\\[ F_{\\text{Europa}} = 55.2 \\text{ W/m}^2 \\]\n\nFor Europa to receive the same solar flux as Earth (1380 W/m\u00b2), the Sun would need to be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{\\text{Earth}}}{F_{\\text{Europa}}} = \\frac{1380}{55.2} \\approx 25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Sun would need to be approximately 25 times brighter.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 25 times brighter."
