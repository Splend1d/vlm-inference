It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\n\nA. The Oxford Movement\nB. Materialism and economic determinism\nC. Hegelian idealism\nD. The rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment\n"

Materialism and economic determinism\n\nThe passage from The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels reflects materialism and economic determinism, which are central tenets of Marxist thought. This mode of thinking posits that the material conditions of society, particularly its economic structure, determine social relations, political institutions, and cultural norms. The emphasis on class struggle and the historical progression of societal structures from feudalism to capitalism, with the bourgeoisie and proletariat as opposing classes, aligns with these principles."
