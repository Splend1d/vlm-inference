                    "text": "To determine which statement is true for the given cyclical process involving an isobaric step, an isochoric step, and an isothermal step, we need to analyze each step and the overall cycle.\n\n1. **Isobaric Step**: In an isobaric process (constant pressure), the work done \\( W \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ W = P \\Delta V \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the constant pressure and \\( \\Delta V \\) is the change in volume.\n\n2. **Isochoric Step**: In an isochoric process (constant volume), no work is done since there is no change in volume:\n\\[ W = 0 \\]\n\n3. **Isothermal Step**: In an isothermal process (constant temperature), the work done \\( W \\) can be calculated using the ideal gas law:\n\\[ W = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of moles, \\( R \\) is the universal gas constant, \\( T \\) is the constant temperature, and \\( V_f \\) and \\( V_i \\) are the final and initial volumes, respectively.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n\"The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\"\n- This is not necessarily true because the change in internal energy depends on both the work done and the heat exchanged during all steps of the cycle. The isobaric step alone does not account for the entire change in internal energy.\n\n**Option B:**\n\"The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\"\n- This is also incorrect because the change in internal energy is determined by the net work done and heat exchange over the entire cycle, not just the difference between the work done in two specific steps.\n\n**Option C:**\n\"The total work done during the cycle is positive.\"\n- This cannot be concluded without knowing the specifics of the volume changes in each step. The total work done could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the direction and magnitude of the volume changes.\n\n**Option D:**\n\"The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\"\n- According to the first law of thermodynamics, for a cyclical process, the net change in internal energy \\( \\Delta U \\) is zero. Therefore, the net work done \\( W_{\\text{net}} \\) must be equal to the net heat transferred \\( Q_{\\text{net}} \\):\n\\[ \\Delta U = Q_{\\text{net}} + W_{\\text{net}} = 0 \\]\nThus,\n\\[ W_{\\text{net}} = -Q_{\\text{net}} \\]\nThis means the total work done during the cycle is indeed equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.**"
