The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine the proper tax treatment of the sale of the land by the AQR partnership, we need to consider the tax principles related to contributions to partnerships and subsequent sales.\n\n1. **Contribution of Land:**\n   - Acre contributed land with a fair market value of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000.\n   - This contribution does not trigger immediate taxable income for Acre or the partnership.\n\n2. **Sale of Land:**\n   - The partnership sold the land for $160,000.\n   - The total gain on the sale is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gain} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Adjusted Basis}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gain} = \\$160,000 - \\$60,000 = \\$100,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Allocation of Gain:**\n   - According to IRS regulations (specifically IRC \u00a7 704(c)), when a partner contributes property with a different fair market value and tax basis to a partnership, any gain or loss realized from the sale of that property must be allocated to reflect the difference between the fair market value at the time of contribution and the tax basis.\n   - In this case, the difference between the fair market value ($100,000) and the tax basis ($60,000) at the time of contribution is $40,000. This $40,000 represents the built-in gain that should be allocated to Acre upon the sale of the land.\n\n4. **Remaining Gain Allocation:**\n   - After allocating the $40,000 built-in gain to Acre, the remaining gain of $60,000 (\\$100,000 total gain - \\$40,000 allocated to Acre) should be shared equally among all partners according to their profit-sharing ratio.\n   - Since there are three partners sharing equally, each partner would receive one-third of the remaining $60,000 gain.\n\nTherefore, the proper tax treatment of the sale is:\n\n**The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.**\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.**"
