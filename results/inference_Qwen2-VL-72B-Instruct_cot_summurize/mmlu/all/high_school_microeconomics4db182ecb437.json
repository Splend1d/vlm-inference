                    "text": "To determine how these two events will affect the equilibrium price and quantity of pineapples, let's analyze each event separately and then combine their effects.\n\n1. **Drought Affecting Pineapple Supply:**\n   - A drought would reduce the supply of pineapples. This means the supply curve shifts to the left.\n   - When the supply decreases, at any given price, fewer pineapples are available. This typically leads to an increase in the equilibrium price because demand remains unchanged while supply decreases.\n   - The equilibrium quantity would decrease as well because the intersection point between the new supply curve (shifted to the left) and the unchanged demand curve results in a lower quantity.\n\n2. **Discovery That May Assist in Avoiding Cancer:**\n   - If there is a discovery that pineapples can help avoid cancer, it increases the demand for pineapples. This means the demand curve shifts to the right.\n   - An increase in demand, at any given price, means more people want to buy pineapples. This typically leads to an increase in both the equilibrium price and quantity because the intersection point between the unchanged supply curve and the new demand curve (shifted to the right) results in higher prices and quantities.\n\n**Combining Both Effects:**\n\n- **Supply Decrease Due to Drought:** This alone would lead to an increase in price and a decrease in quantity.\n- **Demand Increase Due to Health Discovery:** This alone would lead to an increase in both price and quantity.\n\nWhen combining these two effects:\n- **Price:** Both events suggest an increase in price. Therefore, the equilibrium price will likely increase.\n- **Quantity:** The effect on quantity is less clear because the decrease in supply due to the drought works against the increase in demand due to the health discovery. Without knowing the relative magnitudes of these shifts, we cannot definitively say whether the equilibrium quantity will increase or decrease. It could either increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on which shift is stronger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Decreases         Indeterminate"
