This implies that every non-zero element of \\( R \\) generates the entire ring as a right ideal. However, this does not necessarily imply that \\( R \\) is commutative. For example, consider the ring of \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrices over a field, which is not commutative but still satisfies the condition of having exactly two right ideals (the zero matrix and the full ring).\n\n### Statement II: \\( R \\) is a division ring.\nIf \\( R \\) has exactly two right ideals, it means that every non-zero element of \\( R \\) generates the entire ring as a right ideal. This implies that every non-zero element must have a right inverse because if \\( x \\in R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\), then there exists some \\( y \\in R \\) such that \\( xy = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( R \\) must indeed be a division ring.\n\n### Statement III: \\( R \\) is infinite.\nThe number of right ideals in a ring does not directly correlate with whether the ring is finite or infinite. For instance, the finite field \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\) (where \\( p \\) is a prime) has exactly two right ideals (the zero ideal and the whole ring), yet it is finite. Thus, \\( R \\) being infinite is not a necessary condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
