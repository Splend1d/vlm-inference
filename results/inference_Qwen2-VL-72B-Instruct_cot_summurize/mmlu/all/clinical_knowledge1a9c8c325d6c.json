Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n\nThe Early Warning Score (EWS) is a clinical tool used to identify patients at risk of deterioration, particularly in the context of acute illness. It is not limited to specific age groups, departments, or previous care settings but is applicable to any patient who is acutely unwell, including those before or after surgery, especially if they have undergone major surgery. The EWS helps healthcare professionals to recognize early signs of patient deterioration and respond promptly with appropriate interventions."
