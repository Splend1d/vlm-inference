Tracking the number of products reworked.\n\nInternal failure costs are those incurred when a product fails to meet quality standards before it reaches the customer. This includes costs associated with reworking defective products. By tracking the number of products that need to be reworked, a company can monitor and measure improvements in product quality over time. As product quality improves, the number of products requiring rework should decrease, indicating a reduction in internal failure costs."
