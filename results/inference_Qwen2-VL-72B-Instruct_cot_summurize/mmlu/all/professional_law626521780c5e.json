Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument is most likely to succeed in court because it addresses the infringement of fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. The \"American Morality Leadership Act\" imposes significant restrictions on personal appearance and clothing choices, which can be seen as an infringement on individuals' freedom of expression and autonomy. These freedoms are often considered fundamental rights under the First Amendment (freedom of speech and expression) and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (protection of liberty interests). Therefore, arguing that the law infringes on these fundamental rights would provide a strong constitutional basis for challenging the act."
