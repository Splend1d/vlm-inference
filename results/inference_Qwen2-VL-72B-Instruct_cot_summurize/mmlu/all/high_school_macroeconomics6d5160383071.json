Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve.\n\nExplanation: Production possibility curves illustrate the maximum possible output combinations of two goods that an economy can achieve when all resources are fully and efficiently utilized. When nations engage in free trade, they can specialize in producing goods for which they have a comparative advantage and trade with other nations. This specialization and trade allow countries to access a wider range of goods and services than they could produce domestically, effectively allowing them to \"consume beyond\" their own production possibility curves. Therefore, statement B is correct.\n\n- Statement A is incorrect because nations typically specialize and trade based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.\n- Statement C is incorrect because the flow of goods and services is based on the principle of comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.\n- Statement D is incorrect because protecting domestic industries from free trade would restrict a nation's ability to consume beyond its production possibility curve; it would limit the benefits of trade."
