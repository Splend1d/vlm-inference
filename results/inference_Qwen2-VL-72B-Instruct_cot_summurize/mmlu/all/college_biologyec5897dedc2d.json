High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass\n\nEarly-successional plant communities are typically characterized by rapid growth and high rates of primary production relative to the amount of standing-crop biomass. This is because these communities often consist of pioneer species that are adapted to exploit newly available resources quickly, such as light and nutrients, before competition intensifies. As a result, they tend to have high ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass.\n\nA. High niche divergence among co-occurring species - This is more characteristic of later successional stages where species diversity increases and niches become more specialized.\nC. High frequency of K-selected species - K-selected species are those adapted to stable environments and are more common in late-successional communities.\nD. High detrital biomass - This is more typical of later successional stages where decomposition processes are more active and detritus accumulates."
