This setup makes it more difficult for employees to fraudulently report their own hours because there is visual evidence of who is clocking in and out.\n\nB. **Errors in employees' overtime computation**: The new system does not directly address the computational aspect of overtime. While it may improve the accuracy of recorded hours, it doesn't necessarily reduce errors in the calculation of overtime, which could still occur due to human error or software issues.\n\nC. **Inaccurate accounting of employees' hours**: The use of identification numbers and video cameras should help reduce inaccuracies in accounting for employees' hours by providing clear records of when they clock in and out.\n\nD. **Recording of other employees' hours**: The requirement to select an identification number and the presence of a video camera make it harder for one employee to record another employee's hours without being detected.\n\nGiven this analysis, the exposure that the new system is expected to change the least is:\n\n**B. Errors in employees' overtime computation**\n\nThe new system primarily addresses the recording and verification of hours worked but does not inherently reduce errors in the subsequent calculation of overtime."
