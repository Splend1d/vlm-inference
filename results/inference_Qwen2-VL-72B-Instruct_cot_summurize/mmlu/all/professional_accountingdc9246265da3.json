The total variable cost includes both the variable manufacturing cost and the variable selling and distribution costs.\n\nLet \\( V \\) be the variable manufacturing cost per unit. Then the total variable cost per unit is:\n\nTotal Variable Cost per Unit = Variable Manufacturing Cost + Variable Selling and Distribution Costs\n= \\( V \\) + $3.00\n\nSince the contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and the total variable cost per unit:\n\nSelling Price - Total Variable Cost per Unit = Contribution Margin\n$19.00 - (\\( V \\) + $3.00) = $3.80\n\nNow, solve for \\( V \\):\n\n$19.00 - $3.00 - $3.80 = \\( V \\)\n$12.20 = \\( V \\)\n\nTherefore, the target variable manufacturing cost is $12.20.\n\nThe correct answer is A. $12.20."
