Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\nD.

No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThis method of selecting every twenty-fifth student as they enter the school is known as systematic sampling. While it can be effective and efficient, it does not guarantee that every possible sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected, which is a requirement for a simple random sample. Systematic sampling assumes that the population is randomly ordered or that there is no periodicity in the characteristic being measured. If these assumptions are not met, systematic sampling can introduce bias into the results."
