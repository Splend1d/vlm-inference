Let's correct this oversight by considering all combinations:\n\n- \\(n = 2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(n = 2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(n = 2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(n = 2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 10\\)\n- \\(n = 2^2 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(n = 2^2 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 20\\)\n\nSumming these values gives us:\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 42\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 42."
