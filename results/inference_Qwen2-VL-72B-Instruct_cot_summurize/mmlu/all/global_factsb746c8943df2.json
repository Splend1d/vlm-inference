However, it might be too high given the diversification of the Indian economy into other sectors like manufacturing and services.\n\n4. **Option D: 64%**\n   - This is extremely high and unrealistic for a country with a diversified economy like India.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most reasonable and historically accurate option is:\n\n**B. 16%**\n\nTherefore, as of 2015, agriculture made up about 16% of the total Indian GDP."
