However, the primary issue was not the lack of examination but rather the overwhelming number of cases.\n\nB. \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because the workload had increased.\"\n- This statement accurately reflects one of the main reasons for the need for reform: an increased workload due to more cases being submitted.\n\nC. \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it was a part-time court that could not process the growing number of complaints.\"\n- The European Court of Human Rights was never a part-time court; it has always been a full-time institution. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because of the growth in the number of individuals who could access the Court after the increase in the number of member states.\"\n- This statement correctly identifies another reason for the need for reform: the expansion of the number of member states leading to more individuals having access to the court and thus increasing the number of complaints.\n\nBased on the analysis, the false statement is:\n\nC. \"In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it was a part-time court that could not process the growing number of complaints.\""
