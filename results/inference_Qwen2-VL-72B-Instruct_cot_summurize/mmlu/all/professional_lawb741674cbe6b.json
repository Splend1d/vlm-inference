No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, there is generally no legal duty to rescue or assist others unless there is a special relationship between the parties (such as parent-child, employer-employee, or doctor-patient) or the person creating the peril has a duty to mitigate the harm caused by their own actions. The absence of a legal duty to act means that a person who fails to help another in danger, even when they could do so without risk to themselves, typically will not be held liable for the consequences of their inaction."
