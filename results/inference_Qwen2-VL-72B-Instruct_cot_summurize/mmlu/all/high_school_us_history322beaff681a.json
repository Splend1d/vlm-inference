They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

Truman's speech emphasizes the importance of preventing the spread of totalitarian regimes, which he associates with conditions such as poverty, strife, and the loss of hope for a better life. This aligns with the concept of containment, a Cold War strategy aimed at preventing the expansion of Soviet influence and communist ideology. The policy of containment was designed to stop the spread of communism by supporting anti-communist governments and movements around the world."
