Let's define the events as follows:\n\n- \\( H \\): The event that a dog has heartworm.\n- \\( T \\): The event that a dog tests positive for heartworm.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- \\( P(H) = 0.10 \\) (the prevalence of heartworm).\n- \\( P(T|H) = 0.96 \\) (the sensitivity of the test).\n- \\( P(\\neg T|\\neg H) = 0.98 \\), so \\( P(T|\\neg H) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \\) (the false positive rate).\n\nWe want to find \\( P(H|T) \\), the probability that a dog has heartworm given that it tested positive.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n\\[ P(H|T) = \\frac{P(T|H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(T)} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate \\( P(T) \\), the probability of testing positive. This can be found using the law of total probability:\n\\[ P(T) = P(T|H) \\cdot P(H) + P(T|\\neg H) \\cdot P(\\neg H) \\]\n\\[ P(T) = 0.96 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.02 \\cdot 0.90 \\]\n\\[ P(T) = 0.096 + 0.018 \\]\n\\[ P(T) = 0.114 \\]\n\nNow, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n\\[ P(H|T) = \\frac{0.96 \\cdot 0.10}{0.114} \\]\n\\[ P(H|T) = \\frac{0.096}{0.114} \\]\n\\[ P(H|T) \\approx 0.8421 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm is approximately 84%.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 84%."
