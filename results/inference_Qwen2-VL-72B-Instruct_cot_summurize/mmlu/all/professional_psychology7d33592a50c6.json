They may push away or ignore attempts by their caregiver to provide comfort or reassurance, even though they appear anxious or distressed. This pattern can be indicative of a history where the child's needs for comfort and security have not been consistently met, leading to a reluctance to seek or accept comfort from the caregiver.\n\nSecurely attached children (Option A) would typically seek comfort from their caregiver when distressed and feel secure enough to explore their environment with the caregiver nearby.\n\nInsecure resistant children (Option C) would show distress when their caregiver leaves but also resist comfort upon reunion, often appearing angry or ambivalent.\n\nInsecure disorganized children (Option D) exhibit a mix of contradictory behaviors, often appearing confused or dazed, and may show a lack of a coherent strategy for dealing with stress or seeking comfort.\n\nGiven the specific behaviors described\u2014pushing the mother away and not engaging in hugs, while showing anxiety but looking away\u2014the most fitting description is an insecure avoidant attachment style."
