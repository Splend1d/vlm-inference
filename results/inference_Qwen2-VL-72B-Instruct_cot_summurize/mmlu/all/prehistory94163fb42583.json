However, the analysis of animal teeth does not necessarily indicate where the animals were raised; it could only tell us what types of animals were present.\n\nB. **They brought animals to the site from outside of the region.**\n   - This option implies that the animals found in the area were not locally sourced but came from elsewhere. The analysis of animal teeth could potentially reveal this if isotopic or genetic evidence indicated non-local origins.\n\nC. **They had no domesticated animals but hunted wild animals for meat.**\n   - This option suggests that the people relied solely on hunting rather than farming. The presence of domesticated animal teeth would contradict this.\n\nD. **They hunted antelope, gazelle, and bear.**\n   - This option specifies certain wild animals that were hunted. The analysis of animal teeth could confirm the presence of these species if their remains were identified.\n\nGiven the options, the most plausible inference based on the analysis of animal teeth is:\n\n**B. They brought animals to the site from outside of the region.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that isotopic or genetic analysis of teeth could reveal whether the animals were local or came from distant areas."
