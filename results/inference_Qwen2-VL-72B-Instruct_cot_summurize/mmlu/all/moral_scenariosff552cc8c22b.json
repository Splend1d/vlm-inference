Bleach is a toxic substance that can cause severe chemical burns, respiratory problems, and even death if ingested. This action is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the health and well-being of the child.\n\n**Scenario 2: I presented the credit card I found in the lobby to stay at the pricey hotel.**\n- Using a found credit card without permission is considered theft or fraud. It is morally wrong because it involves taking advantage of someone else's property without their consent and potentially causing financial harm to the owner of the card.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
