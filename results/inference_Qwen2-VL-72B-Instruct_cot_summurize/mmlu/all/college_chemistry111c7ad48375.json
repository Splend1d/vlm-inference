Neon melts at -248.6\u00b0C, while argon melts at -189.3\u00b0C.\n\nB. **Boiling point**: Argon also has a higher boiling point than neon. Neon boils at -246.1\u00b0C, whereas argon boils at -185.7\u00b0C.\n\nC. **Polarizability**: Polarizability generally increases with atomic size and number of electrons. Since argon is larger and has more electrons than neon, its polarizability is higher.\n\nD. **First ionization energy**: The first ionization energy decreases as you move down a group in the periodic table. Neon (Group 18) has a higher first ionization energy than argon because it is above argon in the same group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. First ionization energy"
