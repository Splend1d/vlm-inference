In this case, the bank is required to reserve $50 out of $500 in checking deposits, so the reserve ratio is 10%.\nExcess reserves are the amount of reserves that a bank holds above the required reserve level. In this case, the bank has $50 in required reserves and $500 in total deposits, so it has $450 in excess reserves.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 10 percent $450 in excess reserves."
