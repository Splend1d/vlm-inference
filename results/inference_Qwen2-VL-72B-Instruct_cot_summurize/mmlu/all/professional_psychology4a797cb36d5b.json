To reduce this discomfort, individuals may change their beliefs to align with their actions. In the context of forced compliance, if an individual complies with a request for a small reward, they are more likely to change their beliefs to justify the behavior because the small reward does not sufficiently justify the effort or discomfort of complying. This leads to greater belief change compared to situations where compliance is accompanied by a large reward, which can serve as sufficient justification for the behavior without needing to change one's beliefs."
