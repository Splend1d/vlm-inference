There is a rearrangement \\(a_{i_k}\\) of the terms such that \\(\\sum a_{i_k} = 4\\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- If \\(\\sum |a_i|\\) diverges, it means that the series of absolute values does not converge to a finite number.\n- The fact that \\(\\sum a_i = 2\\) indicates that the series converges conditionally (since the absolute series diverges).\n- For a conditionally convergent series, the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem states that the series can be rearranged to converge to any real number or even to diverge.\n\nGiven this theorem, it is indeed possible to rearrange the terms of the series so that it sums up to 4. Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2:\nThere exists metric spaces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with \\(X\\) closed and bounded and a continuous mapping \\(f : X \\rightarrow Y\\) such that \\(f(X)\\) is NOT \"closed and bounded\".\n\n**Analysis:**\n- A closed and bounded set in a metric space is compact if the space is complete (e.g., in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) under the standard metric).\n- According to the Heine-Borel theorem, in Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n- Continuous functions preserve compactness. That is, if \\(X\\) is compact and \\(f\\) is continuous, then \\(f(X)\\) is also compact.\n- Compact sets in metric spaces are closed and bounded.\n\nTherefore, if \\(X\\) is closed and bounded, and \\(f\\) is continuous, then \\(f(X)\\) must also be closed and bounded. Hence, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **B. True, False**."
