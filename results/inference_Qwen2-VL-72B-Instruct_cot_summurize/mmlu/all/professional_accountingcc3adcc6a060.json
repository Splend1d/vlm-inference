                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\n\nWhen an auditor lacks independence, they cannot issue any type of audit opinion because independence is a fundamental requirement for conducting an audit. Independence ensures that the auditor can provide an unbiased and objective opinion on the financial statements. If independence is compromised, the integrity of the audit process is called into question, and therefore no audit opinion can be issued, including a qualified opinion.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options do not necessarily preclude issuing a qualified opinion:\n\nB. Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory: This situation could lead to a qualified or adverse opinion if the auditor concludes that the scope limitation (inability to observe inventory) is material and pervasive enough to affect the financial statements significantly. However, it does not automatically prevent the issuance of a qualified opinion.\n\nC. The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements: This would typically result in a departure from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which could lead to a qualified opinion if the auditor determines that the omission is material but not pervasive. In some cases, it might even lead to an adverse opinion if the omission is considered pervasive.\n\nD. The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary: This is a common practice when the financial statements include actuarial valuations, such as those related to pensions or insurance liabilities. The auditor would typically disclaim responsibility for the actuarial calculations while expressing an opinion on the overall financial statements. This does not preclude the issuance of a qualified opinion; it simply means that the auditor is acknowledging reliance on the work of another specialist.\n\nIn summary, lack of independence is the only scenario listed where an auditor cannot issue any type of audit opinion, including a qualified opinion."
