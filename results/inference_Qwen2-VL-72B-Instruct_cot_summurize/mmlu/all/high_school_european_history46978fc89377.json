It reflects imperialist attitudes prevalent at the time.\n\n2. **Analyzing Key Lines**:\n   - \"Half-devil and half-child\": This line suggests that the native peoples are seen as primitive and uncivilized.\n   - \"To serve your captives' need\": This implies that the British have a duty to civilize and care for these people.\n   - \"The savage wars of peace\": This indicates that the native peoples are seen as inherently violent and uncivilized.\n   - \"Watch sloth and heathen Folly\": This shows a view of the native peoples as lazy and foolish.\n\n3. **Evaluating Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"They are 'exiled sons' of the British race.\" This does not align with the poem's portrayal of the native peoples as uncivilized and inferior.\n   - **Option B**: \"While 'savage,' they fight wars for the sake of a lasting peace.\" This is partially accurate but misses the broader context of the poem's overall negative depiction.\n   - **Option C**: \"They are ready for conversion to Christianity.\" While this might be implied, it is not explicitly stated in the lines provided.\n   - **Option D**: \"They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.\" This accurately captures the poem's portrayal of the native peoples as primitive and uncivilized.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.**"
