However, he does not explicitly exclude any of the groups listed (human infants, the senile, or the mentally disabled) from having some form of moral standing. Instead, he suggests that these groups may have a different kind or degree of moral standing compared to fully rational adults. Therefore, the correct answer is D. none of the above, as Carruthers does not categorically deny moral standing to any of these groups."
