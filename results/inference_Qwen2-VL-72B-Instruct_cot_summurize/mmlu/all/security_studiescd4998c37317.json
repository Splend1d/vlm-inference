Ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but can also be a threat to other referent objects such as the economy.\n\nHIV/AIDS is considered a non-traditional security issue because it impacts various aspects of society beyond just individual health. It can affect economic stability, social cohesion, and even national security by straining healthcare systems, reducing workforce productivity, and increasing societal burdens. These broader implications mean that addressing HIV/AIDS requires a multidisciplinary approach that goes beyond traditional military or political security concerns."
