Assuming that the experiment is ethically sound and follows proper procedures, this action would be considered morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking one's son to get diagnosed as special needs solely for the purpose of obtaining a monthly Supplemental Security Income (SSI) check to spend on oneself is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This scenario involves exploiting a system designed to support individuals with genuine needs for personal gain, which is unethical."
