Decreasing the temperature:**\n\nSince the reaction is endothermic, decreasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium towards the reactants (to release the heat absorbed by the forward reaction). This will decrease the amount of \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\).\n\n**B. Increasing the size of the reaction vessel:**\n\nIncreasing the volume of the reaction vessel decreases the pressure. According to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, the system will respond by shifting in the direction that increases the number of moles of gas. Since there are more moles of \\( \\text{NO}_2 \\) than \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\), the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants, decreasing the amount of \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\).\n\n**C. Adding a selective catalyst:**\n\nA catalyst speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions equally, but does not affect the position of equilibrium. Therefore, adding a catalyst will not change the amount of \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\).\n\n**D. Making the reaction vessel smaller:**\n\nDecreasing the volume of the reaction vessel increases the pressure. According to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, the system will respond by shifting in the direction that decreases the number of moles of gas. Since there are fewer moles of \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\) than \\( \\text{NO}_2 \\), the equilibrium will shift towards the products, increasing the amount of \\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O}_4 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct answer is **D. Making the reaction vessel smaller**."
