Men are more likely than women to act aggressively in crowded conditions.\n\nResearch has shown that men tend to exhibit more aggressive behavior in crowded situations compared to women. This is not to say that all men will behave aggressively in such conditions, but statistically, men are more prone to display aggression when faced with crowding. It's important to note that individual reactions can vary greatly based on personal temperament, cultural background, and other factors."
