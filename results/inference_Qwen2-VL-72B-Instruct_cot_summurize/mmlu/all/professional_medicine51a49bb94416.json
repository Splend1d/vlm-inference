Surgical evaluation\n\nObstructive sleep apnea in children can often be caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids, which can block the airway during sleep. Surgical removal of these structures (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy) is a common and effective treatment for pediatric OSA. This procedure can significantly improve sleep quality and reduce daytime symptoms such as inattention and fatigue.\n\nWhile other options may also be considered or used in conjunction with surgery, they are not typically the first-line treatment for pediatric OSA:\n\nA. Elevation of the head of the bed might help slightly, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue fully.\nB. Heart rate and apnea monitoring are diagnostic tools rather than treatments.\nC. Imipramine is an antidepressant medication and is not indicated for the treatment of OSA in children.\n\nTherefore, the best initial step in managing this child's OSA would be to refer him for a surgical evaluation."
