Since there are three numbers, the median is simply the second number:\nMedian = 3\n\nNow, let's add the number 6 to the list and recalculate the mean and median for the new list: 1, 3, 3, 6.\n\nThe new mean is:\nNew Mean = (1 + 3 + 3 + 6) / 4 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\nThe new median is the average of the two middle numbers since there are now four numbers:\nNew Median = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nComparing the old and new values:\n\n- The old mean was approximately 2.33, and the new mean is 3.25. So, the mean has increased.\n- The old median was 3, and the new median is also 3. So, the median has not changed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the mean would increase."
