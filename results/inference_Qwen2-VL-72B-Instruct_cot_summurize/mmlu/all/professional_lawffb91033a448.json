                    "text": "The scenario described involves a conveyance of property that includes a life estate and a remainder interest, followed by a subsequent conveyance with a condition subsequent. The homeowner conveyed his property to his cousin for life, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs seek to quiet title against the farmer who was granted the property with the condition that he continues to farm it.\n\nGiven this context, the most applicable common law doctrine in determining the ownership of the property would be:\n\n**C. Doctrine of Worthier Title.**\n\nThe Doctrine of Worthier Title is a principle in property law that states that when an owner conveys a fee simple estate to another person and reserves a lesser estate for himself or his heirs, the estate reserved is merged into the greater estate conveyed, and thus extinguished. In this case, the homeowner's heirs have a remainder interest, which is a lesser estate compared to the fee simple estate held by the farmer. According to the Doctrine of Worthier Title, the remainder interest of the homeowner's heirs would be merged into the fee simple estate held by the farmer, extinguishing the remainder interest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Doctrine of Worthier Title."
