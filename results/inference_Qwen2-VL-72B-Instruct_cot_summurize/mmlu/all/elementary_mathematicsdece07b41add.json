This means we are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.\n\nThe prime factorization of each number is:\n- \\(5 = 5\\)\n- \\(3 = 3\\)\n- \\(2 = 2\\)\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers. In this case, since each number is prime and only appears once, the LCM is simply the product of these primes: \\(5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 30\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of pieces of candy that could be in Lily's bag, allowing her to give an equal number of pieces to 5, 3, or 2 people, is 30.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 30."
