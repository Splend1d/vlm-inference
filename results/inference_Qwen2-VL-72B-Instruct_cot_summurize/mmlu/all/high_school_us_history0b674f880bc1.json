But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\nA. peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\nB. the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\nC. the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\nD. a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of Benjamin Franklin's statement:\n\n1. **Context**: The quote is from Benjamin Franklin's examination before Parliament in 1766. This period relates to the early stages of colonial discontent leading up to the American Revolution.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - Franklin discusses the distinction between \"external\" and \"internal\" taxes.\n   - External taxes (duties on imported goods) were not heavily disputed because they were optional and could be avoided by not purchasing the taxed goods.\n   - Internal taxes (like the Stamp Act) were seen as more oppressive because they were mandatory and directly affected daily life and commerce.\n\nGiven this historical context, the policy described most immediately led to:\n\n- The **Stamp Act Crisis**: The Stamp Act of 1765 imposed direct taxes on the colonies, requiring them to pay a tax on various printed materials. This act was highly unpopular and led to widespread protests and resistance among the colonists.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Peace between Indian tribes and white settlers**: This does not align with the immediate effects of the Stamp Act or the broader context of colonial taxation disputes.\n\nB. **The forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland**: This event, known as the Trail of Tears, occurred much later in the 1830s and is unrelated to the Stamp Act.\n\nC. **The first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River**: This treaty was signed in 1851, long after the events described by Franklin.\n\nD. **A negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years**: This also does not fit the immediate historical context of the Stamp Act and colonial taxation issues.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the options directly correlate with the immediate effects of the policy described by Franklin. However, the closest relevant historical event related to the Stamp Act would be the widespread colonial resistance and the eventual repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766 due to its unpopularity.\n\nTherefore, the best answer given the options provided is:\n\n**None of the above**."
