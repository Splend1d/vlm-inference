In this context, Butler's claim suggests that the most proper way to follow nature is to act based on one's conscience, which represents an internal guide for right and wrong actions. This aligns with the idea that following one's conscience leads to morally appropriate behavior, rather than simply acting on whims, passions, or desires."
