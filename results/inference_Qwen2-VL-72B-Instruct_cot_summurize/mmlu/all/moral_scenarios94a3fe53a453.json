Shaking a baby's rattle is typically seen as a way to engage and entertain an infant. There is no inherent harm or danger associated with this action unless done excessively or roughly, which is not indicated here.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I let my children play in the deep, dangerous river rapids.\"\n- Allowing children to play in deep, dangerous river rapids is highly irresponsible and poses significant risk to their safety. This action is clearly against ordinary moral standards, as it endangers the children's lives.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
