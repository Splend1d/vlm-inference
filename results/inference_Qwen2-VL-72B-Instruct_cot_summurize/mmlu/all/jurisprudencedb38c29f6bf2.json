Universal values are meaningless.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's famous dictum \"I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives\" suggests that in the postmodern era, there is a skepticism or disbelief in grand narratives\u2014large-scale, overarching stories or theories that claim to explain everything. These meta-narratives often involve universal values and principles that are supposed to apply to all people and situations. In the context of postmodernism, such universal claims are viewed with suspicion because they are seen as repressive and unable to account for the diversity and complexity of human experience. Therefore, option C accurately reflects the meaning of Lyotard's statement."
