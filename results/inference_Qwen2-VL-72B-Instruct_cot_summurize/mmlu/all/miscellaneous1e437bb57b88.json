Topics that are interesting for the students\n\nSelecting texts based on topics that are interesting for the students can significantly enhance their engagement in the classroom. When students find the material relevant and appealing, they are more likely to be motivated to participate actively in discussions, complete assignments, and retain information. While the other factors listed (instructional objectives, culture of the local community, and instructional reading level) are also important considerations, focusing on student interest is crucial for fostering an engaging learning environment."
