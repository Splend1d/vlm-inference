Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. There is a general failure to recognise the political and academic value of human security as a concept.\nB. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.\nC. The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\nD. Human security has become the dominant concept in understanding contemporary security studies. After the end of the Cold War, the state-centric security paradigm was made irrelevant and today there is a universal understanding that human beings and individuals within states should be the focal point of security.\n"

It recognizes that threats to security can come from non-military sources such as poverty, disease, and environmental degradation, and that these threats can be just as devastating as military aggression. While state-centric realism may still be relevant in some contexts, the concept of human security highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to security that takes into account the well-being of all members of society."
