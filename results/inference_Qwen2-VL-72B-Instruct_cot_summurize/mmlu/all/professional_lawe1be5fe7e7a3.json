The goal is to put the non-breaching party (the builder) in the position they would have been in had the contract been fully performed.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Total Contract Price**: $20,000\n2. **Costs Incurred by the Builder**:\n   - Framing: $9,000\n   - Materials not yet incorporated: $1,000\n   - Total Costs Incurred: $9,000 + $1,000 = $10,000\n\n3. **Additional Costs to Complete the Project**: $5,000\n4. **Resale of Unused Materials**: $1,000 (This reduces the builder's losses)\n\n5. **Expected Profit**:\n   - If the project was completed, the builder would have earned $20,000.\n   - Costs to complete the project: $10,000 (already incurred) + $5,000 (additional costs) = $15,000\n   - Expected Profit: $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000\n\n6. **Increase in Property Value**: $3,000 (This is a benefit received by the homeowner due to the partial construction)\n\n7. **Calculation of Damages**:\n   - Total Costs Incurred: $10,000\n   - Expected Profit: $5,000\n   - Loss Avoided (resale of unused materials): -$1,000\n   - Total Damages: $10,000 + $5,000 - $1,000 = $14,000\n\nTherefore, the builder is likely to recover $14,000 from the homeowner.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. $14,000, the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000)."
