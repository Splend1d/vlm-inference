Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n"

No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen Frost was declared incompetent, Long no longer had the authority to act on behalf of Frost. Incompetence typically results in the termination of an individual's ability to make legally binding decisions, including the authority of agents acting on their behalf. Therefore, any contracts entered into by Long after Frost's incompetence would not be binding on Frost or Frost's legal representative."
