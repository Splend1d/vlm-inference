This is because lenders want to be compensated for the loss of purchasing power due to inflation. As a result, they demand higher interest rates to ensure that the value of their returns keeps up with the rising prices. This upward pressure on nominal interest rates helps to protect lenders against the erosion of the real value of their loans or investments."
