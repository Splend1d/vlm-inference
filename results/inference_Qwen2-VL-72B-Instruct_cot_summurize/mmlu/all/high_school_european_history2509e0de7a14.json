The passage mentions \"the preceding period of troubles,\" which suggests there were conflicts before the edict.\n2. It states that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion should be restored and reestablished where its practice had been interrupted.\n3. It also permits those of the Reformed religion (Protestants) to live and abide without being molested or compelled to act against their consciences.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate inference is:\n\nD. Prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict.\n\nThe passage indicates that there were significant religious troubles before the edict, necessitating a declaration to restore peace and allow both Catholics and Protestants to coexist without hindrance."
