If \\( G \\) is a cyclic group and \\( H \\) is its homomorphic image under a homomorphism \\( f: G \\rightarrow H \\), then \\( H \\) must also be cyclic. This is because if \\( G \\) is generated by an element \\( g \\in G \\), then \\( f(g) \\) generates \\( H \\). Therefore, \\( H \\) is cyclic.\n\n### Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\nAn **Abelian group** (or commutative group) is a group in which every pair of elements commute, i.e., for any two elements \\( a, b \\) in the group, \\( ab = ba \\). If \\( G \\) is an Abelian group and \\( H \\) is its homomorphic image under a homomorphism \\( f: G \\rightarrow H \\), then \\( H \\) must also be Abelian. This follows from the fact that homomorphisms preserve the group operation, so if \\( ab = ba \\) in \\( G \\), then \\( f(ab) = f(ba) \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
