However, when a defendant raises an affirmative defense, such as insanity, the burden shifts to some extent onto the defendant to establish that the defense applies.\n\nThe burden of proof can be broken down into two parts: the burden of production and the burden of persuasion.\n\n1. **Burden of Production**: This requires the defendant to present enough evidence to raise the issue of the affirmative defense (in this case, insanity) so that it becomes a question for the jury or judge to consider.\n\n2. **Burden of Persuasion**: This requires the defendant to convince the jury or judge, by a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not), that the affirmative defense is true.\n\nGiven that the husband is pleading insanity as his defense, he must first produce sufficient evidence to make insanity a viable consideration in the case (burden of production). Then, he must persuade the jury or judge that he was indeed insane at the time of the crime (burden of persuasion).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion."
