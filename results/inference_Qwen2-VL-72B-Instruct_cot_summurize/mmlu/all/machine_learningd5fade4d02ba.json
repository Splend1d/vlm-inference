Specifically, RoBERTa's training data is often cited as being around 10 times larger than BERT's.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\"\n\n- **ResNeXt** (Residual Networks with Next) is an architecture that extends the concept of residual connections introduced by ResNet.\n- The original ResNet paper (He et al., 2016) uses ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions.\n- ResNeXt, proposed in 2017 by Xie et al., also uses ReLU activation functions rather than tanh.\n\nGiven this information, it is not accurate to say that ResNeXts in 2018 typically used tanh activation functions.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
