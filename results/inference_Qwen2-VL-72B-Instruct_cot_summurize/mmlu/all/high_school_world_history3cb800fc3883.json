                    "text": "To determine which intellectual trend the passage from Albert Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" best exemplifies, let's analyze the content and context of the passage.\n\n1. **Understanding the Passage:**\n   - The passage expresses uncertainty about the existence of a transcendent meaning beyond one's own condition.\n   - It acknowledges the impossibility of knowing such meaning at present.\n   - It emphasizes understanding only in human terms, suggesting a focus on human experience rather than abstract or metaphysical concepts.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n\n   **A. A postwar reassertion of traditional religious values:**\n   - This option suggests a reaffirmation of established religious beliefs after a period of upheaval (such as World War II).\n   - However, the passage does not advocate for or support traditional religious values; instead, it questions the possibility of understanding transcendent meaning.\n\n   **B. An expression of patriotic pride thanks to victory in World War II:**\n   - This option implies a celebration of national triumph and pride.\n   - The passage does not mention patriotism or any specific historical victory; it focuses on existential uncertainty and human understanding.\n\n   **C. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities:**\n   - Modernism often involves skepticism towards traditional beliefs and an emphasis on individual experience and reason.\n   - The passage aligns with this by questioning the possibility of knowing transcendent meaning and focusing on human terms of understanding.\n\n   **D. An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism:**\n   - This option suggests a shift towards Marxist ideologies.\n   - The passage does not discuss economic systems, class struggles, or other themes typically associated with Marxism.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The passage reflects a modernist inclination to doubt and question traditional beliefs, particularly those based on faith, and to emphasize human-centric perspectives.\n\nTherefore, the passage is best seen as exemplifying:\n\n**C. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities**"
