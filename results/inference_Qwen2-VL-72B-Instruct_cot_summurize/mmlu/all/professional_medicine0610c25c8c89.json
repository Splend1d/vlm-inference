Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements\nB. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy\nD. Intraoperative angiography\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate management for this patient would be B. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity.\n\nGiven the patient's history of recent femoral-popliteal bypass surgery and the new onset of increasing pain, pallor, and coolness in the left foot with a weak popliteal pulse and a pulseless foot, it suggests a possible occlusion or thrombosis of the bypass graft. Doppler ultrasonography can help assess the patency of the graft and identify any areas of stenosis or occlusion that may require further intervention.\n\nBedside compartment pressure measurements (option A) might be considered if there were signs of compartment syndrome, but the symptoms described do not suggest this condition. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy (option C) could be considered if an acute arterial occlusion is confirmed, but it should not be initiated without first confirming the diagnosis through imaging. Intraoperative angiography (option D) is an invasive procedure typically performed during surgery to visualize the vascular system; it would not be the initial step in managing this patient's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, Doppler ultrasonography is the best initial diagnostic step to evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management."
