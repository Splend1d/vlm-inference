Time and motion studies\n\nFrank Bunker Gilbreth was an American industrial engineer who, along with his wife Lillian Moller Gilbreth, made significant contributions to the field of industrial engineering, particularly in the area of time and motion studies. They developed the concept of \"therbligs\" (Gilbreth spelled backward) which are the smallest elements of work motions that can be analyzed. Their work aimed at improving efficiency in the workplace by studying and optimizing the movements required to perform tasks."
