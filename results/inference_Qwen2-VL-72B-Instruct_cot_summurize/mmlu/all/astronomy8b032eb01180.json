                    "text": "To determine the total energy released during an impact, we need to consider both the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy involved.\n\n1. **Kinetic Energy**: The kinetic energy \\( KE \\) of the comet just before impact can be calculated using its mass \\( m \\) and velocity \\( v \\). The formula for kinetic energy is:\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\n2. **Gravitational Potential Energy**: The gravitational potential energy \\( PE \\) of the comet due to Earth's gravity can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ PE = -\\frac{GMm}{r} \\]\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the Earth, and \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the comet and the Earth. At the surface of the Earth, \\( r = R \\), where \\( R \\) is the radius of the Earth. Therefore,\n\\[ PE = -\\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\n3. **Total Energy Released**: The total energy released during the impact is the sum of the kinetic energy and the change in gravitational potential energy. Since the comet is moving towards the Earth, the potential energy decreases as it approaches the Earth's surface. Thus, the change in potential energy is positive:\n\\[ \\Delta PE = \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nThe total energy released \\( E_{total} \\) is then:\n\\[ E_{total} = KE + \\Delta PE \\]\n\\[ E_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nGiven that the comet impacts at the minimum impact speed, this implies that all of its initial kinetic energy is converted into the energy released upon impact. Therefore, the kinetic energy term \\( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\) should be considered along with the change in gravitational potential energy.\n\nThus, the correct expression for the total energy released in the impact is:\n\\[ E_{total} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the expression without explicitly providing \\( v \\), we focus on the gravitational potential energy component which is significant in such high-speed impacts:\n\n\\[ E_{total} \\approx \\frac{GMm}{R} \\]\n\nThis matches option C:\n\\[ C. 0.5*m*(2GM/R) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
