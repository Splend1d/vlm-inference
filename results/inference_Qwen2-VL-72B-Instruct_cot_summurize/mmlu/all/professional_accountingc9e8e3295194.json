However, it does not directly relate to the competence (knowledge, skills, and abilities) of the internal auditor.\n\nB. **The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor.**\n   - This directly relates to the competence of the internal auditor. Educational background and professional experience are key indicators of an individual's knowledge and skills in their field.\n\nC. **Whether policies prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed.**\n   - This pertains more to ethical considerations and potential conflicts of interest rather than the competence of the internal auditor.\n\nD. **Whether the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor.**\n   - This is relevant to the governance structure and oversight but does not directly address the competence of the internal auditor.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most relevant factor that directly assesses the competence of the internal auditor is:\n\n**B. The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor.**\n\nThis option focuses on the qualifications and background that contribute to the internal auditor's ability to perform their duties effectively."
