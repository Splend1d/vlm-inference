Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.\nB. Market analysts argue that the criminal alliances create organizations with a high level of wealth and power that far underestimates what government and official estimates attribute to them. Within this perspective the threat to the licit economy is vastly increased.\nC. Market analysts believe that white-collar and corporate crimes contribute significantly to undermining the licit market. Those organized crime groups are more prone to use violence and corruption than ordinary criminal groups as a result of the extent of profits invested in their activities.\nD. Market analysts claim that organized crime is highly disorganized, and resembles more a market for illicit goods and services than an organization. Proponents of this view minimize the threat posed by organized criminals to states and societies.\n"

Here's a breakdown of each option provided:\n\nA. **Market place scholars** view transnational crime as operating much like a capitalist marketplace. They emphasize the resilience of criminal organizations due to their size and the sophisticated networks they develop to collaborate and compete effectively. This perspective underscores the adaptability and persistence of these organizations despite law enforcement efforts.\n\nB. **Market analysts** focus on the significant wealth and power accumulated by criminal alliances, suggesting that these groups have resources and influence that surpass official estimates. This viewpoint highlights the substantial threat these organizations pose to the legitimate economy due to their extensive capabilities and reach.\n\nC. **Market analysts** also consider the impact of white-collar and corporate crimes on the licit market. They argue that organized crime groups, driven by substantial profits, are more likely to engage in violence and corruption compared to other criminal entities. This perspective emphasizes the broader societal and economic harm caused by these activities.\n\nD. **Market analysts** who take this view see organized crime as less structured and more akin to a market for illicit goods and services. They suggest that organized crime is not as cohesive or threatening as often portrayed, minimizing the danger it poses to states and societies.\n\nIn summary, the market vision of transnational organized crime encompasses a range of views from seeing it as a highly resilient and sophisticated network to a more fragmented and less organized market for illicit activities. Each perspective offers insights into the nature and impact of organized crime on the global economy and society."
