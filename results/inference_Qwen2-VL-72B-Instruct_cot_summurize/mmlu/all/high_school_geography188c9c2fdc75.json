These jobs bring income into the area from external sources.\n- **Non-Basic Employment Sector**: This includes jobs that serve the local population and do not generate income from outside the area. These jobs primarily support the internal economy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Software Engineer**: This role often involves creating software products that can be sold or used by clients outside the local area, contributing to the local economy through external income. Therefore, it is typically considered part of the basic employment sector.\n\nB. **F-10 Pickup Truck Assembly-Line Worker**: This job is involved in manufacturing vehicles that are sold both locally and externally. The production of these vehicles generates income from outside the local area, making this role part of the basic employment sector.\n\nC. **Oil Refinery Worker**: This role is involved in refining oil, which is then sold both locally and externally. The refined oil products contribute to the local economy through external sales, placing this job in the basic employment sector.\n\nD. **Parking Lot Attendant**: This job primarily serves the local population by providing parking services within the community. It does not generate significant income from outside the local area, making it part of the non-basic employment sector.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Parking lot attendant**"
