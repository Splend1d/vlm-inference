This occurs when \\(\\Delta n = 0\\), meaning there is no net change in the number of moles of gas in the reaction.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **At absolute zero for all reactions**: \n   - At absolute zero, all molecular motion stops, and chemical reactions do not occur. Therefore, this option is not applicable.\n\nB. **When the concentrations are at standard state**:\n   - Standard state conditions typically refer to 1 atm pressure and 298 K temperature for gases, but this does not inherently ensure that \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_c\\) are equal unless \\(\\Delta n = 0\\).\n\nC. **When the concentrations are all 1.00 molar**:\n   - The numerical values of \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_c\\) depend on the specific reaction and its stoichiometry, not just the concentration being 1.00 M. This condition alone does not guarantee equality.\n\nD. **When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume**:\n   - If there is no change in pressure at constant volume, it implies that \\(\\Delta n = 0\\). In such a case, \\((RT)^{\\Delta n} = (RT)^0 = 1\\), making \\(K_p = K_c\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume"
