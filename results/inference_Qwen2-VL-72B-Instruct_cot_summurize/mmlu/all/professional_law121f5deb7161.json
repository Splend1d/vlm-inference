At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\nB. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the company\u00d5s promise was supported by consideration.\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\n"

Yes, because the company's promise was supported by consideration.\n\nIn this scenario, the builder and the company entered into an oral agreement to modify the original contract due to unforeseen circumstances (the increase in the price of structural steel). The modification was supported by consideration, which is a legal term referring to something of value exchanged between parties that makes a contract binding. In this case, the builder provided the additional cost of the steel, and the company agreed to pay the extra amount. This mutual exchange of promises constitutes consideration, making the oral modification enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it is true that modifications to contracts are often required to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds, oral agreements can still be enforceable if they meet certain conditions, such as being supported by consideration.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there was indeed consideration for the modification, as explained above.\n\nOption D is not entirely accurate because fairness and equity are relevant considerations, but the primary reason the builder would likely prevail is due to the presence of consideration supporting the modification."
