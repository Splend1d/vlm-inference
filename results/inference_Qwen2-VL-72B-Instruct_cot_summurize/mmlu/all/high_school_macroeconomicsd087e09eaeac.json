                    "text": "An expansionary supply shock refers to a situation where there is an increase in the productive capacity of an economy, leading to an increase in aggregate supply. This can result from factors such as technological advancements, improvements in efficiency, or reductions in production costs.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Rapid increasing wages**: Increasing wages typically lead to higher production costs for firms, which would be considered a contractionary supply shock rather than an expansionary one.\n\nB. **A greatly depreciated currency**: While a depreciated currency can make exports cheaper and thus stimulate demand, it does not directly increase the productive capacity of an economy. It might indirectly affect supply through increased investment, but it is not a direct example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nC. **Declining labor productivity**: Declining labor productivity means that workers are producing less output per hour worked, which reduces the overall productive capacity of the economy. This is a contractionary supply shock.\n\nD. **Lower factor prices in major industries**: When factor prices (such as the cost of raw materials, labor, or capital) decrease, it becomes cheaper for firms to produce goods and services. This reduction in production costs allows firms to increase their output at lower prices, thereby expanding the productive capacity of the economy. This is an example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Lower factor prices in major industries**"
