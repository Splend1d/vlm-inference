Vitamin B12\n\nInfants born to mothers who follow a strict vegan diet may be at an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, as this nutrient is primarily found in animal products. It is essential for the development of the nervous system and the production of red blood cells in infants. Therefore, it is crucial for vegans to ensure they consume adequate amounts of vitamin B12 during pregnancy and while breastfeeding to prevent deficiencies in their infants."
