                    "text": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the electric field below an infinitely large plane carrying a uniform charge density \\(\\sigma\\), we can use Gauss's Law.\n\nGauss's Law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nFor an infinite plane, we consider a Gaussian surface in the shape of a cylinder with its flat ends parallel to the plane. The electric field lines are perpendicular to the plane, so the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is constant over the area \\(A\\) of each end of the cylinder.\n\nThe charge enclosed by this cylindrical surface is the charge on the plane within the area \\(A\\), which is given by:\n\n\\[ Q_{enc} = \\sigma A \\]\n\nThe electric flux through one end of the cylinder is:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = E \\cdot A \\]\n\nSince the electric field is uniform and perpendicular to the plane, the total electric flux through both ends of the cylinder is:\n\n\\[ 2E \\cdot A = \\frac{\\sigma A}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(E\\):\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nThis result holds true regardless of whether you are above or below the plane because the electric field due to an infinite plane is uniform and symmetric. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field below the plane is also \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}\\).\n\nHowever, the direction of the electric field below the plane will be opposite to the direction above the plane. Since the electric field above the plane points upwards, the electric field below the plane will point downwards.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{2\\epsilon_0}\\), down"
