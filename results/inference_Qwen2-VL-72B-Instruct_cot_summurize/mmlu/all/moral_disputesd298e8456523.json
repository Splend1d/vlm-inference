De Marneffe's response likely involves justifying why such prohibitions might still be considered acceptable or necessary despite the initial objection.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Fatty foods and tobacco products are not actually harmful.**\n   - This option contradicts common knowledge and scientific evidence that both fatty foods and tobacco products can be harmful to health. It is unlikely that de Marneffe would argue this point.\n\nB. **There is nothing wrong with limiting people's access to products that are harmful to them.**\n   - This option aligns well with the idea that if something is harmful, restricting access to it could be justified. This seems like a plausible argument de Marneffe might make.\n\nC. **The benefits of prohibiting these products would not outweigh the costs.**\n   - This option suggests that even though the products are harmful, the negative consequences of prohibition (such as economic impacts or infringement on personal freedom) might be greater than the benefits. This is another possible argument but does not directly counter the initial objection about the wrongness of prohibition.\n\nD. **All of the above.**\n   - Given that options A and C do not seem to be strong arguments for de Marneffe's position, this option is less likely to be correct.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most coherent and likely argument de Marneffe would use to respond to the objection is:\n\n**B. There is nothing wrong with limiting people's access to products that are harmful to them.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the objection by asserting that it is not inherently wrong to restrict access to harmful products, thereby justifying the prohibition of fatty foods and tobacco products."
