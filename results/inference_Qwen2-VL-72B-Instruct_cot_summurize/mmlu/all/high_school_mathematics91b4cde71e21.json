                    "text": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze the given function \\(f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18\\).\n\n### A. \\(f(x) = 0\\) has three real solutions.\n\nTo check this, we would need to solve the cubic equation \\(x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18 = 0\\). Without directly solving it, we can use Descartes' Rule of Signs or synthetic division to find out how many positive and negative real roots there might be. However, without specific calculations, we cannot definitively conclude the number of real solutions just by inspection. We'll come back to this after analyzing the other options.\n\n### B. \\(f(x) \\geq -18\\) for all \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\nLet's evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[f(0) = 0^3 + 2*0^2 - 9*0 - 18 = -18\\]\n\nFor \\(x > 0\\), since the leading term \\(x^3\\) dominates as \\(x\\) increases, and it's positive, \\(f(x)\\) will increase without bound. Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) will indeed be greater than or equal to \\(-18\\) for all \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n### C. \\(f(x) \\leq -18\\) for all \\(x \\leq 0\\).\n\nThis statement suggests that for non-positive values of \\(x\\), \\(f(x)\\) should not exceed \\(-18\\). Let's consider \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2*(-1)^2 - 9*(-1) - 18 = -1 + 2 + 9 - 18 = -8\\]\nSince \\(-8 > -18\\), this statement is false.\n\n### D. The function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\).\n\nTo determine if \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, we need to look at its derivative:\n\\[f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\]\n\nWe want to know if \\(f'(x) < 0\\) for \\(x \\leq -3\\). Let's evaluate \\(f'(-3)\\):\n\\[f'(-3) = 3*(-3)^2 + 4*(-3) - 9 = 27 - 12 - 9 = 6\\]\n\nSince \\(f'(-3) > 0\\), \\(f(x)\\) is actually increasing at \\(x = -3\\), and thus, it does not hold that \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct statement is **B. \\(f(x) \\geq -18\\) for all \\(x \\geq 0\\)**."
