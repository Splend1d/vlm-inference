If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's arrange the given numbers in ascending order:\n\n13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32\n\nSince there are an even number of numbers (6 in total), we take the average of the third and fourth numbers:\n\nMedian = (23 + 25) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24\n\nSo, the median is 24.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 24."
