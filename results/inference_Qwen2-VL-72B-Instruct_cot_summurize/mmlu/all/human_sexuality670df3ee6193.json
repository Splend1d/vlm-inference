They typically want to observe strangers' activities.\n\nVoyeurism involves obtaining sexual pleasure from observing unsuspecting individuals, often in private settings such as bathrooms or changing rooms. Voyeurs typically prefer to observe strangers rather than people they know personally. It's important to note that voyeurism can be illegal and invasive of privacy, and it is not considered a healthy or consensual form of sexual expression."
