These elements can include:\n\n- **Governmental Rules, Laws, and Penalties**: Establishing clear regulations and legal frameworks that govern the production, sale, transfer, and use of arms and related materials, along with penalties for violations.\n  \n- **Unique Marking of Defence Items**: Implementing systems where weapons and defence items are marked uniquely to facilitate tracking, tracing, and accountability.\n\n- **Stockpile Security Measures**: Ensuring that government police and military forces have robust security measures in place to protect weapons stockpiles from theft, loss, or unauthorized access.\n\n- **Collection and Destruction of Old/Outdated Weapons**: Establishing procedures for the collection and safe disposal of old, outdated, or excess weaponry to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nEach of these components plays a crucial role in maintaining national security and preventing the proliferation of arms to unauthorized entities."
