Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This act led to a significant increase in voting participation among racial minority voters, particularly in the Southern United States where discriminatory practices were prevalent."
