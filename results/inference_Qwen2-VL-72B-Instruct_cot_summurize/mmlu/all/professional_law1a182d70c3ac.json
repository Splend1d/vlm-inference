The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\n\nA. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.\nB. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nC. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\n"

No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\n\nWhen a state education agency acquires land through eminent domain, it typically takes a fee simple estate unless there is a specific restriction or condition attached to the transfer. Since the landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal, it suggests that the transfer was completed according to the legal process. The presumption is that the agency acquired full ownership rights, including fee simple title, unless otherwise stated. The fact that the agency did not use the land for its intended educational purpose does not automatically revert the title back to the original owner; such a reversion would require specific conditions or restrictions that were not mentioned in the scenario provided. Therefore, the appellate court is unlikely to rule in favor of the landowner based on the information given."
