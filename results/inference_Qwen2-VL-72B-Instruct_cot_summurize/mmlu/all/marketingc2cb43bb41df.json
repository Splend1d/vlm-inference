Experiential consumption.\n\nHedonic consumption refers to the purchase and use of products for pleasure, enjoyment, or emotional fulfillment rather than purely functional reasons. Experiential consumption focuses on the sensory, affective, and cognitive experiences that consumers derive from products, which aligns with the concept of hedonic consumption. The other options do not specifically address the experiential and pleasure-seeking aspects of consuming products."
