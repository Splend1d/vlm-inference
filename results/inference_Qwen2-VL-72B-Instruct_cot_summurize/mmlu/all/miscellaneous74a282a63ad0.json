This is a rough estimate based on historical data and practical considerations.\n\n3. **Efficiency of Steam Engines**:\n   - Old-fashioned steam engines had relatively low efficiencies, often around 5-10%. Let's use an average efficiency of 8% for our calculation.\n\nNow, let's calculate the power output:\n\n1. **Energy Input per Minute**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Energy input per minute} = 10 \\text{ kg} \\times 24 \\text{ MJ/kg} = 240 \\text{ MJ/min}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Energy Input to Watts**:\n   \\[\n   240 \\text{ MJ/min} = 240 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/min} = 240 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J} / 60 \\text{ s} = 4 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Account for Efficiency**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Power output} = 4 \\times 10^6 \\text{ W} \\times 0.08 = 320 \\text{ kW} = 3.2 \\times 10^5 \\text{ W}\n   \\]\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. \\(6 \\times 10^3\\) W\nB. \\(6 \\times 10^5\\) W\nC. \\(6 \\times 10^7\\) W\nD. \\(6 \\times 10^{11}\\) W\n\nThe closest value to \\(3.2 \\times 10^5\\) W is \\(6 \\times 10^5\\) W.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(6 \\times 10^5\\) W"
