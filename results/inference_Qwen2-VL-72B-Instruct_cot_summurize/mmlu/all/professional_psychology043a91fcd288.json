One day, Leticia's mother calls and says she is very concerned about Leticia and wants to know what she can do to help Leticia feel better about herself. Mrs. Lopez asks that you not tell Leticia that she has called. Your best course of action in this situation would be to:\n\nA. Give Mrs. Lopez the specific advice she has requested.\nB. Tell Mrs. Lopez to ask Leticia what she (Mrs. Lopez) can do to help her.\nC. Tell Mrs. Lopez that it would be best if you discussed this matter with Leticia.\nD. suggest that Mrs. Lopez accompany Leticia to her next therapy session.\n"

Tell Mrs. Lopez that it would be best if you discussed this matter with Leticia.\n\nAs a therapist, it is important to maintain confidentiality and respect the boundaries between the client and their family members. While Mrs. Lopez may be genuinely concerned about her daughter, sharing specific information or advice without Leticia's consent could undermine the therapeutic relationship and potentially harm Leticia's trust in the therapy process. It would be more appropriate to suggest that Mrs. Lopez discuss her concerns with Leticia directly or to arrange a family session where everyone can participate in the conversation."
