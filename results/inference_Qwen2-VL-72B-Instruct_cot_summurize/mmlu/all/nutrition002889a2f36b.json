This is because muscle glycogen can be rapidly broken down into glucose and used for energy through anaerobic glycolysis or aerobic metabolism, depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise. While liver glycogen can also contribute to energy production by releasing glucose into the bloodstream, it is not as readily available as muscle glycogen during intense exercise. Intramuscular lipids and adipose tissue lipids can also be used for energy during prolonged exercise, but they are not as efficient as glycogen at providing quick bursts of energy required during high-intensity activities."
