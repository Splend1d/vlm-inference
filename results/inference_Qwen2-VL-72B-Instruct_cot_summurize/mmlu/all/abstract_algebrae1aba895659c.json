Therefore, \\( Q \\) cannot be considered an extension field of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is false**.\n\n### Statement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field\n\nThis statement is a fundamental result in algebra known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra for fields. It states that any non-constant polynomial defined over a field can be factored into linear factors in some extension field. This implies that every such polynomial has at least one root (zero) in some extension field.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
