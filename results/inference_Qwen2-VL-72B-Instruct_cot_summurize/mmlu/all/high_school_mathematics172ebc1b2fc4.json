                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Alex would have to pay back under each option and then find the difference between these totals.\n\n### Option 1: Compound Interest with Partial Payment\n\nThe formula for compound interest is:\n\\[A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\(n\\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\(t\\) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.\n\nFor the first 5 years, the interest is compounded quarterly (\\(n = 4\\)), so:\n\\[A_5 = 10000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5}\\]\n\nAfter 5 years, Alex pays half of what he owes, so the remaining amount is also compounded for another 5 years:\n\\[A_{10} = \\frac{A_5}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4 \\times 5}\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(A_5\\) and then \\(A_{10}\\).\n\n\\[A_5 = 10000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20} = 10000 \\left(1 + 0.025\\right)^{20}\\]\n\\[A_5 = 10000 \\times (1.025)^{20}\\]\n\\[A_5 \\approx 10000 \\times 1.638617 = 16386.17\\]\n\nSo, after 5 years, Alex owes approximately $16,386.17. He pays half of this amount, leaving $8,193.09 to be compounded for the next 5 years.\n\n\\[A_{10} = 8193.09 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{20}\\]\n\\[A_{10} = 8193.09 \\times (1.025)^{20}\\]\n\\[A_{10} \\approx 8193.09 \\times 1.638617 = 13440.44\\]\n\nSo, under the first option, Alex would pay back a total of $16,386.17 + 13,440.44 = $29,826.61.\n\n### Option 2: Simple Interest\n\nThe formula for simple interest is:\n\\[A = P(1 + rt)\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the total amount after \\(t\\) years.\n- \\(P\\) is the principal amount.\n- \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate.\n- \\(t\\) is the time in years.\n\nFor the second option:\n\\[A = 10000(1 + 0.12 \\times 10)\\]\n\\[A = 10000(1 + 1.2)\\]\n\\[A = 10000 \\times 2.2\\]\n\\[A = 22000\\]\n\n### Difference Between the Two Schemes\n\nThe difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes is:\n\\[22000 - 29826.61 = -7826.61\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the positive difference, we take the absolute value:\n\\[| -7826.61 | = 7826.61\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the positive difference is approximately $7827.\n\nNone of the provided options (A through D) match this calculation directly. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the provided options. Based on the calculations, the closest match to the calculated difference is not listed among the given options."
