Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse\n\nThis feature suggests that the pulsation in the neck is arterial because applying pressure to the root of the neck (carotid sinus) can reduce or stop an arterial pulse due to the baroreceptor reflex, which helps regulate blood pressure. This maneuver is known as carotid sinus massage and is sometimes used to slow a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). The other options do not specifically relate to the characteristics of an arterial pulsation in the neck."
