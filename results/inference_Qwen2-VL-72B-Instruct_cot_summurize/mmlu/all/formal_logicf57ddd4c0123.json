Y \u2283 Z\n3. ~Z / ~X\n\nLet's create the truth table:\n\n| X | Y | Z | ~X | ~X \u2283 Y | Y \u2283 Z | ~Z | ~Z / ~X |\n|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|-----|---------|\n| T | T | T | F  |   T    |   T   | F   |   T     |\n| T | T | F | F  |   T    |   F   | T   |   T     |\n| T | F | T | F  |   T    |   T   | F   |   T     |\n| T | F | F | F  |   T    |   T   | T   |   T     |\n| F | T | T | T  |   T    |   T   | F   |   F     |\n| F | T | F | T  |   T    |   F   | T   |   F     |\n| F | F | T | T  |   F    |   T   | F   |   F     |\n| F | F | F | T  |   F    |   T   | T   |   F     |\n\nNow let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is ~X \u2283 Y.\n2. The second premise is Y \u2283 Z.\n3. The conclusion is ~Z / ~X.\n\nWe need to check if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nFrom the truth table:\n- In rows 1, 2, 3, and 4, both premises (~X \u2283 Y) and (Y \u2283 Z) are true.\n- In row 1, both premises are true, but the conclusion (~Z / ~X) is also true.\n- In row 2, both premises are true, but the conclusion (~Z / ~X) is also true.\n- In row 3, both premises are true, but the conclusion (~Z / ~X) is also true.\n- In row 4, both premises are true, but the conclusion (~Z / ~X) is also true.\n\nSince there are no rows where both premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
