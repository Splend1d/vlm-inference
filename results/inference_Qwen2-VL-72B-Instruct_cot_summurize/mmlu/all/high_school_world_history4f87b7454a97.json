U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence\n\nThe poem \"To Roosevelt\" by Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo was written in 1904, which aligns with the time when the United States played a significant role in Panama's independence from Colombia. This event allowed for the construction of the Panama Canal, which was a major geopolitical move by the United States in Latin America. The poem reflects the concerns and tensions felt by many Latin American countries regarding U.S. intervention in their affairs."
