Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n"

There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\n\nIn this scenario, the key issue revolves around whether the state law is preempted by federal law. Preemption occurs when federal law supersedes state law, either explicitly through statutory language or implicitly when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\n\nHere, the federal standards do not address genetic engineering factors, while the state law specifically regulates them. Since there is no direct conflict between the two laws (i.e., compliance with one does not make it impossible to comply with the other), and since the federal law does not explicitly preempt state regulation in this area, the courts would likely find that the state law is not preempted. Therefore, the state can enforce its own standards regarding genetic engineering factors without violating federal law.\n\nOption B is incorrect because federal law does not automatically exempt products from additional state regulations unless those regulations directly conflict with federal standards or are preempted by explicit federal authority.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no blanket rule that federal laws always preempt state laws concerning fresh produce; preemption must be determined on a case-by-case basis according to specific statutes and their intent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the state law does not necessarily interfere impermissibly with the second state's law; rather, it imposes additional requirements that may be met alongside federal standards.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion based on the given information and U.S. Supreme Court precedent is that there is no preemption in this case."
