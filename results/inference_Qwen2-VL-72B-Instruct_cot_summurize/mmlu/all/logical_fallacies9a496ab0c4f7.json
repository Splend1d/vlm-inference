The structure typically looks like this:\n\n1. Either P or Q (major premise)\n2. Not P (minor premise)\n3. Therefore, Q (conclusion)\n\nGiven this structure, the minor premise in a disjunctive syllogism must eliminate one of the choices to logically conclude the remaining choice.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Accept one choice - This does not fit because the minor premise in a disjunctive syllogism does not affirm one choice; it negates one.\nB. Reject all but one choice - This fits because the minor premise eliminates one of the choices, leaving only one option.\nC. Either A or B - Since we've determined that B is correct, C cannot be correct as it includes an incorrect option (A).\nD. None of the above - This is incorrect because B is indeed correct.\n\nTherefore, the minor premise in a valid disjunctive syllogism must reject all but one choice.\n\nFinal answer: B. reject all but one choice"
