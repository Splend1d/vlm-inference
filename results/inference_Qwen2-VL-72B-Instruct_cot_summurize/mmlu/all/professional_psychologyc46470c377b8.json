While it is strongly related to job satisfaction, productivity, and job motivation, it is less predictive of turnover because turnover is influenced by a variety of factors beyond just an employee's emotional attachment to the organization. Other factors such as job opportunities, compensation, work-life balance, and personal circumstances can also play significant roles in an employee's decision to leave an organization."
