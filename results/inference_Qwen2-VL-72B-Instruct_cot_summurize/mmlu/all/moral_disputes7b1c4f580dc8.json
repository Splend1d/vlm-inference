This formulation is essentially a test of consistency: an action is morally right if the maxim underlying it can be consistently applied by everyone without leading to a contradiction or an unlivable world. It does not directly concern an agent's wants, ethical dilemmas, social acceptability, or the measurement of action consequences."
