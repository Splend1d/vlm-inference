                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the context and core of Thomson's argument regarding abortion. Thomson's famous thought experiment involves the \"violinist\" scenario, which challenges the idea that a fetus has an absolute right to use the mother's body for survival.\n\nThomson argues that even if the fetus is considered a person with rights, those rights do not necessarily include the right to use the mother's body against her will. This distinction is crucial because it suggests that the moral permissibility of abortion does not solely hinge on whether the fetus is a person.\n\nGiven this understanding:\n\n- Option A: \"the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\" This aligns with Thomson's argument, as she emphasizes that the question of personhood alone does not resolve the ethical complexities surrounding abortion.\n\n- Option B: \"abortion is always morally permissible.\" This is too strong a statement and does not accurately reflect Thomson's nuanced position.\n\n- Option C: \"abortion is never morally permissible.\" This contradicts Thomson's argument, which allows for the possibility of abortion being morally permissible under certain circumstances.\n\n- Option D: \"the abortion issue can be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\" This directly contradicts Thomson's main point, which is that the issue is more complex than simply determining personhood.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person."
