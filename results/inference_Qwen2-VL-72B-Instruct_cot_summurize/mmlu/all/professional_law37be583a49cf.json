Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\nC. deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.\nD. deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.\n"

However, it does not directly address the internal operations of political parties.\n\n3. **Private Action vs. Constitutional Restrictions**: Political parties generally have the freedom to set their own rules for membership and primaries as long as they do not violate specific constitutional protections. The Fifteenth Amendment applies to government actions, not necessarily private party actions.\n\n4. **Pre-Primary Election Control**: Federal election laws typically focus on general elections rather than party primaries, which are often considered internal party matters.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most relevant point is whether the party's actions are considered private or subject to constitutional restrictions. Since the party is excluding non-Latino members from participating in the primary, this exclusion might be seen as a private action rather than a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, which primarily targets governmental interference with voting rights.\n\nTherefore, the federal court is most likely to:\n\n**C. Deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that political parties have significant autonomy in managing their internal affairs, including membership and primary processes, unless such actions clearly violate explicit constitutional prohibitions."
