Therefore, the friend retains ownership unless the condition is met.\n\nHowever, the condition has not been triggered because the property has not been used for church purposes. Thus, the friend continues to hold the title to the property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. the friend only.**"
