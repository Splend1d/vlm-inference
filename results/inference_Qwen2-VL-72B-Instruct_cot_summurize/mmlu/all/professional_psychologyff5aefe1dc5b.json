Therapist self-disclosure can be a tool to help achieve this balance by reducing power imbalances and fostering a more collaborative therapeutic environment. It allows the therapist to share personal experiences or perspectives that may be relevant to the client's situation, thereby promoting a sense of mutual understanding and respect."
