                    "text": "To determine the impact on the price and quantity of apples given the changes described, let's analyze each factor step by step:\n\n1. **Increase in Apple Production Due to Pesticides:**\n   - When apple growers use more pesticides to increase apple production, the supply of apples increases. This shift in supply to the right typically leads to a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\n2. **Rising Price of Pears (Substitute for Apples):**\n   - If the price of pears, a substitute for apples, is rising, consumers may switch from pears to apples. This would increase the demand for apples, shifting the demand curve to the right. This shift typically leads to a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\nNow, combining these two effects:\n- The increase in apple production due to pesticides shifts the supply curve to the right, leading to a lower price and higher quantity.\n- The rise in pear prices shifts the demand curve for apples to the right, leading to a higher price and higher quantity.\n\nGiven these opposing forces:\n- The effect on the price of apples is ambiguous because the decrease in price due to increased supply could be offset by the increase in price due to increased demand.\n- The effect on the quantity of apples is clear; both factors (increased supply and increased demand) suggest an increase in quantity.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable prediction is:\n\n**C. Price is ambiguous, but quantity rises.**"
