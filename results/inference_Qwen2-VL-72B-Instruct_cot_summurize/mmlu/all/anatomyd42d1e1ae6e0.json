Compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen would primarily affect the motor function of the facial muscles on the same side (ipsilateral), leading to paralysis or weakness of those muscles. The other functions mentioned (taste, lacrimation, and salivation) are also controlled by the facial nerve but involve different branches that may not be affected by compression at the stylomastoid foramen."
