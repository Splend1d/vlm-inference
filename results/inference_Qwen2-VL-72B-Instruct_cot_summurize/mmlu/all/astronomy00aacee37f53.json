The solar wind consists of charged particles emitted by the Sun that can strip away atmospheric gases if there is no magnetic field to deflect them. Over time, as Mars's magnetic field weakened or disappeared, the solar wind was able to strip away much of its atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and water vapor, which are key components of the greenhouse effect. This reduction in the greenhouse gases led to a significant decrease in temperature, contributing to the current cold and dry conditions on Mars."
