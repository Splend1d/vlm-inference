Two of the roommates decided to play a practical joke on the other roommate, which they liked to do from time to time because he was gullible. The two roommates were seated in the living room of their apartment. The other roommate was in an adjoining room and within earshot of the two roommates. Knowing that their roommate could hear their conversation, the two roommates falsely stated that a fire had been set at the student center at the college. After overhearing this conversation, the other roommate phoned the fire department and reported this information. Several fire trucks were dispatched to the college and determined the information to be false. If the two roommates are prosecuted for violating the aforementioned statute, they should be found\n\nA. guilty, because they caused the false report to be made.\nB. guilty, because they are accomplices to their roommate.\nC. not guilty, because they didn't report the information to the fire department themselves.\nD. not guilty, because they didn't knowingly believe that their roommate would report the information to the fire department.\n"

This is true because their actions directly led to the false report being made by their roommate.\n\n- **Option B**: They are accomplices to their roommate. This is not accurate because the statute does not mention accomplice liability; it focuses on the act of making the false report itself.\n\n- **Option C**: They didn't report the information to the fire department themselves. While technically true, the statute does not require personal reporting; it only requires causing a false report to be made.\n\n- **Option D**: They didn't knowingly believe that their roommate would report the information to the fire department. This is irrelevant if they acted recklessly, knowing that their roommate could hear them and might report the false information.\n\nConsidering the elements of the statute and the context provided, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. guilty, because they caused the false report to be made.**"
