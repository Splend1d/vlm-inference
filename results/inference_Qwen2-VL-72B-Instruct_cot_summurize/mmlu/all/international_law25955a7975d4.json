States have a clear positive obligation to protect individuals in their custody from such harm.\n\nB. **Where the state must investigate claims against it**: This obligation arises from Article 2 (right to life) and Article 3 (prohibition of torture) of the ECHR. The ECtHR has established that states must conduct effective investigations into allegations of serious human rights violations, particularly when there is a suspicion of state involvement or failure to protect.\n\nC. **The development of a legal framework to protect those within the state**: This is also a recognized obligation under the ECHR. States are required to establish and maintain an effective legal system to protect individuals' rights and freedoms.\n\nD. **To provide housing for all those homeless within a state**: While social and economic rights, including the right to housing, are important, they are not explicitly protected under the ECHR. The ECtHR has not developed this as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect in the same way as the other examples listed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. To provide housing for all those homeless within a state**"
