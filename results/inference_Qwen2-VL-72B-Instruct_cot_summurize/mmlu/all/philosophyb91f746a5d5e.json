He thought life was bereft of meaning.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer had a pessimistic view of life, believing that existence was characterized by suffering and that the will to live was the source of this suffering. He argued that life is filled with pain and that the pursuit of desires only leads to more dissatisfaction. According to Schopenhauer, the best one could hope for was to minimize suffering and find moments of peace through art, philosophy, and asceticism."
