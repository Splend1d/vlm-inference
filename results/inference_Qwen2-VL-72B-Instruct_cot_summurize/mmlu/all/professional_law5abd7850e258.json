After the husband beat up the wife one night, she decided to kill him. The wife, who was experienced in firearms, planned to shoot her husband while he slept. Before carrying out her plan, the wife took out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as beneficiary. Shortly thereafter, the husband and wife celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner and had a truly enjoyable evening together. After a great night, the wife experienced a change of heart and decided she really loved her husband and didn't want to kill him after all. The wife confessed and told her husband about her plan, begging forgiveness. The husband was outraged. He proceeded to file for divorce and notified the police about his wife's plan. If the wife is charged with attempted murder, she should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she purchased the life insurance policy.\nB. guilty, because she intended to kill her husband.\nC. not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\nD. not guilty, because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the wife should be found guilty or not guilty if charged with attempted murder, we need to analyze the legal elements of the crime of attempted murder and consider the specific circumstances described.\n\n### Elements of Attempted Murder:\n1. **Intent to Kill**: The individual must have had the intention to cause the death of another person.\n2. **Substantial Step**: The individual must have taken a substantial step toward committing the murder that goes beyond mere preparation but falls short of completing the act.\n\n### Analysis of the Wife's Actions:\n\n1. **Intent to Kill**:\n   - The wife clearly intended to kill her husband, as evidenced by her plan to shoot him while he slept.\n\n2. **Substantial Step**:\n   - She purchased a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as the beneficiary.\n   - However, she did not take any further action towards actually killing her husband (e.g., obtaining a firearm, loading it, or approaching him with the intent to carry out the murder).\n\n3. **Withdrawal**:\n   - The wife experienced a change of heart and confessed her plan to her husband, indicating a withdrawal from the criminal endeavor before taking any further steps.\n\n### Legal Considerations:\n- **Attempted Murder vs. Withdrawal**: In many jurisdictions, the law recognizes the concept of \"withdrawal\" where an individual abandons their criminal intent and takes affirmative steps to prevent the crime from occurring. This can be a defense against charges of attempted murder.\n- **Substantial Step**: The purchase of the life insurance policy alone may not constitute a substantial step towards committing murder, especially since no further actions were taken.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. not guilty, because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor.**\n\nThe wife's confession and change of heart before taking any further substantial steps towards committing the murder indicate that she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor. Therefore, she should not be found guilty of attempted murder."
