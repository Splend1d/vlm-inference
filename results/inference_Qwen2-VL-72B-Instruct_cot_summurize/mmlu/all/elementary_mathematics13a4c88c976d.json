We start with the first number (20) and add the common difference (20) seven times to get to the eighth number:\n\n1st number: 20\n2nd number: \\(20 + 20 = 40\\)\n3rd number: \\(40 + 20 = 60\\)\n4th number: \\(60 + 20 = 80\\)\n5th number: \\(80 + 20 = 100\\)\n6th number: \\(100 + 20 = 120\\)\n7th number: \\(120 + 20 = 140\\)\n8th number: \\(140 + 20 = 160\\)\n\nTherefore, the eighth number in the pattern is 160.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 160."
