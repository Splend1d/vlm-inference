About 200 yards of the man's property bordered along a lake shoreline. A fisherman lived on a stream that flowed along one boundary of the man's land and ran into the lake. When the man acquired ownership of the property, he had a channel dredged across his land from the stream to the lake at a point some distance from the mouth of the stream. The fisherman erroneously believed that the channel was a public waterway. Because the channel served as a convenient shortcut to the lake, the fisherman made frequent trips across the channel in his fishing boat. In no way did the fisherman's use of the channel cause any harm or damage to the man's property. After the man learned about the fisherman's use of the channel, he requested that the fisherman desist further entry onto the waterway. The fisherman, who until that time was unaware of the man's ownership claim, agreed. Nonetheless, the man brought suit against the fisherman to recover damages for trespass. Judgment is likely to be for whom?\n\nA. The fisherman, because when he used the channel he believed that it was a public waterway.\nB. The fisherman, because he caused no damage to the man's land.\nC. The man, but recovery is limited to nominal damages for the fisherman's intentional use of the channel.\nD. The man, because the fisherman should have known that the waterway was not open for public use.\n"

The man, but recovery is limited to nominal damages for the fisherman's intentional use of the channel.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the fisherman used the channel without permission, which constitutes trespassing regardless of whether he believed it was a public waterway. The fact that he caused no damage does not negate the trespass. However, since the fisherman was unaware of the man's ownership claim and promptly ceased using the channel upon learning of it, the man's damages would likely be nominal rather than substantial. Nominal damages acknowledge the legal wrong (trespass) without awarding significant monetary compensation, especially given the lack of harm or damage to the property."
