Later, the owner of the dwelling attempted to use it as a dental office. The other owners in the subdivision asked the court to enjoin the intended use. Leaving aside zoning issues, will the court likely grant the request to prohibit the intended use?\n\nA. No, the wording is ambiguous and therefore any use is now permitted.\nB. The wording only restricts the building of the structure and does not restrict its later use so that the owner is entitled to change the use.\nC. The intention was to enforce a residential use of the property so that the intended change in use will not be allowed.\nD. A professional use of a building cannot be prohibited by a land restriction.f\n"

Since the owner's attempt to convert the dwelling into a dental office would violate this restriction, the court is likely to grant the request to prohibit the intended use, upholding the residential character of the subdivision."
