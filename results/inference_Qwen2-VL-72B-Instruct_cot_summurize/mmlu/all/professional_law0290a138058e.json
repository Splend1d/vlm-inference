The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company's objection to the admission of the painter's statements?\n\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\n"

No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\n\nIn legal terms, the painter's statements could be considered admissions by a party-opponent if they were made during the course of his employment and relate to the matter at hand. Admissions by a party-opponent are generally admissible in court as an exception to the hearsay rule. Since the painter is employed by the same company as the negligent workers, his statements about the company's practices or the condition of the work could be relevant and admissible evidence in the lawsuit."
