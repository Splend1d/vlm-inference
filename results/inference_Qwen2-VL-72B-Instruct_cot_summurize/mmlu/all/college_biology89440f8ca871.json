Saltwater fish actually produce urine that is hypotonic (less concentrated) than their body fluids to help them maintain osmotic balance in a high-salt environment.\n\nB. The kidneys of desert mammals produce urine that is hypoosmotic to the urine of freshwater fishes.\n- This statement is also incorrect. Desert mammals, which need to conserve water, produce highly concentrated (hyperosmotic) urine compared to freshwater fishes, which typically produce more dilute urine.\n\nC. Malpighian tubules allow insects to excrete waste through the exoskeleton.\n- This statement is incorrect. Malpighian tubules in insects are involved in the excretion of metabolic wastes and regulation of fluid balance, but they do not directly excrete waste through the exoskeleton. Instead, they release waste into the hindgut for elimination.\n\nD. Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.\n- This statement is correct. Juxtamedullary nephrons, located deep within the kidney, have a long loop of Henle that allows for the concentration of urine, enabling mammals to produce hyperosmotic urine to conserve water.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
