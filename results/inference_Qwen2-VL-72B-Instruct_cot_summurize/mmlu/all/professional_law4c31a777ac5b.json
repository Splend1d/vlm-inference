                    "text": "The legal effect of the employer's promise to pay the bonus to the employee can be determined by analyzing the principles of contract law, particularly regarding consideration.\n\n**Option A:** This option suggests that the promise is enforceable because the employee conferred a material benefit on the employer by negotiating the lucrative contract. However, this does not directly address whether there was new consideration for the promise of the bonus itself.\n\n**Option B:** This option states that the promise is enforceable because the employer was morally obligated to pay the bonus. Morality alone does not create a legally binding obligation; contracts require mutual consideration.\n\n**Option C:** This option claims that the promise is unenforceable because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration from both parties. In this case, the employee had already performed the act (negotiating the contract) before the promise of the bonus was made, and no additional consideration was provided for the bonus promise.\n\n**Option D:** This option asserts that the promise is unenforceable because it was not in writing. While some promises may need to be in writing under the Statute of Frauds, the primary issue here is the lack of consideration rather than the form of the promise.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that for a contract to be valid, there must be consideration exchanged between the parties. Since the employee had already completed the act of negotiating the contract before the bonus was promised, there was no new consideration provided for the bonus promise."
