It is an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Rule against Perpetuities generally requires that any interest in property must vest, if at all, within 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In this case, the son's interest is contingent upon two conditions: (1) the son must be living, and (2) the son must own any dogs. Since these conditions could potentially not be met until long after the death of the testator, the interest may violate the Rule against Perpetuities. Therefore, it is an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities."
