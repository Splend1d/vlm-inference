The claim was based on erroneous information, found on the website of a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, that the airline assumed to be true. The airline was charged under the state law for making a false statement. No federal statute applies. Which of the following best supports the airline in a defense based on the First Amendment?\n\nA. Its statement about the safety record was made without malice.\nB. Its statement about the safety record was protected noncommercial speech.\nC. The state law is a prior restraint.\nD. The state law is overbroad.\n"

Its statement about the safety record was protected noncommercial speech.\n\nThe First Amendment protects freedom of speech, and courts generally afford greater protection to noncommercial speech than commercial speech. Noncommercial speech refers to communication that does not propose a commercial transaction, whereas commercial speech is speech that proposes a commercial transaction. In this case, the airline's statement about the competitor's safety record appears to be more about providing information (albeit false) rather than directly promoting a commercial transaction. Therefore, arguing that the statement was protected noncommercial speech would be the strongest defense based on the First Amendment."
