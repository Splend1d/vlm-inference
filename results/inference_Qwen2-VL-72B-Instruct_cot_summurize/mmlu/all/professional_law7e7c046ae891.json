A group of students painted purple a statue of the university's founder in protest to the university's federally subsidized nuclear weapon experimental studies. The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: \"Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid. \"The group leader was married to a fellow student. However, in light of his involvement in defacing the statue and the loss of his state aid, his wife left him. At that time, the group leader received a tax bill for $150. This tax was imposed uniformly by the city on all individuals over 19 years of age, with the exception that full-time female college students were exempted. The tax notice stated that his wife, 22 years of age, qualified for the exemption, and there was no bill enclosed for her. Subsequently, the group leader moved in with his new girlfriend and began making arrangements to secure a divorce. However, the group leader was not able to obtain a divorce, since he had not fulfilled the 12-month residency requirement as imposed by state law. In an action by the group leader against the state challenging the constitutionality of the state statute regarding disruptive campus activities in order to regain his $5,000 annual grant, the court will most likely declare the statute\n\nA. constitutional, because it promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is a proper exercise of state action designed to regulate the activities of state university students.\nC. unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is discriminatory on its face.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome of the court's decision regarding the constitutionality of the state statute, we need to analyze the statute within the context of constitutional law principles.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Purpose of the Statute**: The statute aims to prevent disruptive campus activities by withholding state aid from students involved in such activities. This suggests an attempt to maintain order and discipline on campus.\n\n2. **State Interest**: States have a legitimate interest in maintaining order and preventing disruptions on their campuses. This interest can be considered compelling, especially in the context of public universities where disruptions could affect the educational environment for all students.\n\n3. **Proportionality and Specificity**:\n   - **Vagueness**: The term \"disruptive campus activities\" might be seen as vague if it does not provide clear guidelines on what constitutes disruption. This vagueness could lead to arbitrary enforcement.\n   - **Overbreadth**: If the statute is overly broad and restricts more speech or conduct than necessary to achieve its goal, it may be deemed unconstitutional.\n\n4. **Discrimination**: The statute applies uniformly to all students engaging in disruptive activities, regardless of gender, race, or other characteristics. Therefore, it does not appear to be facially discriminatory.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these considerations, the court is likely to focus on whether the statute is sufficiently clear and narrowly tailored to serve the state's compelling interest without being overly broad or vague. \n\n- **Option A**: While promoting a compelling state interest is important, the statute must also be specific enough to avoid vagueness and overbreadth.\n- **Option B**: This option aligns well with the state's legitimate interest in maintaining order but still needs to consider the specificity and proportionality of the statute.\n- **Option C**: This is a strong possibility if the statute is found to be vague and overbroad, leading to potential constitutional issues.\n- **Option D**: This is unlikely since the statute does not discriminate based on any protected class.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe court will most likely declare the statute **unconstitutional, because it is vague and overbroad** (Option C)."
