Most swingers also tend to have tolerant attitudes towards various forms of \"exotic\" sexuality.\n\nSwinging, or partner swapping, typically involves heterosexual couples engaging in sexual activities with other couples or individuals outside their primary relationship. While there can be variations in practices and preferences among swingers, it is generally true that participants often exhibit a more open-minded and tolerant attitude towards diverse sexual expressions and orientations. This tolerance may extend to various forms of \"exotic\" sexuality, though it does not necessarily mean that all forms of non-heterosexual activity are common or widely accepted within the swinging community."
