It is a generalization of the Durbin-Watson test and allows for testing at multiple lags.\n\nHere's why the other options are not suitable for this purpose:\n\nA. The Durbin-Watson test is primarily used to detect first-order autocorrelation (lag 1) and is not designed to test for higher-order autocorrelation.\n\nB. White's test is used to detect heteroskedasticity in a regression model, not autocorrelation.\n\nC. The RESET (Regression Equation Specification Error Test) is used to check for functional form misspecification in a regression model, not for autocorrelation."
