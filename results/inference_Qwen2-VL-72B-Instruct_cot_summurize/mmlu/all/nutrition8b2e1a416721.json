One example is serum methylmalonic acid as a biochemical functional index for vitamin B12 status. What is the primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements?\n\n\nA. To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.\nB. To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects.\nC. To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion.\nD. To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\n"

To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\n\nThese indices help in assessing the functional status of a micronutrient within the body, which can be more informative than simply measuring dietary intake or correcting for nutrient losses. They are designed to reflect the adequacy of biochemical pathways that are dependent on the micronutrient, thereby providing insights into potential risks of clinical diseases or physiological malfunctions associated with deficiencies or excesses of that micronutrient."
