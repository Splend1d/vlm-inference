David is described as a perfectionist who is very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of his pieces. This suggests that he may have low self-esteem because he is highly critical of his own performance.\n\n2. **Self-Efficacy**: Self-efficacy is the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. David is a nationally ranked cellist who has accepted a scholarship to perform in a major college orchestra. This indicates that he likely has strong self-efficacy, as he believes in his ability to perform at a high level.\n\n3. **Locus of Control**: Locus of control refers to whether a person believes they have control over their life (internal) or if external factors control their outcomes (external). Given that David is a perfectionist and is hard on himself for not mastering sections of his pieces, it suggests that he believes he has control over his performance and outcomes, indicating an internal locus of control.\n\nBased on these analyses:\n- David has low self-esteem.\n- David has strong self-efficacy.\n- David has an internal locus of control.\n\nTherefore, the best description of David is:\n\n**A. Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control**"
