It is intentional and aimed at causing harm or pain to someone else.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A man slaps his wife because he is angry that she made hamburgers for dinner again.\n- This action is clearly motivated by anger and intended to cause harm to the wife. It fits the definition of hostile aggression.\n\nB. A sanitation man knocks over some rose bushes when he throws an empty can to the curb.\n- This action appears to be accidental and not motivated by anger or the desire to harm. It does not fit the definition of hostile aggression.\n\nC. A waitress breaks several cups and saucers when she drops a tray on the floor.\n- This incident seems to be an accident, likely due to clumsiness or carelessness, rather than an intentional act of aggression. It does not fit the definition of hostile aggression.\n\nD. A careless driver hits and severely injures a pedestrian who is crossing the street.\n- While this action resulted in severe injury, it was likely due to carelessness rather than intentional harm. It does not fit the definition of hostile aggression.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best illustration of hostile aggression is:\n\nA. A man slaps his wife because he is angry that she made hamburgers for dinner again."
