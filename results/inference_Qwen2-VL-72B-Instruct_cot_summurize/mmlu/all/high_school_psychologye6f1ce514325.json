Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are designed to establish causality by manipulating one or more independent variables while controlling for other variables that could influence the outcome. This control allows researchers to observe the effect of the independent variable(s) on the dependent variable(s) with greater confidence that any observed changes are due to the manipulation rather than other factors."
