Damage to this nerve would result in loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation in that region. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue are innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) for taste and the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) for somaesthetic sensation. The muscles of the tongue are primarily innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII)."
