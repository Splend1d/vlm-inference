It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nWhich of the following groups would be most likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass?\n\nA.

Douglass was an abolitionist who criticized the institution of slavery and the support it received from various institutions and groups within the United States.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Southern Democrats in the 1880s**: This group would generally support the continuation of racial segregation and the remnants of the pro-slavery ideology, making them unlikely to support Douglass's anti-slavery stance.\n\nB. **Western ranchers in the 1850s**: While some western ranchers might have had mixed views on slavery, they were primarily concerned with land rights and economic issues rather than abolitionism. Therefore, they would not necessarily align with Douglass's strong anti-slavery position.\n\nC. **Southern farmers in the 1830s**: These farmers were part of the pro-slavery South and would likely oppose Douglass's views on slavery.\n\nD. **Northern Republicans in the 1860s**: This group includes individuals who were part of the Republican Party during the Civil War era, many of whom were abolitionists or supported the Union cause, which included ending slavery. They would be more likely to support Douglass's perspective against slavery.\n\nGiven these considerations, the group most likely to support Frederick Douglass's perspective would be:\n\n**D. Northern Republicans in the 1860s**"
