Historically, Saudi Arabia has been known to spend a substantial portion of its GDP on defense.\n\n4. **Option D: 10%**\n   - While this percentage is high, it is not entirely out of the realm of possibility for a country with significant military ambitions and resources.\n\nGiven the historical context and the known military spending patterns of Saudi Arabia, the most reasonable estimate as of 2017 would be around 6%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 6%**"
