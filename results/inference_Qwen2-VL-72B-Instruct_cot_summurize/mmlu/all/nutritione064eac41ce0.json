Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\nB. The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC. The problem is one of greed and gluttony, whereby people override strong satiety signals on a regular basis\nD. Flavour signals from tasty, processed food will override satiety signals even after a large meal\n"

Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\n\nThis statement best describes the role of the intestine in the development of obesity by highlighting the disruption in gut hormone secretion, specifically the failure of PYY (Peptide YY) to provide a satiety signal. PYY is a hormone produced by the small intestine that helps regulate appetite and food intake. When its secretion is impaired, it can contribute to overeating and weight gain."
