H+ ions flowing down a gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane\n\nATP synthase produces ATP using the energy derived from the proton (H+) gradient established by the electron transport chain. This process, known as chemiosmosis, involves protons moving back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, which harnesses this flow to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate."
