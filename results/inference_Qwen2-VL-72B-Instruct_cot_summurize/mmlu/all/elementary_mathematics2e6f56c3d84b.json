The problem states that Manuel bought a used car for \"six thousand forty-nine dollars.\"\n2. We need to convert this verbal description into a numeral.\n\nLet's analyze each part:\n- \"Six thousand\" translates to 6,000.\n- \"Forty-nine\" translates to 49.\n\nCombining these two parts, we get 6,000 + 49 = 6,049.\n\nNow, let's match this with the provided options:\nA. $649\nB. $6,049\nC. $6,409\nD. $6,490\n\nThe correct numeral representation of \"six thousand forty-nine dollars\" is $6,049.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B. $6,049."
