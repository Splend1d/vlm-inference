But assuming it was not a designated nude beach, it could be considered morally wrong due to potential legal and social implications.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I told her it was safe to jump off the couch.\"\n- This statement implies that the person encouraged someone else to perform an action that could potentially result in injury.\n- If the person knew that jumping off the couch could cause harm but still encouraged it, this would be considered morally wrong because it involves putting someone else at unnecessary risk.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 might be morally wrong depending on the context (location of the beach).\n- Scenario 2 is more clearly morally wrong because it involves encouraging someone to engage in a potentially harmful activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
