Roman Catholic\n\nThe song references \"Ferdinand\" as the rightful king of Bohemia, which suggests support for the Habsburg dynasty, traditionally associated with Roman Catholicism. The term \"Winter King\" refers to Frederick V of the Palatinate, who was deposed as King of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War, a conflict largely driven by religious differences between Catholics and Protestants. The narrator's disapproval of the \"Winter King\" and encouragement to seek pardon from Ferdinand align with the Catholic perspective of the conflict."
