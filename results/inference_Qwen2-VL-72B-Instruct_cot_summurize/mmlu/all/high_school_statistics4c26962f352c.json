For sums of independent random variables, the variances add up. Therefore, the variance of \\(W\\) is:\n\n\\[Var(W) = Var(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4)\\]\n\nSince the players' weights are independent and identically distributed (iid), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[Var(W) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + Var(X_3) + Var(X_4)\\]\n\\[Var(W) = 4 \\times Var(X)\\]\n\\[Var(W) = 4 \\times 2209\\]\n\\[Var(W) = 8836\\]\n\nThe standard deviation (\\(\\sigma_W\\)) of \\(W\\) is the square root of its variance:\n\n\\[\\sigma_W = \\sqrt{8836}\\]\n\\[\\sigma_W \u2248 94\\]\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the total combined weight \\(W\\) of the four players is approximately 94 pounds.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 94 pounds."
