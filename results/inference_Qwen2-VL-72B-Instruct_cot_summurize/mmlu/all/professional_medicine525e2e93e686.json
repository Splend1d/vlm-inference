Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?\n\nA. 1%\nB. 10%\nC. 40%\nD. 90%\n"

In other words, it's the likelihood of detecting an effect when there truly is one.\n\nIn this context, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference in effectiveness between Drug X and the standard therapy. The alternative hypothesis is that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy.\n\nThe investigators set the probability of a Type I error (wrongly finding Drug X more effective when it is not) at 1%, which corresponds to the significance level (\u03b1). They also set the probability of a Type II error (wrongly finding no difference when there is one) at 10%, which is denoted by \u03b2.\n\nStatistical power is calculated as 1 - \u03b2. Given that \u03b2 is set at 10% (or 0.10), the statistical power is:\n\n1 - 0.10 = 0.90\n\nTherefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 90%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 90%."
