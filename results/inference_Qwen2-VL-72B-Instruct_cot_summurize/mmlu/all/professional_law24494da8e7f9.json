When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nA. No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB. No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD. Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court is likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\nFirstly, the amendment denies the death benefit if the death was caused by the employee's refusal to accept reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician, except when the refusal is due to excessive risk to life or health. This amendment applies generally and does not specifically target religious reasons for refusing medical treatment.\n\nSecondly, the officer's spouse claims that the amendment violates the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. However, courts typically evaluate such claims under the rational basis test when the law in question is neutral and generally applicable. Under this test, the law must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nIn this case, the amendment serves a legitimate governmental interest in ensuring that the death benefit is awarded only when the death was not preventable through reasonably available medical care. It does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits but rather applies uniformly to all employees who refuse prescribed medical care for any reason other than excessive risk to life or health.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits."
