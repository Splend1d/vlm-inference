This year, she plans to make twice that amount:\n\n\\[ \\text{This year's servings} = 32 \\times 2 = 64 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNow, we need to convert cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gallons of soup} = \\frac{\\text{Total cups}}{\\text{Cups per gallon}} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\nTherefore, Chesa will make 4 gallons of soup this year.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 4."
