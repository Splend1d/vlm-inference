                    "text": "To determine which capacity Carruther's assumes that animals lack, we need to analyze each option in the context of Carruther's views on animal cognition and consciousness.\n\nA. **The capacity for suffering**: Many philosophers, including those who study animal ethics, acknowledge that animals can suffer. This is often supported by behavioral evidence and physiological responses similar to those observed in humans under stress or pain.\n\nB. **The capacity for practical reasoning**: Practical reasoning involves making decisions based on goals and outcomes. While some animals exhibit complex behaviors that suggest they can make decisions and solve problems, it is debated whether this constitutes true practical reasoning as understood in human terms.\n\nC. **The capacity for rational agency**: Rational agency implies the ability to act based on reasons and principles, which is a higher cognitive function typically associated with humans. Animals may not possess this level of cognitive sophistication.\n\nD. **The capacity for conscious experience**: Conscious experience refers to subjective awareness and the ability to have mental states. Some philosophers argue that certain animals do have conscious experiences, while others dispute this claim.\n\nGiven Carruther's views, he might argue that animals lack the capacity for rational agency because this involves a level of cognitive complexity that goes beyond what is typically attributed to non-human animals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The capacity for rational agency**"
