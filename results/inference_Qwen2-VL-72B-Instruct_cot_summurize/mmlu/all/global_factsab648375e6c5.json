However, it has been increasing its defense budget steadily over the years.\n\nGiven that China is known for having a significant but not excessively high military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, we can eliminate the extreme values:\n\n- Option A (0.50%) is too low.\n- Option D (12%) is too high.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\nB. 2%\nC. 6%\n\nBetween these two, 2% is more plausible given historical data and trends in global military spending patterns.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is:\n\nB. 2%"
