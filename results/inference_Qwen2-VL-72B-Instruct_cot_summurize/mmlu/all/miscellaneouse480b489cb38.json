For a single person with $20,000 in taxable income, the tax rate is 20%.\n2. For a single person with $25,000 in taxable income, the tax rate is 24%.\n\nAs the income increases from $20,000 to $25,000, the tax rate also increases from 20% to 24%. This indicates that higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the tax system described is:\n\nB. progressive\n\nIn a progressive tax system, the tax rate increases as the taxable income increases."
