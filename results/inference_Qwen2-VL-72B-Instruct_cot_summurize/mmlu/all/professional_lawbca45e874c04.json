After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nIn a strict products liability case, the focus is on the condition of the product itself rather than the actions or negligence of the manufacturer or seller. If the buyer can demonstrate that the dishwasher was defective and that this defect caused damage (in this case, the destruction of her china set), she may have grounds for a successful claim. The fact that the dishwasher made a loud rattling noise and then resulted in the breaking of the china suggests that there was a defect in the dishwasher that led to the damage. Therefore, the buyer could potentially prevail in a strict products liability claim against the appliance company."
