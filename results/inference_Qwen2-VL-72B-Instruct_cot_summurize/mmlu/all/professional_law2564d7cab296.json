The jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, and the court entered judgment. The motorcyclist then sued the company that employed the driver and owned the truck in federal court for personal-injury damages, and the company moved to dismiss based on the state-court judgment. If the court grants the company's motion, what is the likely explanation?\n\nA. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\nB. Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) establishes the company's lack of negligence.\nC. The motorcyclist violated the doctrine of election of remedies.\nD. The state-court judgment is the law of the case.\n"

Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nClaim preclusion, also known as res judicata, prevents a party from relitigating the same claim or cause of action that has already been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. Since the motorcyclist previously sued the truck driver in state court and lost, the principle of claim preclusion may apply to bar the subsequent lawsuit against the company for the same incident. This is because the claim against the company could have been brought in the initial lawsuit and is therefore considered part of the same controversy."
