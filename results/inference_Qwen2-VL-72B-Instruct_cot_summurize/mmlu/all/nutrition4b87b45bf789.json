The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.\n\nThis is because the efficiency of utilization refers to how effectively the body can use the protein it consumes. If the efficiency is low, more protein must be consumed to meet the body's needs, whereas if the efficiency is high, less protein may be needed to meet the same demand. Therefore, to calculate the total amount of protein required, you divide the demand (the amount of protein the body needs) by the efficiency of utilization."
