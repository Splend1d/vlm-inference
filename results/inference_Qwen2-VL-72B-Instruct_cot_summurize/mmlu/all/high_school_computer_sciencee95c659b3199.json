Translating a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code\n\nThe compiler plays a crucial role in the software development process by translating source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor. This translation is necessary because computers can only execute instructions in machine code, which is a series of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent specific operations.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Managing specification files created as part of the development process - This task is typically handled by version control systems or project management tools, not by the compiler.\n\nB. Running and testing the executable created by the programmer - This is usually done using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), command-line tools, or testing frameworks, rather than the compiler itself.\n\nC. Tracking older versions of the software in case an error is found and the software needs to be reverted to an earlier form - This is also a function of version control systems, not the compiler."
