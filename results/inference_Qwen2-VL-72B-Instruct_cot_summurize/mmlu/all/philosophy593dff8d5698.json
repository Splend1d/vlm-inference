According to Hume, reason alone cannot motivate action or produce moral judgments; rather, it serves to inform our passions and desires, which are the true drivers of human behavior. Therefore, options B and C do not accurately reflect Hume's view on reason. Option D is incorrect because not all of the statements listed apply to Hume's description of reason."
