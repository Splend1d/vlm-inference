The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient\u2019s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?\n\nA. DNA helicase\nB. Glucuronosyltransferase\nC. Proteasomal degradation\nD. Ribosomal assembly\n"

The most effective antibiotics for treating plague include fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. DNA helicase - Fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are involved in DNA replication and transcription, but not specifically DNA helicase.\nB. Glucuronosyltransferase - This enzyme is involved in the conjugation of glucuronic acid to drugs and other compounds for detoxification and excretion, and it is not a target for antibiotics.\nC. Proteasomal degradation - This process is involved in protein turnover and is not a target for antibiotics.\nD. Ribosomal assembly - Aminoglycosides like gentamicin and tetracyclines like doxycycline inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with ribosomal function.\n\nGiven that the most effective antibiotics for plague target bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with ribosomal function, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Ribosomal assembly"
