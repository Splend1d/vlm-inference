This process involves the direct formation of bone from mesenchymal tissue without an intermediate cartilage model. Intramembranous ossification is characteristic of flat bones such as those in the skull.\n\nIn terms of growth patterns, the viscerocranium follows the somatic growth pattern, which means its growth is influenced by general body growth rather than the neural growth pattern, which is more specific to the brain and cranial structures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. intramembranous ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern."
