Environmental constraints can indeed limit conventional economic growth, posing a direct threat to economic security and development. This can lead to social unrest and political instability if not managed properly.\n\nB. Environmental changes, such as rising sea levels, can threaten the land on which populations are settled, as well as their access to resources. This can force migration, which in turn can present threats to societal, economic, and other sectors of security due to increased competition for limited resources and potential conflicts between host communities and migrants.\n\nC. Environmental degradation and increased demand for resources can lead to scarcity, which is likely to result in conflict over access to those resources. This can exacerbate tensions between nations or within regions, potentially leading to armed conflict.\n\nTherefore, all of these options highlight significant concerns for peace researchers studying the intersection of environmental issues and security in the twenty-first century."
