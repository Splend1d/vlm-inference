A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames.\n\nExplanation:\n- Exons are the parts of a gene that code for proteins and are present in both the initial RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) and the mature mRNA after splicing.\n- The first exon does not necessarily contain the translational start site; this can vary depending on the gene structure.\n- The last exon does not always contain the normal termination codon; this also depends on the specific gene.\n- Coding exons are indeed translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames, ensuring the correct amino acid sequence during protein synthesis."
