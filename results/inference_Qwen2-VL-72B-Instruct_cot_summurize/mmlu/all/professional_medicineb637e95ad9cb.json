Therefore, it would be most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family, adoption may be the best option. Genetic counseling can also be beneficial to discuss the implications of Turner syndrome on future pregnancies and potential risks to offspring. However, the primary recommendation for having a family in this context would be adoption."
