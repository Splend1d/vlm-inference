Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate.\n\nThis is because changes in accounting estimates are more common and are accounted for prospectively, meaning they affect only future periods. Changes in accounting principles, on the other hand, are less frequent and require retrospective application, which means adjusting prior period financial statements as if the new principle had always been used. When there's uncertainty about the nature of the change, it is typically treated as a change in estimate due to the frequency and prospective treatment associated with such changes."
