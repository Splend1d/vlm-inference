Since the result is negative while both operands were positive, this indicates an overflow.\n\n### One's Complement Representation\n\nIn one's complement, the MSB also represents the sign:\n- \\(0\\) indicates a positive number.\n- \\(1\\) indicates a negative number.\n\nHowever, in one's complement, there is an additional issue with the representation of zero (positive and negative zeros).\n\nThe given numbers are both positive:\n- \\(011000 = 24\\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\\[ 011000 + 011000 = 110000 \\]\n\nIn one's complement, \\(110000\\) represents \\(-23\\). Similar to two's complement, since the result is negative while both operands were positive, this indicates an overflow.\n\n### Sign and Magnitude Representation\n\nIn sign and magnitude, the MSB represents the sign:\n- \\(0\\) indicates a positive number.\n- \\(1\\) indicates a negative number.\n\nThe magnitude bits represent the absolute value of the number.\n\nThe given numbers are both positive:\n- \\(011000 = 24\\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\\[ 011000 + 011000 = 110000 \\]\n\nIn sign and magnitude, \\(110000\\) would represent \\(-24\\), but since the sign bit is ignored for positive numbers, it simply means the result exceeds the maximum positive value that can be represented (which is 31 in a six-bit system). This does not constitute an overflow as defined in sign and magnitude because the result is still valid within the range of representable values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverflow occurs in both two's complement and one's complement representations when adding 011000 and 011000, but not in sign and magnitude representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Two's complement and one's complement only"
