For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n"

The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the woman's will devises her farm to her nephew and bequeaths the residue of her estate to her niece. When she sells the farm and uses the proceeds to buy a new home, the specific devise of the farm to the nephew is effectively nullified because the farm no longer exists. This is known as \"ademption by extinction,\" but it does not affect the residue of the estate.\n\nSince the farm was sold and the proceeds were used to purchase a new home, that new home becomes part of the residue of the estate. As per the terms of the will, the residue of the estate is bequeathed to the niece. Therefore, the niece is entitled to the home as the residuary legatee."
