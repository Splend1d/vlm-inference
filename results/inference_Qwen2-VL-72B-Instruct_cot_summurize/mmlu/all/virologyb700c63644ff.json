Aerosol droplet transmission\n\nMERS is primarily transmitted through close contact with infected individuals, typically via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. While there can be some risk associated with aerosols in certain settings, such as healthcare environments where aerosol-generating procedures might occur, the primary mode of transmission is not considered to be through aerosol droplets in the general sense. The other options listed are indeed associated with MERS:\n\nA. Spread by faecal-oral route: This is a possible route of transmission for MERS.\nC. Reservoir in bats: Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir hosts for the MERS-CoV virus.\nD. A conduit to humans via camels: Camels serve as an intermediate host, facilitating the transmission of MERS-CoV from bats to humans."
