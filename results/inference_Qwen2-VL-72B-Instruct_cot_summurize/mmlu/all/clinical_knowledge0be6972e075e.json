After using their steroid inhaler.\n\nRinsing the mouth after using a steroid inhaler is recommended to reduce the risk of side effects such as oral thrush (a fungal infection) and hoarseness. Steroid inhalers can leave a residue in the mouth that can contribute to these issues, so rinsing helps to minimize this risk. Bronchodilator inhalers do not typically require rinsing afterward."
