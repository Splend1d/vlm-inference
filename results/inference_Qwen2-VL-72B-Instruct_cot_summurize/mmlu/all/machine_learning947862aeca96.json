The following fully connected network without activation functions is linear: $g_3(g_2(g_1(x)))$, where $g_i(x) = W_i x$ and $W_i$ are matrices.\n\nThis statement is true. When you have a sequence of linear transformations (matrix multiplications) without any non-linear activation functions in between, the overall transformation remains linear. This is because the composition of linear functions is itself a linear function.\n\nB. Leaky ReLU $\\max\\{0.01x,x\\}$ is convex.\n\nThis statement is true. The Leaky ReLU function is defined as:\n\\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} \nx & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n0.01x & \\text{if } x \\leq 0 \n\\end{cases} \\]\nBoth pieces of this piecewise function are linear and therefore convex. Since the maximum of two convex functions is also convex, the Leaky ReLU is convex.\n\nC. A combination of ReLUs such as $ReLU(x) - ReLU(x-1)$ is convex.\n\nThis statement is false. The ReLU function $ReLU(x) = \\max\\{0,x\\}$ is not convex over its entire domain; it is only convex for $x \\geq 0$. Subtracting another ReLU function from it does not preserve convexity. In fact, the difference of two ReLU functions can result in a non-convex function.\n\nD. The loss $\\log \\sigma(x)= -\\log(1+e^{-x})$ is concave.\n\nThis statement is true. The logistic sigmoid function $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is a strictly increasing function, and its logarithm is concave. The negative log of a sigmoid function is commonly used as a loss function in binary classification problems and is indeed concave.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\nC. A combination of ReLUs such as $ReLU(x) - ReLU(x-1)$ is convex."
