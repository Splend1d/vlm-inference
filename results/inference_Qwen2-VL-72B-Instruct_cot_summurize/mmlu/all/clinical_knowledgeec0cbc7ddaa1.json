During high-intensity exercise, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of protein breakdown and can accumulate in muscles.\n\nB. **Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place.**\n   - This statement is generally true. Lactate production typically starts within the first few seconds of intense exercise due to anaerobic metabolism.\n\nC. **Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise.**\n   - This statement is also true. Phosphocreatine (PCr) stores are rapidly depleted during the initial seconds of high-intensity exercise as it is used to regenerate ATP.\n\nD. **With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.**\n   - This statement is false. With repeated sprints, the rate of lactate accumulation typically increases rather than declines because the body's ability to clear lactate becomes overwhelmed with successive bursts of high-intensity activity.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\n**D. With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.**"
