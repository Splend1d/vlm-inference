                    "text": "To determine what is wrong with a conservation system based wholly on economic motives according to Aldo Leopold, we need to analyze each option in the context of his views on conservation and ethics.\n\n1. **Option A: It assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.**\n   - This aligns well with Leopold's critique of utilitarian approaches to conservation. He argued that ecosystems are complex and interdependent, and that focusing solely on economic benefits can lead to neglecting essential but non-economic components of the ecosystem.\n\n2. **Option B: It assumes that economic motives are morally relevant.**\n   - While this might be true in some contexts, it doesn't directly address the core issue Leopold had with purely economic motives in conservation. His concern was more about the holistic functioning of ecosystems rather than the moral relevance of economic motives themselves.\n\n3. **Option C: It implies that nonhuman creatures are necessarily without any moral standing.**\n   - This is also a significant point in Leopold's philosophy, particularly in his \"land ethic,\" which extends ethical consideration to all parts of the biotic community. However, it is not the primary criticism he had regarding economic motives in conservation.\n\n4. **Option D: None of the above.**\n   - Given the analysis above, Option A most accurately reflects Leopold's critique of conservation systems based solely on economic motives.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. It assumes that the economic parts of the biotic system will function without the uneconomic parts.**"
