Governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage from Source 2 reflects the frustration and resistance of workers against the mechanization of labor during the Industrial Revolution. This period was characterized by significant social and economic upheaval as traditional ways of life were disrupted by new technologies and industrial practices. Before 1850, governments generally took a laissez-faire approach to industrialization, meaning they did not intervene significantly in the economy or address the social issues arising from it. As a result, workers often had to resort to direct action, such as Luddite protests, to voice their concerns. It wasn't until later in the 19th century that governments began to implement reforms and regulations to address some of these issues."
