Shaping\n\nShaping is a technique in operant conditioning where a behavior is taught by reinforcing successive approximations toward the desired behavior. In this case, the teacher starts by praising the student for playing the correct notes (a simpler task) and then gradually increases the criteria for praise as the student becomes proficient, eventually requiring proper dynamics and interpretation. This gradual reinforcement of increasingly complex behaviors is characteristic of shaping."
