Economic policies must take into account the incentives of not only the leaders, but the populations intended to influence.\n- This statement is generally true because effective economic policies often consider how they will impact both leaders and the general population.\n\nB. Policymakers can incentivize security-promoting behaviors in others through the use of sanctions and aid.\n- This statement is also true as sanctions and aid are tools used by policymakers to influence behavior and promote security.\n\nC. Trade policies can entice leaders to change behaviors in exchange for access to markets or trade preferences, and advance security.\n- This statement is true because trade policies are often used to encourage favorable actions from other countries.\n\nD. Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid.\n- This statement is not true. Poverty is directly linked to economic science. Economic policies and theories play a significant role in understanding and addressing poverty. While aid can help alleviate poverty, economic policies and strategies are fundamental in combating it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid."
