                    "text": "To determine the number of electrons, neutrons, and protons in an atom of chromium (Cr), we need to consider the atomic number and the mass number.\n\n1. **Atomic Number**: The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. For chromium (Cr), the atomic number is 24. Therefore, there are 24 protons in a chromium atom.\n\n2. **Electrons**: In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Thus, a neutral chromium atom has 24 electrons.\n\n3. **Mass Number**: The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. Chromium's most common isotope has a mass number of approximately 52.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Protons: 24\n- Electrons: 24 (in a neutral atom)\n- Neutrons: Mass number - Protons = 52 - 24 = 28\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 24 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons"
