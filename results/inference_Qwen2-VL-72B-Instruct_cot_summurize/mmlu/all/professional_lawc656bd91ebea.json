He decides to torture the victim's father for no good reason. After the beating, the father is hospitalized and in intensive care. The victim was not present but read about it in the newspaper and heard about it from the authorities. Victim suffered extreme emotional distress and required medical treatment. Can victim bring a successful action against perpetrator for intentional infliction of emotional distress? (IIED)\n\nA. No, because victim was not present at the time that the outrageous behavior occurred.\nB. Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.\nC. No, because perpetrator did not know that the father had immediate family members.\nD. Yes, because in torture cases there is strict liability imposed on the perpetrator.\n"

Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.\n\nIn legal terms, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires that the defendant's conduct be so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and cause severe emotional distress to the plaintiff. Given the description provided, the perpetrator's actions were indeed extreme and outrageous, which could support a claim of IIED even if the victim was not present during the incident. The fact that the victim suffered extreme emotional distress and required medical treatment further supports this claim."
