Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances.\n\nWhen a CPA reviews the financial statements of a nonissuer, they typically perform procedures such as making inquiries of management about matters that may affect the financial statements, including restrictions on the availability of cash balances. This helps the CPA understand the entity's liquidity position and any potential limitations on the use of cash. The other options listed (communicating deficiencies in internal control, examining trend analysis, and evaluating management's plans) are more commonly associated with an audit rather than a review engagement."
