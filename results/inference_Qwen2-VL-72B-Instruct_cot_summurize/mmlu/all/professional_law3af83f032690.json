This behavior aligns more closely with manslaughter, which involves causing death or serious injury through reckless conduct rather than with specific intent to kill or harm. Attempted murder typically requires proof of intent to kill, while assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury and battery require specific intent to harm, neither of which were explicitly demonstrated by the defendant's testimony."
