It had distinctive tread marks and an unusual wear pattern on the sole. It also had a \"V\" mark on the heel bottom that indicates the brand was a Victory shoe. The detective, armed with a proper search warrant, searched the suspect's apartment, where he found a shoe to a right foot that of the same size, and with a similar wear pattern and the same \"V\" mark as the shoeprint found at the scene. The shoe for the left foot was not found but the shoe for the right foot was seized from the suspect's closet and offered as evidence at trial. Is this admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because it is direct evidence of guilt.\nB. Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\nC. No, because this shoe is irrelevant and will have no residue or other probative evidence relating to it.\nD. No, because footprint evidence is highly speculative unless both shoes and shoe prints are offered and authenticated.\n"

Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\n\nThe shoe found in the suspect's apartment matches the size, wear pattern, and brand mark of the shoeprint found at the crime scene. While it is not direct evidence (i.e., it does not conclusively prove the suspect's guilt), it provides strong circumstantial evidence that can be used to support the prosecution's case. The fact that the shoe matches the footprint suggests a connection between the suspect and the crime, which can be considered by the jury in determining guilt or innocence."
