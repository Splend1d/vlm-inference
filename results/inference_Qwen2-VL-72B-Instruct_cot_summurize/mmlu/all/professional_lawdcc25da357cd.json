According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.\nC. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the bookkeeper's proposed testimony is admissible, we need to analyze the rules of evidence, particularly focusing on the hearsay rule.\n\n**Hearsay Rule:**\nHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Owner's Statement:** The bookkeeper intends to testify about what the owner said to her when he handed her the envelope. This statement (\"it contained a notice form for the insurance company\") is an out-of-court statement made by the owner.\n- **Purpose of Testimony:** The purpose of the bookkeeper's testimony is to establish that the envelope contained the notice of fire loss. Therefore, the bookkeeper is offering the owner's statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the envelope contained the notice).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- **Option A:** \"admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the owner's statement is hearsay since it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n- **Option B:** \"admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because it addresses the presumption of receipt rather than the admissibility of the hearsay statement itself.\n\n- **Option C:** \"inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.\"\n  - This option is incorrect because the issue here is not about the best evidence rule but about the hearsay rule.\n\n- **Option D:** \"inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\"\n  - This option is correct because the owner's statement is hearsay and there is no indication that it falls under any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**D. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.**"
