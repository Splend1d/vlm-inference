                    "text": "To determine the truth values of these statements, let's analyze each one individually:\n\n### Statement 1: R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\n- **R** typically refers to the set of real numbers.\n- A **splitting field** of a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) over a field \\( F \\) is the smallest field extension of \\( F \\) that contains all the roots of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nSince the real numbers (\\( \\mathbb{R} \\)) do not contain all the roots of every polynomial (for example, polynomials with complex roots), it cannot be said that \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) is a splitting field for every polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Statement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\n- The number of elements in a finite field must be a power of a prime number. This is because finite fields have orders that are powers of primes due to their structure and properties.\n\n- The number 60 can be factored as \\( 60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\). Since 60 is not a power of a prime number, there cannot exist a field with exactly 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, this statement is also false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
