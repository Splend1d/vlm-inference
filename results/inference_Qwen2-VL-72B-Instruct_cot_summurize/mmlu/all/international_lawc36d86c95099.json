The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control.\n\nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) generally applies within the territories of its member states. However, there are circumstances under which the ECHR can apply extraterritorially. This typically occurs when a member state exercises effective control over an area or individuals outside its own territory. Effective control can be established through military occupation, administration of another country's territory, or other forms of direct influence and authority over the area or individuals in question."
