Apple juice is a common beverage for children and is not inherently harmful.\n- There might be concerns about sugar content or dental health, but these are typically not considered morally wrong actions unless there are specific dietary restrictions or allergies that were ignored.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I saw a bee land in my sister's soda, so I offered it to her.\"\n- Offering someone a drink with a bee in it could potentially cause harm, either by the person drinking the bee or getting stung if they disturb it.\n- This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves knowingly exposing someone to potential harm without their knowledge or consent.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
