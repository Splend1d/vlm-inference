The radius \\( r \\) becomes \\( \\frac{r}{10} \\).\n\nLet's denote the original radius as \\( R \\). The new radius \\( r' \\) will be:\n\\[ r' = \\frac{R}{10} \\]\n\nThe gravitational force at the original radius \\( R \\) is:\n\\[ F_{\\text{original}} = G \\frac{M m}{R^2} \\]\n\nThe gravitational force at the new radius \\( r' \\) is:\n\\[ F_{\\text{new}} = G \\frac{M m}{(R/10)^2} = G \\frac{M m}{R^2 / 100} = 100 \\cdot G \\frac{M m}{R^2} \\]\n\nComparing the two forces:\n\\[ F_{\\text{new}} = 100 \\cdot F_{\\text{original}} \\]\n\nTherefore, if the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter with no change in mass, the gravitational force (and thus your weight) would increase by a factor of 100.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 100 times as much"
