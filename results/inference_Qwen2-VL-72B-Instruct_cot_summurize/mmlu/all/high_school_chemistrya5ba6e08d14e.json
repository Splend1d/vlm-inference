In a reduction reaction, an atom or ion gains electrons, resulting in a decrease in its oxidation state.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\n1. \\( \\text{Cu}^{2+} + e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}^+ \\)\n   - Copper(II) ions (\\( \\text{Cu}^{2+} \\)) gain one electron to become copper(I) ions (\\( \\text{Cu}^+ \\)).\n   - This is a reduction because the oxidation state of copper decreases from +2 to +1.\n\n2. \\( \\text{Cu}^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}^0 \\)\n   - Copper(I) ions (\\( \\text{Cu}^+ \\)) gain one electron to become neutral copper atoms (\\( \\text{Cu}^0 \\)).\n   - This is also a reduction because the oxidation state of copper decreases from +1 to 0.\n\n3. \\( \\text{Fe}^{2+} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}^{3+} + e^- \\)\n   - Iron(II) ions (\\( \\text{Fe}^{2+} \\)) lose one electron to become iron(III) ions (\\( \\text{Fe}^{3+} \\)).\n   - This is an oxidation because the oxidation state of iron increases from +2 to +3.\n\nBased on this analysis, the reduction half-reactions are:\n\n1. \\( \\text{Cu}^{2+} + e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}^+ \\)\n2. \\( \\text{Cu}^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}^0 \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions"
