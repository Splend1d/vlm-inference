                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement in the context of the motion of the whiffle ball, considering that air resistance is not negligible.\n\n### Statement I: The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\n- At the highest point, the ball momentarily stops before it starts falling back down. Therefore, its speed is indeed zero at this point. This statement is true.\n\n### Statement II: The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n- Even though the ball's speed is zero at the highest point, it still experiences an acceleration due to gravity (and possibly air resistance). The acceleration does not become zero just because the speed is zero. This statement is false.\n\n### Statement III: The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n- When air resistance is considered, the ball will slow down more on the way up compared to the way down. This is because air resistance acts against the motion both ways but has a greater effect when the ball is moving upward against gravity. As a result, the ball takes longer to reach the highest point than it does to fall back down. This statement is true.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- Statement I is true.\n- Statement II is false.\n- Statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I & III only"
