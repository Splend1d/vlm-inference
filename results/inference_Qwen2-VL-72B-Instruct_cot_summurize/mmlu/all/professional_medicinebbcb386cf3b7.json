Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40\u00a0pack-year history, and consumes more than 8\u00a0cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467\u00a0U/L (reference range: 28-100\u00a0U/L) and a\u00a0\u03b3-glutamyltransferase\u00a0level of 212\u00a0U/L (reference range: <\u00a055\u00a0U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?\n\nA. anterior rami of T1-T5\nB. anterior rami of T6-T10\nC. anterior rami of T11-T12\nD. posterior rami of T1-T5\n"

This is because the pancreas is innervated by these nerves, and pain from the pancreas can be referred to the corresponding dermatomes, which include the epigastrium and upper abdomen. The other options listed (anterior rami of T1-T5, anterior rami of T11-T12, and posterior rami of T1-T5) do not correspond to the innervation of the pancreas."
