It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in the passage, let's analyze the context and key points:\n\n1. **Erasmus's Work and Intentions**: The passage describes Erasmus's work, \"Adagiorum Collectanea,\" as a collection of proverbial sayings from ancient Latin authors aimed at helping writers improve their style and arguments. Erasmus intended to make classical knowledge accessible to a broader audience beyond just the elite.\n\n2. **Impact on Humanism**: The passage notes that Erasmus democratized humanism by making classical culture more widely available. This suggests a shift from humanism being an exclusive privilege of a few to becoming more inclusive.\n\n3. **Erasmus's Philosophical Approach**: Erasmus is portrayed as someone who sincerely loved humanity and its general culture, aiming to introduce the classic spirit into the broader populace. His approach was characterized by a desire to educate and enlighten rather than to maintain exclusivity.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Neoplatonism**: This philosophical movement emphasizes the spiritual and mystical aspects of Plato's philosophy. While Erasmus was influenced by classical thought, the passage does not specifically highlight a mystical or spiritual focus akin to Neoplatonism.\n\nB. **Antitrinitarianism**: This is a theological position that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. There is no mention of religious doctrine or theology in the passage related to Erasmus's work.\n\nC. **Pietism**: This movement emphasizes personal piety and spiritual experience over formalism and ritual. While Erasmus was a Christian, the passage focuses more on his educational and cultural contributions rather than on personal spirituality.\n\nD. **Rationalism**: This philosophical movement emphasizes reason and intellectual understanding. Erasmus's efforts to make classical knowledge accessible and to educate through rational means align well with the principles of rationalism.\n\nConsidering the emphasis on education, accessibility, and the use of reason to spread knowledge, the type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to **rationalism**.\n\nFinal answer: D. Rationalism"
