Smaller cells have a larger surface-to-volume ratio.\n\nThis is because the surface area-to-volume ratio increases as the size of an object decreases. This is important for cells because it allows them to exchange materials with their environment more efficiently. A larger surface area relative to volume means that nutrients and waste can be transported across the cell membrane more effectively, which is crucial for the cell's survival and function."
