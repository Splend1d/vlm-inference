The MR curve represents the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of output. For a monopolist, MR is less than the price because to sell an additional unit, the firm must lower the price on all units sold, not just the marginal unit. This results in the MR curve being steeper and lying below the demand curve but not parallel to it. Instead, it tends to be roughly halfway between the demand curve and the vertical axis, reflecting the fact that the monopolist's MR decreases at a faster rate than the price as output increases."
