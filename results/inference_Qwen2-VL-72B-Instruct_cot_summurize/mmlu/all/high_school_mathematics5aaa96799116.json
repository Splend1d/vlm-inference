We know that:\n\\[R \\times H = 32 - 8i\\]\nAnd Hardy's number is:\n\\[H = 5 + 3i\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(R\\), so we rearrange the equation to solve for \\(R\\):\n\\[R = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i}\\]\n\nTo divide by a complex number, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(5 + 3i\\) is \\(5 - 3i\\). So,\n\\[R = \\frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)}\\]\n\nExpanding both the numerator and the denominator:\n\\[R = \\frac{160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2}{25 - 9i^2}\\]\n\nRemembering that \\(i^2 = -1\\), we simplify further:\n\\[R = \\frac{160 - 136i - 24}{25 + 9}\\]\n\\[R = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34}\\]\n\\[R = 4 - 4i\\]\n\nTherefore, Ramanujan picked the number \\(4 - 4i\\), which corresponds to option D."
