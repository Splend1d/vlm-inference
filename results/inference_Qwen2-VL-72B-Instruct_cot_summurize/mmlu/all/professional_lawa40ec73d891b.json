While it might evoke sympathy, it does not necessarily negate the element of \"knowingly or willfully\" causing death. The defendant still intentionally caused the death, even if motivated by compassion.\n\nB. **The killing was not done with premeditation or deliberation.**\n   - Premeditation and deliberation are elements often associated with first-degree murder but are not explicitly required in the given definition. The definition focuses on whether the act was done knowingly or willfully. Thus, lack of premeditation does not necessarily lead to acquittal under this definition.\n\nC. **The defendant intended to kill himself, but the bullet grazed his head and struck and killed the victim.**\n   - Here, the defendant did not intend to kill the victim; the death was accidental. The act was not done \"knowingly or willfully\" towards the victim, making this the strongest candidate for acquittal based on the definition provided.\n\nD. **The defendant intended to kill another man, but the victim unknowingly stepped in front of the other man and was struck and killed by the bullet.**\n   - Although the defendant did not intend to kill this specific victim, the act was still done with the intent to kill someone else. Therefore, it still qualifies as \"knowingly or willfully\" causing death.\n\nGiven these analyses, the situation that would most likely result in the defendant's acquittal of the first-degree murder charge is:\n\n**C. The defendant intended to kill himself, but the bullet grazed his head and struck and killed the victim.**"
