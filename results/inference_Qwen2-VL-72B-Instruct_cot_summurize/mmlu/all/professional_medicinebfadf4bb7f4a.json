He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?\n\nA. Facial nerve\nB. Frontal sinus\nC. Mastoid sinus\nD. Olfactory nerve\n"

Olfactory nerve.\n\nThe symptoms described, including fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, along with the finding of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, suggest an infection of the central nervous system (CNS). The presence of cysts and trophozoites is indicative of a parasitic infection, and one common route for such parasites to enter the CNS is through the olfactory nerve.\n\nThe olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) is responsible for the sense of smell and passes directly from the nasal cavity to the brain without a blood-brain barrier. This makes it a potential pathway for certain parasites, such as Naegleria fowleri (a free-living amoeba that causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis), to gain access to the CNS. This type of infection can occur after exposure to contaminated water, such as in lakes or ponds, which is consistent with the patient's recent return from summer camp.\n\nOther options listed (facial nerve, frontal sinus, mastoid sinus) are less likely portals of entry for the described parasitic infection."
