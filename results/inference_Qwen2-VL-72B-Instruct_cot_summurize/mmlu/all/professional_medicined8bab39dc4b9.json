The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?\n\nA. Candida albicans\nB. Citrobacter freundii\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Staphylococcus aureus\n"

This is because E. coli is a common cause of appendicitis and is often found in the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause inflammation and infection of the appendix, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. The other options listed (Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, and Staphylococcus aureus) are not typically associated with appendicitis."
