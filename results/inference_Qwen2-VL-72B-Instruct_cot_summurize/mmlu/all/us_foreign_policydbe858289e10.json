ALL of the above\n\nGlobal and regional international trade agreements often employ a combination of mechanisms to facilitate cooperation and compliance among member countries. These include:\n\nA. Reciprocity across multiple issues: This involves countries making concessions or granting benefits to each other in various areas of trade, with the expectation that they will receive similar concessions in return.\n\nB. Reputational concerns of the actors: Countries may adhere to trade agreements to maintain a positive reputation in the international community, which can be important for attracting investment, fostering diplomatic relations, and ensuring continued access to markets.\n\nC. Side payments for adjusting to the organization: These are financial incentives or compensations provided to help countries adjust to new trade rules or standards, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union, which supports farmers and ensures food security.\n\nTherefore, all of these mechanisms can play a role in how global and regional international trade agreements function."
