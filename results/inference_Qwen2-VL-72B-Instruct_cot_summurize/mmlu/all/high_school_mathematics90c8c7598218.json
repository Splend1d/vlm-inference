This is because each divisor \\(d_i\\) pairs up with another divisor \\(d_j\\) such that \\(d_i \\cdot d_j = n\\), and there are \\(k/2\\) such pairs (since each pair multiplies to \\(n\\), and every divisor is part of exactly one pair).\n\nGiven that the product of the divisors is \\(n^6\\), we have:\n\\[n^{k/2} = n^6\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[k/2 = 6\\]\n\\[k = 12\\]\n\nSo, \\(n\\) must have exactly 12 divisors. The number of divisors of \\(n\\) can be determined by its prime factorization. If \\(n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_m^{a_m}\\), where \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m\\) are distinct prime numbers and \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m\\) are their respective exponents, then the number of divisors of \\(n\\) is given by:\n\\[(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\cdots(a_m + 1) = 12\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies this condition. Let's consider the options:\n\nA. 30 = \\(2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1\\)\nThe number of divisors is \\((1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8\\), which does not satisfy our condition.\n\nB. 64 = \\(2^6\\)\nThe number of divisors is \\((6+1) = 7\\), which also does not satisfy our condition.\n\nC. 2048 = \\(2^{11}\\)\nThe number of divisors is \\((11+1) = 12\\), which satisfies our condition.\n\nD. 60 = \\(2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1\\)\nThe number of divisors is \\((2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12\\), which also satisfies our condition.\n\nBetween C and D, we need to choose the smallest \\(n\\), which is 60.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 60."
