However, this doesn't necessarily align with the idea of \"controlled\" or \"moderate\" use, which implies some level of restraint.\n\nB. **Moderate and/or controlled use of illegal drugs is the norm.**\n   - This implies that most individuals who use illegal drugs do so in a way that is neither excessive nor leading to addiction. This could be consistent with findings from longitudinal studies if they show that many users maintain control over their usage.\n\nC. **An individual's illegal drug use inevitably diminishes over time.**\n   - This suggests that over time, people tend to reduce their illegal drug use. While this might be true for some, it does not necessarily reflect the behavior of all users, especially those who become addicted.\n\nD. **Those who begin using illegal drugs typically do not stop until they become addicted.**\n   - This implies a high likelihood of addiction among those who start using illegal drugs. If longitudinal studies confirm this, it would suggest a strong correlation between initial use and eventual addiction.\n\nGiven these options, the one that best aligns with the idea of surveys being confirmed by longitudinal studies is:\n\n**D. Those who begin using illegal drugs typically do not stop until they become addicted.**\n\nThis option suggests a strong pattern of progression towards addiction, which could be supported by longitudinal data showing trends over time."
