                    "text": "A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\n\nA. Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\nB. Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\nC. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\nD. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\n"

                    "text": "To determine how the U.S. Supreme Court should rule on this case, we need to consider several key legal principles and the specific circumstances presented.\n\n1. **Contracts Clause Analysis**:\n   - The Contracts Clause of both the federal and state constitutions prohibits laws that retroactively impair existing contracts. This clause aims to protect parties' reasonable expectations when entering into agreements.\n   - The state Supreme Court found that the new law retroactively impaired the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.\n\n2. **Federal and State Constitutional Issues**:\n   - The state Supreme Court ruled that the statute violated both the federal and state Contracts Clauses.\n   - The state constitutional Contracts Clause is similar to the federal one, indicating that the state court likely applied similar reasoning for both clauses.\n\n3. **U.S. Supreme Court Review**:\n   - The U.S. Supreme Court generally reviews cases involving federal constitutional questions but may also review state constitutional issues if they are intertwined with federal ones or if there is a significant federal interest.\n   - However, the U.S. Supreme Court typically defers to state courts on matters of state law unless there is a clear federal question involved.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A**: Refusing to review the case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below. This option suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court should not interfere with the state court's ruling on the state constitutional issue if it is sufficient to uphold the decision independently of the federal constitutional issue. This aligns with the principle of judicial restraint and respect for state sovereignty.\n\n- **Option B**: Reversing the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary. This option implies that the federal constitutional violation is sufficient to resolve the case, making the state constitutional analysis redundant.\n\n- **Option C**: Affirming the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstaining from reviewing the state constitutional issue. This option focuses solely on the federal constitutional violation without addressing the state constitutional issue.\n\n- **Option D**: Affirming the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue. This option suggests that since the state constitutional Contracts Clause mirrors the federal one, affirming the federal constitutional violation would inherently affirm the state constitutional violation as well.\n\nConsidering the principles of judicial restraint and the fact that the state constitutional Contracts Clause is similar to the federal one, the most appropriate course of action for the U.S. Supreme Court would be to focus on the federal constitutional issue and defer to the state court's ruling on the state constitutional issue.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**C. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.**"
