There is no indication that this action causes harm or violates any moral principles. It seems like a neutral or benign activity.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I put the naughty child in the dog cage to give the child a time out.\"\n- This scenario involves putting a child in a dog cage as a form of punishment. This action is generally considered inappropriate and potentially harmful, both physically and psychologically, for the child. It violates common moral standards regarding the treatment of children.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
