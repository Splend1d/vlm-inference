Since I don't have access to specific historical data, I will provide an educated guess based on typical ranges for such statistics.\n\nPhysical punishment in schools can vary widely depending on cultural norms and educational policies. In many countries, especially those with less stringent regulations against corporal punishment, percentages can range from moderate to high.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 18%\nB. 38%\nC. 58%\nD. 78%\n\nIf we consider that physical punishment might be more prevalent in some regions due to traditional practices or lack of strict enforcement of anti-corporal punishment laws, it is plausible that the percentage could be relatively high.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer would be:\n\nD. 78%"
