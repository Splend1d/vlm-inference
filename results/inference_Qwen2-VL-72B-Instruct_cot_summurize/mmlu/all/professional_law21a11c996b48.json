After two years, the owner of the hardware store told the employee it was time for them to enter into a more formalized employment agreement. The owner and the employee then both signed a written agreement drafted by the owner, whereby the employee agreed to work for a salary of $3,000 per month. The agreement further specified that either party had a right to terminate the contract by giving 60- days' notice to the other. Moreover, the agreement stipulated that if the employee's employment at the hardware store should be terminated, he would not be able to engage in any aspect of the hardware business for a period of two years within a 50-mile radius of the city. Finally, the agreement stated that should the employee violate this agreement, he would be liable to the hardware company for $1,500. The written agreement between the owner and the employee would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable in all respects.\nB. enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions.\nC. enforceable in all respects, except with regard to the $1,500 penalty clause.\nD. unenforceable in all respects.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the enforceability of the written agreement between the owner and the employee, we need to analyze each provision separately based on common legal principles.\n\n1. **Salary and Termination Provisions**: These provisions specify the salary amount ($3,000 per month) and the requirement for either party to give 60 days' notice before terminating the contract. These terms are generally straightforward and are typically enforceable as they pertain to standard employment conditions.\n\n2. **Non-compete Clause**: The agreement stipulates that if the employee's employment is terminated, they cannot engage in any aspect of the hardware business within a 50-mile radius of the city for two years. Non-compete clauses are often scrutinized by courts because they can restrict an individual's ability to earn a living. For such clauses to be enforceable, they must be reasonable in scope (duration, geographic area, and activities restricted). If the restriction is deemed unreasonable or overly broad, it may not be enforced.\n\n3. **Penalty Clause**: The agreement states that if the employee violates the agreement, they will be liable to the hardware company for $1,500. Penalty clauses are generally disfavored in contracts because they can be seen as punitive rather than compensatory. Courts prefer liquidated damages clauses that reasonably estimate actual damages rather than arbitrary penalties.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The salary and termination provisions are likely enforceable.\n- The non-compete clause may or may not be enforceable depending on whether it is considered reasonable.\n- The penalty clause is likely unenforceable as it appears punitive rather than compensatory.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions.**\n\nThis choice acknowledges that while some parts of the agreement may be enforceable, others (such as the non-compete and penalty clauses) may not meet legal standards for enforceability."
