Suicide rates can vary significantly across different regions and populations, but they generally do not exceed a few percent.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 0.90%\nB. 1.80%\nC. 3.60%\nD. 7.20%\n\nWe can analyze these options based on general knowledge about suicide rates. Typically, suicide rates are reported as a percentage of total deaths, and while some regions may have higher rates than others, a rate exceeding 3% would be unusually high for most populations.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible option among the given choices is:\n\nB. 1.80%\n\nThis is a reasonable estimate for the share of deaths by suicide in a region like Greenland as of 2017."
