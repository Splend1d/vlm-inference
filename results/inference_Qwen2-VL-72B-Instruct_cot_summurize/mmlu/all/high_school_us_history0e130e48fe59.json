                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of the provided information from William Penn's Charter of Privileges.\n\nThe passage is from a document issued by William Penn, who was granted land by the King of England. The text emphasizes the freedom of conscience and religion for the inhabitants of Pennsylvania. This indicates that the colony had a specific form of governance that allowed for such freedoms.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. A charter colony in which the King granted a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists - This option suggests a group of individuals or businesses were given a charter, but it doesn't specifically mention a single individual like William Penn.\n\nB. A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family - This option fits well with the historical context. William Penn was granted the land by the King and had significant control over the governance of the colony.\n\nC. A royal colony in which the King appointed the governor - This option implies direct control by the King through an appointed governor, which does not align with the autonomy suggested by the charter.\n\nD. An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King - This option is incorrect because colonies in the British Empire were not independent from the King's authority.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best description of the colony of Pennsylvania is:\n\nB. A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family."
