Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?\n\nA. The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\nB. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.\nC. The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.\nD. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n"

The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n\nThis is because once deliberations have begun, it is generally considered improper to release the jurors without proper supervision or sequestration. This is to prevent any outside influence or contamination of the jury's decision-making process. Allowing jurors to go home during deliberations could potentially compromise the integrity of the trial and the fairness of the verdict."
