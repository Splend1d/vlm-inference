Acetylcholine will not be degraded in the synaptic cleft.\n\nEnzymes in the synaptic cleft, such as acetylcholinesterase, play a crucial role in breaking down neurotransmitters like acetylcholine after they have transmitted their signal. If these enzymes are denatured by a chemical agent, they will no longer function properly, leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft because it will not be degraded. This can result in prolonged or excessive stimulation of the postsynaptic receptors."
