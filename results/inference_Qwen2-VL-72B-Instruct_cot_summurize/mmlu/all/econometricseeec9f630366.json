They use a different method of transforming the model so that the probabilities lie between zero and one\nB. The logit model can result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one\nC. For the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model\nD. The probit model is based on a cumulative logistic function\n"
