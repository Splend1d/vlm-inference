                    "text": "To determine Jonathan's IQ score based on it being in the 97th percentile, we need to understand what the 97th percentile means in terms of IQ scores.\n\nIQ scores are typically distributed according to a normal distribution with a mean (average) of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The 97th percentile indicates that Jonathan's IQ score is higher than 97% of the population.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a z-score calculator, we can find the corresponding z-score for the 97th percentile. The z-score for the 97th percentile is approximately +1.88.\n\nThe formula to convert a z-score to an IQ score is:\n\\[ \\text{IQ} = (\\text{z-score} \\times \\text{standard deviation}) + \\text{mean} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ \\text{IQ} = (1.88 \\times 15) + 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{IQ} = 28.2 + 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{IQ} = 128.2 \\]\n\nSo, the IQ score closest to this calculated value is:\n\nC. 130"
