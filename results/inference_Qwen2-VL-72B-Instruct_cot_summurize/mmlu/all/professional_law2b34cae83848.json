I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:\"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. \"Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?\n\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\nB. Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\nC. No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\nD. No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.\n"

Thus, the power of acceptance had indeed lapsed by the time he tried to accept the offer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the offer was made on May 1, and the 15-day period ended on May 16, making May 18 too late for acceptance."
