(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nEGARCH models address several limitations of standard GARCH models:\n\n(i) **Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative**: In standard GARCH models, the coefficients must be positive to ensure that the conditional variance is non-negative. However, in EGARCH models, the parameters can take any value because the model uses logarithms of variances and absolute values of standardized residuals, which inherently ensures non-negativity.\n\n(ii) **GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects**: Standard GARCH models assume that the impact of positive and negative shocks on volatility is symmetrical. However, empirical evidence suggests that negative shocks tend to increase volatility more than positive shocks of the same magnitude (the leverage effect). EGARCH models incorporate this asymmetry by including terms that distinguish between positive and negative shocks.\n\n(iii) **The responsiveness of future volatility to positive and negative shocks is symmetric under a GARCH formulation**: As mentioned above, standard GARCH models assume symmetry in the response to positive and negative shocks. EGARCH models explicitly model this asymmetry.\n\n(iv) **GARCH models cannot allow for a feedback from the volatility to the returns**: This criticism is not directly addressed by EGARCH models. While EGARCH models improve upon some aspects of standard GARCH models, they do not inherently solve the issue of feedback from volatility to returns. This would typically require a different type of model or an extension beyond the basic EGARCH framework.\n\nTherefore, the criticisms that can be overcome by EGARCH models are (i), (ii), and (iii)."
