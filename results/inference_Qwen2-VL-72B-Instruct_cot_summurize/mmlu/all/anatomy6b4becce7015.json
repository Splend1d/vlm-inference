It can reveal various structures in the oral cavity, including the mandibular canal, which is a channel in the lower jaw that contains nerves and blood vessels. The maxillary sinus, which is an air-filled space in the upper jaw, may also be visible on a dental panoramic radiograph. However, the hard palate and zygomatic arch are not typically visible on this type of X-ray. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The mandibular canal and maxillary sinus."
