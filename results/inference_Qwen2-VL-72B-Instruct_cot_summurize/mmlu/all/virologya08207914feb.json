The genome has been identified by the new method of deep sequencing\n\nAstroviruses were initially discovered in the 1975s, but their significance as human pathogens was not fully recognized until more recently. This is largely due to advances in molecular techniques, particularly deep sequencing, which have allowed for more sensitive and comprehensive detection of viral genomes in clinical samples. Deep sequencing has enabled researchers to identify astroviruses in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, thereby establishing their role as important causes of diarrhea in humans."
