During the first session with Hermann, you find out that his political views are completely repugnant to you, and you feel that you would not enjoy working with him. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. consult with another psychologist during the course of treatment to make sure your feelings don\u2019t interfere with your objectivity.\nB. discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process.\nC. see Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\nD. provide Hermann with appropriate referrals.\n"

If you find that your political views are so repugnant to you that you believe it would negatively impact your ability to provide effective and unbiased care, the most ethical course of action is to refer Hermann to another therapist who can better meet his needs without such personal conflicts. This ensures that Hermann receives the best possible care and support during his time of need."
