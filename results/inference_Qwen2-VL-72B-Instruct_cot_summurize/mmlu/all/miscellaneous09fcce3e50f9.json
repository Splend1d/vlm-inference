Helium (He) has an atomic mass of approximately 4.0026 u.\n- B. Sodium (Na) has an atomic mass of approximately 22.9897 u.\n- C. Uranium (U) has an atomic mass of approximately 238.0289 u.\n- D. Copper (Cu) has an atomic mass of approximately 63.546 u.\n\nComparing these values, it is clear that Uranium (U) has the highest atomic mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Uranium"
