College attendance in a state other than one's home state:\nThis can lead to lower voting rates because students might face difficulties registering and voting in their new state or may feel less connected to local politics there.\n\nB. Frequent relocation of one's primary residence:\nFrequent moves can make it challenging for individuals to register to vote and stay informed about local elections, leading to lower voting rates.\n\nC. The remoteness of most political issues to the daily lives of young people:\nIf young people perceive political issues as irrelevant to their daily lives, they are less likely to vote.\n\nD. The fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21:\nThe minimum voting age in all states is actually 18, so this statement is incorrect. This means it cannot be a contributing factor to lower voting rates among 18-to-25-year-olds.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The fact that the minimum voting age in some states is 21"
