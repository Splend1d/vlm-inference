According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (\u0394U) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):\n\n\\[ \\Delta U = Q - W \\]\n\nSince \u0394U = 0 for an isothermal process,\n\n\\[ 0 = Q - W \\]\n\nRearranging for Q gives:\n\n\\[ Q = W \\]\n\nGiven that the work done by the gas is 150 J, the heat added to the gas must also be 150 J to maintain the isothermal condition. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
