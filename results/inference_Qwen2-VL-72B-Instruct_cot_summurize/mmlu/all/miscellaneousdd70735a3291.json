Federal judges have political independence to fulfill their duties.\n\nThis clause in Article III, Section 1, of the United States Constitution ensures that federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, can serve for life as long as they exhibit \"good behavior.\" This lifetime appointment is intended to provide them with the political independence necessary to make impartial decisions without fear of retribution or removal from office due to political pressures. It does not mean that Congress cannot remove federal judges through impeachment and conviction (which is a process outlined in Article I), nor does it imply that the president has no influence over the composition of the Supreme Court (as the president nominates justices who must be confirmed by the Senate). Additionally, while federal judges do not typically advance within the judiciary in the same way that other government officials might, this is more a matter of structure rather than a direct consequence of the \"good behavior\" clause."
