During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.\nB. No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.\nC. Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\nD. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.\n"

Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal contexts, the battered woman's syndrome can be considered a valid defense if it can be shown that the defendant had a reasonable belief that they were in imminent danger and that their actions were necessary to prevent further harm or death. The facts provided indicate that the wife was subjected to escalating violence and abuse, which could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that she perceived her situation as life-threatening and that her actions were taken out of fear for her own safety. Therefore, the judge should consider giving the instruction about self-defense under the battered woman's syndrome to the jury."
