Brahminic orthodoxy\n\nThe socio-political alliance between the kshatriyas (the warrior or ruling class) and the shramanas (wandering ascetics or monks) in ancient India was often rooted in their shared opposition to Brahminic orthodoxy. The Brahmins were the priestly caste who held significant religious and social power, and their orthodox practices and rituals were sometimes challenged by both the kshatriyas seeking more political autonomy and the shramanas who promoted alternative spiritual paths."
