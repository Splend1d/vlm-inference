Since \\( p(0) = 0 \\), we know that the constant term \\( d \\) must be 0. So now we have:\n\n\\[ p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx \\]\n\nNext, we use the conditions \\( p(1) = 0 \\) and \\( p(-1) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ p(1) = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 + c(1) = a + b + c = 0 \\]\n\\[ p(-1) = a(-1)^3 + b(-1)^2 + c(-1) = -a + b - c = 0 \\]\n\nAdding these two equations gives us \\( 2b = 0 \\), so \\( b = 0 \\). Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us \\( 2a + 2c = 0 \\), or \\( a + c = 0 \\), which means \\( c = -a \\).\n\nSo any polynomial in W can be written as:\n\n\\[ p(x) = ax^3 - ax \\]\n\nThis shows that any polynomial in W is a scalar multiple of \\( x^3 - x \\), which means W is spanned by a single vector (polynomial), making it one-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the dimensions of V and W is:\n\n\\[ \\dim V + \\dim W = 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 5."
