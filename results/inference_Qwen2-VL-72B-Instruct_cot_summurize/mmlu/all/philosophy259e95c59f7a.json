Ethical egoism, on the other hand, is the moral doctrine that one should act in one's own self-interest.\n\nFeinberg's claim likely refers to a specific anecdote or story involving Abraham Lincoln that is used to argue for or against psychological egoism. Without the exact details of the story, we can still analyze the options based on general principles.\n\nA. Provides some evidence for psychological egoism: This would mean that the story shows Lincoln acting out of self-interest, which supports the idea that people are inherently motivated by their own interests.\n\nB. Provides some evidence against psychological egoism: This would mean that the story shows Lincoln acting against his own self-interest, which challenges the idea that people are always motivated by self-interest.\n\nC. Provides no evidence for or against psychological egoism: This would mean that the story does not provide any clear indication of whether Lincoln was motivated by self-interest or not.\n\nD. Actually involves a confusion between ethical egoism and psychological egoism: This would mean that the story or its interpretation mixes up the two concepts, where actions are mistakenly attributed to psychological egoism when they might be better explained by ethical egoism (or vice versa).\n\nGiven that Feinberg is a philosopher known for his work on ethics and moral philosophy, it is plausible that he might point out a common misunderstanding or confusion between these two types of egoism.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. actually involves a confusion between ethical egoism and psychological egoism."
