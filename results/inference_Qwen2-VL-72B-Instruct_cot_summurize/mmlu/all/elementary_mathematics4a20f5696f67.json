Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we divide $3.25 by $0.25:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3.25}{0.25} = 13 \\]\n\nSo, Marcus used 13 quarters to wash his car.\n\nSince each quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds, we multiply the number of quarters by 60 seconds to get the total time in seconds:\n\n\\[ 13 \\times 60 = 780 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we convert 780 seconds into minutes by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n\\[ \\frac{780}{60} = 13 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Marcus spent 13 minutes washing his car.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 13 minutes."
