The fossil record shows that there was a much greater diversity of ape genera in the past compared to the present.\n\nB. **They flourished in a broader area of the world than today's apes.**\n   - This is also true. Ancient apes were distributed across a wider geographic range, including parts of Europe and Asia, whereas modern apes are primarily found in Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nC. **Some ancient species were larger than today's apes.**\n   - This is correct as well. For example, Gigantopithecus, an extinct genus of ape, was significantly larger than any living ape species today.\n\nGiven that all three statements (A, B, and C) are true, the correct answer is:\n\nD. **All of the above.**"
