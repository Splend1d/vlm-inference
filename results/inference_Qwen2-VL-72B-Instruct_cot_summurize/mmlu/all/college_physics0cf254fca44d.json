The Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a stationary observer is:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right) f \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( f' \\) is the observed frequency,\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium,\n- \\( v_s \\) is the speed of the source relative to the medium, and\n- \\( f \\) is the emitted frequency.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( v = 350 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- \\( v_s = 3.5 \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n- \\( f = 600 \\, \\text{Hz} \\)\n\nFirst, calculate the frequency heard by the wall (which acts as a stationary observer):\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} = \\left( \\frac{350}{350 - 3.5} \\right) \\times 600 \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} = \\left( \\frac{350}{346.5} \\right) \\times 600 \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{wall}} \\approx 607.16 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nNext, the echo reflects off the wall and travels back towards the driver who is still moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s. Now, the driver becomes the observer and the reflected sound wave is the source. We use the Doppler effect formula again, but this time for a moving observer and a stationary source:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v} \\right) f \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_o \\) is the speed of the observer relative to the medium.\n\nGiven that the driver is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s, we have:\n\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350} \\right) \\times 607.16 \\]\n\\[ f' = \\left( \\frac{353.5}{350} \\right) \\times 607.16 \\]\n\\[ f' \\approx 612.9 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency the driver hears the echo at is closest to:\n\nC. 612 Hz"
