The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state. Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case.

This practice can be seen as placing a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce, which is generally prohibited by the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and it has been interpreted by the courts to include a dormant Commerce Clause that prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce.\n\nWhile the state may argue that the higher fee for out-of-staters is a reasonable contribution toward the protection they receive from the state, this rationale does not typically justify discriminatory pricing that affects interstate commerce. Therefore, the statute is more likely to be found unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause."
