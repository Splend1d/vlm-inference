The amount of the illuminated side of the Moon that can be seen from Earth\n\nThe phases of the Moon occur because of the changing angle between the Sun, Earth, and the Moon as the Moon orbits around Earth. This causes different portions of the Moon's illuminated side to be visible from Earth, resulting in the various phases such as new moon, waxing crescent, full moon, waning crescent, etc."
