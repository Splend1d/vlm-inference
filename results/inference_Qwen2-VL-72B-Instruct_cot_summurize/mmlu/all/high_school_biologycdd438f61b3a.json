This is because it alters the reading frame for all subsequent codons, potentially leading to a completely different amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. In contrast, deletions of nucleotide triplets or single nucleotide substitutions may not necessarily lead to such drastic changes in the protein sequence, depending on the specific context and the redundancy of the genetic code."
