Silent mutations\n\nSilent mutations, which occur in the DNA but do not result in any changes to the amino acid sequence of the protein due to the redundancy of the genetic code, can make it more difficult to determine evolutionary relatedness based on amino acid sequences compared to nucleotide sequences. This is because silent mutations would not be reflected in the amino acid sequence, potentially obscuring the true evolutionary relationships between species."
