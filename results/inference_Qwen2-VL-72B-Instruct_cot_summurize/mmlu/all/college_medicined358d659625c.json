The force of gravity, \\( F_g \\), acts vertically downward and can be resolved into two components:\n   - A component parallel to the plane: \\( F_{g\\parallel} = mg \\sin \\theta \\)\n   - A component perpendicular to the plane: \\( F_{g\\perp} = mg \\cos \\theta \\)\n\n2. The normal force, \\( N \\), acts perpendicular to the plane and balances the perpendicular component of gravity:\n   - \\( N = mg \\cos \\theta \\)\n\n3. The frictional force, \\( f \\), acts parallel to the plane but in the opposite direction to the motion. It depends on the normal force and the coefficient of friction, \\( \\mu \\):\n   - \\( f = \\mu N = \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\)\n\n4. The net force parallel to the plane is the difference between the gravitational force component and the frictional force:\n   - \\( F_{net} = F_{g\\parallel} - f = mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta \\)\n\n5. Newton's second law states that the net force equals mass times acceleration:\n   - \\( F_{net} = ma \\)\n\n6. Substituting the expression for \\( F_{net} \\) from step 4:\n   - \\( mg \\sin \\theta - \\mu mg \\cos \\theta = ma \\)\n\n7. Solving for acceleration \\( a \\):\n   - \\( a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta) \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for the acceleration of the object is \\( a = g (\\sin \\theta - \\mu \\cos \\theta) \\)."
