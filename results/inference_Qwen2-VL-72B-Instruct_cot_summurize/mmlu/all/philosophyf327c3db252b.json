No choice\n\nSituation ethics, also known as situational ethics or contextual ethics, is a form of ethical relativism that emphasizes the importance of context and circumstances in making moral decisions. It suggests that moral principles should be flexible and adaptable to specific situations rather than rigidly applied in all cases. Therefore, \"No choice\" does not align with the stance of situation ethics, which advocates for considering various options and making choices based on the particular context."
