The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\n\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n"

No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\n\nThis situation involves duress, which is a defense against the enforcement of a contract. Duress occurs when one party is coerced into entering into a contract due to the wrongful threats or actions of the other party. In this case, the mechanic's refusal to deliver the truck unless the landscaper paid an additional $2,000 constitutes a wrongful threat because it exploits the landscaper's immediate need for the truck to fulfill existing contractual obligations. Since the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to agree to the increased payment, the mechanic's demand can be considered duress, making the promise unenforceable."
