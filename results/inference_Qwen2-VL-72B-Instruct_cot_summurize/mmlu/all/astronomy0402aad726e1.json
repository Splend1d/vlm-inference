In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n\nExplanation:\nThe formation of the solar system began with a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As this nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. The temperature in the inner part of this disk was much higher due to the proximity to the young Sun, which prevented volatile substances like water, methane, and ammonia from condensing into solid particles. These volatiles could only condense in the cooler outer regions of the nebula, leading to the formation of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) that are composed primarily of these lighter elements.\n\nIn contrast, in the hotter inner regions, only refractory materials such as metals and silicates could condense into solid particles. Over time, these particles collided and stuck together, forming larger bodies known as planetesimals, which eventually grew into the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These planets are therefore made of denser materials because they formed in an environment where only heavy elements could condense and accumulate."
