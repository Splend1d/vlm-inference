Denied, because a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile always includes the trunk of the automobile.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen an officer has probable cause to make an arrest, they can conduct a search incident to that arrest. This includes searching the passenger compartment of the vehicle and any containers within it. The rationale behind this is to ensure officer safety and prevent the destruction of evidence. In this scenario, the officer had probable cause to arrest Stan based on the circumstances observed (breaking glass, blaring alarm, fleeing from a darkened liquor store). Therefore, the search of the trunk, which is part of the vehicle, would be considered lawful as part of the search incident to arrest."
