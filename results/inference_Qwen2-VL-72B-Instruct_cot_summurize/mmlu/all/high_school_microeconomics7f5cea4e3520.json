The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.\n\nWhen countries trade based on comparative advantage, they specialize in producing and exporting goods that they can produce more efficiently relative to other goods compared to their trading partners. This means that each country focuses on the product where it has the lowest opportunity cost of production. In this scenario, if the United States is trading salmon for anchovies from Peru, it suggests that the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost in producing salmon than Peru does, while Peru has a lower opportunity cost in producing anchovies than the U.S. does."
