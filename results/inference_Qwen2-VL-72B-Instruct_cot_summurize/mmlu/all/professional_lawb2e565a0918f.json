Under the Secretary's interpretation, the new brochures contained obscene photographs and sexually suggestive language. The Secretary was acting under authority given to him by Section 1123(b) of state statute, which provided:\"Whenever the Secretary of Commerce shall determine that a commercial mailing to residents of the state is inappropriate for minors, the Secretary shall have the authority to prohibit such mailing. \"The case reached the highest court in the state, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, being in violation of both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. If this case is reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court, it will reach that court\n\nA. by appeal.\nB. by certiorari.\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n"

This means that the Supreme Court has discretion to choose which cases it will hear, and it typically does so based on the importance of the legal issues involved or to resolve conflicts between different state or federal court decisions. Therefore, the correct answer is B. by certiorari."
