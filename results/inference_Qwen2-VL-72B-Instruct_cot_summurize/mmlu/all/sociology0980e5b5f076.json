The proportion of people living alone has fallen to 29%.\n- This statement suggests that fewer people are living alone, which might imply an increase in other forms of living arrangements (like cohabitation or marriage). However, it does not directly explain a decline in marriage rates.\n\nB. Many people are cohabiting in long-term relationships.\n- This is a plausible reason for the decline in marriage. If more people choose to live together without getting married, it would naturally lead to lower marriage rates.\n\nC. The upward curve of remarriages compensates for the drop in first marriages.\n- This implies that while first marriages may be declining, the number of remarriages is increasing. This could balance out the overall marriage rate but doesn't necessarily indicate a decline in marriage as a whole.\n\nD. All of the above.\n- Given the analysis, options B and C seem relevant to explaining the decline in marriage, whereas A does not directly support this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. Many people are cohabiting in long-term relationships."
