He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\n"

The most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm this diagnosis would be polysomnography (option C), which involves monitoring the patient's breathing, oxygen levels, and brain activity during sleep to detect any disruptions in breathing patterns.\n\nA 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring (option A) would not be useful in diagnosing OSA as it only monitors heart function and rhythm. A multiple sleep latency test (option B) measures how quickly a person falls asleep in a quiet environment and can help diagnose narcolepsy, but it is not specific for OSA. A CT scan of the head (option D) may reveal structural abnormalities in the brain, but it would not be helpful in diagnosing OSA."
