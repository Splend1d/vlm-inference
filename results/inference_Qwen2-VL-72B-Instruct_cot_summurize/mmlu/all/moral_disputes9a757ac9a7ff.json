                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the comparison between the cases of Smith and Jones as presented by Rachels.\n\n1. **Understanding the Cases:**\n   - **Smith:** Smith is a bystander who sees a child drowning in a pond. Smith could easily save the child but chooses not to, resulting in the child's death.\n   - **Jones:** Jones is also a bystander who sees a child drowning in a pond. However, Jones pushes the child into the water, causing the child's death.\n\n2. **Rachels' Argument:**\n   - Rachels uses these cases to argue about the moral equivalence between active harm (killing) and passive harm (letting die).\n   - He suggests that both actions result in the same outcome (the child's death), and thus, the moral responsibility should be considered equally severe.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"Killing is in itself morally worse than letting die.\"\n     - This option implies that actively causing someone's death is morally worse than passively allowing it to happen. Rachels' argument does not support this view; he argues for moral equivalence.\n   - **Option B:** \"Letting die in itself is morally worse than killing.\"\n     - This option implies the opposite of Option A, suggesting that passively allowing someone to die is morally worse than actively causing their death. Again, this contradicts Rachels' argument.\n   - **Option C:** \"Killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die.\"\n     - This option aligns with Rachels' argument. He contends that there is no inherent moral difference between actively killing someone and passively allowing them to die if the outcomes are the same.\n   - **Option D:** \"None of the above.\"\n     - This option would be incorrect because one of the options (Option C) accurately reflects Rachels' argument.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Killing is not in itself morally worse than letting die.**"
