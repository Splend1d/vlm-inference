However, assuming this is a hypothetical or fictional scenario without real-world implications, it would likely not be considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I tossed the hot coal to my friend.\"\n- Tossing a hot coal to someone could cause physical harm.\n- Intentionally causing harm to another person is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
