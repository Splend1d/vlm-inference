                    "text": "Let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nA. **An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.**\n   - When a charged object (in this case, the nonconducting sphere with charge +Q) is brought near a neutral conducting sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conductor. This induction creates an electric field within the conductor that opposes the external electric field from the charged sphere. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. **The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of \u2013Q.**\n   - Induction causes charges to redistribute on the surface of the conductor but does not change the net charge of the conductor. Since the conducting sphere starts as neutral, it remains neutral after induction. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nC. **The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.**\n   - The positively charged nonconducting sphere will induce negative charges on the side of the conducting sphere facing it, and positive charges on the opposite side. The induced negative charges on the conducting sphere will attract the positive charge on the nonconducting sphere, resulting in an electrostatic attraction. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nD. **The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.**\n   - As explained above, the induced charges on the conducting sphere will result in an attraction between the two spheres, not a repulsion. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct statements are:\n- A. An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\n- C. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction."
