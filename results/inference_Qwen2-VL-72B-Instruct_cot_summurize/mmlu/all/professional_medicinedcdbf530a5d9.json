She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most appropriate management is to\n\nA. administer an epidural anesthetic\nB. administer tocolytic therapy\nC. apply cervical topical corticosteroids\nD. augment the labor with oxytocin\n"

Augment the labor with oxytocin.\n\nGiven that the patient is at 39 weeks' gestation, in active labor with a fully effaced cervix and 7 cm dilation, but experiencing a decrease in the frequency and strength of contractions, augmentation with oxytocin (Pitocin) would be the appropriate next step. This can help to stimulate more effective contractions and progress labor. An epidural anesthetic might be considered if pain control is inadequate, but it is not the primary intervention needed here. Tocolytic therapy is used to stop preterm labor, which is not indicated in this case. Applying cervical topical corticosteroids is not a standard practice in managing labor."
