For MAP estimation, we aim to maximize the posterior probability, which includes both the likelihood and the prior distribution over the parameters. Therefore, the Maximization step must be modified to incorporate the prior distribution into the optimization process.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Maximization"
