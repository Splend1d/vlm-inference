On the first day of trial, the air-conditioning malfunctioned in the courtroom, so the judge directed that the selection of the jurors take place in his chambers. Because of the large number of potential jurors, the judge directed that only one lawyer for the prosecution and one for the defense participate in the jury selection process. The defendant remained in the courtroom during the questioning of the jurors. Once the jury was selected, the trial was postponed until the next day, when the air-conditioning was again working. Did the court's jury selection process violate the defendant's federal constitutional rights?\n\nA. No, because a defendant's confrontation rights are limited to witnesses rather than jurors.\nB. No, because there was good cause to conduct jury selection outside the defendant's presence.\nC. Yes, because excluding the defendant undercut the presumption of innocence.\nD. Yes, because jury selection is a critical stage at which a defendant is entitled to be present.\n"

Yes, because jury selection is a critical stage at which a defendant is entitled to be present.\n\nUnder the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, a defendant has the right to be present at all critical stages of the criminal proceedings against them. Jury selection is considered a critical stage because it directly affects the defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. The defendant's absence from this process could potentially prejudice their case, as they have a right to observe and participate in the selection of the jurors who will decide their fate. Therefore, excluding the defendant from the jury selection process would generally be seen as a violation of their constitutional rights."
