This means it spans from $x=0$ to $x=3$ and from $y=0$ to $y=2$.\n\nThe condition $x < y$ represents all points below the line $y = x$. In the context of our rectangle, this line intersects the rectangle at $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$, forming a right triangle within the rectangle.\n\nThe area of the entire rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$ square units.\n\nThe area of the triangle formed by the condition $x < y$ (which is a right triangle with base and height of length 2) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point $(x,y)$ in the rectangle satisfies $x < y$ is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle, which is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $\\frac{1}{3}$."
