In this case:\n\n- The labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype ($100,000) would be considered part of R&D because they are associated with the initial development phase.\n- The cost of testing the prototype ($40,000) is also part of R&D as it is an expense incurred during the testing phase of the product development process.\n\nLegal costs to file a patent ($50,000) are generally not considered R&D costs but rather an intangible asset once the patent is granted. Therefore, these costs should not be included in the R&D expenses.\n\nSo, the total amount that should be expensed as research and development costs is $100,000 (labor and material for the prototype) + $40,000 (testing the prototype) = $140,000."
