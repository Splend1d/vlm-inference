The volume of this sphere can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r = 1$ in this case. Thus, the volume of the sphere is:\n\n\\[V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\]\n\nThe region from which points are randomly selected is defined by $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$, $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$, and $-1 \\leq z \\leq 1$. This forms a cube with side length 2 (since each dimension ranges over a length of 2 units). The volume of this cube is:\n\n\\[V_{cube} = 2^3 = 8.\\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected point lies within the sphere (and thus satisfies $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 1$) is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{V_{sphere}}{V_{cube}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$."
