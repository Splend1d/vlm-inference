                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle\" - This is not true. Using a venepuncture needle for pain testing is inappropriate and potentially harmful. Pain sensation should be tested using a sterile, blunt object like a cotton swab or a wisp of cotton.\n\nB. \"Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch\" - This is not entirely accurate. While proprioception and light touch do share some pathways (such as the dorsal columns), they are not identical. Proprioception involves more complex neural pathways that include muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs.\n\nC. \"It is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork\" - This is true. A 256 Hz tuning fork is commonly used to test vibration sense because it provides a consistent frequency that can be easily perceived by most individuals.\n\nD. \"Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns\" - This is incorrect. Pain impulses primarily travel through the anterolateral system (spinothalamic tract) rather than the dorsal columns. The dorsal columns are mainly responsible for transmitting sensations of fine touch, vibration, and proprioception.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
