The genome encodes several proteins, including the T antigens, which are involved in viral replication and transformation of host cells. The T antigens are divided into large T antigen (LTAg), small T antigen (sTAg), and middle T antigen (mTAg). These antigens play crucial roles in the viral life cycle and pathogenesis."
