Legislation that criminalizes certain cultural behaviors or practices can marginalize groups, lead to social conflict, and undermine the rule of law if such laws are discriminatory or unjust.\n\nD. The use of military force to conduct ethnic cleansing through displacement and killing is a direct and severe threat to societal security, involving gross human rights violations and the destruction of communities.\n\nTherefore, all of these options represent significant threats to societal security in different ways."
