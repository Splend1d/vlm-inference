The posterior fragment may be displaced upward and backward by the action of the masseter and temporalis muscles, which elevate the mandible during chewing. The lateral pterygoid muscle primarily acts to protract (move forward) and depress the mandible, while the medial pterygoid muscle assists in elevation and protrusion but does not typically cause significant displacement in a fracture scenario."
