No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party.\n\nThe homeowner's injury occurred due to an alteration made by the mechanic, which was contrary to the warnings provided in the operating manual. Since the alteration was significant and directly contributed to the failure of the automatic cutoff switch, it is considered a substantial alteration. Manufacturers are generally not liable for injuries resulting from such alterations made by third parties, especially when the manual clearly warned against them."
