According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?\n\nA. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.\nB. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\nD. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n"

The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nThis argument supports the constitutionality of the statute by asserting that the funding limitation does not infringe upon a fundamental right (such as the right to abortion) but instead serves a rational basis for achieving a legitimate state interest. This approach aligns with constitutional principles that allow states to make distinctions in funding based on rational criteria without violating constitutional rights."
