                    "text": "To determine the social philosophy advocated by Herbert Spencer based on the given passage, let's analyze the key points:\n\n1. **Government's Role**: Spencer argues that the government should only protect individuals' freedoms and not intervene in providing relief or ensuring satisfaction for citizens. This suggests a limited role for the government.\n\n2. **Individual Responsibility**: He emphasizes individual responsibility and freedom, stating that people should be free to do as they wish without infringing on others' freedoms. This indicates a belief in personal accountability.\n\n3. **Natural Outcomes**: Spencer views hardships such as poverty, distress, and starvation as \"decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence,\" implying that these outcomes are part of a natural order that benefits humanity as a whole.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Utopian socialism**: This philosophy advocates for a society where resources are owned collectively and distributed equally. It involves significant government intervention to ensure equality, which contradicts Spencer's views on limited government and individual responsibility.\n\nB. **Social conservatism**: This philosophy generally supports traditional values and institutions but does not necessarily align with Spencer's emphasis on minimal government intervention and the natural selection-like view of societal outcomes.\n\nC. **Romanticism**: This movement focuses on emotion, individualism, and the glorification of nature and the past. While it shares some elements of individualism, it does not align with Spencer's specific arguments about government roles and natural outcomes.\n\nD. **Social Darwinism**: This ideology applies the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" from biological evolution to human societies. It supports the idea that competition and natural selection lead to societal progress, aligning closely with Spencer's views on limited government intervention and the beneficial nature of hardships.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most fitting social philosophy advocated by Herbert Spencer in this passage is:\n\n**D. Social Darwinism**"
