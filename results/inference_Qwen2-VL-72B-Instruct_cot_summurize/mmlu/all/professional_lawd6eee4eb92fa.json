In this case, the manufacturer delivered 490 out of 500 widgets, which could be considered substantial performance.\n\n2. **Acceptance of Delivery**: The buyer accepted and paid for the 490 widgets delivered. Acceptance of part of the goods can sometimes be seen as an indication that the buyer is willing to accept the partial fulfillment.\n\n3. **Material Breach**: A material breach occurs when the breach is significant enough to undermine the purpose of the contract. Here, the manufacturer failed to deliver 10 widgets out of 500, which might not be considered a material breach depending on the context and the importance of those widgets to the buyer.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A**: \"not recover, because under the circumstances the manufacturer substantially performed.\" This option suggests that the manufacturer's delivery of 490 widgets out of 500 constitutes substantial performance, which may prevent the buyer from recovering damages.\n\n- **Option B**: \"not recover, because the buyer accepted delivery of the 490 widgets.\" This option implies that the acceptance of the partial delivery negates any claim for breach of contract.\n\n- **Option C**: \"recover, because the manufacturer failed to perform his contractual obligation.\" This option suggests that the failure to deliver all 500 widgets is sufficient grounds for the buyer to recover damages.\n\n- **Option D**: \"recover, because the manufacturer's failure to deliver the additional widgets resulted in a material breach.\" This option hinges on whether the failure to deliver the remaining 10 widgets is considered a material breach.\n\nConsidering the context and the principles of contract law, the most likely outcome is that the buyer will not recover because the manufacturer substantially performed by delivering 490 out of 500 widgets, and the buyer accepted and paid for them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**A. not recover, because under the circumstances the manufacturer substantially performed.**"
