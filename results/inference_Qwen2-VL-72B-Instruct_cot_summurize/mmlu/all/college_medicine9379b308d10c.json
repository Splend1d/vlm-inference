It helps to maintain pH homeostasis by buffering hydrogen ions produced during high rates of glycolysis and other metabolic processes. This buffering action is crucial for maintaining optimal cellular function under conditions of high metabolic activity.\n\n- A. Glutamine: While glutamine is an important amino acid involved in various metabolic pathways, it does not primarily function as an intracellular buffer.\n- B. Glucose: Glucose is a primary energy source for cells but does not act as a buffer to regulate pH.\n- D. Amylase: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars and does not have a role in buffering pH within cells.\n\nTherefore, carnosine is the best choice among the options provided for acting as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high."
