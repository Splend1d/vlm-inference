The mental symphysis, which is the midline suture of the mandible, typically fuses between the ages of 2 and 4 years.\n\nB. The condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty.\n- This statement is correct. The condylar growth cartilage, which is responsible for much of the growth of the mandible, becomes inactive around the time of puberty.\n\nC. The ossification center appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.\n- This statement is incorrect. The ossification center of the mandible actually appears in the second month of intrauterine life (I.U.L), not at 8 weeks.\n\nD. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n- This statement is incorrect. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is primarily the masseter muscle, not the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nB. The condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty."
