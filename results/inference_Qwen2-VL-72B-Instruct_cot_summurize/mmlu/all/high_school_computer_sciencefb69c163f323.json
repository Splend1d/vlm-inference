The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer\n\nAn IP address can be used to track a user's online activity and potentially link it back to their physical location, which poses a significant threat to personal privacy. Cookies, while they can store information about browsing habits, typically do not contain personally identifiable information unless linked with other data. An email address can be used for targeted advertising or phishing attempts but is less intrusive than an IP address. A public key used for encryption is designed to be shared publicly and does not inherently compromise privacy."
