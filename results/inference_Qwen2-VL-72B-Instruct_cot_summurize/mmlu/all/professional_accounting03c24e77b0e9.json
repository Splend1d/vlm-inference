Internally generated cash flow projections for a related asset or liability\n\nLevel 2 inputs are defined as inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, etc.).\n\nInternally generated cash flow projections are considered Level 3 inputs because they involve significant unobservable inputs that reflect management's own assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability."
