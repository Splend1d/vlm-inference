Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?\n\nA. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)\nB. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nC. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)\n"

A deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as those described, including peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord damage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)"
