The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth. If the customer asserts a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the customer will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because it was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol.\nB. prevail, because the person who punched the customer was employed as a bouncer.\nC. not prevail, because the owner did not touch the customer.\nD. not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n"

This means that if the bouncer, who was hired to maintain order and security, used excessive force or acted inappropriately while performing their duties, the bar owner could be held responsible for the bouncer's actions. Therefore, the customer would most likely prevail in asserting a battery claim against the owner of the bar."
