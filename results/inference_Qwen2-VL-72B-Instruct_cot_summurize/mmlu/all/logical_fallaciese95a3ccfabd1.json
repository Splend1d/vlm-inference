In a valid categorical syllogism, each term (subject and predicate) must appear exactly twice: once in the premises and once in the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Enthymeme**: An enthymeme is an incomplete argument that omits one or more premises. It does not have specific rules about the number of times terms are used.\n\nB. **Categorical**: A categorical syllogism involves three categorical propositions, each containing two terms. The rule about each term appearing exactly twice applies here.\n\nC. **Disjunctive**: A disjunctive syllogism involves a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) and a negation leading to a conclusion. It does not follow the same term usage rule as categorical syllogisms.\n\nD. **Conditional**: A conditional syllogism involves conditional statements (\"if-then\") and does not adhere to the same term usage rule as categorical syllogisms.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Categorical**"
