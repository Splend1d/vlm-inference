He famously begins with the statement \"Cogito, ergo sum\" (\"I think, therefore I am\"), which establishes the existence of his own mind as the first certainty. From there, he questions the reliability of his senses and the possibility that he might be deceived by an evil demon or simply be dreaming. Therefore, the correct answer is A. dreaming, as it aligns with Descartes' skepticism about the external world and the possibility that his experiences might not reflect reality."
