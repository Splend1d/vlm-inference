The electric force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nB. The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\nC. The electric force, because the outer electrons in the top atomic layer of the table repel the outer electrons in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nD. The strong nuclear force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\n"

The electric force, because the outer electrons in the top atomic layer of the table repel the outer electrons in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\n\nExplanation:\nThe interaction between the table and the wooden block is primarily due to the electromagnetic force, which includes both attractive and repulsive forces between charged particles. In this case, the repulsion between the outer electrons (which are negatively charged) in the atoms of the table and the wood prevents the two objects from occupying the same space. This repulsion is part of the broader category of interatomic and intermolecular forces, often referred to as van der Waals forces or simply electrostatic interactions. These forces are responsible for the rigidity and structural integrity of solid materials, allowing the table to support the weight of the wooden block without collapsing under it."
