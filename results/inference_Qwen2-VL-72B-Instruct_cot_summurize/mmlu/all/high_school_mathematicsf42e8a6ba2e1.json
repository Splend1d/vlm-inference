This means that for any value of $x$, $f(x) = f(x + 2n)$ where $n$ is an integer.\n\nAdditionally, since the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, if we denote the original function as $f(x)$, then after the transformation, the new function becomes $2f(x - 2)$. However, because the transformed graph is identical to the original, this implies that $f(x) = 2f(x - 2)$.\n\nGiven that $f(0) = 0.1$, we want to find $f(10)$. Since the function repeats every $2$ units, we can express $f(10)$ in terms of $f(0)$ using the periodicity and the vertical stretch:\n\n\\[f(10) = 2f(8) = 4f(6) = 8f(4) = 16f(2) = 32f(0)\\]\n\nSubstituting the given value of $f(0) = 0.1$ into the equation:\n\n\\[f(10) = 32 \\times 0.1 = 3.2\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 3.2."
