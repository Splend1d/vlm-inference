The conversion factor from MHz to Tesla for a proton (1H) is approximately 1 T = 42.576 MHz. However, since we are dealing with 23Na, which has a different gyromagnetic ratio, we will use the given values directly without converting to Tesla.\n\nNow, calculate \u03b3:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 198.52 \\times 10^6}{750 \\times 10^6} \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 198.52}{750} \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1248.84}{750} \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx 1.6651 \\]\n\nThis result is not in the correct units yet. To get it in T^-1 s^-1, we need to multiply by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx 1.6651 \\times 2\\pi \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx 1.6651 \\times 6.2832 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx 10.45 \\]\n\nSo, the magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3) is approximately 10.45 \u00d7 10^7 T^-1 s^-1.\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation exactly, but option A is closest:\n\nA. 101.1 x 10^7 T-1 s-1\n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the question or answer choices. Based on the calculation, none of the provided options are correct. If you have any additional information or if there's a specific context I should consider, please let me know!"
