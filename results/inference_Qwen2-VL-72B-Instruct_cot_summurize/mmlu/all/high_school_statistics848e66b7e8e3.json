Percentiles indicate the percentage of scores that fall below a particular score, not the actual number of points scored. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary scored exactly eight more points than Pam.\n\n### Option B: Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\nPercentiles do not directly translate into percentage differences in scores. The difference in percentiles (64th - 56th = 8) does not mean that Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's. This statement is also incorrect.\n\n### Option C: Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\nThis statement is correct. Since Mary scored at the 64th percentile and Pam at the 56th percentile, it means that 8% of the test-takers scored between Pam and Mary.\n\n### Option D: Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\nWithout knowing the total number of test-takers or any specific details about the distribution of scores, we cannot determine the exact number of people who scored higher than both Mary and Pam. This statement cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is:\n\n**C. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.**"
