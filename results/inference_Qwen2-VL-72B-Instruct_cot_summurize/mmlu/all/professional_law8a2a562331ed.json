State law, however, prohibits use of this state funding for surgery for any person who has resided in the state for less than one year, except in emergency situations. A woman moved to the state two months ago seeking permanent employment. Her physician recommends non-emergency surgery to treat a medical condition. The surgery would qualify for state funding if the woman had resided in the state for a year. The woman has sued to invalidate the state law that prohibits state funding of her surgery. Should the woman prevail in her action?\n\nA. No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\nC. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\nD. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the woman should prevail in her lawsuit against the state law prohibiting state funding for her surgery, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Fundamental Rights and Equal Protection:**\n   - The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law. This includes the prohibition of discriminatory laws that burden fundamental rights without a compelling governmental interest.\n   - The right to travel is considered a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n\n2. **State Funding and Residency Requirements:**\n   - States have discretion in allocating their resources, including healthcare funding. However, they must do so in a manner that does not violate constitutional protections.\n   - Residency requirements can be justified if they serve a legitimate governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options:**\n\n   - **Option A:** \"No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\"\n     - While conserving resources is a legitimate concern, it does not necessarily justify a law that discriminates against certain residents based on their duration of residency. This argument alone may not be sufficient to uphold the law.\n\n   - **Option B:** \"No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\"\n     - This option suggests that the law aims to prevent the use of state funds on individuals who might leave the state soon after receiving benefits. However, this rationale could still be challenged as potentially discriminatory against new residents.\n\n   - **Option C:** \"Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\"\n     - Health care is not universally recognized as a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, this argument is likely weaker compared to the right to travel.\n\n   - **Option D:** \"Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\"\n     - The right to travel is a well-established fundamental right. A law that imposes restrictions on new residents could be seen as an undue burden on this right, especially if it affects their ability to access necessary medical care shortly after moving to the state.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling argument is that the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel, which is a protected right under the Constitution.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.**"
