Their EQ was relatively lower compared to later hominins.\n\n2. **Premodern Homo sapiens**: These early humans had a brain size similar to modern humans but were generally smaller in stature. Their EQ was higher than Homo erectus but not as high as modern Homo sapiens.\n\n3. **Neandertals**: Neandertals had a large brain size, often exceeding that of modern humans (around 1,400-1,700 cubic centimeters). However, they also had a robust and muscular build, which means their brain-to-body mass ratio was not as high as might be expected due to their large body size.\n\n4. **Modern Homo sapiens**: Modern humans have a brain size averaging around 1,350 cubic centimeters and a typical body weight of around 62 kg for males and 53 kg for females. The EQ for modern Homo sapiens is considered to be the highest among these options.\n\nGiven this information, the species with the proportionally largest brain, considering both brain size and body size, is:\n\n**D. modern Homo sapiens**"
