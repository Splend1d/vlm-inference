Unlinked anonymous\n\nUnlinked anonymous surveillance testing is designed to minimize selection bias by ensuring that individuals cannot be identified from the test results. This approach can encourage participation from a broader range of the population, as individuals may be more willing to participate if they know their identity will not be linked to the test results. This can lead to a more representative sample and reduce the potential for selection bias in the data collected."
