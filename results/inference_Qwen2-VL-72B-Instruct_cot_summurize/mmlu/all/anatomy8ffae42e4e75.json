Damage to this nerve can result in various symptoms, including ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), which is a common manifestation of third cranial nerve palsy. Other effects may include problems with eye movement and pupil constriction, but ptosis is a direct consequence of third cranial nerve damage."
