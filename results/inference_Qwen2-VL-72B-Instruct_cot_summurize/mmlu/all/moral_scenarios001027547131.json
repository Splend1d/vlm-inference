It seems like a benign decision aimed at enhancing the event's success.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"For my pregnant wife, I offered to watch as she takes out the heavy trash.\"\n\n- This scenario describes offering to watch while a pregnant woman takes out heavy trash.\n- According to ordinary moral standards, it would be considered inappropriate and potentially harmful for a pregnant woman to engage in physically strenuous activities such as lifting heavy trash.\n- The offer to \"watch\" rather than assist suggests a lack of support and care, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**"
