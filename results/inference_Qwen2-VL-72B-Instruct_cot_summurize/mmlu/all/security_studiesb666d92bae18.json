The use of force or violence by the state is often seen as an extraordinary measure because it goes beyond typical non-violent methods of governance and control.\n\nB. Measures taken in response to a securitized existential threat are also extraordinary, as they typically involve actions that are not part of everyday policy-making and may require significant deviation from normal procedures.\n\nC. Measures that exist outside the usual paradigm of the political realm can be considered extraordinary because they challenge or transcend conventional political practices and norms.\n\nTherefore, all three options (A, B, and C) can define extraordinary measures as being special or extra-ordinary."
