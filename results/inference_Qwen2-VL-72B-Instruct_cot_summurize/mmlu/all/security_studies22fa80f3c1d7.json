The problematic contention that the liberalist perspective is based on ideas that are Western - such as democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights. This suggests that these values may not be universally applicable or easily transplantable to different cultural contexts.\n\nB. Liberalism did not provide a clear way to deal with the Arab Spring, and its inconsistencies and contradictions were exposed. This indicates that there was no straightforward liberal approach to supporting or responding to the uprisings, revealing potential weaknesses in liberal theory and practice.\n\nC. The liberalist perspective does not explain clearly how and when liberalism is supposed to spread, in this case to the Arab countries in question. This points to a lack of clarity within liberalism regarding the mechanisms and timing of its global dissemination, particularly in regions with different historical and cultural backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, all of these challenges were shown by the Western response to the Arab Spring."
