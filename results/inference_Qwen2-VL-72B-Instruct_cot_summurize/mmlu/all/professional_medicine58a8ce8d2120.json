Cyclin-dependent kinases\n\nThe description provided indicates that the patient has an endometrial biopsy showing regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma. This suggests that the cells are actively dividing, which is characteristic of the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of the cell cycle, including the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase, where DNA replication occurs. They are essential for the progression of cells through the cell cycle, including the proliferation phase observed in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Cyclin-dependent kinases."
