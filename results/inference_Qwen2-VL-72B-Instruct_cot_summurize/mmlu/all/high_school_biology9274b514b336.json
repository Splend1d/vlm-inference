B and C only.\n\nThe dorsal fins and tails of ichthyosaurs and fish are examples of convergent evolution (Option B), which is when unrelated species develop similar traits independently due to having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches. This is also an adaptation to a common environment (Option C), as both ichthyosaurs and fish evolved these features to thrive in aquatic habitats. They are not homologous (Option A), meaning they did not originate from a common ancestor with the same feature, because ichthyosaurs are more closely related to terrestrial reptiles that lack such structures."
