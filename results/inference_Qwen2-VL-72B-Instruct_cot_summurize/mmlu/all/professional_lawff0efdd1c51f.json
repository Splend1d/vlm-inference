                    "text": "To determine the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between the parties, we need to analyze the elements of contract formation and the principles of mutual mistake.\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The buyer made an offer to purchase the land at $2,200 per acre. The owner accepted this offer by replying, \"I accept your offer.\"\n\n2. **Mutual Mistake**: The buyer claims there was a mutual mistake regarding the price term, as they intended to offer $2,000 per acre instead of $2,200.\n\n3. **Materiality of the Mistake**: For a mutual mistake to void or modify a contract, it must be material and affect the essence of the agreement. In this case, the mistake pertains to the price, which is a fundamental term of the contract.\n\n4. **Knowledge of Market Prices**: Both parties were aware that comparable land in the vicinity was selling between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. This suggests that the price range was within reasonable expectations.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests there is no contract because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term. However, the owner clearly understood and accepted the offer at $2,200 per acre, so this option does not hold up.\n\n- **Option B** states there is no enforceable contract because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption. While there was a mistake, it was unilateral (only the buyer made the error) rather than mutual. Mutual mistake typically requires both parties to have the same mistaken belief about a material fact. Therefore, this option is not accurate.\n\n- **Option C** asserts there is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended. However, the buyer's intention is irrelevant once the offer was made and accepted. The terms of the contract are based on what was communicated and agreed upon, not the internal intentions of either party.\n\n- **Option D** indicates there is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention. This aligns with the principle that contracts are based on the objective manifestation of intent, not subjective intentions. Once the offer was made and accepted, a binding contract was formed at the stated price of $2,200 per acre.\n\nTherefore, the most probable legal consequence of the correspondence between the parties is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.**"
