Each party must have something of value to the other party.\n\nExchange is a fundamental concept in economics and refers to the process by which goods or services are traded between parties. For an exchange to occur, each party must have something that the other party values. This can include physical goods, services, information, or even intangible assets like goodwill or reputation. The presence of a complex societal system, organized marketing activities, or a profit-oriented organization may facilitate exchanges, but they are not necessary conditions for an exchange to take place."
