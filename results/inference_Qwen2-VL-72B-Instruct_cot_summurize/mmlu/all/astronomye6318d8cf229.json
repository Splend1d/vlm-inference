As gravity pulled material together, larger bodies began to form, eventually becoming the planets we see today. In some cases, not all of this material coalesced into planets; instead, it remained in orbit around them, forming rings.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while option D is the primary mechanism for the formation of many planetary rings, other processes can also contribute to their creation or maintenance:\n\n- **Option A**: The dismantling of small moons by impacts can indeed contribute to the material in planetary rings. For example, the rings of Uranus may have been formed by the disruption of a moon.\n  \n- **Option B**: Fragments of planets ejected by impacts could theoretically contribute to ring material, but this is less common and not a primary mechanism for ring formation.\n  \n- **Option C**: Dust grains that escape from passing comets can add to the material in existing rings, particularly in the case of Saturn's E ring, which is replenished by icy particles from the moon Enceladus.\n\nSo, while all these mechanisms can play a role, the most fundamental way in which planetary rings are made is through the accretion of material within the solar nebula during the early stages of the solar system's formation."
