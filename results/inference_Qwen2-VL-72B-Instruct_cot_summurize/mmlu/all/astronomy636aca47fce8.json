                    "text": "To determine what can be concluded about the star based on the observed shift in the wavelength of the hydrogen spectral line, we need to consider the Doppler effect.\n\nThe Doppler effect states that when an object emitting light (or any other form of electromagnetic radiation) moves relative to an observer, the observed frequency of the emitted light changes. If the object is moving towards the observer, the observed wavelength decreases (blue shift), and if it is moving away from the observer, the observed wavelength increases (red shift).\n\nIn this case:\n- The laboratory measurement gives a wavelength of 486.1 nm for the hydrogen line.\n- The observed wavelength from the star is 485.9 nm, which is slightly shorter than the laboratory value.\n\nSince the observed wavelength is shorter than the laboratory value, this indicates a blue shift. A blue shift occurs when the source of the light is moving towards the observer.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. The star is moving toward us."
