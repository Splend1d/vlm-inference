                    "text": "To determine why Ptolemy had the planets orbiting Earth on 'circles upon circles' in his model of the universe, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **To explain why more distant planets take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac.**\n   - This is related to the apparent speed of planets as seen from Earth, but it doesn't directly address the need for complex circular orbits.\n\nB. **To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky.**\n   - This is known as retrograde motion, where planets appear to move backward (westward) against the background stars for a period of time. Ptolemy's model needed to account for this observed phenomenon, which was not easily explained by simple circular orbits around Earth.\n\nC. **To explain why the Greeks were unable to detect stellar parallax.**\n   - Stellar parallax refers to the apparent shift in position of stars due to Earth's movement around the Sun. The Greeks did not detect this because the effect is very small and requires precise measurements. However, this does not directly relate to the complexity of planetary orbits.\n\nD. **To properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth.**\n   - While the distances of planets do vary, this alone does not necessitate the complexity of 'circles upon circles'. A simpler model could potentially account for varying distances without such complexity.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling reason for Ptolemy's use of 'circles upon circles' (epicycles) is to explain the retrograde motion of planets. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky.**"
