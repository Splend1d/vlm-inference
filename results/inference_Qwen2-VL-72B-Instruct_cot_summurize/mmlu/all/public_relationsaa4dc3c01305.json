Financial performance\n\nStakeholders typically consider the financial performance of a business as it directly affects their interests, such as returns on investment for shareholders or job security and compensation for employees. However, when assessing the broader impact of a business on the world, stakeholders often focus more on aspects like workforce development, impact on local communities, and environmental impact, which are part of the company's social responsibility and sustainability efforts. Financial performance is usually evaluated separately from these other impacts."
