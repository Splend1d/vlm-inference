It is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariances without knowing the disturbance variance.\n\nIn an MA(1) process, the autocovariance function depends on the variance of the white noise disturbances (\u03c3\u00b2). The formula for the autocovariance at lag 1 in an MA(1) model is given by:\n\n\u03b3(1) = \u03c3\u00b2 * \u03b8\n\nwhere \u03b3(1) is the autocovariance at lag 1, \u03c3\u00b2 is the variance of the disturbances, and \u03b8 is the moving average coefficient.\n\nSince we do not have the value of \u03c3\u00b2, we cannot calculate the exact value of the autocovariance at lag 1. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the value of the autocovariances without knowing the disturbance variance."
