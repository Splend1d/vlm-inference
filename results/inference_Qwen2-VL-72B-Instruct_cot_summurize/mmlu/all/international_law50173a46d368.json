This principle is often used in cases involving economic or financial transactions, where the effects of an act in one country can be felt in another.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects\n\nThis option accurately reflects the core idea of the effects doctrine, which allows a state to assert jurisdiction based on the consequences of actions that occur outside its borders but produce significant effects within its own territory."
