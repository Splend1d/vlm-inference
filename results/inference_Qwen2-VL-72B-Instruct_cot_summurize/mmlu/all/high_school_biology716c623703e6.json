                    "text": "To determine which statement is most likely true about the organism described, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It lives in a newly colonized habitat.**\n   - Organisms living in newly colonized habitats often have traits that allow them to rapidly increase their population size, such as producing many offspring at once or having shorter lifespans. This does not align well with the description of giving birth to only one offspring at a time and having a relatively long lifespan.\n\nB. **It is an aquatic organism.**\n   - Being aquatic is not directly related to the reproductive traits mentioned (giving birth to one offspring at a time and having a long lifespan). Many aquatic organisms do not necessarily fit this description.\n\nC. **It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.**\n   - Species that give birth to only one offspring at a time and have a long lifespan typically invest heavily in the survival and development of each individual offspring. This is because they cannot rely on producing large numbers of offspring to ensure the survival of some. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that these organisms require high parental care.\n\nD. **The age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young.**\n   - If the organism has a long lifespan, it suggests that the offspring might take longer to reach maturity and be able to reproduce. This contradicts the idea that they would give birth at a relatively young age.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most probable statement about the organism is:\n\n**C. It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.**"
