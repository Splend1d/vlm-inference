When the crane was manufactured, some of the welding of its parts was done improperly. No one had ever noticed this manufacturing defect in the crane. The defect caused the crane to break and topple over. Part of the crane fell on the doctor's car. The doctor's car was completely destroyed. The car was valued at $35,000. The doctor had auto insurance, and the insurance company promptly paid the doctor $35,000 under the insurance policy. If the doctor brings suit against the manufacturer of the crane, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. No, because the doctor had auto insurance, so she suffered no loss.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was unaware of the defect in the crane.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\n\nIn this scenario, the doctor can bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the crane based on product liability. Product liability law holds manufacturers responsible for injuries or damages caused by defective products, regardless of whether they were aware of the defect. The fact that the doctor had auto insurance and received compensation does not negate the manufacturer's responsibility for producing a defective product that caused damage. The insurance payment compensates the doctor for her loss but does not absolve the manufacturer of liability for the defective product."
