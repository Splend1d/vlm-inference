At the criminal trial, the prosecutor called a witness who had participated in the scheme with the defendant. The witness testified about the operation of the scheme and was cross-examined by the defendant's attorney. The case resulted in a mistrial. An investor who was allegedly defrauded by the scheme has now brought a civil action against the defendant. She seeks to introduce the witness's testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has moved to a foreign country. Is the witness's testimony in the criminal trial admissible in the civil action?\n\nA. No, because the burden of proof in a criminal action is different from the burden of proof in a civil action.\nB. No, because the parties are not identical in the two actions.\nC. Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\nD. Yes, but only if the investor demonstrates that she was unable to obtain the testimony of the witness by deposition.\n"

Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\n\nIn legal proceedings, prior testimony given by a witness who is now unavailable can be admitted under certain circumstances. If the witness has moved to a foreign country and is genuinely unavailable to testify in person or via deposition, their previous sworn testimony from the criminal trial may be admissible in the subsequent civil action. This is based on the principle that prior testimony of an unavailable declarant can be considered reliable evidence.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they do not address the specific issue of the witness's unavailability and the admissibility of prior testimony. Option D is partially correct but not entirely accurate; while the investor might need to demonstrate efforts to obtain the witness's testimony, the primary reason for admissibility is the witness's unavailability."
