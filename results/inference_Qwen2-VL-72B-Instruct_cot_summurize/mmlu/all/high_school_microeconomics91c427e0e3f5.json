Subsidize the firm or its customers.\n\nWhen there is a positive externality in the production of a private good, it means that the benefits of the good extend beyond the individuals who purchase and consume it. This can lead to underproduction of the good because the market price does not fully reflect the total social benefit. To correct this market failure and achieve an efficient outcome, the government can subsidize the production or consumption of the good. This subsidy helps to align the private incentives with the social benefits, encouraging more production and consumption up to the socially optimal level."
