Roosevelt, who was the only U.S. President to serve more than two terms. He was elected to four terms in total (1933-1945).\n\n2. **Opinion Polls**: During Roosevelt's presidency, public opinion polls were conducted by organizations like Gallup. These polls can provide insights into public approval ratings at different times during his tenure.\n\n3. **Approval Ratings**: In the years leading up to Roosevelt's third term election in 1940, his approval ratings were generally high due to his handling of the Great Depression and early stages of World War II.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to infer that a significant majority of Americans approved of Roosevelt running for a third term. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be:\n\n**C. 60%**\n\nThis aligns with the high approval ratings Roosevelt enjoyed during that period."
