In option A, the person's natural envy and ungenerosity are characteristics they did not choose, yet these traits lead them to behave immorally. The other options do not fit the definition of bad constitutive moral luck as well: B involves situational moral luck, C involves control-related moral luck, and D is incorrect because it includes options that do not exemplify bad constitutive moral luck."
