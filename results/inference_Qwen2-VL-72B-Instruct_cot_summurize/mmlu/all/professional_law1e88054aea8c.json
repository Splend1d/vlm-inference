The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Generally, a landowner owes a lower duty of care to a trespasser compared to an invitee or a licensee.\n\n2. **Abnormally Dangerous Activity**: The use of firearms can be considered an abnormally dangerous activity, which imposes a higher standard of care on the landowner. However, this typically applies when the landowner is directly involved in the activity or has control over it.\n\n3. **Negligence**: The farmer did not provide any instructions about gun safety to his friends, which could be seen as negligence if the farmer had reason to foresee the risk of harm from such activities.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct. This might be true under certain circumstances, but the lack of safety instructions could still make the farmer liable.\n  \n- **Option B** states that the neighbor was trespassing. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean the neighbor cannot recover damages, especially if the farmer's negligence contributed to the injury.\n\n- **Option C** indicates that the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training. This highlights the farmer's potential negligence, which could make him liable.\n\n- **Option D** asserts that the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity. This is generally correct, but it needs to be tied to the farmer's direct involvement or control over the activity to hold him liable.\n\nConsidering all factors, the most compelling argument is that the farmer's failure to provide safety instructions to his friends, who were engaging in an inherently dangerous activity (shooting), could be seen as negligence. Therefore, the neighbor is more likely to prevail based on the farmer's negligence rather than the neighbor's status as a trespasser.\n\nThe final answer is:\n**C. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.**"
