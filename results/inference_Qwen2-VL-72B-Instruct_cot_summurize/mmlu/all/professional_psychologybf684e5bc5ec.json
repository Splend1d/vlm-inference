The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given.\n\nExplanation:\n- The criterion for statistical significance (\u03b1) being set to 0.05 means that the probability of making a type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) is 0.05, not 0.15 as stated in option A.\n- The statistical power being equal to 0.85 means that the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis is 0.85. This implies that the probability of making a type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15, not higher than the probability of making a type I error as stated in option B or equal to 0.85 as stated in option C.\n- Therefore, the correct answer is D because the probabilities of both type I and type II errors can indeed be computed from the given information: the probability of a type I error is 0.05, and the probability of a type II error is 0.15. However, the options provided do not accurately reflect these calculations."
