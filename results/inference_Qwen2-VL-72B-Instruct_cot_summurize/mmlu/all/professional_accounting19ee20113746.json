Negligence.\n\nUnder the law, if a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) recklessly departs from the standards of due care when conducting an audit, they may be held liable for negligence to third parties who were unknown to them at the time of the audit. This is because auditors have a duty to exercise reasonable care in their work, and failing to do so can result in harm to those who rely on the audit report."
