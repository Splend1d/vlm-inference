Development of a two-party system\n\nAn electoral system with single-member districts tends to favor the development of a two-party system due to the \"first-past-the-post\" nature of such systems, where the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. This often discourages smaller parties and encourages voters to support one of the two major parties to avoid \"wasting\" their vote on a candidate who has little chance of winning."
