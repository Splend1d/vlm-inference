This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD.

The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nIn the context of equal protection challenges, courts typically apply different levels of scrutiny depending on the nature of the classification involved. When a law involves economic regulation or does not affect fundamental rights or suspect classifications (such as race, religion, national origin, etc.), courts generally apply rational basis review. Under rational basis review, the burden is on the party challenging the law (in this case, the mining company) to show that the law is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The state does not need to prove anything; it only needs to demonstrate that there is some conceivable legitimate interest that the law could be related to."
