A Mexican entrepreneur founds and locates a software company in St. Louis.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A**: An American entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in London would likely increase aggregate demand in the UK but not in the US, as the economic activity and spending would occur outside the US.\n- **Option B**: Closing a military base in California would reduce government spending in that area, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand.\n- **Option C**: Making it more difficult for American firms to export goods to China would reduce exports, which is a component of aggregate demand (through net exports), thus decreasing aggregate demand.\n- **Option D**: A Mexican entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in St. Louis would increase business investment and employment within the US, thereby increasing aggregate demand through increased production, employment, and spending."
