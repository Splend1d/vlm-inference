What the event will be is also beyond the reach of my foresight. We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of a coercive power. I do not conceive that we can exist long as a nation without having lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the state governments extends over the several states. . . .\n\"What astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing. I am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical form of government without horror. . . . What a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves, and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious. . . .\"\n\u2014George Washington, letter to John Jay, August 1, 1786\nBased on the context of the letter, which of the following most closely describes the meaning of Washington's phrase, \"We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature\"?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context of George Washington's letter and the specific phrase in question: \"We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature.\"\n\n1. **Context of the Letter**: The letter was written by George Washington to John Jay in 1786. It discusses the challenges facing the young United States under the Articles of Confederation and expresses concerns about the need for a stronger central government.\n\n2. **Interpretation of the Phrase**: The phrase \"We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature\" suggests that the framers of the Articles of Confederation believed people would act in their collective best interest without the need for strong governmental oversight. This belief led to a system where individual states had significant autonomy, which Washington now sees as problematic.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Contemporary Deist spiritual beliefs were misguided in that they abandoned the Calvinist notions of \"original sin.\"**\n   - This option focuses on religious beliefs and does not directly relate to the political context or the Articles of Confederation.\n\nB. **The United States had overestimated the good will and honor of Great Britain in terms of following the stipulations of the Treaty of Paris (1783).**\n   - While relations with Great Britain were indeed complex, this option does not address the internal governance issues discussed in the letter.\n\nC. **The U.S. Army misread the willingness of American Indians in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions to live side-by-side with white settlers.**\n   - This option deals with interactions between settlers and Native Americans, which is not the primary focus of the letter.\n\nD. **The framers of the Articles of Confederation made a mistake in allowing for too great a degree of democracy in the new republic.**\n   - This option directly addresses the political structure of the Articles of Confederation and aligns with Washington's concern about the need for a more centralized and coercive power to ensure effective governance.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the option that most closely describes the meaning of Washington's phrase is:\n\n**D. The framers of the Articles of Confederation made a mistake in allowing for too great a degree of democracy in the new republic.**"
