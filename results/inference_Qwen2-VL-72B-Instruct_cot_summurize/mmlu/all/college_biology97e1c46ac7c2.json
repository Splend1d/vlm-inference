The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.\n- This is generally true because yolk-rich eggs tend to have slower or incomplete cleavage due to the physical barrier that yolk provides.\n\nB. Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.\n- This is true. Telolecithal eggs, which have a small amount of yolk concentrated at one end, typically undergo meroblastic cleavage, where only part of the egg divides.\n\nC. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\n- This is not true. In fact, it's often the opposite; the animal pole (which has less yolk and is more cellular) tends to divide more readily than the vegetal pole (which is rich in yolk).\n\nD. The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.\n- This is true. Cleavage results in the formation of blastomeres through rapid cell divisions without significant growth.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nC. The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole."
