Let's denote:\n\n- \\( m_1 \\) as the mass of the first object.\n- \\( m_2 \\) as the mass of the second (unknown) object.\n- \\( v_{1i} \\) as the initial velocity of the first object.\n- \\( v_{1f} \\) as the final velocity of the first object.\n- \\( v_{2f} \\) as the final velocity of the second object.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum:\n\\[ m_1 v_{1i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} \\]\n\nFrom conservation of kinetic energy (since it's an elastic collision):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \\]\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing through by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ m_1 v_{1i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} \\]\n\\[ m_1 v_{1i}^2 = m_1 v_{1f}^2 + m_2 v_{2f}^2 \\]\n\nNow let's solve for \\( m_2 \\). We can rearrange the momentum equation to express \\( v_{2f} \\) in terms of known quantities:\n\n\\[ v_{2f} = \\frac{m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f}}{m_2} \\]\n\nSubstitute this expression into the kinetic energy equation:\n\n\\[ m_1 v_{1i}^2 = m_1 v_{1f}^2 + m_2 \\left( \\frac{m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f}}{m_2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ m_1 v_{1i}^2 = m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \\frac{(m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f})^2}{m_2} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( m_2 \\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[ m_2 m_1 v_{1i}^2 = m_2 m_1 v_{1f}^2 + (m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f})^2 \\]\n\nRearrange to isolate \\( m_2 \\):\n\n\\[ m_2 (m_1 v_{1i}^2 - m_1 v_{1f}^2) = (m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f})^2 \\]\n\n\\[ m_2 = \\frac{(m_1 v_{1i} - m_1 v_{1f})^2}{m_1 (v_{1i}^2 - v_{1f}^2)} \\]\n\nThis shows that to determine \\( m_2 \\), we need both the initial speed \\( v_{1i} \\) and the final speed \\( v_{1f} \\) of the first object.
