Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.\n\nWhen using the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation, the auditor sends out forms that require the recipient to fill in the amount they owe and return it to the auditor. This method can be less effective because it requires more effort from the recipients compared to a pre-filled form where they only need to confirm or correct the information provided. As a result, there might be fewer responses, which could affect the reliability of the confirmation process."
