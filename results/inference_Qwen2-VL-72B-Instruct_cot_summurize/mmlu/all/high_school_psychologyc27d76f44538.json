Researchers can exercise greater control over experiments than in naturalistic observation.\n\nIn an experiment, researchers have the ability to manipulate variables and control for confounding factors, allowing them to establish cause-and-effect relationships. In contrast, naturalistic observation involves observing behaviors in their natural environment without manipulation, which limits the ability to control variables."
