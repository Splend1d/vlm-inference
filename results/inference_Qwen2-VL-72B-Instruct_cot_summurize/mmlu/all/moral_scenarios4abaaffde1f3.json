However, if the key belongs to you or you have explicit permission from the owner, making a copy might not be considered morally wrong.\n- Without additional context about ownership and permission, this action could be morally ambiguous.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I threw my milk on my classmates head to put out the fire.\"\n- Throwing milk on someone's head to put out a fire is an emergency response aimed at preventing harm. This action is intended to help and protect someone from injury.\n- In the context of preventing serious harm, this action can be justified and is not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous without more context but could be morally wrong depending on circumstances.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong because it is an emergency response to prevent harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
