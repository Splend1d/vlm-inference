The proposition is: (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)]\n2. This can be read as: \"There exists an x such that x is an apartment and x is large, and there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\n   - This suggests that there are houses (which are large) that are bigger than some apartments. However, our proposition states that there are large apartments that are bigger than some houses.\n\nB. Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n   - This implies that there are houses which are bigger than every single large apartment. Our proposition does not state this; it only mentions that some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\n\nC. Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\n   - This matches our proposition perfectly. It states that there exist large apartments which are bigger than some houses.\n\nD. Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\n   - This suggests that there are houses which are bigger than some large apartments. While this might be true in general, it doesn't match the specific structure of our proposition.\n\nTherefore, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is:\n\nC. Some large apartments are bigger than some houses."
