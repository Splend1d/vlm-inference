Proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\n\nGolgi tendon organs are proprioceptive sensory receptors located in series with skeletal muscle fibers, specifically at the junction between the muscle and its tendon. They play a crucial role in monitoring muscle tension and preventing overstretching or damage to the muscle-tendon unit."
