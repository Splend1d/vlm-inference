Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\nThe construction of a new highway extending from a major city through an area used for farmland typically reduces travel time between the city and the rural areas. This makes it more convenient for people who work in the city to live further out, leading to suburbanization. As a result, residential developments may spring up along the highway, attracting people who want to enjoy a quieter, more spacious lifestyle while still having easy access to urban job opportunities and amenities."
