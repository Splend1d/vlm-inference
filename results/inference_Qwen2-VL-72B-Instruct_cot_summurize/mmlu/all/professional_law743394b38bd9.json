The collector sent a letter to the friend that said, \"I am willing to sell you my oldest motorcycle for $4,000.\" The friend sent the collector an email saying, \"I accept your offer.\" The collector owned three motorcycles: a 1985 model, a 1987 model, and a 1992 model. The friend did not know about the 1985 model, which was the one the collector intended to sell. The collector was unaware that the friend intended to buy the 1987 model. When the collector tendered the 1985 model, the friend refused to accept it. Is the friend likely to prevail in a breach of contract suit against the collector?\n\nA. No, because by not inquiring further about the meaning of the phrase \"oldest motorcycle,\" the friend assumed the risk of being mistaken.\nB. No, because neither the friend nor the collector had reason to know of the other's interpretation of the words \"oldest motorcycle.\"\nC. Yes, so long as a reasonable person in the friend's position would have considered the letter as referring to the 1987 model.\nD. Yes, because the friend had no reason to know of the collector's meaning and the collector could have avoided the confusion by more careful drafting.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the friend is likely to prevail in a breach of contract suit against the collector, we need to analyze the situation based on principles of contract law, particularly focusing on mutual understanding and clarity of terms.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Mutual Understanding**: For a contract to be valid, both parties must have a mutual understanding of the terms. In this case, the collector intended to sell the 1985 model, while the friend intended to buy the 1987 model.\n\n2. **Clarity of Terms**: The term \"oldest motorcycle\" can be ambiguous if there is more than one motorcycle that could fit the description. Here, the collector has three motorcycles with different years, making the term potentially unclear.\n\n3. **Reasonable Expectations**: A reasonable person in the friend's position might interpret \"oldest motorcycle\" differently based on their knowledge or assumptions. However, the friend did not inquire further about the specific model, assuming the risk of misunderstanding.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **No, because by not inquiring further about the meaning of the phrase \"oldest motorcycle,\" the friend assumed the risk of being mistaken.**\n   - This option suggests that the friend bears the responsibility for not clarifying the term. While this is partially true, it does not fully address the collector's role in providing clear terms.\n\nB. **No, because neither the friend nor the collector had reason to know of the other's interpretation of the words \"oldest motorcycle.\"**\n   - This option implies that both parties were equally unaware of the other's interpretation, suggesting a mutual mistake. However, it does not resolve the issue of who should bear the responsibility for the ambiguity.\n\nC. **Yes, so long as a reasonable person in the friend's position would have considered the letter as referring to the 1987 model.**\n   - This option focuses on the perspective of a reasonable person. If a reasonable person would have understood the term to refer to the 1987 model (the second-oldest), then the friend might have grounds to prevail. However, this depends on the specific context and evidence presented.\n\nD. **Yes, because the friend had no reason to know of the collector's meaning and the collector could have avoided the confusion by more careful drafting.**\n   - This option places the burden on the collector for not providing clearer terms. It argues that the collector should have been more precise to avoid any confusion, which aligns with principles of contract clarity.\n\nConsidering all factors, the most compelling argument is that the collector should have provided clearer terms to avoid ambiguity. Therefore, the friend is more likely to prevail if they can demonstrate that the collector could have avoided the confusion through more careful drafting.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the friend had no reason to know of the collector's meaning and the collector could have avoided the confusion by more careful drafting.**"
