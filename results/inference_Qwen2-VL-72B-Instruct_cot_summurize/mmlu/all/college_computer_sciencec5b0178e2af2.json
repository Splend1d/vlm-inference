This is a straightforward way to improve performance.\n\nII. **Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline**: Forwarding is used to resolve hazards in the pipeline by allowing data to be passed directly from one stage to another without waiting for it to go through the entire pipeline. Disallowing forwarding would increase the number of stalls in the pipeline, leading to longer execution times. Therefore, this action would not improve the execution time.\n\nIII. **Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time**: Larger caches reduce the frequency of cache misses, which can significantly decrease the number of memory accesses needed and thus reduce the overall execution time. This improvement in cache performance can lead to faster program execution.\n\nGiven these analyses, the actions that would improve the execution time are:\n\n- Increasing the clock cycle rate (Option I)\n- Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache (Option III)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and III**"
