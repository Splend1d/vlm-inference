                    "text": "The correct interpretation of the similarities in bone structures among human arms, bat wings, and dolphin flippers involves understanding both evolutionary biology concepts.\n\n1. **Homologous Structures**: These are structures in different species that have the same or similar form and function because they are derived from a common ancestral structure. The fact that human arms, bat wings, and dolphin flippers contain many of the same bones suggests that these structures are homologous.\n\n2. **Common Ancestor**: The presence of homologous structures strongly indicates that these species share a common ancestor. This is because the similarities in their bone structures can be traced back to a shared evolutionary history where these structures evolved from a common ancestral form.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Option A: Identifying the bones as being homologous is correct.\n- Option B: Convergent evolution refers to the independent development of similar features in species of different lineages. This does not apply here since the structures are homologous rather than analogous (convergently evolved).\n- Option C: Proposing that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor is also correct, as it explains why they have homologous structures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. A and C only**"
