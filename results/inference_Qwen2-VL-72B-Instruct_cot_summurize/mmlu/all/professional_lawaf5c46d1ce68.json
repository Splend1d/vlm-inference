When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\nB. The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n"

Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n\nExplanation:\nThe federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability. While the woman's intention may have been to create a diverse tenant mix, stating a preference for a \"White male\" in the advertisement violates this law. The act does not allow landlords to express preferences for tenants based on race or gender in advertising or in the rental process. Therefore, option D accurately reflects the legal implications of the woman's actions under the federal Fair Housing Act."
