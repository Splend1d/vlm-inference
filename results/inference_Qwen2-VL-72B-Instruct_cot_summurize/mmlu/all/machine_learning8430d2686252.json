This is done to ensure that subsequent weak classifiers focus more on these misclassified instances. The weight update rule in AdaBoost involves multiplying the weights of misclassified examples by a factor greater than 1. However, this factor is not necessarily the same for all iterations; it depends on the performance of the current weak classifier. Therefore, while the weights do increase multiplicatively, they do not necessarily increase by the same factor at every step.\n\n### Statement 2: In AdaBoost, weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights \\( D_t \\) tends to increase as a function of \\( t \\).\n- **Analysis**: In AdaBoost, the goal is to iteratively improve the overall model by focusing on previously misclassified examples. As the algorithm progresses through iterations, the weighted training error \\( e_t \\) of the tth weak classifier should ideally decrease because the algorithm is designed to reduce the error rate by giving more weight to misclassified examples. Thus, the weighted training error does not tend to increase but rather decreases over time.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Statement 1 is **False** because the multiplicative factor is not necessarily the same across iterations.\n- Statement 2 is **False** because the weighted training error tends to decrease, not increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
