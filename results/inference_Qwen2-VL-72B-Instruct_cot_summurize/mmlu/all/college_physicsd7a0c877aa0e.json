This means that the speed of light in water (\\( v_{\\text{water}} \\)) is slower than the speed of light in vacuum (\\( c \\)) by this factor:\n\\[ v_{\\text{water}} = \\frac{c}{n} = \\frac{c}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{3}{4} c \\]\n\n2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: Since the tube of water is moving at \\( \\frac{1}{2} c \\) relative to the lab frame, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame. Let's denote:\n- \\( u \\): the speed of the tube of water relative to the lab frame (\\( \\frac{1}{2} c \\))\n- \\( v \\): the speed of light in the water relative to the tube of water (\\( \\frac{3}{4} c \\))\n- \\( v' \\): the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n\\[ v' = \\frac{u + v}{1 + \\frac{uv}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ v' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} c + \\frac{3}{4} c}{1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4} c\\right)}{c^2}} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} c + \\frac{3}{4} c}{1 + \\frac{3}{8}} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{\\frac{2}{4} c + \\frac{3}{4} c}{1 + \\frac{3}{8}} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4} c}{\\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{3}{8}} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4} c}{\\frac{11}{8}} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{5}{4} c \\times \\frac{8}{11} \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{5 \\times 8}{4 \\times 11} c \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{40}{44} c \\]\n\\[ v' = \\frac{10}{11} c \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is \\( \\frac{10}{11} c \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. \\( \\frac{10}{11} c \\)"
