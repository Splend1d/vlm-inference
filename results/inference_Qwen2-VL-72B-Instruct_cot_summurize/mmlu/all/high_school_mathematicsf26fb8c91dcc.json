Therefore, the speed-to-price ratio for the current computer is \\(\\frac{S}{P}\\).\n\nAccording to the information given, five years ago, a computer worked half as fast as the current one, so its speed was \\(\\frac{1}{2}S\\), and it cost twice as much, which means its price was \\(2P\\). Thus, the speed-to-price ratio for the older computer was \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}S}{2P} = \\frac{S}{4P}\\).\n\nWe want to find out what percent the current computer's speed-to-price ratio (\\(\\frac{S}{P}\\)) is of the older computer's speed-to-price ratio (\\(\\frac{S}{4P}\\)). To do this, we set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{S}{P}}{\\frac{S}{4P}} = \\frac{S}{P} \\times \\frac{4P}{S} = 4\n\\]\n\nThis means the current computer's speed-to-price ratio is 4 times that of the older computer's. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 100 = 400\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 400."
