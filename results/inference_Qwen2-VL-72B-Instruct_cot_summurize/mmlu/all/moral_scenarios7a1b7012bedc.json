Therefore, the main character did not commit a moral wrongdoing. However, Joe's action of stealing the painting back would be considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve a moral wrongdoing by the main character, but rather by Joe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
