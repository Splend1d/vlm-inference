Exploring what it means to be White and confronting own biases\n\nIn the pseudoindependent stage of White racial identity development, individuals begin to explore their own racial identity and confront their biases and prejudices. They may recognize the existence of racism but still struggle with acknowledging their own complicity or the systemic nature of racism. This stage involves a deeper self-examination and a growing awareness of the impact of one's racial identity on perceptions and actions."
