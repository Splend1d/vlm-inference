When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States\n\nThis option correctly reflects the provisions under international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). According to UNCLOS, if a coastal state does not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), it should provide access to other states, giving preference to developing and land-locked states. This approach aims to ensure sustainable use of marine resources and promote cooperation among states."
