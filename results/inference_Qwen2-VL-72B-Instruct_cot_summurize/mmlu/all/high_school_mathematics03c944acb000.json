So, the cost of three pens is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of three pens} = 3 \\times \\$1.32 = \\$3.96 \\]\n\nSince eleven pencils cost the same as three pens, which is $3.96, we can find the cost of one pencil by dividing $3.96 by 11:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of one pencil} = \\frac{\\$3.96}{11} = \\$0.36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is $0.36 or 36 cents.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 36."
