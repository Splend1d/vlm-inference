However, it doesn't address why current designs aren't optimal despite millions of years of evolution.\n\nB. **Natural selection operates in ways that are beyond the capability of the human mind to comprehend.**\n   - This implies that the complexity of natural selection makes it incomprehensible to humans. While true to some extent, it doesn't directly explain why the current designs aren't optimal.\n\nC. **In many cases, phenotype is not merely determined by genotype, but by the environment as well.**\n   - This statement is accurate regarding how environmental factors influence phenotype, but it doesn't directly address the issue of suboptimal skeletal structure design.\n\nD. **Natural selection is generally limited to modifying structures that were present in previous generations and in previous species.**\n   - This option explains that natural selection works within the constraints of existing structures, meaning it modifies what already exists rather than starting from scratch. This limitation could lead to suboptimal designs due to historical constraints.\n\nGiven the context and analysis, the most plausible explanation for why the forelimbs of diverse mammals might not appear optimally designed is:\n\n**Final answer: D. Natural selection is generally limited to modifying structures that were present in previous generations and in previous species.**"
