Individuals adapt to their environments and, thereby, evolve.\n\nNatural selection is a process where certain traits become more or less common in a population over time due to differential survival and reproduction of individuals with those traits. The key points of natural selection are:\n\nA. Genetic variation exists within populations: This is essential because it provides the raw material for evolution.\n\nB. The best-adapted individuals tend to leave the most offspring: This means that individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nC. Individuals who survive longer tend to leave more offspring than those who die young: This is related to B, as surviving longer increases the chances of reproducing.\n\nD. Individuals adapt to their environments and, thereby, evolve: This statement is incorrect because adaptation and evolution are not synonymous. Adaptation refers to the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment through natural selection. Evolution is the change in the genetic composition of a population over time. It is the result of natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and other processes, but individuals do not \"adapt\" themselves; rather, they possess traits that may be selected for or against by the environment."
