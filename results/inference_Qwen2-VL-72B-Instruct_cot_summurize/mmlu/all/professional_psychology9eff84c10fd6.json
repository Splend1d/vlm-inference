These disorders cause a loss of recall of learned information = anterograde amnesia.\n\nAnterograde amnesia refers to the inability to form new memories after the onset of the disorder, whereas retrograde amnesia involves the loss of memories formed before the onset of the disorder. Therefore, the correct description for anterograde amnesia would be the inability to form new memories, not the loss of recall of learned information."
