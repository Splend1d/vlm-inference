Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Mesothelioma\nB. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast\nC. Multiple endocrine neoplasia\nD. Non-small cell lung carcinoma\n"

                    "text": "The clinical presentation and imaging findings described suggest that the patient may have a primary lung malignancy. The presence of a large right lower lobe mass on CT scan, along with enlarged lymph nodes and a mass in the right adrenal gland, are concerning for metastatic disease. The patient's history of smoking and weight loss also increase the likelihood of a malignancy.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer and can present with symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and weight loss. The presence of calcifications within the lung mass is also more consistent with NSCLC than mesothelioma or multiple endocrine neoplasia. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast is less likely given the absence of a known primary breast cancer and the presence of calcifications within the lung mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Non-small cell lung carcinoma"
