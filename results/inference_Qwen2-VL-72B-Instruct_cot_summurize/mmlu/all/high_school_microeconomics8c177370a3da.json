Price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, individual firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the market price. The price is determined by the intersection of the market supply and demand curves. Each firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price, which means that the demand curve is not downward-sloping for an individual firm. Additionally, in perfect competition, the marginal revenue (MR) curve coincides with the demand curve, and average revenue (AR) equals price (P). Therefore, options A, B, and D are not accurate for a perfectly competitive firm."
