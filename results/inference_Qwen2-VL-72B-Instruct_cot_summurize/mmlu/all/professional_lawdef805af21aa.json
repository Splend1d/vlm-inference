In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a contract for the sale of property where the intended use of the property has been rendered impossible due to a change in zoning regulations after the contract was signed but before the closing date. This situation raises issues related to the doctrine of equitable conversion and the principles of fairness and justice in contract law.\n\nTo determine why judgment might be for Beeson, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. **Sloan assumed the risk**: This suggests that Sloan should bear the consequences of the zoning change because he was aware of the risks associated with the property's future use when entering into the contract. However, this does not directly address the issue of whether Beeson should be relieved of his contractual obligations.\n\nB. **Sloan would be unjustly enriched**: This implies that enforcing the contract would result in an unfair benefit to Sloan, as he would receive payment for a property that can no longer be used for its intended commercial purpose. This argument aligns with the principle of preventing unjust enrichment, which is a key consideration in equitable relief.\n\nC. **Legal title remained in Sloan**: While true, this fact alone does not necessarily justify relieving Beeson of his contractual obligations. Legal title remaining with Sloan does not directly address the fairness or harshness of enforcing the contract under the changed circumstances.\n\nD. **Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain**: This option suggests that the court may apply equitable principles to relieve Beeson of his obligation because enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. This aligns closely with Beeson's argument that enforcing the contract would be unfair given the significant change in the property's permissible use.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling reason for a judgment in favor of Beeson is that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him, and thus equity would relieve him of what has become a bad bargain due to the unforeseen change in zoning regulations.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**D. Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.**"
