A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that the government should not interfere with an individual's right to practice their religion freely. In this scenario, the father believes that his religious faith will heal his daughter, and he is arguing that the court order compelling medical treatment infringes upon his religious beliefs."
