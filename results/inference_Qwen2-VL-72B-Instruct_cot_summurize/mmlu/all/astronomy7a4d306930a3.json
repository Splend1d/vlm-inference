Much of the water that was originally present on Mars is believed to have been lost over time. One of the primary mechanisms for this loss involves the interaction of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun with the Martian atmosphere. This UV radiation can break down water molecules (H\u2082O) into hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). The hydrogen atoms, being lighter, can then escape the planet's gravity and be lost to space through a process known as thermal escape. This process has contributed significantly to the depletion of Mars' original water content."
