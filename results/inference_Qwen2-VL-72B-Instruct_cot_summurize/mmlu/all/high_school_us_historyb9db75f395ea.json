After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\n\nA. The Social Gospel\nB. Social Darwinism\nC. Communism\nD. The support of an urban political machine\n"

The Social Gospel\n\nThe passage describes the establishment of a boarding club for working girls during a strike, with the goal of supporting each other during difficult times. This action aligns with the principles of the Social Gospel, a movement that emerged in the late 19th century and emphasized the application of Christian ethics to social problems, particularly poverty and inequality. Settlement house workers, such as Jane Addams, were often motivated by the Social Gospel to improve the lives of the urban poor through direct action and community organizing."
