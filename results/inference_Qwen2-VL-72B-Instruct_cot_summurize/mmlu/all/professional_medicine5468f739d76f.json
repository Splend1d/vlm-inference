He says he has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue but has not had any other noticeable bleeding. He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever, chills, or rectal drainage. He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350/mm3 ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?\n\nA. Acyclovir\nB. Imiquimod\nC. Levofloxacin\nD. Metronidazole\n"

The patient's symptoms of anal pain, particularly on defecation, and the presence of tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area suggest an infection with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human papillomavirus (HPV). Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, including those caused by anaerobic bacteria, which can cause anal abscesses or fistulas. It is also effective against protozoan parasites such as Trichomonas vaginalis, which can cause vaginitis and urethritis. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat HSV infections, but it is not effective against bacterial or protozoan infections. Imiquimod is a topical medication used to treat HPV infections, but it is not effective against bacterial or protozoan infections. Levofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not effective against protozoan parasites."
