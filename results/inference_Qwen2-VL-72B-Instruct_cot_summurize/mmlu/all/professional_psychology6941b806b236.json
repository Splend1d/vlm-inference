This psychological phenomenon occurs when individuals attribute their own actions to external causes (e.g., being pushed) while attributing others' actions to internal causes (e.g., tripping due to clumsiness or carelessness). In this case, the speaker is more likely to blame an external factor for their own stumble (\"I was pushed\") and an internal factor for someone else's stumble (\"You tripped\")."
