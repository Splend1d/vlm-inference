Under common law, this is generally true because the landowner has no reason to expect an undiscovered trespasser.\n\nB. **A duty for natural conditions**:\n   - This statement implies that the possessor of land owes a duty to protect an undiscovered trespasser from natural conditions (e.g., a cliff or a deep hole). However, under common law, there is typically no such duty because the landowner cannot reasonably foresee an undiscovered trespasser encountering these natural hazards.\n\nC. **No duty for natural conditions**:\n   - This statement aligns with common law principles, as it correctly states that the possessor of land does not owe a duty to protect an undiscovered trespasser from natural conditions.\n\nD. **No duty for active operations**:\n   - This statement suggests that the possessor of land does not owe any duty to protect an undiscovered trespasser from active operations (e.g., construction work or machinery in use). Under common law, this is also generally true because the landowner has no reason to expect an undiscovered trespasser and thus no duty to warn them about ongoing activities.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that is not correct is:\n\n**B. A duty for natural conditions.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly asserts that there is a duty owed by the possessor of land towards an undiscovered trespasser for natural conditions, which contradicts common law principles."
