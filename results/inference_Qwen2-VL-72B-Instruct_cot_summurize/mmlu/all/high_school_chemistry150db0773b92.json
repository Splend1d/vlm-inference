This is because a more electronegative atom can better stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base, making the acid more likely to donate its proton.\n\n- Oxygen (O) is the most electronegative among S, Se, and O.\n- Sulfur (S) is less electronegative than oxygen but more electronegative than selenium (Se).\n- Selenium (Se) is the least electronegative among these three elements.\n\n2. **Bond Strength**: The strength of the O-H, S-H, and Se-H bonds also plays a role. A weaker bond means that the hydrogen atom is more easily donated, making the acid stronger.\n\n- The O-H bond is the strongest due to the high electronegativity of oxygen.\n- The S-H bond is weaker than the O-H bond.\n- The Se-H bond is the weakest among the three due to the lower electronegativity of selenium.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The strongest acid will have the weakest bond and the least electronegative central atom, which is H2Se.\n- The next strongest acid will be H2S, with a moderately weak bond and moderate electronegativity.\n- The weakest acid will be H2O, with the strongest bond and highest electronegativity.\n\nTherefore, the correct order from strongest to weakest acid is:\n\n**D. H2Se > H2S > H2O**"
