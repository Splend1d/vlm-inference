An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the observation that during early stages of development, many vertebrates exhibit similar structures and developmental patterns, reflecting their shared evolutionary history. This phenomenon is often cited as evidence for the concept of \"ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny,\" but it's important to note that this concept has been largely discredited in modern biology. The key point here is that early embryos of different vertebrates share certain features due to their common ancestry."
