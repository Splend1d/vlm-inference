After missing two practices, the football player was dropped from the team by the head football coach. Following his dismissal, the football player met with the coach and asked if he could rejoin the team. The coach said that the football player was despised by the other players and under no circumstances could he return to the team. As the football player was leaving the coach's office, feeling very dejected, the coach then said to him, \"Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here. \"Later that same evening, the football player wrote a suicide note in which he stated, \"The coach is responsible for my despondency. If I can't play football, I don't want to live. \" After swallowing a bottle of Quaalude barbiturates, the football player fell unconscious in his dormitory room. Moments later, the football player's roommate entered the room and saw his limp body on the floor. The roommate read the suicide note and then attempted to administer aid. Failing to revive him, the roommate picked up the football player and carried him to the college's first aid center. The football player received prompt medical attention and soon recovered from his drug overdose. If the football player asserts a claim against the coach based on intentional infliction of emotional distress, the football player will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\nB. prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.\nC. not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.\nD. not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the football player will most likely prevail in a claim against the coach based on intentional infliction of emotional distress, we need to consider the elements required for such a claim. Generally, to succeed in an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must demonstrate:\n\n1. The defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n2. The defendant intended to cause severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or substantially certain to result from their conduct.\n3. The plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress.\n4. The defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's emotional distress.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.**\n   - This option suggests that the coach had the specific intent to cause emotional distress. However, the scenario does not provide clear evidence that the coach intended to cause the football player to suffer emotional distress; rather, it seems more like a reaction to the player's behavior and team dynamics.\n\nB. **Prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.**\n   - While the coach's remarks did cause the football player emotional distress, this alone is not sufficient to establish liability. The conduct must also be extreme and outrageous.\n\nC. **Not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.**\n   - This option points out that the football player voluntarily ingested the drugs, which could mitigate the coach's responsibility. However, the focus should be on whether the coach's actions were extreme and outrageous enough to cause severe emotional distress.\n\nD. **Not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.**\n   - This option suggests that the coach's actions were reasonable given the team's feelings towards the player. However, reasonableness is not the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress; the standard is whether the conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**C. Not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that the football player's decision to ingest the drugs was a voluntary act, which may mitigate the coach's liability even if the coach's words contributed to the emotional distress."
