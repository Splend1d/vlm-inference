We want to find the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not also request tire replacements.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(O) \\) as the probability of requesting an oil change.\n- \\( P(T) \\) as the probability of requesting tire replacements.\n- \\( P(OT) \\) as the probability of requesting both an oil change and tire replacements.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- \\( P(O) = 0.60 \\)\n- \\( P(T) = 0.30 \\)\n- \\( P(OT) = 0.10 \\)\n\nWe need to find the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements. This can be expressed as:\n\\[ P(\\text{not T} | O) \\]\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n\\[ P(\\text{not T} | O) = \\frac{P(\\text{not T and O})}{P(O)} \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( P(\\text{not T and O}) \\), which is the probability of requesting an oil change but not requesting tire replacements. Since \\( P(OT) \\) represents the probability of requesting both, the probability of requesting only an oil change (and not tire replacements) is:\n\\[ P(\\text{not T and O}) = P(O) - P(OT) \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{not T and O}) = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50 \\]\n\nNow, we can compute the conditional probability:\n\\[ P(\\text{not T} | O) = \\frac{P(\\text{not T and O})}{P(O)} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{not T} | O) = \\frac{0.50}{0.60} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{not T} | O) = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not request tire replacements is approximately 0.833.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 0.833"
