This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of the individual's well-being are addressed. Regular reassessment is also crucial to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment plan and make adjustments as necessary. Limiting drug side effects is an important consideration, but it should not be the sole focus at the expense of addressing the person's overall pain management needs."
