This also implies that if you input 4 into the original function $f$, you should get 2 as the output because the inverse function reverses the operation of the original function.\n\nNow, to find $f(f(2))$, we first evaluate $f(2)$, which we know is 4. Then, we need to find $f(4)$.\n\nFrom our previous deductions, since $f(2) = 4$, then $f^{-1}(4) = 2$. But we want $f(4)$, not $f^{-1}(4)$. Since $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverses of each other, $f(4)$ must be the input that gives us 4 when we apply $f^{-1}$ to it. We already know that $f^{-1}(2) = 4$, so $f(4)$ must be 2.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2$.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 2."
