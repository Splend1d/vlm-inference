The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon. The shopper's brother-in- law, who was an eyewitness to the accident, was not called to testify at trial. Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident. With respect to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony at trial, on request by the supermarket's attorney, the court should\n\nA. instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nB. instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nC. permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nD. neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n"

Permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\n\nIn legal proceedings, if a party fails to call a witness who could provide relevant evidence, the opposing party may argue that the reason for not calling the witness is because their testimony would likely be unfavorable to the party who did not call them. This is known as the adverse inference rule or the \"missing witness\" doctrine. However, it is important to note that the court does not instruct the jury to presume anything; rather, it allows the opposing party to make this argument during closing arguments. The jury then decides whether to give weight to this argument in their deliberations."
