                    "text": "To determine the correct inference about religion in the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. based on Source 2, let's analyze the content of the source:\n\n- **Article 5** states: \"The Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire. Followers of all other religions are allowed to worship within their households, or particular houses for that intent, so long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple.\"\n\nFrom this article, we can infer that while the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion is the official religion of the Empire of Brazil, there is some level of religious tolerance as followers of other religions are allowed to worship privately.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period.**\n   - This option suggests that all citizens were expected to follow the same religion. However, Source 2 indicates that while Catholicism is the official religion, other religions are tolerated if practiced privately. Therefore, this option is not fully supported by the source.\n\nB. **Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.**\n   - This option aligns well with the information provided in Source 2. The source explicitly mentions that followers of other religions are allowed to worship privately, indicating a level of religious toleration.\n\nC. **Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period.**\n   - While religious authority might have been important during this period, Source 2 does not provide specific information about the divine right of monarchs. It focuses more on the official religion and the toleration of other religions.\n\nD. **Religious influence on the populations of states declined due to scientific advancements.**\n   - There is no mention of scientific advancements or their impact on religious influence in Source 2. Therefore, this option cannot be inferred from the given source.\n\nBased on the analysis, the inference that is supported by Source 2 is:\n\n**B. Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.**\n\nFinal answer: B."
