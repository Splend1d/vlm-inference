The speed with which mRNA is degraded will determine how much protein is synthesized.\n\nExplanation:\nThe amount of protein synthesized from a given mRNA molecule is influenced by several factors, including the stability and degradation rate of the mRNA. mRNA molecules that are rapidly degraded will result in less protein synthesis compared to those that are more stable and persist longer in the cell. While other factors such as DNA methylation (A), transcription factors (B), and the number and location of ribosomes (D) also play roles in gene expression and protein synthesis, the stability and degradation rate of mRNA directly impact the amount of protein produced from that mRNA."
