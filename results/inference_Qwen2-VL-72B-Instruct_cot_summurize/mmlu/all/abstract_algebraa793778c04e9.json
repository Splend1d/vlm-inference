This is because the unity element in any ring is unique and plays a crucial role in the structure of the ring. Therefore, if \\( S \\) is a subring of \\( R \\), then the unity of \\( S \\) must indeed be the same as the unity of \\( R \\).\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain.\nAn **integral domain** is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero (i.e., it has no zero divisors). A **field** is a special type of integral domain where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nSince fields satisfy all the properties of integral domains (they are commutative rings with unity and have no zero divisors), they are indeed integral domains. However, fields go beyond being just integral domains by requiring that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
