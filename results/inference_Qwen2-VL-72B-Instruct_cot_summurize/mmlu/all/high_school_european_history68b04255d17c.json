A copy is now being forwarded to Your Excellency. \u2026\nHis Majesty desires to say that he is not blind to the danger which threatens Austria-Hungary and thus the Triple Alliance as a result of the Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation. \u2026 His Majesty will, furthermore, make an effort at Bucharest, according to the wishes of the Emperor Franz Joseph, to influence King Carol to the fulfilment of the duties of his alliance, to the renunciation of Serbia, and to the suppression of the Rumanian agitations directed against Austria-Hungary.\nFinally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Franz Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship.\nTheobald von Bethmann-Hollweg (chancellor of Germany), telegram to the German ambassador at Vienna, July 6, 1914\nThe best description of the context of Bethmann-Hollweg's telegram is\n\nA. Germany's collaboration with Austria-Hungary during Germany's unification process\nB. the Balkan Question and the Triple Alliance\nC. Germany's rearmament in violation of the Treaty of Paris\nD.

The mention of Serbia, Russia, and the Pan-Slavic agitation indicates the specific regional conflicts and the broader alliance dynamics at play."
