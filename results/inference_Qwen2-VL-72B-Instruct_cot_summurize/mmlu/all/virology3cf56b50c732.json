The virus is so antigenically variable\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is particularly challenging to create a vaccine for due to its high degree of genetic variability. The virus mutates rapidly, leading to a vast array of different strains. This antigenic variability makes it difficult to develop a vaccine that can provide broad and long-lasting protection against all forms of the virus."
