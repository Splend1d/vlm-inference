However, Singer's work often emphasizes global responsibilities and the need to help those in need regardless of geographical location.\n\nB. **Inappropriately makes proximity morally important.**\n   - This statement implies that Singer's theory might be criticized for considering physical or emotional closeness as a significant factor in moral decision-making. However, Singer's utilitarian approach generally argues against such biases, advocating for impartiality in moral considerations.\n\nC. **Does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.**\n   - This statement reflects a common criticism of utilitarianism, including Singer's version, which often struggles with the idea that we should treat all individuals equally, regardless of personal relationships. Singer acknowledges this challenge but argues that our obligations to loved ones can be balanced with broader moral duties.\n\nD. **Requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.**\n   - This statement suggests that Singer's theory might be criticized for demanding significant changes to how people traditionally think about morality. Singer indeed challenges conventional views by arguing for a more expansive view of moral obligations, particularly regarding animal rights and global poverty.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting objection to Singer's theory, considering his acknowledgment and response to criticisms, is:\n\n**D. Requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.**\n\nThis option captures the essence of a common critique that Singer's ideas demand substantial changes to established moral frameworks."
