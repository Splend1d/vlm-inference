The chief purpose of the code is to limit traffic congestion and noise in the neighborhood. One provision in the code provides that a \"family\" means a number of individuals related to the nominal head of the household or to the latter's spouse living as a single housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit, but is limited to the following:(a) husband or wife of the nominal head of the household;(b) married or unmarried children of the nominal head of the household or the latter's spouse, provided, however, that such married or unmarried children have no children of their own residing with them;(c) father or mother of the nominal head of the household or of the latter's spouse. A resident of the city lives in her home together with her son and his two children. She received a notice of violation from the city which stated that both grandchildren were illegal occupants of her home and that she must comply with the code. After she fails to remove her two grandchildren, the city brings criminal charges against the resident. In an action by the resident challenging the constitutionality of the code provision, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.\nB. constitutional, under the state police power.\nC. unconstitutional, as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome of the court's decision regarding the constitutionality of the housing code provision, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Rational Basis Review**: Generally, courts apply a rational basis review to economic regulations and zoning laws. This standard requires that the regulation be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Here, the city's housing code aims to limit traffic congestion and noise, which are legitimate interests.\n\n2. **Family Definition**: The code defines \"family\" narrowly, excluding certain relatives (like grandchildren) unless they meet specific criteria. This narrow definition could potentially exclude some residents who might otherwise be considered part of a family unit.\n\n3. **Due Process Clause**: The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals against arbitrary and irrational government actions. However, if the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, it typically passes muster under due process scrutiny.\n\n4. **State Police Power**: States have broad police powers to regulate for the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their citizens. Limiting occupancy to reduce traffic congestion and noise falls within this scope.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A**: The provision is constitutional because it bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives (limiting traffic congestion and noise).\n- **Option B**: The provision is constitutional under the state police power, which allows for regulations aimed at public welfare.\n- **Option C**: The provision is unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This would imply that the regulation is arbitrary or irrational, which seems unlikely given the rational basis for the regulation.\n- **Option D**: The provision is unconstitutional as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state. This contradicts the clear objective of reducing traffic congestion and noise.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that the court will find the provision constitutional because it is rationally related to legitimate government interests and falls within the state's police power.\n\n**Final Answer: A. constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.**"
