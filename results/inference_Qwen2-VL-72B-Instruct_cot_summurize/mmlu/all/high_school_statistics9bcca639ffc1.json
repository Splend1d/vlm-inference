The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\nExplanation: Increasing the sample size (number of experimental units) generally increases the statistical power of a test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. This means that the chance of making a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) decreases. However, the significance level (\u03b1), which determines the probability of a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis), is set by the researchers and does not change with sample size. Therefore, increasing the sample size will not affect the probability of a Type I error but will increase the power of the test."
