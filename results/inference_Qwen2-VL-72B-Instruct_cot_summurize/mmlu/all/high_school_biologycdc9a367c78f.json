Autotrophs, which make their own food, had to evolve.\n\nThe heterotroph hypothesis suggests that early life forms were heterotrophic, meaning they obtained energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. However, for oxygen to fill the atmosphere, autotrophic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, had to evolve. These autotrophs use photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. As these autotrophs proliferated, they produced large amounts of oxygen as a byproduct, gradually increasing the oxygen levels in the Earth's atmosphere."
