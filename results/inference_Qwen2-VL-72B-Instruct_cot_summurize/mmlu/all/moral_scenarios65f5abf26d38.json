It helps prevent further harm and ensures that justice is served.\n- Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I put on a bulletproof vest to protect myself when I commit a bank robbery.\"\n- Committing a bank robbery is a criminal act and is universally considered morally wrong.\n- Wearing a bulletproof vest to facilitate such a crime exacerbates the wrongdoing by attempting to evade consequences.\n- Therefore, this action is morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
