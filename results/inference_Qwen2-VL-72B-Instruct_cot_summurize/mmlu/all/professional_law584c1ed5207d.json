Late for a business appointment, a businesswoman was driving north on a highway when she decided to pass the car in front of her. As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire. The owner's home was located approximately one mile from the accident scene. If the owner asserts a claim against thebusinesswoman, he will most likely\n\nA. recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nB. recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nC. recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nD. recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome of the owner's claim against the businesswoman, we need to consider several legal principles and factors:\n\n1. **Statutory Violation**: The businesswoman violated a state statute by driving to the left of the center line, which is a misdemeanor.\n\n2. **Chain of Causation**: The accident caused by the businesswoman delayed the fire engine, which in turn led to the destruction of the owner's house.\n\n3. **Proximate Cause**: For the owner to recover damages, there must be a direct and proximate cause between the businesswoman's actions and the damage to the house. This means the harm must be reasonably foreseeable and directly linked to the violation.\n\n4. **Intervening Causes**: There may be an argument about whether the fire itself was an intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation. However, courts often consider whether the initial act (the businesswoman's violation) set off a chain of events leading to the harm.\n\n5. **Statutory Purpose**: The purpose of the traffic statute is to prevent accidents and ensure safe driving conditions. The harm suffered by the owner (loss of property due to fire) can be seen as a foreseeable consequence of such accidents.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Recover the fair market value of his house before the fire**:\n   - This option suggests full recovery, which might be too broad. The businesswoman's action did not directly cause the fire but contributed to the delay in response time.\n\nB. **Recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck**:\n   - This option seems more reasonable. It acknowledges that the businesswoman's actions contributed to the delay, which in turn exacerbated the damage. The owner could potentially recover the portion of the loss attributable to the delay caused by the accident.\n\nC. **Recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire**:\n   - While the businesswoman did not start the fire, her actions delayed the fire engine's response, which is a significant contributing factor to the extent of the damage.\n\nD. **Recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered**:\n   - Statutes are generally interpreted broadly to cover harms that are reasonably foreseeable consequences of the prohibited conduct. The harm here (property loss due to delayed emergency response) is a foreseeable result of violating traffic laws.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most likely outcome is that the owner will recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.**"
