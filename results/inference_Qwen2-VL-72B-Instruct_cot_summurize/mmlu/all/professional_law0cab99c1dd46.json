The girlfriend, who was scared of flying, reluctantly agreed. During the flight, the pilot decided to play a practical joke and shut off the plane's engine. When the plane went into a nosedive, the pilot said, \"Oh my God, we're going to crash. \" The girlfriend became panic- stricken and started screaming hysterically. A few seconds later, the pilot re-started the engine and said, \"Don't worry \u0080\u0094I was only joking. \" The plane landed safely and neither person was injured. If the girlfriend brings suit against the pilot for intentional infliction of emotional distress, she will probably\n\nA. recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.\nB. recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.\nD. not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the girlfriend can successfully sue the pilot for intentional infliction of emotional distress, we need to consider the elements required for such a claim. Generally, for a plaintiff to succeed in a case of intentional infliction of emotional distress, they must demonstrate:\n\n1. The defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n2. The defendant intended to cause severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress was substantially certain to result from their conduct.\n3. The plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress.\n4. The defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's emotional distress.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these criteria:\n\nA. **Recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.**\n   - This statement focuses on the reaction of a reasonable person but does not address the other necessary elements, such as the pilot's intent or the severity of the distress.\n\nB. **Recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.**\n   - This option correctly identifies one of the key elements: the pilot's conduct (shutting off the engine and causing a nosedive) could be considered extreme and outrageous. However, it does not address the other elements like intent and causation.\n\nC. **Not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.**\n   - This option suggests that the pilot's intent to play a practical joke negates the intent required for an intentional tort. However, the intent to cause distress is still present even if the motive was to play a joke. The pilot knew his actions would cause distress.\n\nD. **Not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.**\n   - This option incorrectly assumes that physical injury is necessary for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Emotional distress alone can be sufficient.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.**\n\nThis option correctly highlights the extreme and outrageous nature of the pilot's actions, which is a critical element in establishing intentional infliction of emotional distress."
