                    "text": "In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son \u0080\u0094investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.\nB. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.\nC. the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\nD. the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the buyer is entitled to monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, we need to analyze the relevant legal principles and the specific facts presented.\n\n### Key Legal Principles:\n1. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: This covenant guarantees that the property being conveyed is free from any liens, charges, or other encumbrances except those specifically disclosed or known to the grantee.\n2. **Notice-Type Recording Statute**: Under a notice-type recording statute, a subsequent purchaser who records their interest first is protected against prior unrecorded interests, provided they act in good faith without notice of the prior interest.\n3. **Title Theory for Mortgages**: In jurisdictions following the title theory, the mortgagee holds legal title to the property during the period of the mortgage, and the mortgagor retains equitable title.\n\n### Analysis of Facts:\n- **1936 Mortgage**: The son granted a mortgage to an investor in 1936, which was recorded in 1936.\n- **1956 Mortgage**: The son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank in 1956, which was recorded in 1956 and stated it was subordinate to the 1936 mortgage.\n- **1953 Deed**: The son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend in 1953, but the deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957.\n- **1979 Conveyance**: The friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer in 1979, and this deed was duly recorded.\n- **2008 Agreement**: The farmer agreed to convey the dairy farm to the buyer in 2008, and the sale was finalized on January 15, 2009.\n\n### Breach of Covenant Against Encumbrances:\nThe buyer discovered the 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied. The question is whether this constitutes a breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\n#### Considerations:\n1. **Recording Status**: The 1936 mortgage was recorded before the 1953 deed was recorded. Therefore, the 1936 mortgage would have priority over the 1953 deed under a notice-type recording statute.\n2. **Knowledge of Buyer**: If the buyer had no actual or constructive notice of the 1936 mortgage at the time of purchase, the covenant against encumbrances would be breached.\n3. **Time of Breach**: The breach occurs at the time of conveyance if the property is subject to an encumbrance that was not disclosed or known to the buyer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the 1936 mortgage was recorded and the buyer had no notice of it, the covenant against encumbrances was breached at the time of conveyance. Therefore, the buyer is entitled to seek monetary damages for the breach.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nB. the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages."
