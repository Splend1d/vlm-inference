The context of the question revolves around the effectiveness of different methods of teaching grammar.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar.\n- This option aligns well with the passage, which emphasizes that \"plentiful discursive experience\" is crucial for learning grammar because it exercises judgment and provides language intake.\n\nB. Good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar.\n- This contradicts the passage, as it states that formal grammar study has been proven irrelevant and does not improve judgment.\n\nC. Analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking.\n- While this might be true, it is not the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on the effectiveness of discursive experience over formal grammar study.\n\nD. Formal study of grammar improves writing ability.\n- This also contradicts the passage, which claims that formal grammar study is irrelevant to learning grammar effectively.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar."
