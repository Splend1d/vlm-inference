In consolidation, this intercompany liability (Simmon's note payable) and the corresponding asset (King's note receivable) would be eliminated because they cancel each other out within the same entity (the consolidated group).\n\nSo, the calculation for the consolidated liabilities is as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = (\\text{King's Liabilities}) + (\\text{Simmon's Liabilities}) - (\\text{Intercompany Liability}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\$450,000 + \\$200,000 - \\$100,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\$550,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $550,000"
