While this could be part of the story, it doesn't fully capture the specific nature of the changes happening during this period.\n\nB. **Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization**: This option aligns well with the historical context of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government implemented extensive and centralized efforts to modernize the country, including significant investments in education to raise literacy rates.\n\nC. **Experimentation with syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization**: Syndicalism is a form of worker self-management and direct action. While there were elements of worker control and collective action in the Soviet Union, particularly in the early years after the revolution, this does not directly explain the rapid increase in literacy rates.\n\nD. **Second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world**: This option refers to the later stages of industrial development in countries outside the Western world. While industrialization was certainly a factor in the Soviet Union, it does not specifically address the educational campaigns that led to increased literacy.\n\nGiven the context of the Soviet Union's history, where the government played a dominant role in directing societal changes, including education, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**B. Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization**\n\nThis option accurately reflects the Soviet government's efforts to rapidly modernize the country, including through extensive educational programs aimed at increasing literacy rates."
