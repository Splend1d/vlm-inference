On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n"

                    "text": "The ruling in favor of the niece is most likely based on the principle that the delivery of the deed was effective when the widower handed it to his friend. This is because, in property law, the transfer of real property (such as a quarry) requires not only a valid deed but also the delivery of that deed to the grantee or someone acting on their behalf.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Creation of the Deed**: The widower created a deed conveying the quarry to his niece.\n2. **Delivery of the Deed**: The widower handed the deed to his friend with instructions to give it to the niece. This act constitutes delivery if the friend was acting as the niece's agent or if the niece had authorized the friend to receive the deed on her behalf.\n3. **Recording of the Deed**: The friend then recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. Recording serves as public notice of the transfer but does not itself effectuate the transfer; it merely provides evidence of the transaction.\n4. **Death of the Widower and Will**: The widower died and left the quarry to his daughter in his will. However, a will takes effect only after death and cannot override a prior valid conveyance by deed.\n5. **Dispute**: Upon the niece's return, a dispute arose over ownership.\n\nGiven these points, the critical factor is the delivery of the deed. If the friend was acting as the niece's agent or had authority to receive the deed on her behalf, the delivery was effective at the time the widower handed the deed to the friend. Therefore, the transfer of ownership occurred before the widower's death, making the devise in the will irrelevant to the ownership of the quarry.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.**"
