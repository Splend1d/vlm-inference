Therefore, it decreases the fringe width.\n\nB. **Move the screen closer to the slits**:\n   - This decreases \\( D \\), which reduces the numerator. Therefore, it decreases the fringe width.\n\nC. **Move the slits closer together**:\n   - This decreases \\( d \\), which reduces the denominator. Therefore, it increases the fringe width.\n\nD. **Use light with a lower wave speed**:\n   - The wave speed does not directly affect the fringe width in this context. The relevant parameters are the wavelength, distance to the screen, and slit separation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Move the slits closer together."
