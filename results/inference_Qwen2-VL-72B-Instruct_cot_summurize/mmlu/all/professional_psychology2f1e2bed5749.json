This allows children to use symbols, such as words and images, to represent objects and ideas. Conservation, which is the understanding that certain properties of objects remain constant despite changes in their form or appearance, typically emerges later, during the concrete operational stage. The object concept, which involves understanding that objects continue to exist even when they are out of sight, develops earlier, around 8-12 months of age. Formal operations, which involve abstract and systematic thinking, emerge during adolescence."
