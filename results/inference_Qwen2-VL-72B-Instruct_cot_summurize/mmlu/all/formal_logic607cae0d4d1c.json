It is too general and does not capture the specific individuals mentioned in the sentence.\n\nC. \\( tL \\lor eL \\)\n- This option reverses the order of the subject and predicate, which is incorrect in predicate logic. The correct form should be predicate followed by the subject.\n\nD. \\( Tl \\supset El \\)\n- This option represents a conditional statement, not a disjunction. It means \"If Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is a latte boy,\" which is not what the original sentence states.\n\nThe best translation into predicate logic is:\n\n\\( L(T) \\lor L(E) \\)\n\nThis matches option A if we assume that lowercase \\( t \\) and \\( e \\) represent Taylor and Eric respectively, but since it's not standard practice, the correct answer based on standard notation would be:\n\n**Final Answer:** C. \\( tL \\lor eL \\) (assuming lowercase notation is acceptable)."
