When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower.\n\nMeteor showers occur when the Earth passes through the debris trail left behind by a comet. As the comet orbits the Sun, it sheds ice and dust particles. These particles, which can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a boulder, continue to follow the comet's orbit. When Earth intersects with this stream of debris, the particles enter our atmosphere at high speeds, burning up and creating the streaks of light we see as meteors."
