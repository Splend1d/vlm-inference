Obesity, excess energy intake, normal growth and hypoinsulinaemia\n\nLeptin is a hormone produced by adipose cells that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance by suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure. A congenital disorder impairing the secretion of leptin would result in a lack of this regulatory mechanism, leading to increased hunger, overeating, and ultimately obesity. Since leptin also affects insulin sensitivity, individuals with such a disorder might exhibit hypoinsulinaemia (low levels of insulin) due to the body's reduced ability to regulate glucose metabolism properly. Growth may be normal if other hormones and nutrients are sufficient, but the primary phenotypic features would be obesity and excess energy intake."
