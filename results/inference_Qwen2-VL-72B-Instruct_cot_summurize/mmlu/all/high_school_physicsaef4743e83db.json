The voltage across each capacitor is the same as the voltage of the source.\n\nThe capacitance of each capacitor remains unchanged regardless of how they are connected in the circuit. Since the capacitors are identical, their capacitances are the same.\n\nHowever, the charge stored on each capacitor will not necessarily be the same. In a parallel configuration, the total charge stored is the sum of the charges on each individual capacitor. If the capacitors are identical and the voltage across them is the same, then the charge on each capacitor will also be the same due to Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
