Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations. The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level.\nB. Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.\nC. The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.\nD. IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.\n"

They often provide loans and financial assistance to these countries but attach conditions known as \"structural adjustment programs\" or SAPs. These programs typically involve measures like reducing government spending, privatizing state-owned enterprises, devaluing currencies, and liberalizing trade. The aim is to promote economic stability, growth, and debt repayment. However, these policies have sometimes led to social unrest and have been criticized for exacerbating inequality and undermining local industries. Therefore, option D accurately reflects the approach taken by these international financial institutions towards developing countries."
