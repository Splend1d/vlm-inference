In this case, the dark blue flower color and the bright white flower color are incompletely dominant, resulting in an intermediate light blue color in the F1 generation. When the F1 generation is selfed, the expected 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed, which is characteristic of incomplete dominance."
