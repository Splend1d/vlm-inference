The critical value corresponds to the upper and lower 2.5% points of the t-distribution because the total rejection region is split equally between the two tails.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom and a 5% significance level:\n\n\\[ t_{0.025, 24} \\approx 2.064 \\]\n\nTherefore, the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% size of test of \\( H_0: \\beta_3 = 1 \\) is approximately 2.06.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 2.06"
