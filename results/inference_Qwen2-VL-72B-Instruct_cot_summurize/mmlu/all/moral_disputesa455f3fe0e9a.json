According to these theories, the justification for punishing someone lies in the beneficial consequences that result from the punishment, such as deterrence, rehabilitation, or societal protection. Therefore, the correct choice is A, which aligns with the consequentialist perspective by emphasizing the production of overall intrinsic value through punishment."
