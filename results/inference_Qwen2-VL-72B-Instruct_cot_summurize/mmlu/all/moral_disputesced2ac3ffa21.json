Illicit cash flow to tax havens from rich countries exceeds aid to the world's poor.\n- This statement highlights how wealth is being siphoned off to tax havens rather than being used to help the poor, indicating a violation of the rights of the poor by global institutions.\n\nB. The implementation of neoliberal economic policies has had at mixed and at worst adverse impacts on the economic and social rights of the world's poor.\n- This statement suggests that certain economic policies have negatively affected the poor, implying that these policies (part of global social institutions) violate the rights of the poor.\n\nC. Wealthy nations press their political and economic advantages to secure unfair trade agreements with poor countries.\n- This statement points out that powerful nations use their influence to create unfair trade deals, which can harm the economies of poorer nations, thus violating the rights of the poor.\n\nEach of these statements individually supports Ashford's thesis. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer would be:\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nFinal answer: D. All of the above."
