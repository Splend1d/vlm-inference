While Lukianoff and Haidt do discuss concerns about over-sensitivity and the potential for misinterpretation, they don't specifically mention confabulation as a direct result of uncovering microaggressions.\n\nB. **the pursuit of justice by marking out racism, sexism, and classism**: This implies that the trend is aimed at identifying and addressing instances of discrimination. However, Lukianoff and Haidt argue that the focus on microaggressions can sometimes lead to an oversensitive culture rather than promoting true justice.\n\nC. **labeling, by assigning global negative traits to persons**: This aligns with their concern that the focus on microaggressions can lead to labeling individuals with broad negative characteristics based on minor or unintentional actions. They critique this tendency to label people harshly and suggest it can harm social interactions and personal growth.\n\nD. **universities to bear overly burdensome legal obligations**: While universities may face challenges related to managing complaints and ensuring a safe environment, Lukianoff and Haidt's primary concern is more about the cultural and psychological impacts rather than the legal obligations on universities.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate reflection of Lukianoff and Haidt's perspective on the trend of uncovering microaggressions is:\n\n**C. labeling, by assigning global negative traits to persons.**"
