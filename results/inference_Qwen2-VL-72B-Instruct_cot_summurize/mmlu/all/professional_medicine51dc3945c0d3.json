Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\n"

Do endotracheal intubation\n\nGiven the patient's history of esophageal varices and the presentation of vomiting a large volume of bright red blood, followed by becoming difficult to arouse, it is likely that the patient is experiencing an acute variceal bleed. This can lead to hypovolemic shock and airway compromise. Immediate endotracheal intubation is necessary to protect the airway from aspiration and ensure adequate oxygenation while other interventions are planned.\n\nFollowing intubation, the next steps would typically include:\n- Rapid infusion of intravenous fluids to restore intravascular volume.\n- Administration of medications such as octreotide or somatostatin to reduce portal hypertension and control bleeding.\n- Preparation for urgent upper endoscopy to definitively diagnose and treat the source of bleeding, which may involve band ligation or sclerotherapy.\n- Consideration of balloon tamponade if bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically.\n- Evaluation for potential transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement if bleeding recurs or cannot be controlled with other measures.\n\nVasopressin therapy might also be considered but is not typically the first-line treatment for acute variceal bleeding. It is often used in conjunction with other therapies or when other treatments have failed."
