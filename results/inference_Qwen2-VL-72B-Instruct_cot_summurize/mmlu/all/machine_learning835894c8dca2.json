Density-based clustering\n\nDensity-based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), are well-suited for spatial data and can produce clusters of varying sizes and shapes. These algorithms identify clusters based on the density of points in the data space, allowing them to find arbitrarily shaped clusters and handle noise effectively.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- A. Decision Trees are primarily used for classification and regression tasks, not for clustering.\n- C. Model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated by a mixture of underlying probability distributions, which may not be suitable for spatial data with complex shapes.\n- D. K-means clustering requires specifying the number of clusters beforehand and tends to produce clusters of similar size and spherical shape, which may not fit the requirement for clusters of many different sizes and shapes."
