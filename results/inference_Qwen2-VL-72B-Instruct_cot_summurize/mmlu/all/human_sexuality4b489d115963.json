However, it's important to note that the effects of erotica can vary widely depending on individual factors such as personal preferences, cultural background, and the specific content of the material. Additionally, studies have also explored other potential impacts of erotica, including its influence on attitudes towards sex, relationships, and body image, but these effects are complex and not uniformly positive or negative."
