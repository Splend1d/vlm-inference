This means that age is directly related to the ability to perform the essential functions of the job and is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business.\n\nAsking about age in other scenarios could be considered discriminatory and would not be legally permissible under most circumstances. Therefore, options A, C, and D are not appropriate reasons to inquire about a person's age during the personnel selection process."
