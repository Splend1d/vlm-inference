In accordance with the orthodox tradition of his religion, the employee wears a covering on his head throughout the day. The director of the state forestry department has notified the employee that he will not be permitted to wear his head covering while on duty. A state forestry regulation provides that all forest rangers are required to wear only standard headgear in the interests of maintaining a uniform dress code conducive to the furtherance of the department's morale, efficiency, and professional standard of conduct. Although the employee wants to pursue a career as a forest ranger, he feels that his religious beliefs should not be compromised by a governmental agency. In trying to resolve his dilemma, the employee seeks your legal advice. You should advise him that in light of relevant U. S. Supreme Court decisions, the state regulation is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because although the employee has a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, a state may impose reasonable regulations that are rationally related to the furtherance of a state interest.\nB. constitutional, because the interest of the state in vindicating a carefully considered professional judgment by the forestry director that wearing such religious apparel would interfere with the department's morale and efficiency is sufficient to contravene the wishes of its members to wear headgear required by their religious beliefs.\nC. unconstitutional, because in accordance with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, a state has no power to regulate religious beliefs.\nD. unconstitutional, because an individual has a fundamental right to seek gainful employment, and a state cannot arbitrarily and unreasonably regulate against such economic activity.\n"

This principle allows states to enact laws and regulations that serve legitimate state interests, provided they are rationally related to those interests. Here, the state's interest in maintaining a uniform dress code for forest rangers to promote morale, efficiency, and professional standards is a legitimate interest. The regulation is also rationally related to this interest, as it aims to ensure a cohesive and professional appearance among employees.\n\nWhile the employee does have a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, this right is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable limitations when necessary to achieve important state objectives. Therefore, the state regulation is likely to be deemed constitutional."
