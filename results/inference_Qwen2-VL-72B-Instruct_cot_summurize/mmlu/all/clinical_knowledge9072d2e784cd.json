Schamroth's sign\n\nSchamroth's sign involves placing the dorsal surface of one distal phalanx against the volar surface of another, typically on opposite hands. In healthy individuals, there should be a diamond-shaped window between the nail beds. In clubbing, this window disappears due to the increased curvature of the nail bed. This method is considered more reliable than simply inspecting the nail-bed angle from above or the side or assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed."
