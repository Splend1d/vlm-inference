The underlined portion does not modify any noun or pronoun directly.\n\nB. **A relative clause**: A relative clause typically begins with a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, that, which) and provides additional information about a noun or pronoun. The underlined portion does not begin with a relative pronoun.\n\nC. **A subordinate clause**: A subordinate clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and is used to provide additional information to the main clause. It often begins with subordinating conjunctions such as \"whenever,\" \"because,\" \"although,\" etc. The underlined portion starts with \"whenever\" and provides additional context for when Angela takes a walk.\n\nD. **An independent clause**: An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. The underlined portion cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the underlined portion \"Whenever the mood strikes her\" is best described as a subordinate clause because it provides additional information to the main clause and cannot stand alone as a complete sentence.\n\n**Final Answer: C. a subordinate clause**"
