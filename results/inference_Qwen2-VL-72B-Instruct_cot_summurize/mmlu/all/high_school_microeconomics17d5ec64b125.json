Air pollution from a power plant is blowing downwind and harming the trees in your community. Tax the production of electricity.\n\nExplanation:\n- A negative externality occurs when an economic activity imposes costs on third parties who are not involved in the transaction. In this case, the air pollution from the power plant is causing harm to the trees in the community.\n- To address this negative externality, taxing the production of electricity would increase the cost of producing electricity for the power plant. This would incentivize the power plant to reduce its emissions or invest in cleaner technologies, thereby reducing the negative impact on the community's trees.\n- Option A (taxing the citizens of the community) does not address the source of the problem and would unfairly burden the affected individuals rather than the responsible party.\n- Option B (giving a tree subsidy to your neighbor) addresses a positive externality (benefit to others) rather than a negative one.\n- Option C (giving a subsidy to the hog farmer) would encourage more hog farming, potentially exacerbating the negative externality rather than mitigating it."
