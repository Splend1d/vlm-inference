The K-means algorithm does not have such a requirement. It can work with any dimensionality of the feature space, regardless of the number of samples.\n\nB. **Has the smallest value of the objective function when K = 1**\n   - This is generally true. When \\( K = 1 \\), all data points are assigned to a single cluster, and the centroid of this cluster will be the mean of all the data points. The objective function (sum of squared distances from each point to its cluster centroid) will indeed be minimized in this case because there is only one cluster.\n\nC. **Minimizes the within class variance for a given number of clusters**\n   - This is correct. The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which is a measure of the within-class variance. For a fixed number of clusters \\( K \\), it tries to find centroids that minimize the total WCSS.\n\nD. **Converges to the global optimum if and only if the initial means are chosen as some of the samples themselves**\n   - This is incorrect. While choosing initial centroids as actual data points can sometimes help avoid poor local minima, it does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum. The K-means algorithm is sensitive to initialization and can get stuck in local optima even with good initializations.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are B and C."
