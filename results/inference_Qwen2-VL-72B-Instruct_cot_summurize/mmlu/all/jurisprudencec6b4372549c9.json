Animals have inherent worth which entitles them to the absolute right to live their lives with respect and autonomy.\n\nTom Regan, a prominent philosopher in the field of animal rights, argued that animals have intrinsic value and moral rights. He believed that animals should not be viewed merely as resources for human use but as beings with their own interests and rights to life, liberty, and bodily integrity. This perspective aligns with the idea that animals have inherent worth and deserve to live their lives with respect and autonomy."
