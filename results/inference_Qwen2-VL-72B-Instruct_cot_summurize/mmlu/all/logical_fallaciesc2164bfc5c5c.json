For example, if each brick in a wall is light, then the entire wall must be light.\n2. **Fallacy of Division**: This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the whole must also be true for its parts. For example, if a car is fast, then each part of the car must be fast.\n3. **Gambler's Fallacy**: This fallacy involves the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa).\n4. **Equivocation**: This fallacy involves using a word or phrase with multiple meanings in an argument without clarifying which meaning is intended, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.\n\nNow, let's analyze Mill's statement:\n- \"Each person's happiness is a good to that person.\"\n- \"The general happiness, therefore, is a good to the aggregate of all persons.\"\n\nMill is suggesting that since individual happiness is beneficial to individuals, the collective happiness (the sum of individual happinesses) is beneficial to the group as a whole. This reasoning does not involve assuming that properties of parts apply to the whole or vice versa. It doesn't involve probabilities or multiple meanings of words either.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the listed fallacies directly apply to Mill's statement. However, if we had to choose the closest one, it might seem like he is making an implicit assumption about how individual goods combine into a collective good, which could be seen as a form of the fallacy of composition. But strictly speaking, his statement does not explicitly commit any of these fallacies.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer would be:\nA. Fallacy of Composition\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this choice is somewhat interpretative, and Mill's statement itself does not clearly exhibit a fallacy."
