Guests typically leave their used towels for cleaning staff to collect and replace with fresh ones.\n- There is no harm or wrongdoing involved in this action; it is part of normal hotel procedures.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- \"I always kept my whiskey bottles out of reach of my 3-year-old son.\"\n- Keeping potentially harmful substances like alcohol out of reach of young children is a responsible and protective measure.\n- This action aligns with child safety practices and is considered morally right.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
