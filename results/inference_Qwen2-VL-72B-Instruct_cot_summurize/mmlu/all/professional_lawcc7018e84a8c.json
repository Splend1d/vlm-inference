A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?\n\nA. Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\nB. No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.\nC. No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.\nD. Yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\"\n"

Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\n\nIn the context of negligence law, the principle of \"take your plaintiff as you find them\" means that a defendant must accept responsibility for the plaintiff's pre-existing conditions or vulnerabilities. If the plaintiff has a rare medical condition that makes them more susceptible to injury, the defendant is still liable for the full extent of the harm caused by their negligence. This principle applies even if the injury would not have occurred to someone without such a condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\""
