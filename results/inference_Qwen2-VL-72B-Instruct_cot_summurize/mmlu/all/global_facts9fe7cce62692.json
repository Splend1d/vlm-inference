Given the growing concerns about algorithmic bias and fairness around that period, this seems unlikely.\n   \n2. **Option B (41%)**: This indicates that less than half of the population finds it unreasonable. While plausible, it might underestimate the level of concern given the heightened awareness of algorithmic biases.\n\n3. **Option C (56%)**: This suggests that more than half but not an overwhelming majority find it unreasonable. This aligns well with the increasing scrutiny and debate over algorithmic decision-making in sensitive areas like criminal justice.\n\n4. **Option D (71%)**: This implies a strong majority finds it unreasonable. While there was significant concern, it might be slightly high considering the mixed views on technological advancements in various sectors.\n\nConsidering these points, the most reasonable estimate based on the context and the typical distribution of public opinion would be:\n\n**Final Answer: C. 56%**"
