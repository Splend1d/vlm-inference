Increasing the sample size: A larger sample size generally provides more information about the population, making it easier to detect an effect if one exists. This increases the power of the test.\n\nII. Increasing the significance level (alpha): A higher significance level means that you are willing to accept a higher risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error). This makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis, thereby increasing the power of the test.\n\nIII. Increasing the probability of a Type II error: A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. Increasing the probability of a Type II error would actually decrease the power of the test because power is defined as 1 minus the probability of a Type II error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
