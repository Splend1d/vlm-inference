GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. **The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens**: This production occurs outside the United States, so it would not be included in U.S. GDP.\n\nII. **The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States**: This production also occurs outside the United States, so it would not be included in U.S. GDP.\n\nIII. **The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan**: This production occurs within the United States, so it would be included in U.S. GDP.\n\nIV. **The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens**: This production occurs within the United States, so it would be included in U.S. GDP.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer includes options III and IV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
