X-linked recessive.\n\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited disorder that primarily affects males and is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene located on the X chromosome. This makes it an X-linked recessive condition. Females can be carriers of the mutation but typically do not show symptoms unless they have two defective copies of the gene or have skewed X-inactivation."
