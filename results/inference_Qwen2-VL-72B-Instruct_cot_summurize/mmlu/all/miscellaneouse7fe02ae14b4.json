Global division of labor\n\nThe use of inexpensive labor in Asian countries by footwear companies based in the United States and Europe is an example of the global division of labor. This refers to the distribution of work across different regions or countries, often driven by the pursuit of lower costs or specialized skills. In this case, companies take advantage of lower labor costs in Asia to produce goods more cheaply than they could domestically."
