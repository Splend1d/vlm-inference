He believed that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, but he had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches, which were owned by the driver's neighbor and reported stolen off of her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied. On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?\n\nA. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\nB. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.\nC. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.\nD. No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.\n"

Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\n\nIn this scenario, the police officer conducted a search without any specific and articulable facts indicating that the driver might be involved in criminal activity or that there was contraband in the vehicle. The driver's irritability and fidgeting alone do not provide sufficient grounds for a search. Under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, searches and seizures must be reasonable, which generally requires either a warrant or probable cause, or at least reasonable suspicion for a limited search. Since the officer did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion, the search was likely unconstitutional, and the appellate court may reverse the lower court's decision denying the motion to suppress the evidence."
