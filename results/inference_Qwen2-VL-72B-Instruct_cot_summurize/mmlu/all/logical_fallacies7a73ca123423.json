This type of reasoning is known as an \"appeal to perfection\" or \"perfect solution fallacy.\" However, none of the options provided directly match this specific fallacy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **ad ignorantium** - This refers to the argument from ignorance, where someone claims something must be true because it has not been proven false, or vice versa.\n\nB. **Many questions** - This could refer to the complex question fallacy, where a question is asked in such a way that it presupposes certain answers or assumptions.\n\nC. **Extension** - This term is not commonly used in the context of logical fallacies and does not fit the description given.\n\nD. **Compound proposition** - This term relates more to logic and the structure of statements rather than a specific fallacy.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly align with the specific fallacy described in the question. However, if we had to choose the closest one based on the context provided, it might be:\n\n**A. ad ignorantium**\n\nThis is because arguing that something is flawed for not doing something it was never intended to do can sometimes involve assuming that the thing should be able to do everything, which is a form of ignorance about its actual purpose or capabilities."
