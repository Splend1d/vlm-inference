However, emotions alone do not provide conclusive evidence for moral absolutes.\n\nB. **Shows conclusively that reproductive cloning is sometimes wrong.**\n   - Similar to option A, this option implies that feelings of repugnance can conclusively determine the morality of an action under certain circumstances. Again, emotions alone do not provide conclusive evidence for moral judgments.\n\nC. **Has nothing to do with the morality of cloning.**\n   - This option suggests that feelings of repugnance have no bearing on the moral assessment of cloning. While emotions might not be the sole basis for moral judgment, they can still be relevant indicators of potential ethical issues.\n\nD. **Is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning.**\n   - This option acknowledges that feelings of repugnance can indicate that there may be something ethically problematic about reproductive cloning. It does not claim absolute certainty but recognizes the emotional response as a potential indicator of deeper moral concerns.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most reasonable interpretation is that feelings of repugnance can serve as a sign that there might be something ethically questionable about reproductive cloning, without claiming absolute certainty or dismissing the relevance of such feelings entirely.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**D. Is a sign that something is wrong with reproductive cloning.**"
