This theory successfully predicts several key features of our solar system, including:\n\n- Planets orbiting the Sun in nearly circular orbits within a flattened disk (Option A).\n- The presence of asteroids, Kuiper-belt objects, and comets, which are remnants of the early solar system (Option D).\n\nHowever, the nebular theory does not specifically predict the equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets (Option B). In fact, the solar system has four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and four jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), which is not necessarily an \"equal\" number in terms of mass or size.\n\nThe craters on the Moon (Option C) are primarily the result of impacts by meteoroids and asteroids after the formation of the Moon, which is a separate process from the initial formation of the solar system itself. While the nebular theory can explain the presence of impactors in the early solar system, it does not directly predict the specific cratering history of the Moon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets"
