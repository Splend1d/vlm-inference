                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\n\nThis is because Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that for an individual to be affected by the disease, they must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent). Heterozygous individuals, who carry one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the normal dominant allele, do not exhibit symptoms of the disease but can pass the recessive allele to their offspring. This allows the allele to persist in the population even though affected individuals do not survive to reproductive age."
