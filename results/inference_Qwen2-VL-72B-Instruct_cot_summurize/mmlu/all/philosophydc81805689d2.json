According to this theory, the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure and minimizes pain or suffering. Mill believed that while it's not always practical to calculate the exact consequences of every action, we can rely on general rules of thumb that have been derived from the principle of utility to guide our behavior. These rules are based on past experiences and empirical evidence about what tends to produce the greatest good for the greatest number."
