A lunar day is defined as the time it takes for the Moon to complete one rotation on its axis relative to the Sun.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Rotation Period**: The Moon rotates on its axis once every 27.3 days (sidereal period).\n2. **Orbital Period**: The Moon orbits the Earth in approximately 27.3 days (sidereal period), which is almost the same as its rotation period.\n3. **Synchronous Rotation**: Due to tidal locking, the Moon's rotation period and orbital period are synchronized. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth.\n4. **Lunar Day Calculation**: Because the Moon's rotation and orbit are synchronized, a lunar day (from sunrise to sunrise) is approximately equal to the time it takes for the Moon to complete one full orbit around the Earth relative to the Sun.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 29 Earth days\n\nSo, a day on the Moon lasts approximately 29 Earth days."
