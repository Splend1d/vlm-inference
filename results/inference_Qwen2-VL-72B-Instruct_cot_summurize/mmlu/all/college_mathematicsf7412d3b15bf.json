When this circle is revolved around the z-axis, each point on the circle traces out a circle in the xy-plane with radius equal to the distance from the z-axis to that point on the original circle. This distance is the radius of the original circle, which is 1.\n\nThe equation of a torus can be derived using cylindrical coordinates. The general equation for a torus centered at (R, 0, 0) with inner radius r is:\n\n\\[ (R - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 + z^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nIn our case, R = 3 (the distance from the z-axis to the center of the original circle), and r = 1 (the radius of the original circle). Substituting these values into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ (3 - \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 + z^2 = 1 \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 9 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we obtain:\n\n\\[ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\\)"
