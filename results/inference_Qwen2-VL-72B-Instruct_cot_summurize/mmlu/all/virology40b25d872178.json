Via scratches and breaks in the skin\n\nPapillomaviruses, including those that cause warts and some types of cancer, typically infect humans through direct skin-to-skin contact. This can occur when there are small cuts, abrasions, or breaks in the skin, allowing the virus to enter the body. They are not generally waterborne, airborne, or primarily spread in hospital settings (nosocomial)."
