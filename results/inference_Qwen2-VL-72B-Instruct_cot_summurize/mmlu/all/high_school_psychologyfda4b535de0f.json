It does not play a significant role in visual recognition or memory.\n2. **Hypothalamus**: The hypothalamus is involved in regulating autonomic functions such as body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sleep. It is not directly associated with visual recognition.\n3. **Amygdala**: The amygdala is involved in emotional processing and memory, particularly related to fear and survival responses. While it plays a role in emotional memory, it is not primarily responsible for visual recognition.\n4. **Left Cerebral Cortex**: The cerebral cortex, especially the occipital lobe, is crucial for visual processing. Damage to this area can impair visual recognition abilities.\n\nGiven that Lucille cannot recognize her family members by looking at them, the lesion is most likely affecting her ability to process visual information, which points to damage in the cerebral cortex, specifically the left side since it is often associated with language and visual processing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. left cerebral cortex**"
