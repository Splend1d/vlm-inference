They are not theoretically motivated\n\nPure time-series models, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, rely solely on historical data and do not incorporate any theoretical or causal relationships between variables. This lack of theoretical motivation can be seen as a disadvantage because it means that these models may not capture important underlying economic or financial mechanisms that could improve forecast accuracy.\n\nIn contrast, structural models explicitly incorporate theoretical relationships between variables, which can provide insights into the underlying dynamics of the system being modeled. This can lead to more accurate forecasts and a better understanding of the factors driving the behavior of the variables of interest."
