Imports are subtracted from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) when calculating net exports because they represent spending on foreign goods rather than domestic production. Therefore, net exports would decrease due to the increase in imports.\n\nHowever, the purchase of the entertainment system by the American consumer contributes to the overall economic activity within the U.S., which is reflected in the GDP calculation. The expenditure on the imported good is part of the consumption component of GDP, so there is no direct change in the total GDP as a result of this transaction alone. The GDP remains unchanged because the value of the imported good is included in the calculation of GDP through consumer spending, even though it reduces net exports."
