The plaintiff's statement to the police accident investigator about not seeing the color of the light due to being distracted by her cell phone is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement being used to prove the fact that she did not see the traffic light. Hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible unless it falls under one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. Since no exception appears to apply in this scenario, the investigator's testimony should be excluded as hearsay."
