Placing items on the counter is part of the checkout process.\n- There is no indication of theft, damage, or any other morally wrong behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"At the theater, I took out my phone before the movie started to text a friend.\"\n- Using a phone during a movie can be disruptive to others, especially if it emits light or sound.\n- While not necessarily illegal, it is generally considered rude and disrespectful to other moviegoers.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve any morally wrong actions.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that is generally considered morally wrong due to its potential to disrupt others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
