The use of seeds as a natural insecticide in Altamira cave in southwestern Europe.\n   - This indicates an understanding of the properties of certain seeds and their application to repel insects, which is a sophisticated use of plants.\n\nB. Plant materials such as flowers in Aurignacian burials in southern France.\n   - This suggests the use of plants for ceremonial or decorative purposes, indicating cultural significance but not necessarily a new practical use.\n\nC. Plant material lining the floor of Sibudu Cave in South Africa.\n   - This shows the use of plants for construction or comfort, possibly as bedding or insulation, which is a practical application.\n\nD. The use of wood in the Gravettian tradition to make spear-throwers and canoes.\n   - While this involves the use of wood (a plant product), it focuses on woodworking rather than the direct use of plant materials in a new way.\n\nAmong these options, A stands out because it demonstrates a specific and innovative use of plant seeds for pest control, which is a clear example of a new application of plants during the Middle Stone Age.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. the use of seeds as a natural insecticide in Altamira cave in southwestern Europe."
