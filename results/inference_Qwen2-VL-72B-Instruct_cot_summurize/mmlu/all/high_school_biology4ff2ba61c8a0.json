Fermentation replenishes the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue.\n\nFermentation is an anaerobic process that allows cells to produce ATP in the absence of oxygen. During fermentation, pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) is converted into other compounds such as ethanol or lactate. This conversion regenerates NAD+ from NADH, which is essential for glycolysis to continue producing ATP. Therefore, the primary purpose of fermentation is to maintain the supply of NAD+, allowing glycolysis to proceed and generate energy in the form of ATP."
