The rule in Shelley's Case\n\nThe rule in Shelley's Case is a common law principle that applies when a grantor conveys an estate to a life tenant and then to the heirs of the grantor. According to this rule, the remainder to the grantor's heirs is void, and instead, the grantor retains a reversionary interest. This means that after the life estate ends, the property reverts back to the original grantor or their estate, rather than passing to the grantor's heirs as intended.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. The doctrine of concurrent ownership refers to situations where two or more parties hold an undivided interest in the same property at the same time (e.g., joint tenancy, tenancy in common). It does not apply to the scenario described.\n\nC. The doctrine of worthier title is another common law principle that states that if a person conveys an estate to another and then to the grantor's heirs, the grantee takes a better title than the grantor intended because the grantee's heirs cannot take a lesser estate than the grantee. However, this doctrine does not directly address the situation where the grantor's heirs are named as the subsequent beneficiaries.\n\nD. The rule against perpetuities is a legal doctrine that prevents the creation of future interests that may vest too far in the future. While it can affect the validity of certain future interests, it does not specifically address the situation described in the question, which is governed by the rule in Shelley's Case."
