It might be seen as insensitive or lacking empathy, but it does not involve any direct harm or wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, grabbing a stranger's child without permission is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action can cause harm, distress, and potential legal consequences, as it involves physical contact with a minor without consent."
