It is an exothermic process due to the release of energy as an electron is liberated from the Coulombic attraction holding it to the nucleus.\nB. The entropy of the system increases due to the separation of the electron from its atom.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Energy contained in the light can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between electrons and the nucleus.\n\nIn photoelectron spectroscopy, high-energy photons (light) are used to eject electrons from atoms or molecules. This process requires energy because the electron is held in place by the attractive force (Coulombic attraction) between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. The energy provided by the photons is sufficient to overcome this attraction, allowing the electron to be ejected. This is why ionization can occur even though it is not thermodynamically favored; the external energy source (the light) provides the necessary energy for the process to take place."
