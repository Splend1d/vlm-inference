Increase in production of SUVs.\n\nWage differentials are typically based on factors such as higher risk jobs, investment in human capital (like education and training), and sometimes racial discrimination (which is an unfortunate reality but not a legitimate basis for wage differences). An increase in the production of SUVs would affect the demand for labor in that industry but is not itself a basis for a wage differential between different workers or jobs."
