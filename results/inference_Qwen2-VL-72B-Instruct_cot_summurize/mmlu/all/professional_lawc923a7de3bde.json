For 15 years, a commercial fisherman had kept a daily log of the water level at his dock on the riverbank opposite the land in order to forecast fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to graph the data from the fisherman's logs for use as a trial exhibit. At trial, the fisherman testified to the care with which he had made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, which had been made available for the defendant's inspection. The draftsman then testified to the manner in which he had prepared the graphs. With this foundation, are the graphs admissible?\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n"

Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Business Records Exception to Hearsay**: The fisherman's logs are considered business records, which are generally admissible under the hearsay exception if they meet certain criteria. These criteria include that the records were made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the event recorded, and by someone with knowledge of the event.\n\n2. **Foundation Laid**: The fisherman testified about the care with which he made the measurements and recorded them in his logs. This testimony establishes the reliability of the logs as business records.\n\n3. **Graphs as Summaries**: The draftsman's graphs are summaries of these voluminous business records. Under the rules of evidence, summaries of voluminous records are admissible if they accurately reflect the underlying records and the underlying records have been made available for inspection by the opposing party.\n\n4. **Expert Opinion**: While the draftsman may be providing an interpretation or summary of the data, the primary purpose of the graphs is to present the data in a more accessible format rather than to offer an expert opinion on the water levels themselves.\n\nTherefore, the graphs are admissible as summaries of voluminous business records, provided they meet the requirements for such summaries under the rules of evidence."
