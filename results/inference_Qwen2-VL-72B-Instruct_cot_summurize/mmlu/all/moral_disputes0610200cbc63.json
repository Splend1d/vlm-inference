This perspective acknowledges the complexity and intersectionality within misogyny, recognizing that different groups of women may face unique forms of discrimination and hate. By considering such speech as hate speech, Richardson-Self emphasizes the importance of addressing and combating all forms of misogyny, regardless of whether they target all women or specific subsets."
