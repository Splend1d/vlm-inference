A grayish, milky fluid\n\nWhen water contaminates a hydraulic system in farm machinery, it often causes the hydraulic fluid to become cloudy or milky in appearance due to emulsification. This is because water and oil do not mix well, leading to a suspension of water droplets within the oil, which gives it a milky look. The other options may also indicate issues with the hydraulic system but are less specific to water contamination."
