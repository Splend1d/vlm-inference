In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is\n\nA. a nuclear thyroid scan\nB. an iodine131\u00a0scan\nC. fine-needle aspiration\nD. ultrasonography of the thyroid gland\n"

It involves inserting a thin needle into the nodule to extract cells for analysis, which can help determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant. This procedure is minimally invasive and provides valuable information about the nature of the nodule.\n\nWhile ultrasonography (option D) is also commonly used to evaluate thyroid nodules and can provide information about the size, location, and characteristics of the nodule, it does not provide a definitive diagnosis regarding malignancy. Ultrasonography might be performed before FNA to guide the biopsy or to assess the nodule's characteristics, but FNA is typically the next step for further evaluation.\n\nNuclear thyroid scans (option A) and iodine-131 scans (option B) are generally not the first-line investigations for a solitary thyroid nodule unless there is a specific indication such as hyperthyroidism or a history of radiation exposure. These scans are more useful in assessing the function of the thyroid gland rather than providing a histological diagnosis of a nodule."
