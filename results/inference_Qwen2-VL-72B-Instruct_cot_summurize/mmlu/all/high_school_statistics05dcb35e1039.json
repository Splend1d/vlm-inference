In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.\n\nIn experiments, researchers actively manipulate one or more variables (the independent variables) to determine their effect on another variable (the dependent variable). This allows for cause-and-effect relationships to be established. In contrast, observational studies involve observing subjects without any intervention by the researcher, which means that cause-and-effect conclusions cannot be drawn with the same level of certainty."
