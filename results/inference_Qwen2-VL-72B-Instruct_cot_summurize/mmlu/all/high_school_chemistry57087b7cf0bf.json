Bond length is influenced by the number of shared electron pairs between atoms (i.e., single, double, or triple bonds) and the electronegativity of the atoms involved.\n\n1. **CO2**: Carbon dioxide has two carbon-oxygen double bonds (O=C=O). Double bonds are shorter than single bonds because they involve more electron density between the atoms.\n\n2. **CO32-**: The carbonate ion has one carbon-oxygen double bond and two carbon-oxygen single bonds arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. The double bond is shorter than the single bonds.\n\n3. **NO2-**: The nitrite ion has one nitrogen-oxygen double bond and one nitrogen-oxygen single bond. The double bond is shorter than the single bond.\n\n4. **NO3-**: The nitrate ion has three equivalent nitrogen-oxygen single bonds arranged in a trigonal planar geometry. All bonds are single bonds and thus longer compared to double bonds.\n\nGiven this information, the molecule with the shortest bonds will be the one with the most double bonds. Since **CO2** consists entirely of double bonds, it will have the shortest bonds among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. CO2"
