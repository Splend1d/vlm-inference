Polyploidy\n\nThe scenario described suggests that the new variant is reproductively isolated from the original population, as indicated by the inability to produce offspring when bred with the original phenotype. This reproductive isolation can be a result of polyploidy, where the new variant has an extra set of chromosomes compared to the original population. This change in chromosome number often leads to sterility when crossed with the original population but allows for successful reproduction within the new variant group."
