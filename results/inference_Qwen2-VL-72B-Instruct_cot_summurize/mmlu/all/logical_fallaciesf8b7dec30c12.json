Questionable Analogy\n\nThis statement commits the fallacy of questionable analogy because it compares the universe to a watch and assumes that just as a watch requires a maker, so too does the universe require a creator. This analogy is questionable because it assumes that the universe operates on the same principles as a man-made object like a watch, which may not be a valid comparison."
