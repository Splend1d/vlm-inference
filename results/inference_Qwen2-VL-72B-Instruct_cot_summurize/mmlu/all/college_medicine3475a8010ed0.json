H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\n\nThis option correctly explains why the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water has a negative slope. Unlike most substances, ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water because of the open crystalline structure formed by hydrogen bonding in the solid state. This means that as pressure increases, ice can be converted into liquid water at temperatures below its normal melting point, resulting in a negative slope for the liquid-solid equilibrium line on the phase diagram."
