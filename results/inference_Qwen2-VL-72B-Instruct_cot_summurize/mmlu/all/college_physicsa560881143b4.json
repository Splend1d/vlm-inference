The Pauli exclusion principle\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers, including their spin. In the context of helium, which has two electrons, this principle affects the energy levels of the excited states.\n\nIn an ortho-helium state, the electron spins are parallel, meaning they have the same spin quantum number. This configuration allows for a lower energy state because it maximizes the spatial separation between the two electrons, reducing their mutual repulsion. In contrast, in a para-helium state, the electron spins are antiparallel, leading to a higher energy state due to increased electron-electron repulsion.\n\nTherefore, the Pauli exclusion principle explains why ortho-states have lower energy than para-states in helium."
