                    "text": "A bakery incorporated and headquartered in State A had a dispute with a mill incorporated and headquartered in State B over the quality of the flour the mill had delivered to the bakery. The bakery sued the mill in a federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100,000 in damages. The contract between the bakery and the mill contained a clause designating State B courts as the sole venue for litigating disputes arising under the contract. Under precedent of the highest court in State A, forum-selection clauses are unenforceable as against public policy; under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, such clauses are enforceable. The mill has moved to transfer the case to a federal court in State B, citing the forum-selection clause in the parties' contract and asserting the facts that the flour was produced in State B and that the majority of likely witnesses are in State B. Is the court likely to grant the mill's motion?\n\nA. No, because State A law treats forum- selection clauses as unenforceable.\nB. No, because the mill should have instead filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue.\nC. Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.\nD. Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Federal Common Law Precedent**: The U.S. Supreme Court has established that forum-selection clauses are generally enforceable. This means that even though State A considers such clauses unenforceable as against public policy, federal courts will typically uphold these clauses due to federal common law precedent.\n\n2. **Enforcement of Forum-Selection Clauses**: Given that the contract contains a clause designating State B courts as the sole venue for disputes, and considering the U.S. Supreme Court's stance on enforcing such clauses, the federal court in State A is likely to honor this provision.\n\n3. **Motion to Transfer**: The mill's motion to transfer the case to a federal court in State B aligns with the enforceability of the forum-selection clause. Federal courts have discretion to transfer cases to another district when it serves the convenience of the parties and witnesses or is in the interest of justice (under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a)).\n\nTherefore, despite State A's local law regarding forum-selection clauses, the federal court is likely to grant the mill's motion based on federal common law precedent and the enforceability of the forum-selection clause in the contract."
