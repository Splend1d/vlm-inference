All of the above.\n\nExplanation: Societies become more complex due to various factors including:\n\n- **Surplus food storage**: This allows for specialization of labor and the development of trade, which are key aspects of societal complexity.\n- **Crop irrigation infrastructure**: The need to manage water resources through dams or canals leads to organized planning and governance, contributing to societal complexity.\n- **Defense needs of sedentary communities**: Protecting settled populations often necessitates the formation of organized military structures and alliances, further complicating social organization.\n\nTherefore, all these factors contribute to the increased complexity of societies."
