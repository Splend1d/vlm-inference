The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.\n\nThis statement does not accurately characterize our current understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system. While there are mechanisms in place, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and various national health agencies, these systems often struggle to effectively contain pandemic outbreaks due to issues like limited resources, lack of coordination, and challenges in implementing global health policies. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, highlighted significant gaps in the international response and the need for improved preparedness and cooperation."
