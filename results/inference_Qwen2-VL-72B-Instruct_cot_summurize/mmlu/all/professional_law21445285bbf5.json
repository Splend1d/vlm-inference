                    "text": "A state recidivist statute made it a felony punishable by life imprisonment without parole to be convicted for the fifth time of any form of criminal theft involving goods or money of $100 or more. A man's record showed four prior convictions for nonviolent crimes involving theft or bad checks, each one pertaining to property or cash in excess of $100 but not in excess of $500. On the fifth conviction, after conviction of passing a $100 bad check, the court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute. He challenged the sentence and the statute based on the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\nB. Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\nC. No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n"

Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment includes a proportionality principle, which requires that sentences must be commensurate with the crime committed. In cases where the crime does not involve violence or the threat of violence, imposing a life sentence without the possibility of parole may be considered disproportionately severe. This is especially true when the offenses are nonviolent and involve relatively small amounts of money. The Supreme Court has previously ruled in cases such as Ewing v. California (2003) that while habitual offender laws can impose severe penalties, they must still be proportional to the nature of the crimes committed. Therefore, the Court might find the sentence in this case to be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment."
