Removal of the investment tax credit\n\nThe removal of an investment tax credit would likely slow a nation's economic growth because it discourages businesses from investing in new equipment, facilities, and technology. Investment tax credits provide incentives for companies to invest in their operations, which can lead to increased productivity, job creation, and overall economic growth. Without these incentives, businesses may be less likely to invest, potentially leading to slower economic expansion."
