It is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which restricts military activity and claims to sovereignty in the region.\n\nB. **American Samoa**: American Samoa is an unincorporated territory of the United States. It does not have full sovereignty and is not recognized as a state.\n\nC. **Egypt**: Egypt is a sovereign country located in North Africa. It has a defined border, a permanent population, a government, and the ability to engage in international relations. Therefore, it qualifies as a state.\n\nD. **Marshall Islands**: The Marshall Islands is also a sovereign country located in the Pacific Ocean. It has a defined border, a permanent population, a government, and the ability to engage in international relations. Thus, it too qualifies as a state.\n\nGiven these analyses, both Egypt (Option C) and the Marshall Islands (Option D) are states. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, and assuming there might be a specific context or instruction to choose one, the most commonly recognized and widely known state among the options would be Egypt.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**C. Egypt**"
