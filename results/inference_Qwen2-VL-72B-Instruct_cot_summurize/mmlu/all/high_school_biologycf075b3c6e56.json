It provides rigidity and strength to plant stems and trunks, which is crucial for supporting the weight of leaves and other structures as plants grow taller. This ability to grow tall has been a significant factor in the evolutionary success of land plants, as it allows them to reach sunlight more effectively and compete for space in dense vegetation."
