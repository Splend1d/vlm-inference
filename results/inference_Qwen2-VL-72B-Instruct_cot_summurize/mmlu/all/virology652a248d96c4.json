The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo.\n\nThis statement accurately describes a significant advancement in rabies vaccine production. Modern rabies vaccines are often produced using human diploid cell lines, which are derived from fetal tissue obtained from elective abortions. This method allows for the production of a safer and more effective vaccine compared to earlier methods."
