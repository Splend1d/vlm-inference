The empire had expanded rapidly through conquests, but it had not fully integrated or won the loyalty of many of the peoples it had subjugated. This lack of allegiance made it easier for Pizarro and his relatively small force to exploit existing tensions and conflicts among the various groups within the Inca realm. Additionally, the capture and execution of the Inca ruler Atahualpa further destabilized the empire and contributed to its downfall. While horses and guns did play a role in intimidating the Incas, and Pizarro's strategic acumen was important, the internal weaknesses of the Inca Empire were key to his success."
