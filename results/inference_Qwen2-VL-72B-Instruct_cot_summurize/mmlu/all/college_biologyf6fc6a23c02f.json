This typically indicates that there are no critical ionizable groups (such as amino acids with ionizable side chains) on either the enzyme or the substrate that are directly involved in the catalytic mechanism or binding interactions that are sensitive to pH changes. If ionizable groups were participating, their protonation state would change with pH, affecting the enzyme's activity."
