As long as Timmy has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver he will have a healthy development.\n\nResearch indicates that children's sexual orientation is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, and is not determined by the sexual orientation of their parents. Similarly, popularity among peers and social skills are influenced by a wide range of factors including personality, social interactions, and individual experiences, rather than the sexual orientation of the parents. A supportive and accepting environment is crucial for any child's healthy development, regardless of the family structure."
