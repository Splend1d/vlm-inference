He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

This communication can be interpreted as a notice of his intention to cease performance under the contract. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pool.**\n   - This statement is accurate. Given the man's notice, the swimming club can reasonably deny him access to the pool since he has indicated he will not be using it.\n\nB. **The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.**\n   - This statement is also accurate. The man's letter indicates his intention not to fulfill his contractual obligations, which constitutes a breach of contract. The swimming club can take legal action immediately.\n\nC. **The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.**\n   - This statement is generally accurate. In many jurisdictions, a party who has repudiated a contract can retract their repudiation before the other party accepts the repudiation or takes legal action.\n\nD. **The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.**\n   - This statement is inaccurate. The swimming club does not have to wait until the next payment date to sue for breach of contract. Once the man has indicated his intention not to perform (repudiated), the swimming club can sue immediately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
