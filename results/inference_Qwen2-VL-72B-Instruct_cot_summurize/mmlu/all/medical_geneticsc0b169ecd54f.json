Low density lipoprotein receptor\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is primarily caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). This receptor plays a crucial role in the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. When the receptor is defective due to a mutation, LDL cholesterol accumulates in the blood, leading to high levels of cholesterol and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease."
