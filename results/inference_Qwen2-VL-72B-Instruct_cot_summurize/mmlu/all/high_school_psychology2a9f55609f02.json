Counterconditioning, which involves replacing an unwanted response with a desired one through conditioning, can be aligned with somatic approaches as it may involve bodily responses and sensations. Systematic desensitization and rational emotive behavior therapies are more cognitive-behavioral in nature, while chemotherapy is a medical treatment for diseases like cancer and not typically associated with somatic therapy."
