Service as required by State B's rules of civil procedure.\n\nIn federal court, service of process must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). Rule 4 of the FRCP governs service of process and generally requires that service be made in accordance with state law where the action is brought or as directed by the court. Since the lawsuit is filed in federal court in State B, the service should follow the rules of civil procedure of State B, unless otherwise specified by the federal court.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not necessarily align with standard legal procedures for service of process. Emailing documents (Option C) is typically not sufficient unless specifically allowed by local rules or agreed upon by the parties. Personal service by the plaintiff (Option D) is also unusual; typically, service is performed by a process server or another authorized individual. Leaving documents with secretaries (Option B) might not constitute proper service under many jurisdictions' rules, which often require personal delivery to the defendant or their authorized agent.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice, ensuring compliance with the applicable state laws and federal rules governing service of process."
