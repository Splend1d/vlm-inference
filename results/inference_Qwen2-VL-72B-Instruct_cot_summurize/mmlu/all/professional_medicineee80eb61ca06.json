Her suitability for home dialysis\n\nGiven the patient's advanced age, comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal failure, as well as her living situation on a farm far from the nearest dialysis facility, her suitability for home dialysis is the most important factor to consider for long-term treatment options. Home dialysis can provide greater flexibility and convenience, potentially improving her quality of life and reducing the burden of frequent travel for in-center dialysis treatments."
