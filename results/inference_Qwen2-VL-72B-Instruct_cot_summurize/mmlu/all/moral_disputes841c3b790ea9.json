                    "text": "The concept of \"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon\" refers to a situation where individuals or groups collectively agree to impose constraints on each other's behavior in order to achieve a common goal. This typically involves a cooperative effort where everyone agrees to abide by certain rules or restrictions that they would not necessarily follow individually.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. All countries cooperating to change the existing incentive structure by introducing a system of enforceable sanctions to curb climate change.\n- This option describes a scenario where countries collectively agree to enforce sanctions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It involves mutual coercion (sanctions) and mutual agreement (cooperation among countries).\n\nB. The agreement of more powerful nations to require less powerful nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions for the benefit of all humanity.\n- This option suggests that more powerful nations are imposing requirements on less powerful nations. While it involves coercion, it does not necessarily indicate mutual agreement from both sides.\n\nC. The agreement of less powerful nations to boycott trade with more powerful nations until the latter agree to curb their greenhouse gas emissions.\n- This option describes a form of coercion (boycotting trade) but does not clearly indicate mutual agreement between the two parties involved.\n\nD. The agreement of a large number of individual agents to restrict their own pollution.\n- This option involves individual agents agreeing to restrict their own pollution, which is a form of self-imposed constraint rather than mutual coercion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best example of \"mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon\" is:\n\nA. All countries cooperating to change the existing incentive structure by introducing a system of enforceable sanctions to curb climate change."
