We are given two points on the graph of $f(x)$: $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. \n\nTo find the range of possible values for $f(1)$, we consider the line segment connecting these two points. The slope of the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{slope} = \\frac{9 - 5}{2 - (-2)} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means the equation of the line passing through these points is of the form $y = x + b$. To find $b$, we can use one of the points; using $(2,9)$ gives us:\n\n\\[ 9 = 2 + b \\]\n\\[ b = 7 \\]\n\nSo, the equation of the line is $y = x + 7$. This line represents the upper boundary for the value of $f(x)$ at any point between $-2$ and $2$ due to the strict convexity of $f(x)$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the value of $y$ on this line is:\n\n\\[ y = 1 + 7 = 8 \\]\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, $f(1)$ must be less than $8$ but greater than $f(-2)=5$ and $f(2)=9$ because the function cannot go above the line segment connecting these points. However, since we're only asked for the upper bound and not the lower bound, we focus on the fact that $f(1)$ must be less than $8$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. (-inf, 8)"
