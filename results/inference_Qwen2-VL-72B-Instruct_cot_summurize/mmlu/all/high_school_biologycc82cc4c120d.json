Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. \"It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.\"\n- Enzymes function as biological catalysts to speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. This statement is also true.\n\nC. \"It is operative over a wide pH range.\"\n- Trypsin has an optimal pH range where it functions most efficiently, typically around pH 8.0. Outside this range, its activity decreases significantly. Therefore, this statement is not true because trypsin does not operate effectively over a wide pH range.\n\nD. \"The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate.\"\n- The rate of an enzymatic reaction is influenced by the concentration of the substrate, which is a fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics. This statement is true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is NOT true about trypsin is:\n\nC. It is operative over a wide pH range."
