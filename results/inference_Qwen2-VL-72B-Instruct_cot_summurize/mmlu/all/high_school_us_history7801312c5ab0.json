                    "text": "To determine which change in westward migration is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.**\n   - This option suggests a shift in migration patterns from Oregon to California. Historically, this aligns with the California Gold Rush that began in 1848, leading to a significant increase in migration to California.\n\nB. **The first great wave of migration ended, and the number of migrants remained extremely low until after the Civil War.**\n   - This option implies a decline in migration during the 1840s, which contradicts historical records. The 1840s saw substantial migration, including the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush.\n\nC. **For the first time, pioneers began to settle areas west of the Mississippi River.**\n   - Settlement west of the Mississippi River had already begun before the 1840s. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 opened up vast territories west of the Mississippi, and settlement was underway by the early 19th century.\n\nD. **Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West.**\n   - While some free blacks did move westward, the primary focus of westward migration in the 1840s was driven by other factors such as the search for land and economic opportunities rather than being exclusive to free blacks.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate change in westward migration that likely occurred in the 1840s is:\n\n**A. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.**\n\nThis option accurately reflects the historical shift in migration patterns due to the discovery of gold in California."
