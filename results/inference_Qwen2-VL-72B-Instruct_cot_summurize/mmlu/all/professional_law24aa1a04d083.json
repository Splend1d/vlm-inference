The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nB. No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.\nC. Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\nD. Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.\n"

No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\n\nIn a bench trial, where the judge serves as both the finder of fact and the interpreter of law, the appellate court typically defers to the trial judge's findings of fact, especially when those findings are based on witness testimony. This deference is given because the trial judge has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and assess their credibility firsthand, which is crucial in resolving factual disputes. Therefore, unless there is clear evidence that the trial judge's findings were clearly erroneous or unsupported by the evidence, the appellate court is unlikely to overturn the findings."
