The homeowner gives the friend a mortgage for $100,000.\n2. The homeowner gives the investor a mortgage for $80,000.\n3. The friend records his mortgage.\n4. The homeowner gives the bank a mortgage for $50,000.\n5. The investor records his mortgage.\n6. The bank records its mortgage.\n\nThe recording statute states that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. This means that the priority of the mortgages is determined by the order in which they were recorded.\n\nLet's break down the recording order:\n- The friend's mortgage was recorded first.\n- The investor's mortgage was recorded second.\n- The bank's mortgage was recorded third.\n\nSince the friend's mortgage was recorded first, it has the highest priority. The investor's mortgage is second in priority, and the bank's mortgage is third.\n\nNow let's calculate the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the property ($160,000):\n\n1. First, the friend's mortgage of $100,000 must be satisfied.\n2. After paying off the friend's mortgage, there will be $60,000 remaining ($160,000 - $100,000).\n3. Next, the investor's mortgage of $80,000 must be satisfied. However, since only $60,000 remains after paying the friend, the investor will receive $60,000.\n4. There will be no funds left for the bank's mortgage of $50,000.\n\nTherefore, the friend should receive the full amount of his mortgage, which is $100,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. $100,000. 00"
