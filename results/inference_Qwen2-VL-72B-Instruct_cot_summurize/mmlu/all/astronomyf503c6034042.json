This law states that the square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n\nMathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n\\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nIf the Earth's distance from the Sun is increased by a factor of 3, then \\( a_{\\text{new}} = 3a_{\\text{original}} \\).\n\nLet \\( T_{\\text{original}} \\) be the original orbital period of the Earth around the Sun (1 year), and let \\( T_{\\text{new}} \\) be the new orbital period after moving to the new orbit.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{T_{\\text{new}}}{T_{\\text{original}}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_{\\text{new}}}{a_{\\text{original}}} \\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{T_{\\text{new}}}{1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3a_{\\text{original}}}{a_{\\text{original}}} \\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ \\left( T_{\\text{new}} \\right)^2 = 3^3 \\]\n\\[ \\left( T_{\\text{new}} \\right)^2 = 27 \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{new}} = \\sqrt{27} \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{new}} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\approx 5.196 \\]\n\nTherefore, the new orbital period would be approximately 5.2 times longer than the original period.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. about 5.2 times longer"
