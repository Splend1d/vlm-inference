The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\n\nIn legal proceedings, business records such as bank deposit and tally records are generally admissible under the hearsay exception for business records if they meet certain criteria. However, these records typically need to be authenticated by a qualified individual who can attest to their accuracy and reliability. This authentication can be done through live testimony or a written certification that complies with the relevant rules of evidence. Without proper authentication, the court is likely to find the evidence inadmissible due to concerns about its authenticity and reliability."
