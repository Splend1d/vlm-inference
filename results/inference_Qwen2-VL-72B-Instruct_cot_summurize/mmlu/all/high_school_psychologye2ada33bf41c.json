The study involved deceiving participants into believing they were administering painful electric shocks to another person, which led to significant stress and discomfort for many participants. This raises serious concerns about the ethical treatment of human subjects in research. While issues related to informed consent, sampling procedures, and anonymity are also important considerations in research ethics, the primary ethical criticism of Milgram's study focuses on the potential for causing psychological harm."
