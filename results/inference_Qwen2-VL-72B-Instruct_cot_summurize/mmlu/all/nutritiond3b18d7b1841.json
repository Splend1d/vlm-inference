The migrating motor complex (MMC) is actually involved in the clearance of undigested material from the small intestine when there is no food present, not primarily responsible for peristaltic movement after a meal.\n\nB. Insulin release after eating a meal does not directly slow the emptying of the stomach. Insulin is more involved in regulating blood sugar levels rather than directly affecting stomach emptying.\n\nC. At the start of a meal, the stomach indeed increases its tone to help with the mixing and digestion of food, but it is not specifically to develop pressure for expulsion via the pylorus. The primary function of increased tone is to aid in the breakdown and mixing of food.\n\nD. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum can indeed slow intestinal motility. This is because these substances trigger the release of hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK), which slow down gastric emptying and intestinal motility to allow for proper digestion and absorption.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility."
