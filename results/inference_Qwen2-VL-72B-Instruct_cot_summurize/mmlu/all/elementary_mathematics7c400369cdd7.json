From the lists above, we see that 75 and 150 are common multiples. The smallest one is 75.\n\nTherefore, Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time after 75 minutes from the start time of 6:00 a.m.\n\nAdding 75 minutes to 6:00 a.m.:\n6:00 a.m. + 75 minutes = 7:15 a.m.\n\nSo, the next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time is at 7:15 a.m.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 7:15 a.m."
