The glass also allows viewers to see the sculptures without touching them.\n\nB. **On a series of pedestals**: While pedestals elevate the sculptures and make them more visible, they do not offer any protection from accidental touches or environmental factors.\n\nC. **On wall-mounted shelves with sturdier works around them**: This option might provide some protection by surrounding the fragile works with sturdier ones, but it still leaves the sculptures exposed to potential damage from direct contact.\n\nD. **In shadow boxes with signs that read \"Do Not Touch\"**: Shadow boxes provide a level of protection similar to glass-paneled cases, but the effectiveness depends on how well the sign is heeded by visitors. Signs alone may not prevent all instances of accidental or intentional contact.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most secure method for displaying fragile works of sculpture would be:\n\n**A. In glass-paneled cases**\n\nThis option offers the best combination of visibility and protection for the fragile sculptures."
