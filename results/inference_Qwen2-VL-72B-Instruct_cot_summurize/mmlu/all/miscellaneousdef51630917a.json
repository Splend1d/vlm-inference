                    "text": "To determine which sequence of events is consistent with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone.**\n   - This scenario describes an igneous process where lava cools and solidifies to form rock. Sandstone, however, is a sedimentary rock formed from the accumulation and cementation of sand-sized particles. Therefore, this option is inconsistent.\n\nB. **The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.**\n   - This scenario describes a sedimentary process where the lowering of water levels leads to the formation of a beach. Beaches typically consist of sand, which can accumulate and lithify into sandstone. This is consistent with the formation of sandstone above shale.\n\nC. **One-celled organisms developed a colony on the seafloor. Shells made by these organisms accumulated and lithified, forming the sandstone.**\n   - This scenario describes the formation of limestone or a similar biogenic sedimentary rock rather than sandstone. Sandstone is not typically formed from the accumulation of shells but from sand-sized particles.\n\nD. **Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.**\n   - This scenario involves metamorphism, which transforms existing rocks into new ones under high temperature and pressure conditions. Sandstone is not typically formed through metamorphism; it forms through sedimentation and lithification.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the most consistent sequence of events with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale is:\n\n**B. The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.**\n\nThis option correctly describes a sedimentary process that could lead to the formation of sandstone above shale."
