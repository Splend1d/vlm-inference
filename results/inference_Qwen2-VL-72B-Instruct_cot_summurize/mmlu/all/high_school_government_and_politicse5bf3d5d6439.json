It just means they might not represent every single viewpoint.\n\nC. **the minority party controls nearly half of all committees**\n   - This statement is factually incorrect as the majority party typically controls most committees. Even if it were true, it wouldn't directly explain why committee opinions diverge from public opinion.\n\nD. **committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists**\n   - This implies that committee members might prioritize the interests of lobbyists over those of their constituents, leading to opinions that do not align with public sentiment.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most compelling reason for why the opinions of congressional committees might not accurately reflect public opinion is:\n\n**D. committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists**\n\nThis option directly addresses how external influences can shift committee members' focus away from public opinion."
