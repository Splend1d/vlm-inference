This means that $f(x+20) = f(x)$ for all $x$.\n\nNow consider the function $y=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$. If we shift this graph $a$ units to the right, we get the function $y=f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right)$.\n\nWe want this new function to be identical to the original function $y=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$. This means that $f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$ for all $x$.\n\nThis will happen if $\\frac{x-a}{5} = \\frac{x}{5} + n$, where $n$ is an integer. Solving this equation for $a$, we get $a = 5n$.\n\nThe smallest positive value of $a$ occurs when $n=1$, so $a = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$.\nThe answer is: $5$"
