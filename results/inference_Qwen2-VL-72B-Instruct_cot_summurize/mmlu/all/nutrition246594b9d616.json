Intake only of locally grown food in central Africa\n\nIodine deficiency is primarily caused by insufficient dietary intake of iodine, which is often due to the lack of iodized salt or other iodine-rich foods in the diet. Central Africa is known for having low levels of iodine in its soil, which can result in iodine-deficient crops. Therefore, relying solely on locally grown food in this region could lead to iodine deficiency."
