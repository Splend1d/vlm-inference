She immediately contacted the seller and asked about the quality of the coin. The seller assured her that the coin was in mint condition. The collector then agreed to purchase the coin for $10,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the collector's establishment,\" with payment to be made one week after delivery. The seller stated that the coin would be shipped out at the end of the week. When the collector received the coin, she noticed that the coin had a large scratch across the face. Nonetheless, the collector accepted delivery. Two weeks later, the collector sold the coin to another collector for $12,000. The collector has refused to pay anything to the seller. The seller brought a breach of contract action against the collector, who, in turn, has filed a counterclaim against the seller. Who is most likely to prevail, and in what amount?\n\nA. The collector is entitled to nominal damages, because the coin was received in a damaged condition.\nB. Neither party should prevail, because the risk of loss was on the seller, but the collector did not incur any loss, since she sold the coin for a profit.\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\nD. The seller is entitled to $12,000, because the collector's resale constituted a conversion.\n"

(Free On Board) at the collector's establishment.\n   - Payment was due one week after delivery.\n   - The seller promised the coin was in mint condition.\n\n2. **Condition of the Coin Upon Delivery:**\n   - The collector received the coin with a large scratch across the face, indicating it was not in mint condition as promised.\n\n3. **Collector's Actions:**\n   - Despite noticing the damage, the collector accepted delivery.\n   - Two weeks later, the collector resold the coin for $12,000.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations:**\n   - **Acceptance of Delivery:** Accepting delivery typically signifies that the buyer acknowledges receipt of the goods and may waive certain rights to reject or return them.\n   - **Breach of Contract:** The seller breached the contract by delivering a coin that did not meet the agreed-upon condition (mint condition).\n   - **Resale:** The collector's resale of the coin for a higher price complicates the issue of damages and potential recovery.\n\n### Legal Principles:\n- **Risk of Loss:** Generally, under UCC Article 2, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are tendered for delivery. However, if the goods do not conform to the contract, the buyer can reject them.\n- **Acceptance of Non-Conforming Goods:** If the buyer accepts non-conforming goods, they may still have remedies such as damages for breach of warranty or reduction in price.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the collector accepted delivery despite the coin being in a damaged condition, the collector cannot easily rescind the contract or refuse to pay. However, the collector might argue for a reduction in price due to the breach of warranty regarding the coin\u2019s condition.\n\n**Most Likely Outcome:**\n\n- **Option C:** The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\n  \nThis option aligns with the principle that acceptance of delivery generally obligates the buyer to pay the agreed price unless there is a clear rejection or return of the goods. Since the collector accepted the coin and subsequently resold it, the seller is entitled to the original agreed price of $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the seller is most likely to prevail and is entitled to $10,000."
