The value placed on the owner's skills in an alternative career\n\nAn implicit cost, also known as an opportunity cost, refers to the value of what is given up when a choice is made. In this case, the value placed on the owner's skills in an alternative career represents the income or benefits the owner could have earned if they had chosen to work elsewhere instead of running their own store. This is an implicit cost because it is not directly paid out in monetary terms but represents a foregone opportunity.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not implicit costs:\n\nA. The wage that is paid to the assistant manager - This is an explicit cost because it involves a direct payment of money.\n\nB. The cost of purchasing canned goods from a wholesale food distributor - This is also an explicit cost because it involves a direct financial transaction.\n\nD. The cost of cooling the refrigerated meat display - This is an explicit cost because it involves paying for electricity or other resources used to maintain the refrigeration system."
