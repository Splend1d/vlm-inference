The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company.

Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.**\n\n- **Privity of estate:** This refers to the direct relationship between the landlord (property owner) and tenant (shopkeeper).\n- **Privity of contract:** This refers to the contractual relationship between the landlord and tenant as established by the lease agreement.\n\nGiven that the property owner leased the building to the shopkeeper directly, both privity of estate and privity of contract exist between them. This statement is correct.\n\n**B. Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.**\n\n- **Privity of estate:** This would imply that the shopkeeper is the landlord and the corporation is the tenant.\n- **Privity of contract:** This would imply that there is a lease agreement between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n\nThe shopkeeper leased the premises to the corporation, so both privity of estate and privity of contract exist between them. This statement is correct.\n\n**C. Privity of estate, but not privity of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.**\n\n- **Privity of estate:** The corporation is not leasing directly from the property owner; it is leasing from the shopkeeper. Therefore, there is no privity of estate between the property owner and the corporation.\n- **Privity of contract:** Similarly, since the corporation is not contracting directly with the property owner, there is no privity of contract between them.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the corporation.\n\n**D. Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.**\n\n- **Privity of estate:** The nonprofit organization is leasing from the corporation, not the property owner. Thus, there is no privity of estate between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n- **Privity of contract:** Since the nonprofit organization is not contracting directly with the property owner, there is no privity of contract between them.\n\nThis statement is correct because neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that is not correct regarding the legal relationships of the various parties is:\n\n**C. Privity of estate, but not privity of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.**"
