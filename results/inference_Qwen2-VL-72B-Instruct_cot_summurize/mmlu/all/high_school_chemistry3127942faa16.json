This means they become isoelectronic with a noble gas, meaning they have the same number of electrons as the noble gas. This stability is achieved by filling their outermost electron shell, making option C the correct choice.\n\nOptions A and D are not generally true for all monatomic ions of representative elements. Solubility can vary greatly depending on the specific ion and the solvent in question. Highly colored ions are more commonly associated with transition metal ions rather than monatomic ions of representative elements.\n\nOption B is also not accurate for all monatomic ions of representative elements. While some may be electronegative, this property varies significantly across the periodic table and is not a defining characteristic of monatomic ions from representative elements."
