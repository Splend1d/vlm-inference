They could even exacerbate tensions.\n\nC. \"each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.\"\n- This option highlights mutual dependency, which can create a balance and temper the adversarial nature because both groups need each other to achieve their goals.\n\nD. \"very few media outlets will cover a story that is embarrassing to a political leader.\"\n- This implies a bias in media coverage but does not explain why the adversarial nature is tempered. It might reduce negative stories but doesn't address the core dynamic between the two groups.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.\n\nThis option best explains how the adversarial nature is tempered due to mutual reliance."
