All of the above.\n\nCharles Lyell's principle of uniformitarianism, which posits that the same natural laws and processes that operate in the universe now have always operated in the universe in the past and apply everywhere in the universe, led him to conclude that the Earth must be extremely old. This conclusion was based on observations that many geological processes, such as erosion, occur very slowly over long periods of time. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as all of the options A, B, and C contribute to Lyell's argument for an ancient Earth."
