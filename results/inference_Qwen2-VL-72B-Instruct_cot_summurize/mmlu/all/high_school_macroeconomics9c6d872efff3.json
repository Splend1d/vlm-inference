The promise of the U.S. government to maintain its value\n\nThe U.S. dollar is a fiat currency, meaning its value is not backed by physical commodities like gold or silver but rather by the trust and confidence in the U.S. government's ability to manage the economy and maintain the currency's value. This is often referred to as \"full faith and credit\" of the government. The Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of the United States, plays a crucial role in managing monetary policy to ensure the stability of the dollar."
