This means that we have obligations towards animals not because they have intrinsic moral worth or rights, but rather because of the impact our actions towards them can have on other morally significant beings, such as humans. Carruthers argues that animals do not have intrinsic moral status or rights, but we still have responsibilities towards them due to the consequences of our actions on human welfare and interests."
