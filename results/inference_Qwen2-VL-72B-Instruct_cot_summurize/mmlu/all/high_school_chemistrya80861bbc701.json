                    "text": "B. This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate (KClO4) dissolves in water and the temperature of the resultant solution decreases, it indicates that the dissolution process is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surroundings. The decrease in temperature suggests that energy is being taken up by the system, which is characteristic of an endothermic reaction.\n\nThe spontaneity of a process can be determined by considering both enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S) changes. For a process to be spontaneous at constant temperature and pressure, the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) must be negative:\n\n\\[ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S \\]\n\nSince the dissolution of KClO4 in water is endothermic (\\( \\Delta H > 0 \\)), for the process to be spontaneous, there must be a significant increase in entropy (\\( \\Delta S > 0 \\)) to compensate for the positive enthalpy change. Therefore, the dissolution process is spontaneous due to an increase in entropy.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is:\nB. This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase."
