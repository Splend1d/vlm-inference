This includes evaluating the clarity of the thesis statement, the organization and coherence of the essay, the relevance and sufficiency of supporting evidence, the effectiveness of argumentation or explanation, and the appropriateness of language use. While aspects such as error count, sentence complexity, and discourse modes may be considered, they are usually not the sole focus of a holistic evaluation. Instead, these elements contribute to the overall assessment of how well the student has addressed the topic and communicated their ideas effectively."
