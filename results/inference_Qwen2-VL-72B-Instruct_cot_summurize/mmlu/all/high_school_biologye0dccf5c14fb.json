Amino acid synthesis could have been stimulated by volcanic eruption.\n- This statement is also considered plausible because volcanic activity could have provided the necessary energy and conditions for the synthesis of amino acids.\n\nC. The first cells formed about 3.5 billion years ago, according to the fossil record.\n- This statement is consistent with current scientific understanding based on fossil evidence.\n\nD. The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules.\n- This statement is incorrect. In fact, the early Earth had very little free oxygen in its atmosphere. Free oxygen would have been detrimental to the formation of organic molecules because it can oxidize and break down these compounds. Instead, the lack of free oxygen allowed for the accumulation of organic molecules that eventually led to the formation of life.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct about ancient Earth is:\n\nD. The presence of free oxygen facilitated the rapid formation of organic molecules."
