An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\nB. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.\nC. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.\nD. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n"

No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n\nIn criminal law, the concept of \"willfulness\" generally implies an intentional violation of the law. However, in some cases, courts may infer willfulness and knowledge from the defendant's actions and circumstances surrounding those actions. In this scenario, the habitual practice of transporting large amounts of cash across the border without reporting it can be seen as evidence that the owner acted with willful disregard for the law, even if he claims ignorance of the specific legal requirement.\n\nTherefore, the federal appellate court is unlikely to reverse the conviction based on the habitual nature of the owner's actions, which suggest a deliberate and repeated violation of the law."
