On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, \"I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The landscaper replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?\n\nA. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n"

The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\n\nHere's why: A bilateral contract involves mutual promises between two parties, where each party promises to do something in exchange for the other party's promise. In this scenario, the homeowner promised to pay $10,000 upon completion of the landscaping work by May 1, and the landscaper promised to complete the work by that deadline. Both parties exchanged promises, making it a bilateral contract."
