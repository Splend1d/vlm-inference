However, if we consider the most common perspectives in discussions about drug policy, option C appears to reflect a stance often associated with harm reduction strategies, where personal use might be decriminalized while commercial activities remain illegal to control distribution and quality.\n\nTherefore, the best characterization of de Marneffe's view, based on typical discussions around drug policy, would be:\n\n**C. The use of drugs should be legal, but the sale and manufacturing of them should be illegal.**"
