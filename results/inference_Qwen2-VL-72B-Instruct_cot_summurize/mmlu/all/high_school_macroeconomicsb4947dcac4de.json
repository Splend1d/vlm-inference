When products improve in quality, the CPI may not fully account for these improvements, leading to an overestimation of the inflation rate. This is because the CPI does not adjust for changes in product quality or the introduction of new products that offer better value. As a result, the measured price increases may appear larger than they actually are in terms of the purchasing power of consumers."
