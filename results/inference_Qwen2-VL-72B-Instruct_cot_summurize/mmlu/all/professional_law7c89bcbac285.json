The man signed an agreement with the facility that he would attend weekly classes at the facility for six months and would pay $500 on the first of each month. Upon signing the contract, the man made his first payment of $500 and attended the weekly class sessions. On the first day of the second month, the man once again made his $500 payment and continued to attend the session. At the start of the third month, the man told the director of the facility's accounting office that he was having financial difficulties, and asked for an extension. The director agreed to permit the man to attend classes while the man tried to get the money to pay the facility. One week later, the man received a letter from the facility informing him that he would be barred from attending any further classes unless the next $500 payment was made. Is the facility justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes?\n\nA. No, because by permitting the man to attend classes without having paid the third monthly installment, the facility waived its right to have that installment fee paid on time.\nB. No, because the facility's allowing the man to attend classes without paying the third monthly installment created an implied contract, thus permitting him to complete the classes without advance payment of the installments.\nC. Yes, because the man's failure to make the third monthly installment payment constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.\n"

Yes, because there was no consideration to extinguish the payment of the third monthly installment fee, which was a material part of the contract.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the man had entered into a contract with the facility to attend weekly classes for six months and agreed to pay $500 on the first of each month. This agreement constitutes a binding contract where the man's obligation to pay the monthly fees is a material term. When the man failed to make the third monthly payment, he breached this material term of the contract.\n\nWhile the facility initially allowed the man to continue attending classes despite his financial difficulties, this does not necessarily waive their right to enforce the terms of the original contract. The facility's decision to allow the man to attend classes without immediate payment can be seen as a temporary accommodation rather than a permanent modification of the contract terms. There was no formal renegotiation or new agreement that would constitute a waiver or an implied contract.\n\nTherefore, the facility is justified in refusing to permit the man to attend classes until the third monthly installment is paid, as the payment is a material part of the contract and the man has not provided any consideration (such as a new agreement or payment plan) to extinguish this obligation."
