Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication. The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?\n\nA. Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nB. Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.\nC. Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\nD. Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.\n"

Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\n\nA Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is incorrectly not rejected, meaning that the test fails to detect an effect that is actually present. In this context, if Heartaid is indeed more effective than the current medication but the study does not find sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, then the conclusion would be that there is no significant difference in effectiveness between the two medications. As a result, patients would continue using the current medication, potentially missing out on the benefits of the more effective Heartaid."
