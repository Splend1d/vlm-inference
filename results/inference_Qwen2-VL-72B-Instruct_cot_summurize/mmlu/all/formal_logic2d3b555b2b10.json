It states that Leo ('l') is taller than Cathy ('c').\nB. **Tcl**: This would mean Cathy ('c') is taller than Leo ('l'), which contradicts the original statement.\nC. **lTc**: This does not follow the correct structure for the predicate 'Txy'. The correct format should be 'Tlc'.\nD. **cTl**: This also means Cathy ('c') is taller than Leo ('l'), which again contradicts the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\n**Final answer: A. Tlc**"
