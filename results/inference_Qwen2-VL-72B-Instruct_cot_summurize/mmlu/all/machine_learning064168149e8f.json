Therefore, it is true that ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\n\n**Statement 2: Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.**\n- Caltech-101 is another image dataset but is significantly smaller compared to ImageNet.\n- ImageNet contains over 14 million images, while Caltech-101 contains around 9,000 images.\n- Therefore, this statement is false because ImageNet has many more images than Caltech-101.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
