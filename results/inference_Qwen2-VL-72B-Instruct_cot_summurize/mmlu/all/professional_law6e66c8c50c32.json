After approving the license to the utility company, the city council then passed a measure by which the utility company was required to insert in its monthly billing statements a letter from a private consumer group criticizing the high cost of electrical service. The cost of printing and mailing the monthly letter was paid entirely by the consumer group. Nonetheless, the utility company vehemently objected to having such a critical letter enclosed in their monthly billing statements. However, the city council warned the utility company that unless it complied with the directive, the city would revoke its license for electrical service. The utility company filed suit in federal court seeking a hearing prior to its license being revoked by the city council. Which of the following constitutional provisions would provide the utility company with the strongest grounds with which to challenge the city council measure?\n\nA. The due process clause.\nB. The equal protection clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

The due process clause.\n\nThe due process clause of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals and businesses from arbitrary government actions that deprive them of life, liberty, or property without fair procedures. In this case, the utility company could argue that the city council's measure, which forces the company to include a critical letter in its billing statements, constitutes an infringement on its property rights (the use of its billing statements) without due process. This could be seen as an arbitrary imposition that affects the company's business operations and reputation without providing adequate procedural safeguards or justification."
