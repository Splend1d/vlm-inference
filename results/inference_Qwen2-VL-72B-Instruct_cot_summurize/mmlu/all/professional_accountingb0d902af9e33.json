However, on the accrual basis, all credit sales ($5600) are recognized as revenue when they occur, regardless of when the cash is collected.\n\n   Increase due to credit sales = $5600 (accrual basis) - $1900 (cash basis) = $3700\n\n2. **Accrued Salaries**: On the cash basis, expenses are recognized only when cash is paid. Since no payment was made in January, there would be no expense recorded under the cash basis. However, on the accrual basis, the accrued salaries ($1200) are recognized as an expense when they are earned by employees, even if not yet paid.\n\n   Increase due to accrued salaries = $0 (cash basis) - $1200 (accrual basis) = -$1200 (a decrease)\n\nCombining these adjustments:\n- Increase due to credit sales: $3700\n- Decrease due to accrued salaries: -$1200\n\nNet increase = $3700 - $1200 = $2500\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $2,500"
