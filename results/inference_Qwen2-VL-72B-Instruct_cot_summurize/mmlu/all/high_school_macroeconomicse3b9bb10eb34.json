Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. For an event to affect GDP, it must involve the production or sale of goods and services that are counted in the economy's output.\n\n- Option A involves a transaction of a used good between individuals, which does not count towards GDP since the car was already included in GDP when it was originally produced.\n- Option B involves government spending on infrastructure, which directly contributes to GDP.\n- Option C describes a situation where goods (music CDs) are produced but not sold. Since they do not generate revenue and are not sold, they do not contribute to GDP.\n- Option D involves an institutional purchase of new goods (computers), which would be included in investment spending and thus affect GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
