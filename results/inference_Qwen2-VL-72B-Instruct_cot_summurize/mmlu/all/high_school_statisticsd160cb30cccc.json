                    "text": "The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects a false null hypothesis. In this case, we want to reject the null hypothesis (H0: \u03bc = 70) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (Ha: \u03bc < 70) when the true mean (\u03bc) is actually 65.\n\nThe power of a test depends on several factors:\n\n1. The significance level (\u03b1): A smaller \u03b1 makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, thus reducing the power.\n2. The sample size (n): A larger sample size generally increases the power because it provides more information about the population.\n3. The effect size: The difference between the hypothesized mean (70) and the true mean (65). This is fixed at 5 in our case.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15\nB. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15\nC. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30\nD. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30\n\nComparing options A and B:\n- Both have the same sample size (n = 15), but A has a higher significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05) compared to B (\u03b1 = 0.01). Therefore, A will have greater power than B because a higher \u03b1 makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nComparing options C and D:\n- Both have the same sample size (n = 30), but C has a higher significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05) compared to D (\u03b1 = 0.01). Therefore, C will have greater power than D for the same reason as above.\n\nNow, comparing options A and C:\n- Both have the same significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05), but C has a larger sample size (n = 30) compared to A (n = 15). Therefore, C will have greater power than A because a larger sample size provides more information and makes it easier to detect differences.\n\nThus, the choice that results in the greatest power of the test when \u03bc = 65 is:\n\nC. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30"
