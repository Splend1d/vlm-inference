The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?\n\nA. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\nC. Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n"

Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.**\n\nIn a motion for summary judgment, the party moving for summary judgment (in this case, the manufacturer) bears the initial burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If the manufacturer's motion fails to present any evidence supporting their claim that the insulation was never used by the worker's employer, the worker can argue that the motion is procedurally deficient and should be denied.\n\nOption A is less effective because it suggests that the worker needs more time for discovery, which may imply that the worker currently lacks sufficient evidence to oppose the motion. Option B is also less compelling because it focuses on the issue of credibility, which is generally not a sufficient basis to deny a motion for summary judgment if the moving party has otherwise met their burden. Option D is inappropriate because it involves making a cross-motion for summary judgment, which is not necessary when responding to a procedural deficiency in the opposing party's motion."
