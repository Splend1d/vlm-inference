The magnetic moment is primarily due to the spin of unpaired electrons.\n\nLet's analyze each element:\n\n1. **Carbon (C)**:\n   - Atomic number: 6\n   - Electron configuration: \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^2\\)\n   - Number of unpaired electrons: 2 (in the 2p orbitals)\n\n2. **Nitrogen (N)**:\n   - Atomic number: 7\n   - Electron configuration: \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^3\\)\n   - Number of unpaired electrons: 3 (in the 2p orbitals)\n\n3. **Neon (Ne)**:\n   - Atomic number: 10\n   - Electron configuration: \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6\\)\n   - Number of unpaired electrons: 0 (all electrons are paired)\n\n4. **Sulfur (S)**:\n   - Atomic number: 16\n   - Electron configuration: \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4\\)\n   - Number of unpaired electrons: 2 (in the 3p orbitals)\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that:\n\n- Carbon has 2 unpaired electrons.\n- Nitrogen has 3 unpaired electrons.\n- Neon has 0 unpaired electrons.\n- Sulfur has 2 unpaired electrons.\n\nSince the magnetic moment is directly related to the number of unpaired electrons, the element with the most unpaired electrons will have the strongest magnetic moment.\n\nTherefore, the element with the strongest magnetic moment is:\n\n**B.
