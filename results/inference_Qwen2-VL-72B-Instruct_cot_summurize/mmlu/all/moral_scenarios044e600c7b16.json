If they were not, it would be wrong.\n- In Scenario 2, depositing a turd in the punchbowl is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSince we don't have information about whether the main character was sober in Scenario 1, we cannot definitively say it is morally wrong without additional context. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nSo, the final answer is C."
