However, West's account focuses more on the dynamics of power and dependency rather than individual responsibility.\n\nB. **They are dominated by their partners insofar as they are not free to do as they please.**\n   - This option aligns well with West's account. It emphasizes the idea that women feel dominated and lack freedom due to their dependence on their partners, which can lead to engaging in undesired sex.\n\nC. **They are actually coerced into having sex.**\n   - While coercion is a form of domination, West's account specifically highlights the subtler forms of domination through dependence rather than overt coercion.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option is incorrect if any of the other options accurately reflect West's account.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate reflection of West's account is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. They are dominated by their partners insofar as they are not free to do as they please.**"
