According to the Global Carbon Project and other reliable sources, the top emitters of CO2 typically include major industrialized nations and those with large populations.\n\nHere's a brief analysis:\n\n- **Canada**: While Canada is an industrialized nation, its emissions are generally lower compared to some of the larger countries.\n- **Russia**: Russia has significant industrial activities and a large population, making it a major emitter of CO2.\n- **Iran**: Iran is also an industrializing nation with substantial oil and gas production, but its emissions are not as high as some of the largest emitters.\n- **Japan**: Japan is highly industrialized and has a large economy, but it has implemented various measures to reduce emissions.\n\nBased on historical data and trends, Russia is known to be one of the top emitters globally due to its large industrial base and extensive fossil fuel use.\n\nTherefore, the country that emitted the most CO2 in 2017 is:\n\n**B. Russia**"
