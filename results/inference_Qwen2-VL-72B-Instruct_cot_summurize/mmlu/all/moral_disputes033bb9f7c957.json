If Ashford's article focuses on this aspect, it would be discussing how the vastness of poverty can paralyze individuals or organizations into inaction.\n\nB. **having to choose between addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice**: This option implies a paralysis due to the difficulty in deciding whether to tackle immediate issues (like providing food or medical aid) or long-term systemic problems (like economic policies or corruption). If Ashford's article deals with this dilemma, it would explore the challenges of prioritizing different types of interventions.\n\nC. **reconciling conflicting moral theories**: This option indicates that the paralysis comes from trying to reconcile different ethical perspectives or principles. If Ashford's article focuses on this, it would discuss the complexities of aligning various moral frameworks to guide action.\n\nD. **having to give up so much of our own wealth in light of Singer's arguments**: This option suggests that the paralysis stems from the ethical demands posed by philosopher Peter Singer, who argues for significant sacrifices to help alleviate poverty. If Ashford's article addresses this, it would deal with the emotional and practical difficulties of adhering to such demanding ethical standards.\n\nGiven these options, the most likely context for Ashford's article to address a particular paralysis would be related to the overwhelming nature of global poverty (Option A), as this is a common theme in discussions about why people might feel helpless or paralyzed in the face of such a massive issue.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**A. the sheer scope of global poverty.**"
