This distinction is often explained in terms of the right to noninterference, which suggests that individuals have a right not to be interfered with or harmed by others. In this context, actively killing someone would be seen as a violation of that person's right to noninterference, whereas letting someone die might be seen as respecting their autonomy and not interfering with their natural course of events."
