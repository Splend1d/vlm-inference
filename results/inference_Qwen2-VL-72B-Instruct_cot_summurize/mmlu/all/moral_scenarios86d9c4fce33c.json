Coupons are intended for use by anyone who has them, and using them does not harm others or violate any common moral principles.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong (invading privacy).\n- Scenario 2 does not involve an action that is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
