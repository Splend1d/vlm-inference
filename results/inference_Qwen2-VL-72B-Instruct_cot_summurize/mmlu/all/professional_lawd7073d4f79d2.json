The items were displayed on a variety of tables and shelves, which were easily accessible to the customers. While the woman was walking down one of the aisles, her attention became focused on a doll that was prominently exhibited on an overhead display shelf. When the woman approached the doll display, she reached up to grab the doll. As she did so, the woman failed to see a baseball lying on the floor. She tripped over the baseball and fell down, fracturing her hip. If the woman asserts a claim against the toy store for her injuries, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply on the issue of whether the toy store was negligent and responsible for the baseball being on the floor?\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n"

                    "text": "The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is a legal principle that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents, especially when the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality or situation that caused the injury.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman is asserting a claim against the toy store for her injuries. To determine if the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies, we need to consider whether the toy store had control over the premises where the accident occurred and whether it is more likely than not that the store's negligence caused the baseball to be on the floor.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.**\n   - Being a business invitee means the woman was legally entitled to be on the premises for the benefit of the store. However, being an invitee alone does not automatically invoke res ipsa loquitur. It must be shown that the store had control over the premises and that the injury was due to their negligence.\n\nB. **Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.**\n   - This option correctly identifies a key element of res ipsa loquitur: the store's control over the premises. If the store had control over the premises and the baseball was on the floor due to their negligence (such as failing to maintain a clean and safe environment), then res ipsa loquitur could apply.\n\nC. **No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.**\n   - This option suggests that someone else might have been responsible for the baseball being on the floor. If another customer placed the baseball there, it would undermine the argument that the store's negligence led to the accident. However, this does not necessarily rule out res ipsa loquitur if the store still had a duty to ensure the safety of its premises.\n\nD. **No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.**\n   - An intervening act typically refers to an independent event that breaks the chain of causation between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injury. If the baseball was placed on the floor by an unrelated third party, it could be seen as an intervening act. However, this would depend on whether the store had a duty to prevent such occurrences and whether they breached that duty.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.**\n\nThis option correctly highlights the store's control over the premises, which is a crucial factor in applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur."
