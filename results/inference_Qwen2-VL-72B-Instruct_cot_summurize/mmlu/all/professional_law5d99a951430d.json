To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\nC. not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.\nD. not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome if the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, we need to analyze the situation based on legal principles related to tort law, specifically focusing on battery and assault.\n\n1. **Battery**: Battery involves an intentional and harmful or offensive contact with another person without their consent. In this case, the graduate vomited over the customer, which can be considered an offensive touching.\n\n2. **Assault**: Assault involves intentionally placing someone in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. However, since the graduate did not intend to vomit over the customer, assault may not apply here.\n\n3. **Involuntary Actions**: If the graduate's actions were truly involuntary due to intoxication, it might affect the liability. However, courts generally do not excuse behavior solely based on voluntary intoxication.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A (prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous)**: This suggests a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the conduct does not seem extreme enough to meet the high threshold required for such a claim.\n\n- **Option B (prevail, because an offensive touching resulted)**: This aligns with the definition of battery. The graduate's vomiting over the customer constitutes an offensive touching without consent.\n\n- **Option C (not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary)**: While the graduate's actions might have been involuntary due to intoxication, courts typically do not excuse behavior resulting from voluntary intoxication.\n\n- **Option D (not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking)**: Lack of awareness about the drink does not absolve the graduate from responsibility for her actions.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely outcome is that the customer would prevail based on the principle of battery.\n\n**Final Answer: B. prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.**"
