It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

It is primarily a hunting practice rather than an agricultural one.\n\n2. **Wolf domestication by the Algonquians**: This involves the process of taming and breeding wolves, which is more related to animal husbandry or domestication rather than crop cultivation.\n\n3. **Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois**: This involves cultivating multiple crops together, which is similar to maize cultivation as both involve growing plants for sustenance and possibly other uses.\n\n4. **Seal hunting among the Inuit**: This involves hunting marine mammals for food and other resources, similar to buffalo hunting, and does not relate to crop cultivation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most analogous activity to maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is mixed agriculture among the Iroquois, as both involve the cultivation of crops.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois**"
