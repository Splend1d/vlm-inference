The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.\n\nSlander, by definition, involves spoken words or gestures that defame someone's character. For a statement to constitute slander, it must be communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff, which implies some form of publication. Even in cases of slander per se, where the harm is presumed and no proof of special damages is required, the defamatory statement still needs to be published to a third party."
