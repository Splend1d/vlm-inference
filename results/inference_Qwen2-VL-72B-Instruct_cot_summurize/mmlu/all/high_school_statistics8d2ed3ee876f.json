This means we need to calculate the probabilities for exactly 3, 4, and 5 hurricanes and then sum these probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each of these probabilities:\n\n1. **For exactly 3 hurricanes:**\n\n\\[ P(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} (0.586)^3 (1 - 0.586)^{5-3} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 3) = 10 \\times (0.586)^3 \\times (0.414)^2 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 3) = 10 \\times 0.205 \\times 0.172 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 3) \\approx 0.353 \\]\n\n2. **For exactly 4 hurricanes:**\n\n\\[ P(X = 4) = \\binom{5}{4} (0.586)^4 (1 - 0.586)^{5-4} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 4) = 5 \\times (0.586)^4 \\times (0.414)^1 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 4) = 5 \\times 0.120 \\times 0.414 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 4) \\approx 0.247 \\]\n\n3. **For exactly 5 hurricanes:**\n\n\\[ P(X = 5) = \\binom{5}{5} (0.586)^5 (1 - 0.586)^{5-5} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 5) = 1 \\times (0.586)^5 \\times (0.414)^0 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 5) = 1 \\times 0.071 \\times 1 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 5) \\approx 0.071 \\]\n\nNow, summing these probabilities gives us the total probability of having at least three hurricanes:\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) \\]\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) \\approx 0.353 + 0.247 + 0.071 \\]\n\\[ P(X \\geq 3) \\approx 0.671 \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match exactly with our calculation, but the closest option is D. 0.658. It seems there might have been a slight miscalculation or rounding difference in the provided options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 0.671, which makes D. 0.658 the closest choice."
