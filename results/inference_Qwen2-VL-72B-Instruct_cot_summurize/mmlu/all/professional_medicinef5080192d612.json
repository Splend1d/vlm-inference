Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is\n\nA. acquired factor VIII deficiency\nB. diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection\nC. hypocomplementemia\nD. malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K\n"

Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors, and its deficiency can result in easy bruising and bleeding, as described in the patient's history."
