These criteria include:\n\nA. The estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome: A stronger association suggests a more likely causal relationship.\n\nB. Evidence that the exposure of interest has appeared before the outcome (temporality): For causation, the exposure must occur before the outcome.\n\nC. Evidence showing that reductions in the exposure level will reverse the risk of the outcome (biological gradient or dose-response relationship): This indicates that changes in exposure levels can affect the outcome, supporting a causal link.\n\nAll these factors contribute to the overall assessment of whether an exposure is likely to cause a health outcome."
