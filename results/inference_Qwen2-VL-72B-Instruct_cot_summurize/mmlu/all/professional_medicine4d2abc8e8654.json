The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant\nB. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through\nC. CT scan of the abdomen\nD. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n"

Given her obesity (BMI of 38 kg/m2), she is at increased risk for gallstone formation.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nA. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluating patients with suspected biliary pathology due to its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting gallstones. It is non-invasive, readily available, and cost-effective. If gallstones are identified on ultrasound, further management can be planned accordingly, such as cholecystectomy if symptomatic gallstones are confirmed."
