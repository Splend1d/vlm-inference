Someone repeatedly buzzes his apartment ringer outside the building, but he doesn't answer it because he is very tired and wants to sleep. Later he hears the door to his apartment being kicked in and he is immediately accosted by a man with a gun, who waves the gun at him and says, \"You are getting me your cash or else.\" The man opens his safe and turns over the money. The perpetrator absconds with the money but is picked up by the police a few minutes later. What common law crimes has the perpetrator probably committed?\n\nA. Burglary and attempted murder.\nB. Robbery and attempted murder.\nC. Robbery, burglary and attempted murder.\nD. Robbery and burglary.\n"

Let's break down each element:\n\n1. **Burglary**: This crime typically involves entering a building unlawfully with intent to commit a felony or theft inside. In this case, the perpetrator entered the man's apartment without permission and with the intent to steal money.\n\n2. **Robbery**: This crime involves taking property from someone through force or intimidation. Here, the perpetrator used a gun to threaten the man and demanded money, which was handed over.\n\n3. **Attempted Murder**: This crime requires an attempt to kill someone, which includes actions that could reasonably result in death. While the perpetrator threatened the man with a gun, there is no indication that they attempted to shoot or otherwise cause serious bodily harm leading to death.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate description of the crimes committed by the perpetrator would be:\n\n**D. Robbery and burglary.**\n\nThere is no evidence provided to support a charge of attempted murder, as the threat with the gun does not necessarily equate to an attempt to kill. Therefore, the correct answer is robbery and burglary."
