While there were some environmental changes, they were not as drastic as those experienced during the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nB. **exploitation of new food resources**: This is a significant aspect of the Holocene epoch globally. During this time, humans began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the development of agriculture. This would include the exploitation of new food resources.\n\nC. **a growth in cultural diversity**: The Holocene saw the spread of human populations across the globe, leading to increased cultural diversity as different groups developed their own unique cultures and practices.\n\nD. **the independent domestication of wheat and cattle**: Wheat and cattle were primarily domesticated in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East, not independently in Australia.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. exploitation of new food resources**"
