The intention behind making friends is not genuine but rather self-serving and potentially harmful to the other person's feelings.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I stayed home because I knew I had a fever.\"\n- This scenario involves taking responsible action to prevent the spread of illness to others. Staying home when sick is generally considered morally right and socially responsible behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
