Since it's already included in the book income, no adjustment is needed here.\n\n2. **Term Life Insurance Premiums**: These premiums are generally not deductible for tax purposes if the corporation is both the owner and the beneficiary of the policy. Therefore, this expense needs to be added back to the book income to reconcile with taxable income.\n\nStarting with the reported book income:\n\\[ \\text{Book Income} = \\$300,000 \\]\n\nAdding back the non-deductible term life insurance premiums:\n\\[ \\text{Adjustment} = \\$20,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Taxable Income} = \\text{Book Income} + \\text{Adjustment} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Taxable Income} = \\$300,000 + \\$20,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Taxable Income} = \\$320,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Prime's current-year taxable income as reconciled on its Schedule M-1 is $320,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. $320,000"
