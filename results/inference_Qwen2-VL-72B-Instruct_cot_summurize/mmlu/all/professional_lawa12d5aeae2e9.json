He did, however, come across a secluded mountain cabin, in which he decided to take shelter for the night. Since the door to the cabin was locked, he broke a window and entered the structure. Once inside, he fell asleep on the sofa. When he awoke the next morning he was hungry. The defendant then found some food in the refrigerator, which he cooked and ate. Before leaving the cabin, the defendant looked around to see if there was anything worth stealing. He opened the door to the bedroom and found a gold watch on the nightstand. He placed the watch in his pocket and left the cabin. The defendant was later arrested and charged with burglary. The defendant's strongest defense would be that\n\nA. he was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\nB. the crime was not completed until the morning hours.\nC. he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\nD. the cabin was empty when he entered it.\n"

If the defendant can demonstrate that he did not have the intent to commit a crime when he initially broke into the cabin (e.g., he was only seeking shelter due to intoxication), this could significantly weaken the prosecution's case for burglary. The subsequent actions of eating food and taking the watch might still expose him to other charges, such as trespassing or theft, but they do not necessarily constitute burglary if the initial entry lacked the requisite criminal intent."
