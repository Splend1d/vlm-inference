If the discrepancy is too small, the recipient may not feel motivated to change their attitude because they do not perceive a significant difference. On the other hand, if the discrepancy is too large, the recipient may reject the message outright due to the perceived threat to their existing beliefs or attitudes. Therefore, a moderate level of discrepancy is optimal for inducing attitude change."
