Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred, and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. Before the term of his lease ended, the tenant discovered that the landlord had not paid his taxes on the property, so he purchased the property through a sheriff's sale. The tenant refuses to make any further rental payments on the property. If the landlord brings suit against the tenant for payment of rent in arrears, he would most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the tenant is estopped to deny the landlord's title.\nB. succeed, because of his security interest in the property.\nC. fail, because the purchase by the tenant vitiated any further contractual obligations.\nD. fail, because the landlord was under a duty to keep the demised premises in reasonably good repair.\n"

This includes ensuring that the roof is watertight and structurally sound. When the storm blew off several roof shingles and caused a leak, the landlord should have taken action to repair the damage promptly. Since the landlord failed to do so, and this failure resulted in additional damage to the property (the parquet floors), the tenant may have grounds to argue that the landlord breached their duty to maintain the premises.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the tenant purchased the property through a sheriff's sale due to the landlord's failure to pay taxes does not necessarily absolve the tenant from their obligation to pay rent. However, the tenant's refusal to pay rent could be justified if they can demonstrate that the landlord's breach of the duty to maintain the property significantly impacted the habitability or value of the property during the lease term.\n\nTherefore, if the landlord brings suit against the tenant for payment of rent in arrears, the landlord would most likely fail because they were under a duty to keep the demised premises in reasonably good repair and did not fulfill that duty."
