However, since I don't have access to real-time databases or the internet, I can provide an educated guess based on typical trends and historical economic data.\n\nHistorically, a significant portion of the world's population lived in low and lower-middle-income countries. In the late 20th century, it was common for around half to three-quarters of the global population to fall into these categories due to widespread poverty and economic disparities.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. 25% - This seems too low given historical trends.\nB. 40% - This is also relatively low compared to what we know about global income distribution at that time.\nC. 55% - This is plausible but might be slightly underestimated.\nD. 75% - This aligns more closely with the typical distribution seen in the late 20th century.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. 75%"
