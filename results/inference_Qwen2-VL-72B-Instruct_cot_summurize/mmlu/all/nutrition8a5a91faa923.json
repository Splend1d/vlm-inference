The mechanism by which non-esterified fatty acids are taken up by cells is by a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport involving fatty acid binding, translocase and transport proteins.\n\nNon-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can enter cells through both passive diffusion and active transport mechanisms. Passive diffusion occurs due to the hydrophobic nature of fatty acids, allowing them to cross the cell membrane. However, for more efficient uptake, especially in tissues with high metabolic demands like muscle and adipose tissue, carrier-mediated transport plays a significant role. This involves proteins such as fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), and other transporters that facilitate the movement of fatty acids across the cell membrane."
