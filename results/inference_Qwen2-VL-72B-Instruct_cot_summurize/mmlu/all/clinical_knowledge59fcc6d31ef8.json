One of the expected side effects of creatine supplementation is an increase in body mass, primarily due to water retention in the muscles. This can lead to a temporary weight gain, but it does not necessarily indicate an increase in fat mass. Creatine helps to draw more water into the muscle cells, which can enhance muscle volume and potentially aid in muscle recovery and growth."
