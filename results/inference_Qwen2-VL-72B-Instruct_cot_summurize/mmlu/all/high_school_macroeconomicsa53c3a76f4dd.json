An increase in government spending with no change in taxes\n\nWhen the economy is operating at full employment, any increase in aggregate demand without a corresponding increase in aggregate supply can lead to inflation. In this scenario, increasing government spending without raising taxes will inject more money into the economy, potentially leading to higher demand for goods and services. Since the economy is already at full employment, it may not be able to produce more goods and services to meet this increased demand, resulting in higher prices (inflation). The other options either do not increase aggregate demand or offset the increase in demand with measures that reduce it."
