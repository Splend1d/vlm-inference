This means \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Independence**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring. For independent events, \\(P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\cdot P(F)\\).\n\nLet's analyze the given probabilities:\n\n- \\(P(E) = 0.32\\)\n- \\(P(F) = 0.15\\)\n- \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\)\n\n### Mutual Exclusivity Check:\nSince \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\) (which is not equal to 0), events E and F are not mutually exclusive.\n\n### Independence Check:\nFor independence, we check if \\(P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\cdot P(F)\\):\n\\[P(E) \\cdot P(F) = 0.32 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.048\\]\n\nSince \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\) matches \\(P(E) \\cdot P(F)\\), events E and F are independent.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**D.
