Reagan's first term military spending pressured the Soviet Union to keep up its international commitments\n\nSome scholars argue that President Ronald Reagan \"won the Cold War\" by significantly increasing military spending during his first term in office. This strategy, known as the Reagan Doctrine, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union economically and militarily, forcing them to compete in an arms race they could not afford. The increased military spending contributed to the financial strain on the Soviet economy, which was already suffering from inefficiencies and mismanagement. This pressure, combined with other factors such as internal dissent and the policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War."
