Pregnancy can cause similar symptoms and may influence the choice of further investigations and treatments. If the patient is pregnant, certain medications and procedures might be contraindicated or require special consideration.\n\nOnce pregnancy has been ruled out or confirmed, further evaluation can proceed based on the results. If the pregnancy test is negative, additional tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), amylase level, or abdominal imaging might be considered depending on the clinical presentation and findings from the physical examination."
