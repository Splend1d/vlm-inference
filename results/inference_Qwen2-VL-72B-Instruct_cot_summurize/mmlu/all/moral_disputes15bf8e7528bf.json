                    "text": "To determine what assumption Mike Pence thinks people who object to Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) make, we need to analyze the context and the core of the question.\n\nSCNT is a technique used in cloning where the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell is transferred to an enucleated egg cell. This process can be used for therapeutic purposes or reproductive cloning.\n\nWhen people object to SCNT, they might argue that it is not in the best interest of the resulting child. To understand the assumption Pence believes these objectors make, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **The parents have good motives.**\n   - If Pence thought this was the assumption, it would imply that objectors believe the parents' intentions are noble but the method itself is flawed. However, this doesn't directly address the concern about the child's well-being.\n\nB. **We can't tell what the motives of the parents are.**\n   - This suggests uncertainty about the parents' intentions. Objectors might argue that without knowing the motives, it's risky to proceed with SCNT because the outcomes could be harmful to the child.\n\nC. **The parents have bad motives.**\n   - This implies that objectors assume the parents are acting out of selfish or harmful intentions. If Pence believed this was the assumption, it would mean objectors are concerned that the child will suffer due to the parents' motives.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option dismisses all previous assumptions, suggesting that Pence does not believe any specific assumption is made by those who object to SCNT.\n\nGiven the nature of objections to SCNT, which often revolve around ethical concerns regarding the welfare of the child, the most plausible assumption is related to the uncertainty or potential harm associated with the parents' motives. Therefore, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**B. We can't tell what the motives of the parents are.**\n\nThis aligns with the idea that objectors are concerned about the unknown or potentially harmful intentions behind using SCNT, which could affect the child's well-being."
