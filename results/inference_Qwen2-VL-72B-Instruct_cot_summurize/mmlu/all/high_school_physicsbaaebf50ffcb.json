                    "text": "To determine the new orbit of the satellite after the collision with the meteor, we need to consider the principles of orbital mechanics and the effects of changes in velocity on the satellite's trajectory.\n\n1. **Initial Orbit**: The satellite is initially in a circular orbit around Earth. This means that its velocity is perfectly tangential to the orbit, and it has a constant speed.\n\n2. **Collision Effect**: The meteor increases the satellite's speed by 1% at point P without changing the instantaneous direction of the velocity. This increase in speed will cause the satellite to deviate from its original circular path.\n\n3. **Orbital Mechanics**: When the speed of a satellite in a circular orbit is increased, it will move into a higher-energy orbit. In this case, since the speed increase is relatively small (1%), the satellite will not escape Earth's gravity but will instead transition into an elliptical orbit.\n\n4. **Elliptical Orbit Characteristics**:\n   - **Apogee**: The point in the orbit where the satellite is farthest from Earth.\n   - **Perigee**: The point in the orbit where the satellite is closest to Earth.\n\nGiven that the speed increase occurs at point P, this point will become either the apogee or perigee of the new elliptical orbit. Since the speed increase causes the satellite to move away from Earth initially, point P will be the farthest point from Earth in the new orbit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.**"
