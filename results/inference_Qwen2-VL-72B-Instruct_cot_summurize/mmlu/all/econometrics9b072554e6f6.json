In this case, we have a system with 4 variables and we want to test the null hypothesis that there are 2 cointegrating vectors.\n\nThe trace test statistic is calculated as the sum of the log determinants of the eigenvalues associated with the cointegrating vectors. Therefore, in order to conduct the test, we need to use the eigenvalues corresponding to the cointegrating vectors.\n\nSince we are testing the null hypothesis of 2 cointegrating vectors, we need to use the eigenvalues associated with the first two cointegrating vectors. These will be the largest two eigenvalues, since they correspond to the strongest cointegrating relationships.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The largest 2 eigenvalues."
