This approach emphasized minimal involvement in international affairs and a focus on domestic issues. The United States often sought to avoid entanglement in European conflicts and maintained a policy of neutrality. However, it's important to note that this isolationist stance evolved over time, particularly with the country's growing global influence and involvement in world wars and other international events."
