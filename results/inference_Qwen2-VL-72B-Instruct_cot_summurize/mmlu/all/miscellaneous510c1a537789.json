This would make Japanese cars cheaper for the US car dealer to import, potentially increasing their profit margins.\n\nB. **A Japanese tourist vacationing in the United States**: An increase in the value of the US dollar relative to the yen would mean that the yen is worth less compared to the dollar. This would make traveling to the United States more expensive for the Japanese tourist, as they would need more yen to purchase the same amount of goods and services in the US.\n\nC. **A worker in the United States beer industry**: The value of the US dollar relative to the yen does not directly impact the worker in the US beer industry unless there are specific trade relationships or cost inputs affected by this exchange rate change. Generally, this worker's situation would remain relatively unchanged.\n\nD. **A Japanese baker buying United States wheat**: If the US dollar increases in value relative to the yen, it would make US wheat more expensive for the Japanese baker to purchase, as they would need more yen to buy the same amount of wheat.\n\nBased on this analysis, the person who would benefit most from an increase in the value of the US dollar relative to the Japanese yen is:\n\n**A. A United States car dealer importing Japanese cars**."
