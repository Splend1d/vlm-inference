Higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers\n\nImport quotas restrict the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, which typically leads to higher prices for consumers as the supply of the good decreases. This also results in a misallocation of resources because domestic producers, who may be less efficient than foreign producers, are protected from competition, leading to potentially higher costs and inefficiencies in the market."
