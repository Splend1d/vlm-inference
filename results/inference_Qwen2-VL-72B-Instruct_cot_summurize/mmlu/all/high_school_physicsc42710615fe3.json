The impulse \\( J \\) imparted by the floor on the ball during the collision is equal to the change in momentum \\( \\Delta p \\) of the ball.\n\nThe initial momentum \\( p_i \\) of the ball just before it hits the floor is given by:\n\\[ p_i = m v_i \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the ball and \\( v_i \\) is its velocity just before hitting the floor.\n\nThe final momentum \\( p_f \\) of the ball just after it bounces back up is given by:\n\\[ p_f = m v_f \\]\nwhere \\( v_f \\) is its velocity just after leaving the floor.\n\nSince the ball rises almost to its original height, we can assume that its final velocity \\( v_f \\) is approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to its initial velocity \\( v_i \\).\n\nThe change in momentum \\( \\Delta p \\) is then:\n\\[ \\Delta p = p_f - p_i = m v_f - m v_i = m (v_f - v_i) \\]\n\nThe impulse \\( J \\) is related to the force \\( F \\) and the time \\( t \\) of contact as follows:\n\\[ J = F t \\]\n\nWe need to find the average force \\( F \\), so we rearrange the equation to solve for \\( F \\):\n\\[ F = \\frac{J}{t} \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial velocity \\( v_i \\) using the conservation of energy. The potential energy at the top is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom:\n\\[ m g h = \\frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 \\]\n\\[ v_i^2 = 2 g h \\]\n\\[ v_i = \\sqrt{2 g h} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ v_i = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\times 3.2 \\text{ m}} \\]\n\\[ v_i = \\sqrt{62.72 \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2} \\]\n\\[ v_i \\approx 7.92 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nSince \\( v_f \\) is approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to \\( v_i \\):\n\\[ v_f \\approx -7.92 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the change in momentum \\( \\Delta p \\):\n\\[ \\Delta p = m (v_f - v_i) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta p = 0.08 \\text{ kg} \\times (-7.92 \\text{ m/s} - 7.92 \\text{ m/s}) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta p = 0.08 \\text{ kg} \\times (-15.84 \\text{ m/s}) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta p = -1.2672 \\text{ kg m/s} \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the average force \\( F \\):\n\\[ F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{t} \\]\n\\[ F = \\frac{-1.2672 \\text{ kg m/s}}{0.04 \\text{ s}} \\]\n\\[ F = -31.68 \\text{ N} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the force, which is upwards (opposite to the direction of the initial velocity). The magnitude of the force is 31.68 N.\n\nNone of the provided options match this result, indicating there might have been an error in the options or in the interpretation of the question. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 31.68 N, not any of the given options A, B, C, or D."
