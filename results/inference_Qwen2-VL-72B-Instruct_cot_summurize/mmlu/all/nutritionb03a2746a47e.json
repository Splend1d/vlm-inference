Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA (non-esterified fatty acid) concentrations.\n   - This statement is generally correct. After a meal, insulin levels rise, which suppresses hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity in adipose tissue. This results in decreased release of NEFAs into the bloodstream.\n\nB. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption.\n   - This statement is also correct. Insulin activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which facilitates the uptake of triglycerides from chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) into adipose tissue during the postprandial state.\n\nC. During the postprandial period, the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favor of hydrolysis of chylomicrons.\n   - This statement is correct as well. In the postprandial state, the liver primarily focuses on processing dietary fats delivered by chylomicrons rather than synthesizing new VLDLs.\n\nGiven that all three statements are correct, the final answer is:\n\nD. All options given are correct."
