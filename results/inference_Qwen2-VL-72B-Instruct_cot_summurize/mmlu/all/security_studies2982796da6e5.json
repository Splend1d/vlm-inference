The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle in international relations that addresses the state's responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It consists of three pillars:\n\n1. The responsibility to prevent: States have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities.\n2. The responsibility to react: When a state is unwilling or unable to protect its population, the international community has a responsibility to take appropriate collective action.\n3. The responsibility to rebuild: The international community has a responsibility to assist affected states in recovering and rebuilding after a crisis.\n\nThe \"responsibility to remain sovereign\" is not an element of R2P, as the principle focuses on protecting populations rather than preserving state sovereignty."
