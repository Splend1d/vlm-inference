For example, \"00\", \"11\", \"0101\", etc.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Turing Machine Acceptance:**\n   - A Turing machine can simulate any computation and has unlimited memory.\n   - It can easily accept this language by comparing the first half of the string with the second half. This can be done by moving back and forth on the tape to verify that both halves match.\n   - Therefore, the language is accepted by some Turing machine.\n\n2. **Pushdown Automaton Acceptance:**\n   - A pushdown automaton (PDA) has limited memory compared to a Turing machine, specifically a stack.\n   - To check if two halves of a string match, a PDA would need to remember the entire first half on its stack and then compare it with the second half.\n   - However, since the length of the string can be arbitrarily long, the PDA cannot guarantee enough space on the stack to store the entire first half for comparison.\n   - Hence, the language is not accepted by any pushdown automaton.\n\n3. **Context-Free Language:**\n   - Context-free languages are those that can be generated by context-free grammars or recognized by PDAs.\n   - Since the language \\( \\{ww\\} \\) cannot be recognized by a PDA, it is not context-free.\n\n4. **Regular Language:**\n   - Regular languages are a subset of context-free languages and can be recognized by finite automata.\n   - Since the language is not context-free, it is also not regular.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. accepted by some Turing machine, but by no pushdown automaton**\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
