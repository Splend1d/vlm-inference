It is necessary to show that every reasonable effort has been made to procure his attendance.\n\nTo establish the unavailability of a witness at trial, it must be demonstrated that all reasonable efforts have been made to secure their presence. This typically involves showing that attempts were made to locate and subpoena the witness, and that these efforts were unsuccessful despite being diligent and thorough. The mere fact that a witness is not present in court or is insane (if living) does not automatically establish unavailability; substantial efforts to bring them to court must have been undertaken and proven futile."
