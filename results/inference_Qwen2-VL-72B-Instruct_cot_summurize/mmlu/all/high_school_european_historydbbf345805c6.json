                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of the passage provided by Otis T. Mason.\n\nThe passage describes the opportunities for studying anthropology in Paris during the Paris Exposition of 1889. It highlights various institutions and activities related to anthropology, such as the Mus\u00e9e and Laboratoire Broca, Bertillon's anthropometric operations, lectures in the \u00e9cole d'Anthropologie, and research facilities in medical schools and hospitals.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Scientific societies needed new ways of attracting members who were less interested in the study of the natural world**:\n   - This option suggests that the field of anthropology emerged due to a need to attract members to scientific societies. However, the passage does not mention anything about attracting members or a decline in interest in the natural world.\n\nB. **There arose a sudden interest in expanding human rights throughout the French colonies**:\n   - This option implies that the field of anthropology was born out of an interest in human rights in French colonies. While anthropology can be related to human rights, the passage does not discuss human rights or colonial interests directly.\n\nC. **Scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe**:\n   - This option aligns well with the historical context of the late 19th century. During this period, European powers were expanding their influence globally through colonization. Anthropology developed as a way to scientifically study and understand different cultures, which fits the description in the passage.\n\nD. **A large influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia arrived in Europe**:\n   - This option suggests that the field of anthropology emerged due to immigration from Africa and Asia. While immigration could have influenced the development of anthropology, the passage does not specifically mention immigration as a driving factor.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe**."
