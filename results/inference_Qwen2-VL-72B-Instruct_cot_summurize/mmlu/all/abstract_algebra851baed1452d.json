                    "text": "To determine the truthfulness of these statements, let's analyze each one individually:\n\n### Statement 1: For every positive integer \\( n \\), there is a cyclic group of order \\( n \\).\n\nA cyclic group of order \\( n \\) is a group that can be generated by a single element and has exactly \\( n \\) elements. The existence of such groups is guaranteed by the fact that for any positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a cyclic group of order \\( n \\). This group is often denoted as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) (the integers modulo \\( n \\)) or \\( C_n \\) (the cyclic group of order \\( n \\)). Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nConsider a finite cyclic group \\( G \\) of order \\( n \\). By definition, \\( G \\) is generated by a single element, say \\( g \\). The order of \\( g \\) is \\( n \\), meaning \\( g^n = e \\) (where \\( e \\) is the identity element of \\( G \\)) and \\( g^k \\neq e \\) for all \\( 0 < k < n \\).\n\nFor any divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\), we need to show that there exists an element in \\( G \\) whose order is \\( d \\). Let \\( d \\) be a divisor of \\( n \\). Then, \\( n = kd \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Consider the element \\( g^k \\). We have:\n\\[ (g^k)^d = g^{kd} = g^n = e \\]\nThis shows that \\( g^k \\) has order at most \\( d \\). To show that it has exactly order \\( d \\), suppose \\( (g^k)^m = e \\) for some \\( m < d \\). Then:\n\\[ g^{km} = e \\implies km \\text{ is a multiple of } n \\]\nSince \\( n = kd \\), \\( km \\) must be a multiple of \\( kd \\), which implies \\( m \\) must be a multiple of \\( d \\). But since \\( m < d \\), this is impossible unless \\( m = 0 \\). Thus, \\( g^k \\) indeed has order \\( d \\).\n\nTherefore, every finite cyclic group does contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This statement is also true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
