The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954) declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional.\n\n2. **Regional Differences**: There were significant regional differences in attitudes toward school desegregation. The South, where segregation was deeply entrenched, generally had much lower levels of support for desegregation compared to other regions of the country.\n\n3. **Approval Rates**: By the late 1960s, national polls showed that a majority of Americans supported school desegregation. However, in the South, support was significantly lower. For example, by the mid-1960s, around 70% of non-Southern whites supported school desegregation, whereas only about 30% of Southern whites did.\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference**:\n   - If 70% of non-Southern whites supported desegregation,\n   - And 30% of Southern whites supported desegregation,\n   - The difference would be 70% - 30% = 40%.\n\nGiven these considerations, the approximate difference in approval of school desegregation from the South and the rest of the U.S. at its peak was around 40%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 40%"
