The aunt, the owner in the middle of the three lots, was an amateur scientist. She began experimentation with electricity, using a lightning rod to conduct her experiments. Frequently, the electrical storms apparently originated in and over the area within which the brother's land is located. Because of this, the aunt would often angle her rod over the fence between her property and the brother's property to maximize her chances of success. After one entire rainy and windy season of experiments, the brother had grown tired of the aunt's lightning-rod intrusions because they interfered with his ham radio operations in his garage. The brother brought suit to enjoin such lightning-rod experiments. At trial, it was found that the aunt had been conducting her activities in the airspace directly above the brother's land. The court should\n\nA. enjoin the aunt's experiments because they constitute an unreasonable interference with the space above the brother's land.\nB. enjoin the aunt's experiments because one does not have the right to engage in such scientific experiment without permission.\nC. not enjoin the aunt's lightning rod experiments if they were necessary to protect her property from the electrical storms.\nD. not enjoin the aunt's experiments because the brother does not own the space above his land.\n"

Enjoin the aunt's experiments because they constitute an unreasonable interference with the space above the brother's land.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal terms, airspace above a piece of land is generally considered part of the property rights of the landowner. This principle is known as \"jus in rem,\" which means the right to use and control one's property. The brother has the right to use the airspace above his land without interference. The aunt's lightning rod experiments, by intruding into the airspace above the brother's land, interfere with his ability to use that airspace for his own purposes, such as operating his ham radio. Therefore, the court should enjoin (prohibit) the aunt's experiments to prevent this unreasonable interference with the brother's property rights."
