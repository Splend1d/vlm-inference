The level of rivalry\n\nThe five forces model, developed by Michael Porter, identifies five competitive forces that shape every industry and help determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths. These forces include:\n\n1. The threat of new entrants (potential for entry into the industry)\n2. The bargaining power of buyers (power of customers)\n3. The bargaining power of suppliers\n4. The threat of substitute products or services (threat of substitute products)\n5. The intensity of competitive rivalry (level of rivalry)\n\nAmong these, the \"level of rivalry\" refers to the degree of competition among existing firms in the industry. This includes factors such as price competition, advertising battles, product introduction, and other strategic moves companies make to gain market share over their competitors."
