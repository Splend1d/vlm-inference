Very restricted replication in the gut\n\nAstroviruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract, causing gastroenteritis, particularly in young children and immunocompromised individuals. They do not typically cause infections in the central nervous system or the upper respiratory tract. The sequence diversity of astroviruses does allow for some variability in their strains, but this is not the defining characteristic of their pathology."
