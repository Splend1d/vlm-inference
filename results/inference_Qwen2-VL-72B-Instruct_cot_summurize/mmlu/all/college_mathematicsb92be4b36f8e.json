For any two distinct column vectors \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) of \\( M \\), the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent.\n   - This implies that no column of \\( M \\) can be written as a linear combination of another column.\n\nB. The homogeneous system \\( Mx = 0 \\) has only the trivial solution.\n   - This means that the only solution to the equation \\( Mx = 0 \\) is \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nC. The system of equations \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\( b \\).\n   - This indicates that for every possible right-hand side vector \\( b \\), there exists exactly one solution \\( x \\).\n\nD. The determinant of \\( M \\) is nonzero.\n   - This means \\( \\det(M) \\neq 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's see how these conditions relate to each other:\n\n1. **Condition A (linear independence of columns)**:\n   - If any two columns are linearly independent, it suggests that the columns do not contain redundant information.\n\n2. **Condition B (trivial solution to homogeneous system)**:\n   - If the homogeneous system \\( Mx = 0 \\) has only the trivial solution, it means that the null space of \\( M \\) contains only the zero vector. This implies that the columns of \\( M \\) are linearly independent.\n\n3. **Condition C (unique solution for every \\( b \\))**:\n   - If the system \\( Mx = b \\) has a unique solution for every \\( b \\), it means that \\( M \\) is invertible. An invertible matrix has a non-zero determinant and its columns are linearly independent.\n\n4. **Condition D (nonzero determinant)**:\n   - A matrix with a non-zero determinant is invertible, meaning it has a unique solution for every \\( b \\). It also implies that the columns are linearly independent.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that conditions B, C, and D are all related to the invertibility of the matrix \\( M \\). Specifically:\n\n- Condition B (trivial solution to homogeneous system) implies that the columns are linearly independent.\n- Condition C (unique solution for every \\( b \\)) implies that the matrix is invertible.\n- Condition D (nonzero determinant) directly states that the matrix is invertible.\n\nTherefore, conditions B, C, and D are all equivalent to each other because they all imply that the matrix is invertible.\n\nCondition A (linear independence of any two columns) is slightly different. While it implies that no two columns are linear combinations of each other, it does not necessarily mean that the entire matrix is invertible or that the homogeneous system has only the trivial solution. For example, if three or more columns are linearly dependent, then the matrix would not be invertible even though any pair of columns might still be linearly independent.\n\nThus, the condition that is equivalent to none of the other four is:\n\n**A. For any two distinct column vectors \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) of \\( M \\), the set \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is linearly independent.**"
