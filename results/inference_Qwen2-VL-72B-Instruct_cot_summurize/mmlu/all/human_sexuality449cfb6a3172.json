Prostaglandins cause the uterus to contract, which can lead to pain. However, the sensation of pain is mediated by highly sensitive nerve endings in the uterine tissue. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because low levels of prostaglandin would not cause menstrual cramps, and an increased oxygen supply to the uterus would not typically be associated with menstrual cramps. Option D is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that frequent masturbation causes menstrual cramps."
