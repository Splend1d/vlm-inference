In democratic states, the legitimacy of securitization depends on public acceptance, and the population has the power to challenge or reject the securitizing discourse through various means such as elections, protests, or media.\n\nC. **The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.**\n   - This statement is generally true in the context of securitization. Once extraordinary measures are taken, they can be used to justify the initial claim of an existential threat, thereby convincing the audience post hoc.\n\nD. **Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.**\n   - While this statement might be true regarding the general nature of decision-making in authoritarian regimes, it does not directly relate to the specific process of securitization. Securitization focuses on how issues are framed and communicated to an audience, rather than the internal dynamics of decision-making structures.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is not directly applicable to the Securitization process is:\n\n**D. Within authoritarian and other undemocratic regimes, the relevant political decision-making is often dominated by the military and political elite.**\n\nThis statement describes the internal structure of decision-making in certain types of regimes but does not pertain specifically to the communicative act of securitization itself."
