It might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful depending on the context and the expectations set by the church, but it does not involve harm or violation of ethical principles.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"At the event, I served alcohol to the high school teachers.\"\n- Serving alcohol to adults (assuming the high school teachers are of legal drinking age) is typically not considered morally wrong. However, if the event is specifically for minors or if there are policies against serving alcohol at such events, it could be seen as inappropriate. Assuming no such restrictions apply, this action is generally acceptable.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not clearly morally wrong under ordinary circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
