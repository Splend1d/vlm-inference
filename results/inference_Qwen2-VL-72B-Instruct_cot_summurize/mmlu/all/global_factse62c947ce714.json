However, when considering the fraction of GDP, smaller economies like Chile might have a higher percentage of their GDP allocated to renewable energy investments.\n\nConsidering the data available from various sources, including reports from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and other reputable organizations, it is often noted that smaller economies can have a higher percentage of their GDP dedicated to renewable energy investments due to their smaller overall GDP figures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Chile**"
