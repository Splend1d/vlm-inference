So, his reading speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reading Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Pages}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ pages}}{10 \\text{ hours}} = 20 \\text{ pages per hour} \\]\n\nNow, to find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book at this speed, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Pages}}{\\text{Reading Speed}} = \\frac{320 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ pages per hour}} = 16 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 16 hours."
