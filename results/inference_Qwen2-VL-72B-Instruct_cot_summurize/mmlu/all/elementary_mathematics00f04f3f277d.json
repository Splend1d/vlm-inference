Surveying the cheerleaders for the home team: Cheerleaders are typically biased towards their own team, so this method would likely skew the results in favor of the home team.\n\nB. Surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team: This method would only capture fans of the visiting team, ignoring those who might support the home team but are not wearing hats or other visible signs of support.\n\nC. Surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets: This method is more likely to provide a balanced view because it includes a mix of attendees who have already decided to attend the game, regardless of which team they support. It captures a broader spectrum of the audience.\n\nD. Surveying people who do not live in the home team\u2019s city: This method would focus on visitors and potentially miss out on local fans who might be attending the game.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate results would come from:\n\nC. Surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets\n\nThis approach provides a more balanced and representative sample of the attendees' preferences."
