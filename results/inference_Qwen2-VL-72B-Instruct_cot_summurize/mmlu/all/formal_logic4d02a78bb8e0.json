H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) (Premise 1)\n2. H \u2228 ~J (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, ~I (Conclusion)\n\nWe will use the method of indirect truth tables by assuming the conclusion is false and then checking if this assumption leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nLet's assume that ~I is false, which means I is true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate Premise 1 and Premise 2 under this assumption:\n\n1. H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J)\n   Since I is true, ~I is false.\n   So, ~I \u2228 J becomes False \u2228 J = J.\n   Thus, H \u2261 J.\n\n2. H \u2228 ~J\n   We have two cases here:\n   - Case 1: H is true. Then H \u2228 ~J is true regardless of the value of J.\n   - Case 2: H is false. Then H \u2228 ~J is equivalent to ~J.\n\nNow, let's check for consistency:\n\n- If H is true, then from H \u2261 J, J must also be true.\n  In this case, H \u2228 ~J is true because H is true.\n  There is no contradiction here.\n\n- If H is false, then from H \u2261 J, J must also be false.\n  In this case, H \u2228 ~J is equivalent to ~J, which is true because J is false.\n  There is no contradiction here either.\n\nSince there is no contradiction in either case, our assumption that ~I is false does not lead to a contradiction with the premises. This means the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Valid"
