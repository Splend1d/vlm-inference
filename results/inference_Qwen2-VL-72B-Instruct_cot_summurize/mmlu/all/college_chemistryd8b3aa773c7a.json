This means that every 6 hours, the activity of the isotope decreases by half.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many half-lives have passed in 24 hours:\n\\[ \\text{Number of half-lives} = \\frac{\\text{Total time}}{\\text{Half-life}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{6 \\text{ hours/half-life}} = 4 \\text{ half-lives} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the formula for exponential decay to find the remaining activity after 4 half-lives:\n\\[ A(t) = A_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\]\nwhere \\( A(t) \\) is the activity at time \\( t \\), \\( A_0 \\) is the initial activity, and \\( n \\) is the number of half-lives.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial activity \\( A_0 = 150 \\text{ mCi} \\)\n- Number of half-lives \\( n = 4 \\)\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\\[ A(t) = 150 \\text{ mCi} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 \\]\n\\[ A(t) = 150 \\text{ mCi} \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\]\n\\[ A(t) = 9.375 \\text{ mCi} \\]\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the remaining activity is approximately 9.4 mCi.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 9.4 mCi"
