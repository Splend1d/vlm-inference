He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\nB. Chvostek sign\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n"

Chvostek sign\n\nThe symptoms described\u2014circumoral numbness, paresthesias in the fingertips, and anxiety\u2014are indicative of hypocalcemia, which can occur post-thyroidectomy due to damage to the parathyroid glands during surgery. The Chvostek sign is a clinical sign that may be present in hypocalcemia. It involves tapping over the facial nerve near the zygomatic arch, which can cause twitching of the muscles on the same side of the face.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally: This would suggest an upper motor neuron lesion, which is not consistent with the described symptoms or the surgical procedure performed.\n\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side: This would indicate a lesion of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), which is unlikely to be related to the described symptoms or the surgical procedure.\n\nD. A drooping left shoulder: This could suggest a lesion of the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI), but it is not consistent with the described symptoms or the surgical procedure.\n\nTherefore, the most likely additional finding on physical examination would be the presence of the Chvostek sign."
