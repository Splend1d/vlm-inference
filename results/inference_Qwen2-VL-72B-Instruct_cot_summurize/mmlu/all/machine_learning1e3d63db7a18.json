It is not possible to comment on the importance of this feature without additional information.\n\nWhile a high negative coefficient indicates that there is a strong relationship between the feature and the target variable (inversely proportional in this case), it does not necessarily mean that the feature should be retained or ignored. The importance of a feature in a linear regression model depends on several factors including the magnitude of the coefficient, its statistical significance (p-value), and the context of the problem. Additionally, other considerations such as multicollinearity, domain knowledge, and the overall model performance should also be taken into account before making decisions about feature retention."
