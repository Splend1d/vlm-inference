This typically involves interaction with a T helper cell (Th cell) that has been activated by an antigen-presenting cell (APC), such as a dendritic cell or macrophage. The APC presents the antigen to the Th cell, which then activates the B cell. This interaction leads to the proliferation and differentiation of the B cell into plasma cells, which secrete antibodies specific to the antigen."
