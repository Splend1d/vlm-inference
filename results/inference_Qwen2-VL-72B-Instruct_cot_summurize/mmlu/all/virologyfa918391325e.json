Rebuilding scientific, medical, and nursing infrastructure and training staff: This can help ensure that there are adequate resources and personnel available to respond to an outbreak quickly and effectively.\n\nB. Early and accurate diagnosis with molecular kits: Rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for containing an outbreak and preventing its spread.\n\nC. Developing effective vaccines: Vaccines can help prevent the spread of Ebola by protecting individuals from infection.\n\nD. Arranging rapid intervention into West Africa with EU and USA army teams: Rapid intervention can help contain an outbreak and prevent it from spreading to other areas.\n\nOverall, a comprehensive approach that includes all of these strategies is likely to be the most effective way to prevent future outbreaks of Ebola."
