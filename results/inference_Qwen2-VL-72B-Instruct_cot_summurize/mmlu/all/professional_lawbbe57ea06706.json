This means that the government cannot favor one religion over another or promote religion over non-religion. The Fourteenth Amendment applies this prohibition to state governments as well.\n\nIn this scenario, the state statute allocates public funds to pay for half of the annual salaries of teachers in private schools, including those that may be religious. This could be seen as indirectly supporting religious education with public funds, which would violate the establishment clause. Therefore, the statute is most likely to be declared unconstitutional under the First Amendment's establishment clause as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment."
