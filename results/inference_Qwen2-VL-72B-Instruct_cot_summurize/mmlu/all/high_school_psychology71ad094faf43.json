According to this theory, emotions have two components: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. In Antoinette's case, her initial physiological response (heart racing) was interpreted first as fear when she thought she was being attacked by ninjas. However, once she recognized her friends and realized it was a surprise party, she reinterpreted the same physiological arousal as happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Schachter-Singer"
