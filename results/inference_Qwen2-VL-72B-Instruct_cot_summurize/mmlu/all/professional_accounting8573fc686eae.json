Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nC. Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nD.

This can occur due to human error or judgment mistakes, such as failing to recognize misstatements in the sample items examined."
