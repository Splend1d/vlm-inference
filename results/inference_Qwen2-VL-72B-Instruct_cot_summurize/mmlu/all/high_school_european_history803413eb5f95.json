Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best explanation for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.**\n   - This option suggests that De las Casas exaggerated the brutality of the Spanish to justify the use of African slaves instead of Native Americans. However, there is no direct evidence in the excerpt provided that supports this claim.\n\nB. **Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.**\n   - This option implies that Columbus portrayed his interactions with the natives in a positive light to make himself look good. His account focuses on giving gifts and trying to convert the natives to Christianity, which could indeed be seen as self-serving.\n\nC. **Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.**\n   - This option suggests that the treatment of the natives worsened over time. While Columbus describes peaceful interactions, De las Casas describes brutal treatment. This could indicate a change in behavior over time.\n\nD. **De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.**\n   - This option suggests that De las Casas wrote about the brutality to persuade the Spanish to abandon the Americas. However, the excerpt does not explicitly state this intention.\n\nGiven the context and the content of the excerpts, the most plausible explanation is:\n\n**C. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.**\n\nThis option aligns with the historical understanding that early explorers like Columbus often sought to establish friendly relations with the natives, while later expeditions focused more on exploitation and conquest."
