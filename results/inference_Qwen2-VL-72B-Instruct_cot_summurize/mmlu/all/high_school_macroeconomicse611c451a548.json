However, if the price level rises due to an increase in aggregate demand (which can happen when the economy is near or at full capacity), this reduces the real value of money and thus dampens the multiplier effect. This is because higher prices mean that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services, which limits the extent to which additional spending can stimulate further rounds of spending."
