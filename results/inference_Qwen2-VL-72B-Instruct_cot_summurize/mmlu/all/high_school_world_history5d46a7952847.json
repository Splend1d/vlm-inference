Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.\n\"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\n\"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n\u2014Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nBased on the passage, which of the following statements correctly describes politics in China during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Reverence for Nature**: The passage mentions that \"the spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility\" when the former kings of Xia cultivated their virtue. However, this does not directly imply that reverence for nature leads to tranquility and peaceful transitions of power. It suggests that virtue leads to harmony, but it doesn't explicitly connect reverence for nature to political stability.\n\n2. **Ruler's Public Actions as an Extension of Private Behavior**: The passage emphasizes the importance of the ruler's virtue and behavior. It states, \"If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\" This implies that both public and private actions of the ruler are crucial for maintaining virtue and avoiding calamity.\n\n3. **Intelligence vs. Ethical Behavior**: There is no mention in the passage that intelligence is valued more highly than ethical behavior. In fact, the passage stresses the importance of virtue and moral conduct over other qualities.\n\n4. **Ministers Supporting All Policies Unconditionally**: The passage does not discuss the role of ministers or their expectations regarding supporting the emperor's policies. It focuses on the ruler's personal virtues and responsibilities.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that best aligns with the passage is:\n\n**B. A ruler's public actions were considered an extension of his private behavior.**\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
