This comparison helps us understand whether the firm is using its inputs efficiently.\n\nGiven:\n- Price of labor (\\( P_L \\)) = $2\n- Price of capital (\\( P_K \\)) = $1\n- Marginal product of labor (MPL) = 200\n- Marginal product of capital (MPK) = 50\n\nFirst, calculate the marginal product per dollar spent on each input:\n\n\\[ \\text{Marginal product per dollar of labor} = \\frac{\\text{MPL}}{P_L} = \\frac{200}{2} = 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Marginal product per dollar of capital} = \\frac{\\text{MPK}}{P_K} = \\frac{50}{1} = 50 \\]\n\nSince the marginal product per dollar of labor (100) is greater than the marginal product per dollar of capital (50), the firm is not using its inputs efficiently. To maximize output for a given cost, the firm should reallocate resources such that the marginal product per dollar spent on both inputs is equal.\n\nTo achieve this, the firm should:\n- Decrease the amount of capital used, which will cause the marginal product of capital to rise.\n- Increase the amount of labor used, which will cause the marginal product of labor to fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls."
