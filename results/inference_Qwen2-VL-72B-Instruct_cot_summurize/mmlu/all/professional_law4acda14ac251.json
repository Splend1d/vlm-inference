The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property. During the trial the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfS' the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n"

Malice cannot simply be inferred from the intent to steal; it must be shown that the defendant acted with a specific intent to cause damage or harm. Therefore, the judge's instruction was incorrect because it improperly conflated the elements of larceny (theft) with those required for malicious destruction of property."
