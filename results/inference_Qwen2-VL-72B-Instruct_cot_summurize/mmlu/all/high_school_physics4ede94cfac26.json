                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement about uniform circular motion is true:\n\nA. **The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Centrifugal force is not an actual force but rather an apparent force experienced in a rotating reference frame. It does not have an action-reaction pair with the centripetal force, which is a real force directed towards the center of the circle.\n\nB. **The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. In uniform circular motion, the centripetal acceleration always points towards the center of the circle, while the velocity vector is tangent to the circle at any given point. They do not point in the same direction.\n\nC. **The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.**\n   - This statement is partially correct. The magnitude of the velocity remains constant in uniform circular motion, but its direction changes continuously. However, the centripetal acceleration is directed towards the center and its magnitude is constant, but it is not accurate to say that \"the acceleration of the object is constant\" without specifying that it refers to the magnitude of the acceleration.\n\nD. **A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.**\n   - This statement is correct. A satellite in orbit is essentially in free fall, where the gravitational force acts as the centripetal force, causing the satellite to move in a circular path around the Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.**"
