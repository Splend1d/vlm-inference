It is important to note that the client retains control over their actions and can terminate the session if they choose to do so. The other statements are either inaccurate or misleading:\n\nA. Hypnosis is generally considered safe for most people when conducted by a trained professional.\nB. While therapists can make suggestions during hypnosis, the client maintains control over their behavior and can choose whether or not to follow those suggestions.\nD. Intelligence does not determine susceptibility to hypnosis; various factors such as openness to suggestion, motivation, and the relationship between the client and therapist play a role."
