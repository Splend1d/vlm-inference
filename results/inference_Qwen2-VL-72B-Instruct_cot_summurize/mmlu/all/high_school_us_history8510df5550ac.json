I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nThe policy advocated by Beveridge foreshadowed which of the following?\n\nA. The rise of the United States to the status of a great power\nB. A period of growing isolationism\nC. A period of laissez-faire economics\nD. Growing support for constitutional strict constructionism\n"

The rise of the United States to the status of a great power\n\nAlbert Beveridge's speech, \"The March of the Flag,\" delivered in 1898, reflects the sentiments of American expansionism and imperialism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Beveridge argues for the United States' capability and right to govern territories beyond its borders, drawing parallels with other imperial powers like England and Germany. His rhetoric suggests confidence in American governance and the inevitability of American expansion.\n\nGiven this context, the policy advocated by Beveridge foreshadowed the rise of the United States as a global power. This period saw the U.S. acquiring territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, and engaging in further territorial expansion and influence in the Pacific and Caribbean regions. Thus, option A accurately captures the essence of Beveridge's vision and its historical implications."
