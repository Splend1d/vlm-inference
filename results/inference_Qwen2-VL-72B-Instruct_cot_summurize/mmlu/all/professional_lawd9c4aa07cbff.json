                    "text": "The scenario described involves a legal inconsistency where the defendant has been found guilty of felony murder but not guilty of the underlying felony (arson). In many jurisdictions, a conviction for felony murder requires proof of the underlying felony. If the defendant is acquitted of the underlying felony, it can create a legal inconsistency that may affect the validity of the felony murder conviction.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.**\n   - This option suggests that the guilty verdict is a plain error affecting constitutional rights. While the inconsistency might be considered an error, it does not necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\n\nB. **granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.**\n   - This option implies that the inconsistency in the verdicts should lead to an acquittal of both charges. However, the inconsistency typically only affects the felony murder charge, not necessarily leading to an acquittal of the underlying felony charge.\n\nC. **denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.**\n   - This option suggests that the inconsistency does not constitute a reversible error. However, in many legal systems, such inconsistencies can indeed be grounds for reversal or reconsideration of the felony murder conviction.\n\nD. **denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.**\n   - This option indicates that the proper course of action would be to seek an appellate review rather than having the verdict set aside immediately. This is a plausible approach as the inconsistency could be addressed through an appeal process.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.**\n\nThis option acknowledges that while there is an inconsistency, the appropriate next step is to pursue an appeal rather than having the verdict set aside outright."
