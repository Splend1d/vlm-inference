Inserting it into a suitable bacterium in order to produce multiple copies.\n\nPlasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome. When a plasmid incorporates specific genes, such as the gene coding for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, it can be cloned by inserting it into a suitable host bacterium. The bacteria will then replicate the plasmid along with their own DNA during cell division, producing multiple copies of the plasmid and the genes it carries. This process is commonly used in molecular biology and genetic engineering to amplify DNA sequences of interest."
