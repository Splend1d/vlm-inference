They argue that a steady increase in the money supply is preferable to using monetary policy for fine-tuning the economy, which they believe can lead to instability.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct from a monetarist perspective:\n\nA. Monetary policy should be used to fine-tune the economy - Monetarists generally oppose the use of monetary policy for fine-tuning because they believe it leads to economic instability.\n\nB. Crowding out is not a problem - Monetarists do acknowledge the concept of crowding out, where government borrowing can raise interest rates and reduce private investment. They would not claim that crowding out is not a problem.\n\nD. The velocity of money is unstable - Monetarists actually believe that the velocity of money (the rate at which money changes hands) is relatively stable over time, which is a key assumption in their theory that links changes in the money supply to changes in the price level and output."
