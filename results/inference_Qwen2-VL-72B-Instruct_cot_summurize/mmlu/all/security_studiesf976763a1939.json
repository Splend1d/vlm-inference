War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC.

States that are experiencing a decline in power might feel threatened and vulnerable, leading them to act aggressively to prevent further loss or to secure their position.\n\nB. In a multipolar system, states might engage in buckpassing, where they rely on others to take action against a common threat, potentially leading to miscalculations and conflicts.\n\nC. When the offense-defense balance favors offense, it creates an environment where states might feel compelled to strike first before they themselves become targets, increasing the risk of conflict.\n\nTherefore, each of these scenarios can increase the likelihood of war according to realist theory."
