Let's break down each option:\n\nA. **Group A members would be more likely to persist in the occupation**\n   - People in Group A have interests highly similar to those of engineers. This suggests they might find the work more engaging and fulfilling, which could lead to higher persistence rates.\n\nB. **Group A and Group B would not differ in success at or satisfaction with the occupation**\n   - This statement implies no difference in outcomes between the two groups. However, if Group A has interests aligned with engineering, they might experience greater satisfaction and success compared to Group B.\n\nC. **Group A members would be more likely to succeed in the occupation**\n   - Given that Group A's interests align closely with those of engineers, it is reasonable to infer that they may have a better understanding and affinity for the work, leading to greater success.\n\nD. **Group B members would achieve levels of success equal to those of Group A, but would do so more slowly**\n   - This suggests that despite having different interests, Group B can still achieve the same level of success as Group A, just at a slower pace. However, the initial premise does not provide enough information to support this claim.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most justified statement is:\n\n**C. Group A members would be more likely to succeed in the occupation**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that having interests similar to those of engineers (Group A) would likely contribute to greater success in the engineering field."
