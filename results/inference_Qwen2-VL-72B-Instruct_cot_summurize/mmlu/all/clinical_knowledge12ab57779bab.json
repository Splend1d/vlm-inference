                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\n- This statement is incorrect. Calcitonin actually decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing calcium excretion in the urine.\n\nB. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\n- This statement is correct. Primary hyperparathyroidism often does not cause symptoms, especially in its early stages. However, it can lead to complications if left untreated.\n\nC. Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\n- This statement is incorrect. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. It is produced primarily in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and is also obtained through diet. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a crucial role in regulating calcium metabolism.\n\nD. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n- This statement is incorrect. Oliguria (reduced urine output) is not typically a symptom of hypercalcaemia. Hypercalcaemia can cause polyuria (increased urine output) due to its effect on kidney function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic."
