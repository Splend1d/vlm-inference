The key phrase here is \"the first and foremost step toward a solution of our environmental problems.\" This suggests that Baxter believes there is a fundamental misunderstanding or misdirection in how we approach environmental issues.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Some optimal state of pollution.\n- This option implies that there is an acceptable level of pollution that is neither too high nor too low. It suggests a balance where pollution is minimized but not entirely eliminated.\n\nB. An overall maximally clean environment.\n- This option suggests striving for the cleanest possible environment, which might be unrealistic and impractical given current technological and economic constraints.\n\nC. Some maximal state of pollution.\n- This option implies allowing as much pollution as possible, which contradicts the goal of solving environmental problems.\n\nD. The preservation of all living species.\n- While preserving biodiversity is important, it doesn't directly address the core issue of pollution and environmental degradation.\n\nGiven these options, the most logical choice aligns with Baxter's view that we should aim for a balanced approach rather than an extreme one. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Some optimal state of pollution."
