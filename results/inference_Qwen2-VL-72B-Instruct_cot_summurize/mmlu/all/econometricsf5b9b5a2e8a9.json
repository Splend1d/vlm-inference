It ranges from 0 to 4, with values around 2 indicating no autocorrelation. Values significantly less than 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, while values significantly greater than 2 suggest negative autocorrelation.\n\nIf the Durbin-Watson statistic is close to zero, it indicates strong positive autocorrelation. Therefore, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient would also be close to plus one.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Close to plus one"
