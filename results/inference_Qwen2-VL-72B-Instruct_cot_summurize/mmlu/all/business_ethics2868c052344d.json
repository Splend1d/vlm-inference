Corporations can be described as \"boundaryless\" because they often operate across various jurisdictions and sectors without clear geographical or operational boundaries. It is difficult to \"control information\" within such entities due to the vast number of individuals involved and the complexity of their operations. Much corporate activity indeed takes place in \"public spaces,\" which can include digital platforms, social media, and other forums accessible to the general public."
