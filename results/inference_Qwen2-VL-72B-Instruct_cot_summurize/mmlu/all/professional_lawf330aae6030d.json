The testimony of the other shopper who experienced a similar issue with the escalator just moments before the woman's accident is relevant because it suggests that there was a dangerous condition or malfunction with the escalator at the time of the incident. This testimony can help establish a pattern of behavior or a defect in the escalator, which is pertinent to proving the mall's liability for the woman's injuries. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as it tends to prove a material fact in the case."
