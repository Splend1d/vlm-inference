Entropy generally decreases when there is a net decrease in the number of moles of gas because gases have higher entropy than liquids or solids.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. \\( \\text{HCl(aq)} + \\text{NaOH(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{NaCl(aq)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)} \\)\n\nThis reaction involves only aqueous and liquid phases, so there is no change in the number of moles of gas.

There is a net decrease of 1 mole of gas, leading to a decrease in entropy.\n\nComparing the reactions, B has the greatest decrease in the number of moles of gas (a decrease of 2 moles), while D has a decrease of 1 mole. Reactions A and C do not involve any change in the number of moles of gas.\n\nTherefore, the reaction expected to have the greatest decrease in entropy is:\n\nB. \\( \\text{CH}_4(\\text{g}) + 2 \\text{O}_2(\\text{g}) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2(\\text{g}) + 2 \\text{H}_2\\text{O(l)} \\)"
