Everest.\n\n1. **Depth of the Mariana Trench**: 35,840 feet below sea level.\n2. **Height of Mt. Everest**: 29,028 feet above sea level.\n\nFirst, we add the absolute values of these two measurements:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance} = 35,840 \\text{ feet (depth)} + 29,028 \\text{ feet (height)} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total distance} = 64,868 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\nA. 6,000 feet\nB. 7,000 feet\nC. 64,000 feet\nD. 65,000 feet\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value of 64,868 feet is:\n\nC. 64,000 feet\n\nTherefore, the best estimate of the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth is:\n\n**C. 64,000 feet**"
