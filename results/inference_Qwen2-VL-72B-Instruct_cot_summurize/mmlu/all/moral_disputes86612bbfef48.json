While this is an important aspect of dignity, it doesn't necessarily imply glorification in a problematic way.\n\nB. **a patient's worthiness of being protected or cared for**: This option implies that dignity is used to highlight the need for protection and care. Again, this is a positive aspect of dignity but does not suggest a problematic glorification.\n\nC. **Western culture's obsession with youth, strength, and independence**: This option points to a cultural bias where dignity might be incorrectly associated with attributes like youth, strength, and independence. This could lead to the exclusion or devaluation of individuals who do not possess these traits, such as older adults or those with disabilities.\n\nD. **none of the above**: This option would mean that Velleman does not worry about any of the provided scenarios.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the question, the most plausible concern Velleman might have is related to how dignity is misused in a way that reflects cultural biases and potentially excludes certain groups. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Western culture's obsession with youth, strength, and independence**"
