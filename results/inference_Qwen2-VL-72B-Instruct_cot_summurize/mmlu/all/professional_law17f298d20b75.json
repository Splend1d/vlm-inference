The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n"

This fact alone does not directly impact the voluntariness or admissibility of the statement unless it can be shown that the defendant requested and was denied access to his attorney.\n\nC. **The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.**\n   - An arrest without probable cause could lead to the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of that illegal arrest under the exclusionary rule. However, this would typically affect physical evidence rather than statements made after proper Miranda warnings.\n\nD. **The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.**\n   - If the defendant did not understand English and the Miranda warnings were not provided in a language he understood, this would likely render the statement inadmissible because the defendant did not knowingly and intelligently waive their rights.\n\nGiven these analyses, the allegation that would be **LEAST** helpful in suppressing the defendant's statement is:\n\n**B. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.**\n\nThis fact alone does not directly relate to the voluntariness or admissibility of the statement unless there is additional evidence showing that the defendant was denied access to counsel."
