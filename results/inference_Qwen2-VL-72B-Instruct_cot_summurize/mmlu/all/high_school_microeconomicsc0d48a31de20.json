Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Enact stricter antitrust legislation**: This primarily deals with preventing monopolies and promoting competition in markets. While it can help maintain fair market practices, it does not directly address the free rider problem.\n\nB. **Provide more complete information about the relevant goods**: This can help consumers make informed decisions but does not directly solve the issue of individuals benefiting from public goods without contributing.\n\nC. **Supply public goods using tax dollars**: This approach directly addresses the free rider problem by ensuring that everyone contributes through taxes to fund public goods, such as national defense or public parks, which cannot be excluded from use by non-payers.\n\nD. **Tax those creating negative externalities**: This is effective for internalizing costs associated with negative externalities (like pollution), but it doesn't specifically tackle the free rider problem related to public goods.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most effective way for the government to avoid a free rider problem is:\n\n**C. Supply public goods using tax dollars**\n\nThis ensures that everyone contributes to the provision of public goods, thereby mitigating the free rider problem."
