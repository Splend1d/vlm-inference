We want to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 10 \\times 2^n \\geq 1000 \\]\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[ 2^n \\geq 100 \\]\n\nNext, solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ n \\geq \\log_2(100) \\]\n\nUsing logarithms:\n\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{\\log_{10}(100)}{\\log_{10}(2)} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{2}{\\log_{10}(2)} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{2}{0.3010} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 6.64 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer (as it represents the number of complete 3-day periods), we round up to the next whole number:\n\n\\[ n = 7 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the total number of days:\n\n\\[ 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nStarting from January 1st, adding 21 days gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{January 1st} + 21 \\text{ days} = \\text{January 22nd} \\]\n\nTherefore, the earliest date when the entire town would be infected with the virus is January 22nd.\n\nThe closest option to January 22nd is:\n\nB.
