Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\nC. Operant conditioning is used to train organisms to perform specific acts, and classical conditioning is used to get organisms to stop performing specific acts.\nD. Classical conditioning is more difficult to use but more effective than operant conditioning.\n"

Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\n\nClassical conditioning, also known as respondent conditioning, involves associating a neutral stimulus with a naturally occurring stimulus to elicit a similar response. For example, Pavlov's dogs learned to associate the sound of a bell with food, causing them to salivate at the sound of the bell alone.\n\nOperant conditioning, on the other hand, involves reinforcing or punishing behaviors to increase or decrease their frequency. This type of conditioning focuses on the consequences of actions rather than the stimuli that precede them. For example, a child might learn to clean their room to receive praise or avoid punishment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus."
