An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC.

                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break down each option and analyze it based on our understanding of osmosis and water potential.\n\n1. **Option A**: \"It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because water moves from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. In the context of osmosis, water will move from the less concentrated (0.5 M) solution inside the dialysis bag to the more concentrated (0.6 M) solution outside the bag.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect because water potential is determined by both solute potential and pressure potential. While solute potential plays a significant role, pressure potential also contributes to the overall water potential.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\"\n   - This statement is correct. Water potential (\u03a8) is indeed determined by the combination of solute potential (\u03a8_s) and pressure potential (\u03a8_p). The formula for water potential is \u03a8 = \u03a8_s + \u03a8_p.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\"\n   - This statement is incorrect. Water potential drives water from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, not solely based on pressure potential differences.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.**"
