However, the amount of ATP stored in muscles is limited and can only sustain high-intensity exercise for a very short period, typically around 2 seconds. After that, other energy systems, such as the phosphocreatine system or anaerobic glycolysis, take over to continue supplying energy for continued high-intensity activity."
