Work sample\n\nWork sample tests are often considered to have the best chance of withstanding legal challenge when adverse impact on a minority group has been observed. This is because work sample tests directly measure job-related skills and abilities by having applicants perform tasks that are similar to those they would encounter on the job. They are seen as highly relevant to the job and less likely to be influenced by cultural or educational biases compared to other types of tests.\n\nProjective tests (A) are psychological assessments that can be subjective and may not directly relate to job performance, making them more vulnerable to legal challenges.\n\nEmpirically keyed tests (B) are based on statistical relationships between test scores and job performance but may still show adverse impact if they are not carefully constructed to avoid bias.\n\nMultiple-choice tests (D) can also be susceptible to adverse impact if they are not designed to be fair and unbiased across different demographic groups.\n\nTherefore, work sample tests are generally viewed as the most defensible in legal terms when it comes to demonstrating job-relatedness and minimizing adverse impact."
