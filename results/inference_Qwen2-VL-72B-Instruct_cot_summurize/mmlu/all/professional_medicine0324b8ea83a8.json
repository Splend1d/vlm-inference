Fibromyalgia\n\nFibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. The presence of multiple bilateral tender points in specific areas such as the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. Additionally, normal radiograph findings and laboratory studies further support this diagnosis, as fibromyalgia does not typically present with abnormal imaging or lab results."
