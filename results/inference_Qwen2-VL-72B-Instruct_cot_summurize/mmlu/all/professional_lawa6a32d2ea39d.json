The tutor sent the law student a copy of the tutor's standard tutorial agreement. The agreement stated that the tutor's rate was $50 per one-hour session. The law student then telephoned the tutor and said, \"This agreement looks fine to me. I'd like you to give me 10 sessions over the next 10 days. \" The tutor replied, That will be fine. Fill in 10 sessions on the agreement, sign it, and bring it to me tomorrow when we have our first session. \" The student then said, \"I want you to really push me to do my best. In fact, if I get an A in any class I'll pay you an additional $100 for each A. \"The next day, the law student brought the signed agreement to the tutorial session. The tutor conducted all 10 sessions. Two weeks later, when the results of the finals were released, the law student excitedly called the tutor and exclaimed, \"Thank you so much I just found out that I received two A's and two B's in my classes!\" The tutor then sent the law student a bill for $700. Two days later the tutor received a check from the law student in the amount of $500. Included with the check was a note which read, \"You taught me contract law very well. I now know that I am not obligated to pay you the additional $200 for the A's, because that was just a gratuitous promise. \" On the back of the check the law student typed the following:\"Endorsement of this check by payee constitutes surrender of all claims against me arising out of our tutorial arrangement. \"In need of money, the tutor endorsed and cashed the check. What is the probable legal effect of the tutor's endorsement of the check?\n\nA. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\nB. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\nC. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.\nD. Part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the probable legal effect of the tutor's endorsement of the check, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Nature of the Tutoring Agreement:**\n   - The original agreement specified a rate of $50 per hour for 10 sessions, totaling $500.\n   - The law student's additional promise to pay $100 for each A grade received was not included in the written agreement.\n\n2. **Legal Principles Involved:**\n   - **Liquidated Claim:** A claim where the amount owed is fixed or determinable.\n   - **Unliquidated Claim:** A claim where the amount owed is uncertain or not yet determined.\n   - **Accord and Satisfaction:** This occurs when there is a dispute over the amount owed, and the parties agree to settle for a lesser amount, which is then paid and accepted.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Tutor's Endorsement:**\n   - The tutor endorsed and cashed a check for $500, which was less than the claimed total of $700 ($500 + $200).\n   - The note attached to the check explicitly states that endorsing the check constitutes surrender of all claims against the law student arising out of the tutorial arrangement.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.**\n- The $500 is a liquidated claim (fixed amount based on the tutoring sessions). However, the tutor's claim also includes the unliquidated claim of $200 for the A grades. Thus, this option doesn't fully address the unliquidated portion.\n\n**B. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.**\n- Accord and satisfaction typically involves a dispute over the amount owed, and the parties agree to settle for a lesser amount. Here, the tutor and student had a dispute over the additional $200 for the A grades (unliquidated claim). By endorsing the check, the tutor agreed to accept $500 as full settlement, which aligns with the concept of accord and satisfaction.\n\n**C. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.**\n- This statement is generally true but doesn't apply here since the tutor endorsed the check with the explicit understanding that it discharges all claims.\n\n**D. Part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.**\n- While part payment alone might not suffice, the endorsement of the check with the explicit note stating surrender of all claims indicates acceptance of the $500 as full settlement.\n\nConsidering the explicit note attached to the check and the tutor's endorsement, the most accurate interpretation is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.**"
