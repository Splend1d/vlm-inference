The PRF is not the estimated model; it is the theoretical relationship between variables that we aim to estimate with the SRF.\n- B. We use the SRF to infer likely values of the PRF, not the other way around.\n- C. Whether the model is good cannot be determined by comparing the SRF and the PRF directly because the PRF is unknown in practice; we assess the goodness of fit using statistical tests and diagnostics on the SRF.\n- D. This statement accurately describes the PRF as it represents the underlying relationship or process that we hypothesize exists between the variables in our data."
