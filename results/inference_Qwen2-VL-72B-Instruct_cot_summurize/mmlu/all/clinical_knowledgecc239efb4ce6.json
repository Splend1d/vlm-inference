The knee joint is actually a hinge joint, not a ball and socket joint.\n\nB. A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee.\n- This statement is incorrect. A Baker's cyst is typically found posterior to the knee, not anterior.\n\nC. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\n- This statement is correct. The patellar tap (also known as the patellar ballottement test) is used to detect fluid accumulation in the knee joint, which is indicative of an effusion.\n\nD. 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum.\n- This statement is incorrect. Knock knee deformity is due to genu valgum, not genu varum. Genu varum refers to bowleggedness, while genu valgum refers to knock knees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion."
