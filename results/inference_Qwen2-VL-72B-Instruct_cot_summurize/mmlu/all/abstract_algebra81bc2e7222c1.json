According to Sylow's Theorems, if \\( p^k \\) is the highest power of a prime \\( p \\) that divides \\( n \\), then there exists a subgroup of order \\( p^k \\). However, this does not guarantee the existence of subgroups of all other divisors of \\( n \\). For example, consider the alternating group \\( A_4 \\) which has order 12. It does not contain a subgroup of order 6, even though 6 is a divisor of 12.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"If \\( a \\) belongs to a finite group, then \\( |a| \\) divides \\( |G| \\).\"\n\nThis statement is true. This is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, which states that for any finite group \\( G \\) and any element \\( a \\in G \\), the order of \\( a \\) (denoted as \\( |a| \\)) must divide the order of the group \\( G \\) (denoted as \\( |G| \\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
