All of the above.\n\nConsequentialist moral theories, such as utilitarianism, are indeed value-based theories that focus on the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their moral worth. They involve considering alternative actions and their potential outcomes. Consequentialism is also often characterized by its impartiality, meaning it requires treating everyone's interests equally without giving special consideration to oneself or others based on personal relationships. Therefore, all three features listed (A, B, and C) are aspects of consequentialist moral theory."
