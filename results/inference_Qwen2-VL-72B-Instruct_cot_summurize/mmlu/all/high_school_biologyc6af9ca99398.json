Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.\n\nThis option addresses both the potential for eye irritation (by wearing goggles) and skin irritation (by wearing nitrile gloves), as well as the need to minimize exposure to acetone vapors by keeping containers closed. Additionally, nitrile gloves provide better chemical resistance compared to other types of gloves, making them suitable for handling acetone.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not adequately address the safety concerns related to acetone's properties as an eye and skin irritant and its flammable nature."
