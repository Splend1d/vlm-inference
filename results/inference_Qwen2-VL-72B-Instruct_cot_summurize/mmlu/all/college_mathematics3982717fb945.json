To determine if this point corresponds to a minimum, we can use the second derivative test or simply observe that \\(e^x\\) grows faster than any linear function as \\(x\\) increases, suggesting that after reaching the critical point, \\(f(x)\\) will increase. Thus, \\(x = \\ln(c)\\) indeed corresponds to a minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) occurs at \\(x = \\ln(c)\\), which means the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(f(\\log c)\\)."
