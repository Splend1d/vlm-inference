Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nExplanation:\nWhen Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, it records an expense for the salaries paid, which increases the salary expense account. At the same time, the payment reduces the cash balance by $300,000. Therefore, the salary expense increases, and cash decreases."
