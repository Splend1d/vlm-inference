                    "text": "A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. $45,000.00\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nAccording to the modified comparative negligence statute in this jurisdiction, a negligent plaintiff can still recover damages as long as their negligence is not equal to or greater than the defendant's negligence. In this case, the jury found that the fan was 55% negligent and the driver was 45% negligent.\n\nSince the fan's negligence (55%) is greater than the driver's negligence (45%), the fan cannot recover any damages under this statute. However, the question specifies that it is the friend who is bringing the lawsuit against the driver, not the fan.\n\nThe friend, who was a passenger in the fan's car, did not contribute to the negligence leading to the accident. Therefore, the friend's recovery is not affected by the comparative negligence between the fan and the driver. The friend's recovery is based solely on the driver's negligence.\n\nGiven that the driver was found to be 45% negligent and the friend suffered $100,000 in damages, the friend's recovery would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\text{Total Damages} \\times \\text{Percentage of Defendant's Negligence} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$100,000 \\times 45\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$100,000 \\times 0.45 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$45,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of $45,000."
