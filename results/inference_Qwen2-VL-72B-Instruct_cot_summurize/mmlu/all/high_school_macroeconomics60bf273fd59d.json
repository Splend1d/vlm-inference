The net effect on the price level depends on the relative magnitudes of these shifts. Therefore, the change in the price level is uncertain without knowing the relative sizes of the shifts.\n  \n- **Real GDP:** Both an increase in AD and an increase in SRAS tend to increase real GDP. Thus, real GDP will certainly rise.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.**"
