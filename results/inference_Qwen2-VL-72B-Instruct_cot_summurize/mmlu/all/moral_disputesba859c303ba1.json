If a being lacks this capacity, it cannot make moral judgments or act based on moral principles, thus it cannot be a moral agent. However, it can still be a moral patient (an entity that can be affected by the actions of others and therefore deserves moral consideration), an object of moral sympathy (worthy of compassion and empathy), or a being of value (having intrinsic worth)."
