Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already contained in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), so we don't need to consider it separately for extending the field.\n\nNow, let's look at the extensions step by step:\n\n1. **Extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\):** The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p=2\\). Thus, the degree of this extension is 2.\n\n2. **Extension from \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\):** Now, we want to extend by adding \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is \\(x^2 - 3\\), which is also irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) because it has no roots in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Thus, the degree of this extension is also 2.\n\nThe total degree of the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions, which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4"
