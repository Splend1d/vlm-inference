                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information about how long it takes each person to paint the room and then solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nLet's denote the rate at which Rowena paints as \\(R_r\\) and the rate at which Ruby paints as \\(R_b\\). Since Rowena can paint the room in 14 hours, her rate is \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\) of the room per hour. Similarly, since Ruby can paint the room in 6 hours, her rate is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the room per hour.\n\nThe first condition tells us that when Rowena paints for \\(x\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(y\\) hours, they finish half of the painting. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[x \\cdot R_r + y \\cdot R_b = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the rates we found:\n\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nThe second condition tells us that when Rowena paints for \\(y\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(x\\) hours, they paint the whole room. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[y \\cdot R_r + x \\cdot R_b = 1\\]\n\nSubstituting the rates again:\n\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\nNow, let's solve these two equations simultaneously. First, let's simplify them by finding a common denominator, which would be 42 (the least common multiple of 14 and 6):\n\n\\[6x + 7y = 21\\]\n\\[7y + 6x = 42\\]\n\nNotice that both equations are essentially the same, just scaled differently. This means we made a mistake in interpreting the second condition. The correct interpretation should be:\n\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\nLet's correct our approach and solve the system correctly:\n\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of each equation by their respective denominators to clear the fractions:\n\n\\[6x + 7y = 21\\]\n\\[7y + 6x = 84\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\n\\[7y + 6x - (6x + 7y) = 84 - 21\\]\n\\[0 = 63\\]\n\nThis indicates there was an error in my setup or understanding of the problem. Let's re-examine the conditions more carefully:\n\nThe correct interpretation should lead to:\n\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[y \\cdot \\frac{1}{14} + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\]\n\nMultiplying through by the denominators:\n\n\\[6x + 7y = 21\\]\n\\[7y + 6x = 42\\]\n\nThis setup is incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the conditions given.
