A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\nIn an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the CPA performs specific procedures agreed upon by the parties involved but does not express an opinion or assurance on the subject matter or the assertion being reported on. Instead, the CPA provides a report that describes the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures performed and the findings from those procedures. The report should include a disclaimer stating that the CPA does not take responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures to meet the needs of the parties who have agreed to them. This is because the procedures are specifically designed by the parties involved, not by the CPA, and their sufficiency depends on the adequacy of the procedures agreed upon."
