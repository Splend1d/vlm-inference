Complex foragers tend to be less mobile as they exploit more stable and predictable resources.\n\nD. **Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.**\n   - This is a key characteristic of complex foragers. They tend to specialize in exploiting a few highly productive resources, which allows them to settle in one place for longer periods compared to simple foragers who need to move frequently.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate difference between simple foragers and complex foragers is:\n\n**D. Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.**"
