This is a clear example of religious regulation of personal behavior. The second verse from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, while not directly from an Islamic text, reflects a more secular or philosophical view on enjoying life, including drinking wine when the roses are in bloom. However, it still touches on the theme of personal behavior, albeit in a different cultural context. Both verses, therefore, relate to the regulation or contemplation of personal behavior, with the first being explicitly religious and the second being more philosophical but still within the cultural context of Islamic society."
