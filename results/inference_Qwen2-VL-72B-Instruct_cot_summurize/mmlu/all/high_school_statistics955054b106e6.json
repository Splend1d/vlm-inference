Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct statement about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests, we need to understand the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the explained variance.\n\nThe given information states that \"the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests.\" This means that the R-squared value (R\u00b2), which represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable, is 0.71.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) is related to R-squared (R\u00b2) by the formula:\n\\[ R^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nGiven \\( R^2 = 0.71 \\), we can find the correlation coefficient \\( r \\) by taking the square root of 0.71:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0.71} \\approx 0.84 \\]\n\nSince the correlation coefficient can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of the relationship, we need to consider whether the relationship between the number of calls and the abundance of nests is positive or negative. Given that more calls indicate more birds and thus more nests, the relationship is likely positive.\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient \\( r \\) should be positive:\n\\[ r \\approx 0.84 \\]\n\nThus, the correct statement is:\n\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84."
