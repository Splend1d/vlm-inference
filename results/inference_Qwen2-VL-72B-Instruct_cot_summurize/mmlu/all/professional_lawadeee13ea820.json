The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?\n\nA.

Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.\n\nIn a tort lawsuit, the homeowner would need to demonstrate that the electrician breached a duty of care owed to her by failing to adhere to established standards in the electrical industry, which resulted in damage to her property. If it can be shown that the electrician's work did not meet these standards and caused the wiring to become disjointed, the homeowner may have grounds to recover damages."
