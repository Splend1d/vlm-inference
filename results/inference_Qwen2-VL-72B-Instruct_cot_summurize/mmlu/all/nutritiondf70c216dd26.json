Wealthy countries subsidies and trade barriers make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security.\n\nGlobalisation can have both positive and negative effects on food security. On one hand, it can increase access to food through international trade and investment. However, wealthy countries often use subsidies and trade barriers to protect their own agricultural industries, making it difficult for developing countries to compete in the global market. This can lead to reduced access to affordable food for people in developing countries, exacerbating food insecurity. Additionally, globalisation can lead to the consolidation of power in the hands of large multinational corporations, which can further marginalize small farmers and local communities. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B and C are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the impact of globalisation on food security. Option D is partially correct but does not address the root causes of food insecurity caused by globalisation."
