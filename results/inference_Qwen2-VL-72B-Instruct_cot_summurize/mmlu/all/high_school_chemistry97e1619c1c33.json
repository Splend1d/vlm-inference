However, sodium chloride (NaCl) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO\u2084) are both soluble in water. Therefore, there would be no precipitate formed, and the reaction would proceed with all ions remaining in solution.\n\nB. \\( \\text{CaCl}_2 + \\text{MnSO}_4 \\)\n- Calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082) and manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO\u2084) could also potentially form a precipitate if the resulting product is insoluble. However, calcium sulfate (CaSO\u2084) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl\u2082) are both soluble in water. Therefore, there would be no precipitate formed, and the reaction would proceed with all ions remaining in solution.\n\nC. \\( \\text{NH}_4\\text{I} + \\text{Pb}(\\text{NO}_3)_2 \\)\n- Ammonium iodide (NH\u2084I) and lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO\u2083)\u2082) can form lead(II) iodide (PbI\u2082), which is insoluble in water. This would result in a precipitate, so this reaction does not have all ions remaining in solution.\n\nD. \\( \\text{KOH} + \\text{HClO}_4 \\)\n- Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and perchloric acid (HClO\u2084) react to form water and potassium perchlorate (KClO\u2084). Since water is formed as one of the products, this reaction involves a neutralization reaction and does not involve all ions remaining in solution.\n\nBased on the analysis, the pairs of reactants that will have no net ionic equation (all ions remain in solution) are:\n\nA. \\( \\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_3 + \\text{FeCl}_2 \\)\nB. \\( \\text{CaCl}_2 + \\text{MnSO}_4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( \\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_3 + \\text{FeCl}_2 \\)\nB. \\( \\text{CaCl}_2 + \\text{MnSO}_4 \\)"
