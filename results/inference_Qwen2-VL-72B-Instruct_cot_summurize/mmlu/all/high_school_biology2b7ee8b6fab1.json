Differences in the timing and expression levels of different genes leads to structural and functional differences.\n\nCell differentiation in vertebrates involves the specialization of cells into various types with distinct functions and structures. This process is primarily driven by differences in the timing and expression levels of specific genes rather than having different sets of genes or changes in the reading frame of mRNA. Spontaneous morphogenesis also plays a role but is not the primary mechanism for differentiation."
