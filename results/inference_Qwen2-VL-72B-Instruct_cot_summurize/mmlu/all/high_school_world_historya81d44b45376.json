It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following is a treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which option best fits the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies during the specified periods, let's analyze the context and core of the question.\n\nThe passage from Tacitus describes how the Bructeri were driven out and exterminated by the Chamavi and Angrivarii, with the support of neighboring tribes. This suggests a scenario where barbarian groups were in conflict with each other and with more established societies, leading to significant violence and displacement.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.**\n   - This option focuses on religious conversion, which is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage does not mention any religious conversions.\n\nB. **Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.**\n   - This option suggests that barbarian peoples served as soldiers within the armies of more established societies. While this could be true in some historical contexts, it is not directly supported by the passage, which focuses on conflict and extermination rather than integration into military forces.\n\nC. **Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.**\n   - This option implies a legal and social subjugation of barbarian peoples. The passage does not provide evidence of such a systematic legal relegation to servile status.\n\nD. **Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.**\n   - This option suggests that barbarian peoples were sometimes invited to take over the governance of more established societies. This aligns with historical instances where barbarian leaders were given power or influence within civilized societies, such as during the fall of the Western Roman Empire when barbarian leaders took control of parts of the empire.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting option that reflects a similar treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies both in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. and 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.**"
