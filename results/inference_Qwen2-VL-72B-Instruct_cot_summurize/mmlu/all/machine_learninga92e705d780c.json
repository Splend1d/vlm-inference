The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n\nBatch Normalization (BN) normalizes the activations of a previous activation layer at each batch, i.e., applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1. This reduces internal covariate shift, making training deep models easier. \n\nThe bias parameter in an affine layer (also known as a fully connected layer) is used to shift the activation function along the x-axis. However, since BN also shifts the mean of the activations to zero, the bias parameter becomes redundant if BN is applied immediately after the affine layer. Therefore, it's common practice to omit the bias term in the layers immediately preceding a BN layer."
