However, this doesn't align with Singer's critique, which implies inefficiency.\n\nB. **almost as effectively as we could get it to our close neighbors**:\n   - This implies that there is some level of efficiency in delivering aid to distant refugees, but it's nearly comparable to helping close neighbors. This also doesn't fit well with Singer's critique of inefficiency.\n\nC. **quite inefficiently, but they are still worth donating to**:\n   - This option acknowledges inefficiency but argues that despite this, the organizations are still valuable recipients of donations. This seems to align with Singer's nuanced view that while there may be inefficiencies, the organizations still have merit.\n\nD. **very inefficiently, and are therefore not worth donating to**:\n   - This option suggests that the inefficiency is so severe that it negates the value of donating to these organizations. This is a strong stance and does not align with Singer's more balanced perspective.\n\nGiven Singer's nuanced critique, the most fitting option is:\n\n**C. quite inefficiently, but they are still worth donating to.**"
