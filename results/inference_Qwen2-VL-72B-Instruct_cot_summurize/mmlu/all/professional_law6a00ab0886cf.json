The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n"

In this case, the prosecution is likely seeking to introduce evidence of the defendant's past actions to demonstrate a pattern of behavior that supports the current charge of false pretenses and intent to defraud. This type of evidence is often referred to as \"other act\" evidence and can be admissible under certain circumstances to prove motive, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: admissible, to show his intent to defraud."
