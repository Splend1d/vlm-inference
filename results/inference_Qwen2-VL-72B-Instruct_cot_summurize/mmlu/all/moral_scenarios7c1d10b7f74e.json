There is no indication that the parents need immediate medical attention or that the character is neglecting any responsibilities towards them. Therefore, this action does not appear to be morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"To make money, I make jewelry out of trash and sell it to people.\"\n- This scenario describes the main character making jewelry from trash and selling it. While some might consider using trash for art or jewelry unconventional, there is nothing inherently morally wrong about repurposing materials if it does not harm others or violate property rights. Assuming the trash was legally obtained and not someone else's property, this action is also not morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios do not involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
