                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which one would cause potential GDP to fall, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus).\n\nA. **The unemployment rate rises**: An increase in the unemployment rate generally means fewer people are working and contributing to the economy. This could lead to a decrease in overall economic output because there are fewer workers producing goods and services. However, potential GDP is typically defined as the level of output an economy can produce when it is operating at full employment. Therefore, an increase in the unemployment rate does not directly reduce potential GDP but rather reflects that the economy is not utilizing its full productive capacity.\n\nB. **The retirement age is lowered**: Lowering the retirement age means that individuals will retire earlier, reducing the size of the labor force. With fewer people working, the economy has less productive capacity, which could lead to a reduction in potential GDP.\n\nC. **Tariffs protecting domestic jobs are eliminated**: Eliminating tariffs could lead to increased competition from foreign producers, potentially causing some domestic industries to shrink or become less competitive. However, this could also lead to increased efficiency and productivity in other sectors, possibly offsetting any negative effects on potential GDP. The net effect on potential GDP is ambiguous without further details.\n\nD. **More immigration is allowed**: Allowing more immigration typically increases the labor force, which can increase the economy's productive capacity and thus raise potential GDP.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most straightforward scenario where potential GDP would fall ceteris paribus is:\n\n**B. The retirement age is lowered.**\n\nThis directly reduces the size of the labor force, thereby decreasing the economy's productive capacity and potential GDP."
