To sell more units, the monopoly must lower its price, which means that the marginal revenue (the additional revenue from selling one more unit) is less than the price of that unit. This is because lowering the price affects not only the revenue from the additional unit sold but also reduces the revenue from all previously sold units, since they are now sold at a lower price. Therefore, the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve for a monopoly."
