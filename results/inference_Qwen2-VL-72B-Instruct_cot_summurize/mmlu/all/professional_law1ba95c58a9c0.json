The man called a towing company and told the company's manager that the car was 100 feet down the embankment. \"That's lucky,\" said the manager, \"because our winch only goes 100 feet.\" After the manager and the man agreed on a price, an employee of the company attempted to reach the car but could not because the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment. Is the towing company's performance excused on the grounds of mistake?\n\nA. No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.\nB. No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.\nC. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\nD. Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.\n"

If such a mistake exists, it can potentially excuse one or both parties from their contractual obligations.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Situation**:\n   - **Distance Misunderstanding**: Both the man and the towing company manager believed the car was 100 feet down the embankment. This belief was incorrect as the car was actually 120 feet down.\n   - **Material Fact**: The distance is a crucial factor since the winch has a maximum capacity of 100 feet. Therefore, the distance is a material fact affecting the contract's performance.\n   - **Mutual Mistake**: Both parties shared this misunderstanding, indicating a mutual mistake.\n\n3. **Risk Allocation**:\n   - **Assumption of Risk**: The towing company assumed the risk by not verifying the distance themselves. However, this does not necessarily negate the mutual mistake if the distance was genuinely unknown to both parties.\n   - **Contract Terms**: There is no indication that the contract explicitly allocated the risk of mistake to either party.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the mutual mistake about the distance, a fundamental aspect of the contract, excuses the towing company's performance."
