During the training phase, when predicting the class label of a training instance, it will always predict the correct class because it uses the nearest training instance to itself, which is itself. Therefore, the training error of a 1-NN classifier is indeed 0.\n\nSo, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.\nThe Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate incorporates both the likelihood and the prior probability in its calculation, whereas the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) relies solely on the likelihood function. As the amount of data increases, the influence of the prior diminishes relative to the likelihood. This means that with an infinite amount of data, the likelihood dominates the posterior distribution, making the MAP estimate converge to the MLE estimate regardless of the prior chosen.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is also **True**.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. True, True**"
