                    "text": "To determine which statement is not true, let's analyze each option in the context of the given scenario:\n\n1. **Option A: The particles must have the same sign of charge.**\n   - For the net force to be zero, the electrostatic force (which depends on the charges) must balance with the gravitational force (which depends on the masses). Since like charges repel and opposite charges attract, having the same sign of charge would imply a repulsive electrostatic force. However, this does not necessarily mean they must have the same sign of charge; it could also be balanced by different magnitudes of charges or masses.\n\n2. **Option B: If the distance between the particles changes, the force will no longer be 0 N.**\n   - Both electrostatic and gravitational forces depend inversely on the square of the distance between the particles. Changing the distance will alter both forces, potentially unbalancing them. Therefore, if the distance changes, the net force may indeed no longer be zero.\n\n3. **Option C: The particles must have the same mass.**\n   - The gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to their masses. For the gravitational force to balance the electrostatic force, the masses do not necessarily need to be the same; they can be different as long as the forces balance out.\n\n4. **Option D: Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because it is possible for the electrostatic force and the gravitational force between two charged particles to balance each other out, resulting in a net force of zero. This balance depends on the specific values of the charges, masses, and distance between the particles.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\n**Option D: Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.**"
