Explicit costs are direct payments made by the firm for resources such as labor, materials, and rent. Implicit costs, on the other hand, represent the opportunity cost of using resources owned by the firm, such as the owner's time or capital invested in the business. When a firm earns a normal profit, it is covering all its costs, including the opportunity cost of the resources it owns, but not making any economic profit beyond what is necessary to keep those resources in their current use."
