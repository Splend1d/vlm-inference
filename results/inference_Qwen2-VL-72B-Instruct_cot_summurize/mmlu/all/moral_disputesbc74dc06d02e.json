It involves creating cloned embryos from which stem cells can be harvested for use in medical treatments. This approach does not involve producing and raising a child, nor does it inherently imply going down a \"slippery slope.\" The primary goal is to generate cells that can potentially repair or replace damaged tissues and organs."
