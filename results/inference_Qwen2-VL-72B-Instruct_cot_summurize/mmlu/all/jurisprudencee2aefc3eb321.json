Because they are an expression of a capitalist economy and are unnecessary in a socialist society.\n\nMarxist accounts of law often view individual rights as a product of capitalist societies, where they serve to protect private property and maintain class distinctions. In a socialist society, according to Marxist theory, the state would own the means of production, and there would be no need for individual rights as they are understood in capitalist societies. Instead, the focus would be on collective rights and the needs of the community as a whole."
