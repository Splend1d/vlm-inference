Avoiding unnecessary deception to humans - This is a fundamental ethical principle in many fields, including research and healthcare, to ensure trust and integrity.\n\nB. Avoiding unnecessary pain to humans and other animals - This principle is widely recognized in medical ethics, animal welfare, and research practices to minimize harm.\n\nC. Avoiding use of animals when computers are available - While this is an important consideration in some contexts, particularly in scientific research and testing, it may not be applicable or feasible in all situations. For example, certain biological or behavioral studies might require the use of animals despite the availability of computational models.\n\nD. Protecting confidentiality - Confidentiality is a critical ethical guideline in various domains such as healthcare, law, and research to safeguard personal information and privacy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ethical guideline that is not universally subscribed to by all public institutions is:\n\nC. Avoiding use of animals when computers are available"
