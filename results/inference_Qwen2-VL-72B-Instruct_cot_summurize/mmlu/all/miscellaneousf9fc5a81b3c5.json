Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n**Option C:**\n- Gneiss: This is a metamorphic rock.\n- Schist: This is another type of metamorphic rock.\n- Phyllite: This is a type of metamorphic rock.\n- Chlorite: This is a mineral.\n- Mica: This is a group of minerals.\n\nSince gneiss, schist, and phyllite are rocks, not minerals, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n- Coal: This is a sedimentary rock.\n- Chert: This is a sedimentary rock.\n- Limestone: This is a sedimentary rock.\n- Dolomite: This is a sedimentary rock.\n- Halite: This is a mineral.\n\nSince coal, chert, limestone, and dolomite are rocks, not minerals, this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B**: Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum."
