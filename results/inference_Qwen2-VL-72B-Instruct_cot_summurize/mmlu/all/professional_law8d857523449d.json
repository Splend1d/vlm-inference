At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation.

                    "text": "The commissioner's testimony about what his predecessor told him regarding his authority to raise his expense allocation would be considered hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the commissioner is repeating what someone else (his predecessor) said to him.\n\nTo determine the admissibility of this testimony, we need to consider whether it falls under any recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. One such exception could be if the statement is relevant to proving the commissioner's state of mind or lack of criminal intent, which is often referred to as \"state of mind\" hearsay.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Option A: Admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.**\n  - This option suggests that the testimony could be admitted to demonstrate that the commissioner believed he had the authority to increase his expenses based on what his predecessor told him, thus potentially showing a lack of criminal intent.\n\n- **Option B: Admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.**\n  - This option implies that the testimony could be used to establish a routine practice within the organization. However, the statement from the predecessor does not necessarily reflect a routine practice but rather a specific instance of advice given.\n\n- **Option C: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.**\n  - This option states that the testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay and does not fall under any recognized exception. While this is generally true for most hearsay statements, there might be an exception applicable here.\n\n- **Option D: Inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.**\n  - This option suggests that the league's charter itself should be presented as the best evidence of the commissioner's authority, making the hearsay statement unnecessary. However, the commissioner's testimony about his understanding based on his predecessor's advice is still relevant to his state of mind.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. Admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.**\n\nThis option acknowledges that the hearsay statement can be admitted to provide context for the commissioner's belief and potential lack of criminal intent."
