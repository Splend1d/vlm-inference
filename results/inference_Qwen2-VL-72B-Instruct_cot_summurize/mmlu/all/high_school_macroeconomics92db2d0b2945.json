The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping and the long-run Phillips curve is vertical.\n\nIn the short run, there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation, represented by the downward slope of the Phillips curve. However, in the long run, this trade-off disappears, and the Phillips curve becomes vertical, indicating that any level of unemployment can be associated with a constant rate of inflation."
