                    "text": "To determine the solubility of MgCl2 in different solutions, we need to consider the common ion effect and the solubility rules for ionic compounds.\n\nMgCl2 is an ionic compound that dissociates into Mg2+ and Cl- ions when dissolved in water:\n\n\\[ \\text{MgCl}_2(s) \\rightarrow \\text{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\text{Cl}^-(aq) \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **LiOH(aq)**: This solution contains Li+ and OH- ions. Neither of these ions is a common ion with MgCl2, so there should not be any significant effect on the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nB. **CBr4(aq)**: This solution contains CBr4 molecules. Since CBr4 is a nonpolar molecule and MgCl2 is an ionic compound, MgCl2 would not be very soluble in this solution due to the \"like dissolves like\" principle.\n\nC. **Mg(NO3)2(aq)**: This solution contains Mg2+ and NO3- ions. The presence of Mg2+ ions (a common ion with MgCl2) will decrease the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect.\n\nD. **AlCl3(aq)**: This solution contains Al3+ and Cl- ions. The presence of Cl- ions (a common ion with MgCl2) will decrease the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect.\n\nGiven these considerations, the solution that would have the least impact on decreasing the solubility of MgCl2 is **LiOH(aq)** because it does not contain any common ions with MgCl2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. LiOH(aq)**"
