The kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor defined as:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}} \\]\n\nGiven that the final velocity \\( v = 0.6c \\), we can compute \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\]\n\nThe initial kinetic energy when the particle is at rest (\\( v = 0 \\)) is zero. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = KE_{final} - KE_{initial} = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\gamma = 1.25\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta KE = (1.25)mc^2 - mc^2 = 1.25mc^2 - mc^2 = 0.25mc^2 \\]\n\nThus, the work required to accelerate the particle from rest to \\(0.6c\\) is \\(0.25mc^2\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.25mc^2"
