As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the core of Francis Bacon's ideas presented in the passage. Bacon advocates for a method of empirical reasoning that starts from observations and particulars and gradually ascends to more general axioms. This approach contrasts with the traditional method that jumps quickly from particulars to general axioms without thorough investigation.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.**\n   - This option suggests that by the 1800s, empirical reasoning had lost its significance. However, the passage does not provide any indication that this method had become irrelevant by the 1800s.\n\nB. **It had become a core principle of European culture.**\n   - This option implies that empirical reasoning had become widely accepted and central to European thought by the 1800s. Given the emphasis on observation and systematic inquiry in the passage, this aligns well with the development of the scientific method during the Enlightenment and subsequent periods.\n\nC. **It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.**\n   - While it is possible that the method had evolved over time, the passage does not suggest that it had become unrecognizable. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of empirical reasoning and its systematic approach.\n\nD. **It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.**\n   - This option suggests that the method had stopped progressing and that people were looking for alternative approaches. There is no evidence in the passage to support this claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**B. It had become a core principle of European culture.**\n\nThis choice reflects the historical development of empirical reasoning into a fundamental aspect of scientific and philosophical inquiry by the 1800s."
