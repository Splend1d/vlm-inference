Specifically, for any two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the following must hold:\n\\[ f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) consists of the elements \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) with addition modulo 2, let's consider the possible values for \\(f(1)\\).\n\n1. **If \\(f(1) = 0\\)**:\n   - Then for any integer \\(n\\), \\(f(n) = f(1+1+\\ldots+1) = f(1) + f(1) + \\ldots + f(1) = 0 + 0 + \\ldots + 0 = 0\\).\n   - This means every integer maps to 0 under this homomorphism.\n\n2. **If \\(f(1) = 1\\)**:\n   - For \\(n = 2\\), \\(f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 0\\) (since \\(1 + 1 = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)).\n   - For \\(n = 3\\), \\(f(3) = f(1+1+1) = f(1) + f(1) + f(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 1\\) (since \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)).\n   - In general, for any odd \\(n\\), \\(f(n) = 1\\), and for any even \\(n\\), \\(f(n) = 0\\).\n\nThus, there are exactly two homomorphisms from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\):\n- One where every integer maps to 0.\n- One where odd integers map to 1 and even integers map to 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2"
