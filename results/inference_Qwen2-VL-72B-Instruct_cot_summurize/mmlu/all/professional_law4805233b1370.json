One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's,\" we need to analyze the nature of the promise and its legal implications.\n\n1. **Unenforceable, Conditional Gift (Option A):**\n   - This option suggests that the promise is a gift that is contingent upon certain conditions being met. However, gifts are generally revocable unless there is consideration or a formal contract. The promise here seems more like a contractual agreement rather than a simple gift because it involves a specific performance (studying a minimum of five hours a day) in exchange for payment.\n\n2. **Non-Detrimental and Non-Binding (Option B):**\n   - This option implies that the promise is not legally binding because it does not involve any detriment to the promisor (the father). However, the law student's promise to study a minimum of five hours a day can be seen as a detriment, as it involves a commitment of time and effort.\n\n3. **Enforceable with a Bargained-For Exchange (Option C):**\n   - This option indicates that the promise would be enforceable if there was a bargained-for exchange. In this case, the law student's promise to study a minimum of five hours a day can be considered a bargained-for exchange for the father's promise to pay money for grades. This aligns well with the principles of contract law where both parties provide something of value.\n\n4. **Voidable Proposal (Option D):**\n   - This option suggests that the promise could be voided under certain circumstances. While some promises can indeed be voidable, the context here does not suggest any specific grounds for voidability such as fraud, duress, or incapacity.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the promise could be enforceable if it is viewed as part of a contract involving a bargained-for exchange."
