An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n"

There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\n\nExplanation:\nThe 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution generally bars lawsuits against states by private citizens in federal court without the state's consent. However, there are exceptions to this sovereign immunity when Congress has validly abrogated it. In the context of civil rights laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was enacted pursuant to Congress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, courts have held that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity if it clearly intends to do so and if the legislation is congruent and proportional to the harm being addressed.\n\nIn this case, since the women are suing under Title VII, which is a civil rights law aimed at enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the Court of Appeals should find that there is no sovereign immunity because Congress intended to provide a remedy for victims of discrimination, including those employed by state governments. Therefore, the state cannot claim sovereign immunity to avoid paying money damages and legal fees if the discrimination is proven."
