Everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so\n\nThis is because in perfect competition, there are no barriers to entry or exit for firms, and all workers have equal access to jobs at the prevailing wage rate. The market clears at the equilibrium point where the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity demanded, ensuring that anyone willing to work at the market wage can find employment.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nB. Individual firms face downward-sloping labor demand curves - This is not true in a perfectly competitive labor market. In such markets, individual firms are price takers and face a horizontal labor demand curve, meaning they can hire as many workers as they want at the going market wage.\n\nC. Unemployment can reach as high as 10-15 percent - This is not consistent with the concept of equilibrium in a perfectly competitive labor market. At equilibrium, the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity demanded, implying full employment (barring frictional or structural unemployment).\n\nD. Individual firms face upward-sloping labor demand curves - This is also incorrect. As mentioned earlier, in a perfectly competitive labor market, individual firms face a horizontal labor demand curve, not an upward-sloping one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
