                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement separately:\n\n### Statement 1:\n\"For any two variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) having joint distribution \\(p(x, y)\\), we always have \\(H[x, y] \\geq H[x] + H[y]\\) where \\(H\\) is entropy function.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The correct relationship between the joint entropy \\(H[x, y]\\) and the individual entropies \\(H[x]\\) and \\(H[y]\\) is given by:\n\\[ H[x, y] = H[x] + H[y | x] \\]\nwhere \\(H[y | x]\\) is the conditional entropy of \\(y\\) given \\(x\\). This implies that:\n\\[ H[x, y] \\leq H[x] + H[y] \\]\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.\"\n\nMoralization is a process used in converting a directed acyclic graph (DAG) into an undirected graph. In this process, for every pair of nodes that have a common child, an edge is added between them if it does not already exist. This process typically increases the number of edges in the graph rather than decreasing it.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also false.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
