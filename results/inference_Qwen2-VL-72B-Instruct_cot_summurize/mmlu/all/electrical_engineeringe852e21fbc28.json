All of the above.\n\nHigher transmission voltage offers several advantages in power transmission systems:\n\nA. **Power Transfer Capability Increased**: Higher voltage allows for the transmission of more power over the same line without increasing the current, which is beneficial for long-distance transmission.\n\nB. **Transmission Line Losses Reduced**: Since power loss in a transmission line is proportional to the square of the current (I^2R losses), reducing the current by increasing the voltage reduces these losses significantly.\n\nC. **Area of Cross Section and Volume of the Conductor Reduced**: With lower currents at higher voltages, smaller conductors can be used, reducing the material costs and making the lines lighter and easier to install.\n\nTherefore, all three points A, B, and C are correct, making D the right answer."
