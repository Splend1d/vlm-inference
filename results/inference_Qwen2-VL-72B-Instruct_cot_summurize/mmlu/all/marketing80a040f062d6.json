Refers to the process of family formation and dissolution.\n\nThe family life cycle is a concept in sociology that describes the stages a family goes through from its formation to its dissolution. These stages typically include marriage, birth of children, raising children, empty nest (when children leave home), and retirement. It does not specifically refer to psychographic segmentation, nor is it solely about the relationships among age, occupation, income, and housing. While it can be related to personal growth, it is more focused on the collective experience of the family unit rather than individual stages of personal development."
