The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.\nB. No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.\nC.

This legal doctrine holds that if a third party reasonably believes that an agent is acting within the scope of their authority due to the principal's actions or representations, then the principal can be held liable for the agent's actions. In this case, since the installer's truck and literature displayed the manufacturer's logo, it could be argued that the homeowner reasonably believed the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer. Therefore, the manufacturer might be held responsible for the installer's negligence."
