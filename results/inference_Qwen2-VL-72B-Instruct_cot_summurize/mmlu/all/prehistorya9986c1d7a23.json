                    "text": "To determine who the rulers were based on the strontium isotope ratios in the teeth of people buried at Cop\u00e1n, we need to consider what strontium isotopes can tell us about human migration and diet.\n\nStrontium isotopes in teeth can provide information about where individuals spent their childhood because strontium is incorporated into bones and teeth from the local environment through the food and water consumed. Different geological regions have distinct strontium isotope ratios due to variations in the underlying bedrock.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Option A: local elite who rose to power based on their popularity and knowledge of politics** - This option does not directly address the strontium isotope data, which would indicate whether the individuals were local or from elsewhere.\n  \n- **Option B: foreigners from different regions across much of the Maya territory** - If the strontium isotope ratios in the teeth of the rulers show significant variation that does not match the local geology, it suggests they came from different regions, supporting the idea that they were foreigners.\n\n- **Option C: an elite class of astronomer-priests who ate mostly vegetables and fish** - While this might be true for their diet, it doesn't directly relate to the strontium isotope ratios unless there's evidence that their diet influenced the isotopic signature in a way that distinguishes them from others.\n\n- **Option D: Egyptian emigrants who arrived on ships and taught the Maya how to build pyramids** - This option is highly unlikely given the historical and geographical context. There is no credible evidence suggesting direct contact between ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica.\n\nConsidering the most plausible explanation based on strontium isotope ratios, which typically indicate geographic origin rather than specific roles or dietary habits, the best answer is:\n\n**B. foreigners from different regions across much of the Maya territory**\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from the assumption that varying strontium isotope ratios in the teeth suggest that the rulers were not all from the same local area but came from diverse regions within the Maya territory."
