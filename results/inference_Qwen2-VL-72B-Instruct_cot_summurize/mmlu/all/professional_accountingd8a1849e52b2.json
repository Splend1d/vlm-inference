Cost of equity will likely decrease.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the inflation rate falls, it typically leads to a decrease in interest rates and bond yields. This reduction in the risk-free rate (often approximated by the yield on government bonds) can lead to a lower required return for investors, which in turn decreases the cost of equity for companies. \n\nThe cost of equity is often estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), where the cost of equity (Re) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ Re = Rf + \\beta \\times (Rm - Rf) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Rf \\) is the risk-free rate,\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the stock (a measure of its systematic risk relative to the market),\n- \\( Rm \\) is the expected market return.\n\nIf the inflation rate falls, the risk-free rate (\\( Rf \\)) also tends to fall, leading to a lower cost of equity. This decrease in the cost of equity can make the company's stock more attractive to investors, potentially increasing the stock price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The cost of equity will likely decrease."
