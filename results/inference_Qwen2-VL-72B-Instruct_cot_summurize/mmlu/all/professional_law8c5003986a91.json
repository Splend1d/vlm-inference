                    "text": "A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nUnder the common law of riparian rights, which is followed in this scenario, each riparian owner has the right to make reasonable use of the water flowing through their land. However, when there is not enough water to satisfy all uses, priority is given to those who have made beneficial use of the water first. In this case, the millionaire began using the water for irrigation in 1956, long before the rancher started using the water for domestic purposes in 1986. Therefore, the millionaire's use is considered prior and beneficial, giving him priority over the rancher's more recent use.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the concept of an easement by prescription typically applies to the continuous and uninterrupted use of another person's land, not necessarily to water rights. While the millionaire has been using the water continuously, the issue here revolves around riparian rights and the principle of prior beneficial use rather than an easement by prescription.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the principles of riparian rights under common law. Upstream landowners do not inherently have superior rights to water; the priority is based on the timing and nature of the use. Domestic use is generally considered reasonable and necessary, but it does not automatically trump agricultural use if the agricultural use predates it and is also reasonable and beneficial."
