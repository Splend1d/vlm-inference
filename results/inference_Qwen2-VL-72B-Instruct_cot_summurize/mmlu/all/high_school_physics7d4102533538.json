The efficiency (\\(\\eta\\)) is given as 75%, or 0.75 in decimal form. Therefore, the output power (\\(P_{\\text{output}}\\)) is:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{output}} = P_{\\text{input}} \\times \\eta \\]\n\\[ P_{\\text{output}} = 120 \\, \\text{W} \\times 0.75 = 90 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nNow, we know the output power of the motor is 90 W. We need to find out how fast this power can lift a 6 kg mass. The power required to lift an object is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P = F \\times v \\]\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force and \\( v \\) is the velocity.\n\nThe force required to lift the mass is equal to its weight, which is given by:\n\n\\[ F = m \\times g \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass (6 kg) and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\n\\[ F = 6 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 58.8 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nUsing the power equation again:\n\n\\[ P = F \\times v \\]\n\\[ 90 \\, \\text{W} = 58.8 \\, \\text{N} \\times v \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{90 \\, \\text{W}}{58.8 \\, \\text{N}} \\approx 1.53 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 1.5 m/s"
