We want to find the degree of the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nThe minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 6\\), because:\n\n1. It is monic (the leading coefficient is 1).\n2. It has \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) as a root: \\((\\sqrt{6})^2 - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0\\).\n3. It is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p=2\\) or \\(p=3\\).\n\nSince the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is quadratic, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2"
