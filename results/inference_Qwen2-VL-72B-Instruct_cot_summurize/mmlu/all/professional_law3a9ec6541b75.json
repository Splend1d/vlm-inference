During trial, plaintiff's counsel asked an opposing witness on cross examination: \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" Defense counsel objected to the question. How will the court rule on the objection?\n\nA. The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the question is leading.\nC.

The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross-examination.\n\nLeading questions are generally permitted during cross-examination in order to test the credibility and reliability of the witness's testimony. The purpose of cross-examination is to challenge the witness's statements and uncover inconsistencies or biases. Therefore, the court will likely allow the question as it is part of the normal process of cross-examining a witness."
