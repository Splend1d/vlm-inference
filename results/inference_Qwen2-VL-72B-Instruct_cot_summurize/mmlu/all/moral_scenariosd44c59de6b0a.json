It might be seen as an act of frugality or environmental consciousness, depending on the context.\n\nIn Scenario 2, intentionally loosening your grip while holding onto a struggling elder who is teetering backward is clearly morally wrong. This action could result in harm or injury to the elder and is considered neglectful or even malicious behavior."
