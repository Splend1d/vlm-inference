Carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms\n\nThe major product of the reaction, 2-butene, is formed because it results from the elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane in a way that follows Zaitsev's rule. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene (the one with more alkyl groups attached to the double bond) is the major product of an elimination reaction. In this case, 2-butene is more substituted than 1-butene, as it has two methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons, while 1-butene has only one.\n\nIn 2-bromobutane, the bromine is attached to the secondary carbon (carbon 2), which has fewer hydrogen atoms compared to the primary carbon (carbon 1). When the bromine and a hydrogen atom are eliminated, the reaction preferentially occurs in a way that removes hydrogen from the carbon with fewer hydrogens (carbon 3), leading to the formation of 2-butene as the major product. This is because removing a hydrogen from carbon 3 leads to the formation of a more stable (more substituted) alkene, which is 2-butene."
