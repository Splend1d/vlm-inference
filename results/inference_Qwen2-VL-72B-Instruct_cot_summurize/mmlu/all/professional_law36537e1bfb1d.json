Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

No, because the offer was not accepted \u2014 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\n\nIn this scenario, the key issue is whether there was a legally binding contract between the purchaser and the seller. For a contract to be enforceable, it must include an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound. In the case described, while there was an oral agreement and a written offer with a post-dated check, the seller did not sign the offer form or deposit the check, indicating that there was no formal acceptance of the offer. Therefore, without acceptance, there was no legally binding contract, and the seller had the right to sell to another party who offered the full asking price."
