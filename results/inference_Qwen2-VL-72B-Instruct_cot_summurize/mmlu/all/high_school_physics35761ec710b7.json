                    "text": "The correct conclusion regarding the electric field outside a solid, metal object with non-uniform charge distribution on its surface can be determined based on the principles of electrostatics.\n\n1. **Electric Field Inside a Conductor**: In an electrostatic situation (no moving charges), the electric field inside a conductor is always zero. This is because free charges within the conductor redistribute themselves until they cancel out any internal electric fields.\n\n2. **Electric Field Outside a Conductor**: The electric field outside a charged conductor depends on the charge distribution on its surface. For a non-uniform charge distribution, the electric field will vary depending on the location outside the conductor.\n\n3. **Gauss's Law**: Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface. For a conductor, all excess charge resides on the surface, and the electric field lines emanate from or terminate on these charges.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the electric field outside the object is zero. This is incorrect because the presence of a non-uniform charge distribution on the surface implies that there will be an electric field outside the object.\n\n- **Option B** suggests that the electric field outside the object is equal to the electric field inside the object. Since we know the electric field inside a conductor is zero, this option is also incorrect.\n\n- **Option C** suggests that the electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object. This is generally true for spherically symmetric charge distributions, but it does not apply to non-uniform charge distributions where the field varies in a more complex manner.\n\n- **Option D** suggests that the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space. This is correct according to the relationship derived from Gauss's law for a surface element on a conductor. The electric field \\( E \\) just outside a charged conductor is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\nwhere \\( \\sigma \\) is the surface charge density and \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.**"
