On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy. An air leak is noted for the next 24 hours, which now has stopped. However, the patient has become restless and combative. Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia. Blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. After ordering a STAT portable x-ray of the chest, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Administer \u03b2-blocking medications\nB. Administer alprazolam\nC. Remove the patient from the ventilator and ventilate him with a bag-valve mask\nD. Reposition the chest tube\n"

The patient's symptoms of restlessness, combativeness, diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest, and tachycardia suggest that there may be a problem with the chest tube placement or function. Repositioning the chest tube can help to ensure that it is properly draining air from the pleural space and preventing further complications such as tension pneumothorax. Administering beta-blockers or alprazolam may not address the underlying issue and could potentially worsen the patient's condition. Removing the patient from the ventilator and ventilating with a bag-valve mask may also not address the underlying issue and could lead to hypoxemia. A STAT portable x-ray of the chest should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management."
