Given that \\(y = 2^t\\), we set \\(2^t = 4\\) and solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[2^t = 4\\]\n\\[2^t = 2^2\\]\n\\[t = 2\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(t = 2\\), we can find the coordinates of the point on the curve where \\(t = 2\\). Plugging \\(t = 2\\) into both components of \\(F(t)\\):\n\n\\[x = t^2 + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\\]\n\\[y = 2^t = 2^2 = 4\\]\n\nSo, the point is \\((5, 4)\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of \\(F(t)\\) to get the slope of the tangent line at \\(t = 2\\). The derivative of \\(F(t)\\) with respect to \\(t\\) gives us the rate of change of both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) with respect to \\(t\\), which we can use to find the slope of the tangent line:\n\n\\[F'(t) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(t^2 + 1), \\frac{d}{dt}(2^t)\\right) = (2t, 2^t \\ln(2))\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 2\\), the derivative is:\n\n\\[F'(2) = (2*2, 2^2 \\ln(2)) = (4, 4\\ln(2))\\]\n\nThe slope of the tangent line is the ratio of the change in \\(y\\) to the change in \\(x\\), which is the second component divided by the first component of \\(F'(2)\\):\n\n\\[m = \\frac{4\\ln(2)}{4} = \\ln(2)\\]\n\nNow, we have the slope \\(m = \\ln(2)\\) and the point \\((5, 4)\\) through which the tangent line passes. We can use the point-slope form of a line, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), to write the equation of the tangent line:\n\n\\[y - 4 = \\ln(2)(x - 5)\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(y - 4 = \\ln(2)(x - 5)\\)"
