Substituting this into the second equation:\n\n\\[(-x^2)^2 + x = 0\\]\n\\[x^4 + x = 0\\]\n\\[x(x^3 + 1) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions for \\(x\\): \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -1\\).\n\nFor \\(x = 0\\), substituting back into \\(y = -x^2\\) gives \\(y = 0\\). So, one critical point is \\(P(0, 0)\\).\n\nFor \\(x = -1\\), substituting back into \\(y = -x^2\\) gives \\(y = -(-1)^2 = -1\\). So, another critical point is \\(Q(-1, -1)\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the second-order partial derivatives to apply the second derivative test:\n\n\\[f_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\\]\n\\[f_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\\]\n\\[f_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3\\]\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix \\(D\\) at a point \\((x, y)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2\\]\n\nAt \\(P(0, 0)\\):\n\n\\[D_P = (6*0)(6*0) - (3)^2 = -9\\]\n\nSince \\(D_P < 0\\), \\(P\\) is a saddle point.\n\nAt \\(Q(-1, -1)\\):\n\n\\[D_Q = (6*(-1))(6*(-1)) - (3)^2 = 36 - 9 = 27\\]\n\nSince \\(D_Q > 0\\) and \\(f_{xx}(-1, -1) = 6*(-1) = -6 < 0\\), \\(Q\\) is a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q."
