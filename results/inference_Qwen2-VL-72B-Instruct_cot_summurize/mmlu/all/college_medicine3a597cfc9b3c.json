Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst, which later become part of the placenta. Its primary function is to maintain the corpus luteum during early pregnancy, ensuring the continued production of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the endometrial lining of the uterus and supporting the pregnancy."
