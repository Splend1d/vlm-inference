Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time.\n\nThis strategy employs positive reinforcement, which is a powerful tool in behavior modification. By offering Mary a reward (playing with the blocks) contingent upon her staying seated and completing her work, you create a clear incentive for her to follow through with the desired behavior. This approach not only encourages immediate compliance but also helps to build a habit over time as Mary associates staying seated and working with a positive outcome.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. Allowing Mary to read from a teacher-selected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work: While this might engage Mary initially, it doesn't directly address the issue of her leaving her seat during seat work time. It may also disrupt the flow of the lesson plan.\n\nC. Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson: While understanding the importance of the task can be beneficial, it may not be sufficient to change her behavior immediately or consistently. Young children like Mary often need more concrete incentives.\n\nD. Removing the blocks from the classroom during the assigned seat-work time: This removes the distraction but does not provide an alternative positive behavior to reinforce. It could also lead to Mary seeking other distractions or becoming disengaged without a clear incentive to stay seated.\n\nTherefore, option B provides a structured and motivating consequence that aligns well with principles of behavior management and is likely to be the most effective in encouraging Mary to complete her seat work."
