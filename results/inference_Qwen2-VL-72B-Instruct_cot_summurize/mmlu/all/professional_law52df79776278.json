                    "text": "A man owned a four-story apartment building. The man borrowed $125,000 from his friend to make improvements. As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?\n\nA. The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\nB. The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.\nD. The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a complex interplay between a mortgage, a deed absolute used as additional security, and subsequent actions taken upon default on the promissory note. Let's break down the key elements:\n\n1. **Mortgage**: The man borrowed $125,000 and secured it with a mortgage on the apartment building.\n2. **Deed Absolute**: The man executed a deed absolute to the friend, which was intended as additional security for the debt. This deed was placed in escrow with instructions to be delivered to the friend if the man failed to pay the promissory note.\n3. **Default**: The man failed to pay the promissory note on January 1, 2009.\n4. **Escrow Delivery**: The escrow agent delivered the deed to the friend on January 2, 2009.\n5. **Recording**: The friend recorded the deed on January 3, 2009.\n6. **Conveyance**: The friend sold the apartment building to an investor on January 10, 2009.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n- \"The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\"\n- This option suggests that the man can seek redemption from the friend but not from the investor. However, once the friend sold the property to the investor, the investor would generally take title free of any claims by the man unless there were specific provisions allowing redemption post-sale.\n\n**Option B:**\n- \"The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\"\n- This option implies that the man can seek redemption from the investor but not from the friend. This is unlikely since the investor purchased the property in good faith and without notice of any potential redemption rights.\n\n**Option C:**\n- \"The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.\"\n- This option suggests that the man can seek redemption from either party but cannot undo the sale. This seems plausible given that the investor likely took the property in good faith and without notice of any defects in title.\n\n**Option D:**\n- \"The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\"\n- This option suggests that the man has no rights at all due to his default. However, depending on state law and the specific terms of the agreement, the man might still have certain rights to redemption or other legal remedies.\n\nConsidering the details provided and typical legal principles regarding mortgages and deeds absolute, **Option C** appears to be the most accurate. The man may have the option to seek redemption from either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but he cannot set aside the conveyance made to the investor in good faith.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n**C. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.**"
