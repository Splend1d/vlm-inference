The expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products.\n\nThe possible outcomes when rolling two dice are:\n- Both dice show 6: Probability = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n- Any other outcome: Probability = 1 - 1/36 = 35/36\n\nThe payoffs for each outcome are:\n- Both dice show 6: Player wins $20\n- Any other outcome: Player loses the game, which means they lose their $2.00 bet\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of both dice showing 6) * (Payoff if both dice show 6) + (Probability of any other outcome) * (Payoff if any other outcome)\n\nExpected Value = (1/36) * ($20) + (35/36) * (-$2)\n\nExpected Value = ($20/36) - ($70/36)\n\nExpected Value = ($20 - $70)/36\n\nExpected Value = -$50/36\n\nExpected Value \u2248 -$1.39\n\nTherefore, the expected gain or loss per game is approximately -$1.39, which rounds to about $1.44 loss per game.\n\nThe correct answer is D. The player will lose about $1.44."
