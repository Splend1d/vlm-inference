                    "text": "To determine the heat transfer during the expansion-compression cycle, we need to consider the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (\\(Q\\)) minus the work done by the system (\\(W\\)). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- The cycle is counterclockwise on a P-V diagram.\n- The work done \\(W\\) is 300 J.\n\nFor a counterclockwise cycle on a P-V diagram, the work done by the system is negative (since the area enclosed by the cycle represents work done on the surroundings). Therefore, \\(W = -300 \\text{ J}\\).\n\nSince the cycle is a complete loop, the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) over one complete cycle is zero. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the first law equation:\n\n\\[\n0 = Q - (-300 \\text{ J})\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(Q\\):\n\n\\[\nQ = 300 \\text{ J}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the heat transfer during this cycle is 300 J into the system.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 300 J into the system"
