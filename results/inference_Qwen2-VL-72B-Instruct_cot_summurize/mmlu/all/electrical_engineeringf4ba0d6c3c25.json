Higher electrical conductivity: This ensures efficient transfer of current and minimizes energy loss as heat within the electrode itself.\n2. Higher thermal conductivity: This helps in dissipating the heat generated during welding, preventing overheating of the electrode.\n3. Sufficient strength to sustain high pressure at elevated temperatures: The electrode must be able to withstand the mechanical forces applied during welding without deforming or failing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all of above."
