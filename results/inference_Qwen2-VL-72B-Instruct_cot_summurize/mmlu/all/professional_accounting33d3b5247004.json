This ensures that the procedures performed are in accordance with recognized professional standards and enhances the credibility and reliability of the report. The other options do not accurately reflect the nature of an agreed-upon procedures engagement, which typically does not involve providing an opinion or negative assurance but rather reporting factual findings based on the procedures agreed upon by the parties involved."
