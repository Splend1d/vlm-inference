In most jurisdictions, depositions typically cannot be compelled before an action is formally filed without court permission or agreement from the other party.\n\nII. **A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.**\n   - This statement is true. In many legal systems, a defendant can be required to attend a deposition as part of the discovery process without the need for a separate subpoena if they are already a party to the lawsuit.\n\nIII. **A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.**\n   - This statement is true. Depositions are often used for discovery purposes, allowing parties to gather information that might not necessarily be admissible at trial but can still be useful for preparing the case.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. II and III only.**"
