Resigns to take a position as a consultant to lobbying groups - This suggests a change in career path but doesn't necessarily imply a betrayal of original duties or alignment with the interests they were supposed to regulate.\n\nB. Cedes control of his or her department to lifelong bureaucrats within the department - This implies a lack of leadership and control but does not directly indicate an alignment with the interests they were supposed to regulate.\n\nC. Places his or her department's priorities above the president's - This indicates a shift in priorities but does not necessarily mean the cabinet member has aligned with external interests or cultures.\n\nD. Accepts bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department - This clearly shows a cabinet member aligning with the interests of the businesses they are supposed to regulate, which fits the definition of \"going native.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Accepts bribes or expensive favors from businesses regulated by his or her department"
