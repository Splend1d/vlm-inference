They increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done.\n\nEx post facto laws typically involve making an act criminal after it was committed, increasing the punishment for an act after it was done, or altering criminal offenses or punishments in a way that prejudices the accused for past activities. However, they do not generally involve increasing the evidence required to convict someone; rather, they tend to make it easier to convict by retroactively changing the law."
