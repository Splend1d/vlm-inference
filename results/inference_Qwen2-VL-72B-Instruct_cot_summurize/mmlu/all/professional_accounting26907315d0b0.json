The equity method is typically used when an investor has significant influence over the investee, which is generally defined as having between 20% and 50% ownership.\n\nGiven that:\n- Goll Co. has a 25% interest in Rose Co.\n- Goll Co. has an 18% interest in Jave Co.\n\nSignificant influence is usually considered to be present when the investor owns at least 20% but less than 50% of the voting shares of the investee. Therefore:\n\n- For Rose Co., with a 25% interest, Goll Co. likely has significant influence and would use the equity method.\n- For Jave Co., with an 18% interest, Goll Co. does not have significant influence and would not use the equity method.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Rose only."
