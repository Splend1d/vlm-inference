                    "text": "To determine which observation provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child's ankles carries less energy than when it was first created by the rock's impact, we need to consider how wave energy is related to its characteristics.\n\nWave energy is primarily determined by the amplitude (height) and frequency of the wave. As waves propagate through a medium, they can lose energy due to various factors such as friction, dispersion, or reflection.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The wave is moving more slowly.**\n   - The speed of a wave in water is generally determined by the depth of the water and the properties of the medium. While changes in wave speed might indicate changes in the medium, it does not directly relate to the energy carried by the wave.\n\nB. **The wave pulse\u2019s width has become greater.**\n   - If the wave pulse's width has increased, this could suggest that the wave has dispersed, spreading out over a larger area. However, this does not necessarily mean that the wave carries less energy; it just means the energy is distributed over a larger area.\n\nC. **The wave pulse\u2019s width has become smaller.**\n   - If the wave pulse's width has decreased, this would imply that the wave has become more concentrated. This concentration could actually increase the energy density per unit area, suggesting that the wave might carry more energy in a smaller region rather than less overall energy.\n\nD. **The wave\u2019s height has become smaller.**\n   - The height (amplitude) of the wave directly correlates with the amount of energy it carries. A decrease in wave height indicates that the wave is carrying less energy compared to when it was initially generated.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child's ankles carries less energy than when it was first created by the rock's impact is:\n\n**D. The wave\u2019s height has become smaller.**\n\nThis is because the amplitude (height) of the wave is directly proportional to the energy it carries. A reduction in height indicates a loss of energy."
