We can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find this probability.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\n\\[ P(Z < 2.22) \\approx 0.9869 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - P(Z < 2.22) \\]\n\\[ P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - 0.9869 \\]\n\\[ P(Z > 2.22) \\approx 0.0131 \\]\n\nSo, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today is approximately 0.0131.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\n\nD. 0.0132"
