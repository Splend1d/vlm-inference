As \\(x\\) approaches negative infinity, the polynomial approaches negative infinity.\n\nGiven that there is at least one real root and no negative real roots, combined with the information from Descartes' Rule of Signs, we conclude that:\n\n**The polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\) has exactly one real root.**\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
