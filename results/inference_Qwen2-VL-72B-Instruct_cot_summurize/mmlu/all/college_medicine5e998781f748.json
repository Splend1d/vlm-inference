When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n"

The value of social capital.\n\nThe correlation between having social networks that overlap with the alumni networks of selective colleges and increased likelihood of admission highlights the importance of social connections or social capital in the admissions process. Social capital refers to the resources and advantages that individuals can access through their social relationships and networks. In this context, it suggests that students who have connections within the alumni network may benefit from those connections when applying to these selective institutions."
