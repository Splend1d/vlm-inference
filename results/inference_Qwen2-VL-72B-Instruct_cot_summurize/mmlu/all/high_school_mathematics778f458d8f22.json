This cycle has a length of 6.\n\nSince the pattern repeats every 6 terms, to find the remainder of the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term, we can divide 100 by 6 and see where it falls in the cycle.\n\n$100 \\div 6 = 16$ remainder $4$\n\nThis means the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term will have the same remainder as the $4^{\\text{th}}$ term in the cycle, which is $3$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 3."
