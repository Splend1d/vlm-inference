Charles Lyell\n\nCharles Lyell was a British geologist who is best known for his principle of uniformitarianism, which posits that the same geological processes we observe today have been operating throughout Earth's history. This idea of a very old Earth with a long history of gradual change provided the necessary framework for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which requires significant time spans for species to evolve and diversify."
