One best way to do a job\n\nScientific management, also known as Taylorism, was developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emphasizes finding the most efficient methods for job tasks, standardizing work processes, and training workers to use these standardized methods. The goal is to maximize productivity and efficiency by identifying the \"one best way\" to perform each task."
