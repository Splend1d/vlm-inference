This can lead to a decrease in net exports (exports minus imports), which is a component of real GDP. As a result, if the dollar appreciates significantly, it could contribute to a fall in U.S. real GDP. \n\nThe other options generally have different effects:\n\nA. Removing tariffs and quotas typically leads to increased trade, which can boost GDP by increasing both exports and imports.\nB. High investment in human capital usually enhances productivity and economic growth, contributing positively to GDP.\nC. Increasing the money supply can stimulate economic activity in the short term by making credit more available and potentially lowering interest rates, which can encourage spending and investment. However, excessive money supply growth can also lead to inflation, which has complex effects on GDP."
