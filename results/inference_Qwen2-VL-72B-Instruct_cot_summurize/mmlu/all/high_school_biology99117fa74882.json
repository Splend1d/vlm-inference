None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nFor the pest eradication effort using DDT to be successful in the long run, it would have been necessary that none of the individual insects had genetic variations that allowed them to resist the effects of DDT. Over time, insects with resistance genes survived and reproduced, leading to populations where resistance became widespread. This phenomenon is known as natural selection and is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology. Increasing the dose, frequency, or coverage of DDT applications would not have prevented the development of resistance if some individuals already had the genetic capacity to withstand the pesticide."
