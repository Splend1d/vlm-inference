His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nA nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n"

                    "text": "To determine what a nineteenth-century Russian historian would be most interested in when evaluating this passage, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The Russian interest in French culture**: While the passage does mention French culture (e.g., the French workers), the primary focus is not on cultural exchange or interest but rather on social and political issues.\n\nB. **The spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners**: The passage does describe Souvarine's interactions with the workmen and his attempts to foster a sense of community, but the overall tone is more critical than celebratory of camaraderie.\n\nC. **The sense of continual class struggle**: This option aligns closely with the themes presented in the passage. The text discusses the struggles between different social classes, the disillusionment with political movements, and the critique of the workers' aspirations to become bourgeoisie themselves. This reflects a broader theme of class struggle which was a significant concern in both Russian and European history during the nineteenth century.\n\nD. **The need for noblesse oblige**: Noblesse oblige refers to the idea that those of higher social status have a moral obligation to act honorably and responsibly towards others. While the passage touches on the nobility (mentioning Souvarine's renunciation of his rank and fortune), the main focus is not on the obligations of the nobility but rather on the broader social and political dynamics.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most relevant interest for a nineteenth-century Russian historian would likely be:\n\n**C. The sense of continual class struggle**\n\nThus, the final answer is C."
