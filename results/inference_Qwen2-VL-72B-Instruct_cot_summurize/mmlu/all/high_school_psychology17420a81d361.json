This is because crystallized intelligence relies on education, experience, and cultural knowledge, all of which tend to accumulate as one gets older.\n\nFluid intelligence, on the other hand, generally peaks in early adulthood and then gradually declines with age. Fluid intelligence involves problem-solving, reasoning, and the ability to process new information quickly.\n\nThe term \"g\" refers to general intelligence, which encompasses both fluid and crystallized intelligence. While some aspects of general intelligence may decline with age (like fluid intelligence), others may remain stable or even increase (like crystallized intelligence).\n\nSpeededness, which relates to how quickly one can perform mental tasks, often decreases with age due to slower processing speeds."
