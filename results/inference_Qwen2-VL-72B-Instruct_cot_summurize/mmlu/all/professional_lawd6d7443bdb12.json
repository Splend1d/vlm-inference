On each of the Model 1 A snowmobiles produced, the manufacturer installed a speed-regulating device that prevented the snowmobiles from exceeding 50 m. p. h. The manufacturer distributed the snowmobile through wholesalers and retailers across the country. In its sales brochures and advertising materials, the manufacturer advises all of its distributors against making any modifications on snowmobiles without first conferring with the manufacturer's staff of engineers. The operator of a shop in a mountain community had the exclusive right to distribute Model 1A snowmobiles in the area. Amid complaints from previous buyers regarding Model lA's speed limitations, the operator removed the speed regulators from all the Model 1A snowmobiles in stock. A buyer purchased from the operator one of the Model 1A snowmobiles that had the speed regulator removed. One day, the buyer was driving the Model 1A snowmobile through a snow-covered field, at speeds in excess of 70 m. p. h. The snowmobile hit a snow-covered rock, causing the buyer to lose control of the snowmobile, crash into a tree, and suffer serious injuries. If the buyer institutes a strict liability in tort action, he will most likely recover against\n\nA. the manufacturer only.\nB. the manufacturer, even though it was unaware of the removal of the speed regulator.\nC. the operator only.\nD. both the manufacturer and the operator.\n"

                    "text": "In a strict liability in tort action, the focus is on the product itself rather than the negligence or fault of the parties involved. The key elements for a successful strict liability claim typically include:\n\n1. The product was defective when it left the manufacturer's control.\n2. The defect caused the plaintiff's injury.\n3. The product was being used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner.\n\nGiven the scenario described:\n\n- The manufacturer installed a speed-regulating device to prevent the snowmobiles from exceeding 50 mph.\n- The operator removed the speed regulators from all the Model 1A snowmobiles in stock.\n- The buyer purchased a modified snowmobile and was driving at speeds in excess of 70 mph when the accident occurred.\n\nThe removal of the speed regulator by the operator created a defect in the product that contributed to the buyer's injury. Therefore, the operator would be liable under strict liability principles because they altered the product in a way that made it unsafe.\n\nHowever, the manufacturer could also potentially be held liable if it can be shown that the design of the snowmobile (without the speed regulator) was inherently defective or if the manufacturer failed to provide adequate warnings or instructions about the dangers of removing the speed regulator.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. both the manufacturer and the operator.\n\nBoth parties may be held responsible under strict liability principles due to their roles in creating and distributing the defective product."
