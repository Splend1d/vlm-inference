Some resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can lead to economic inequalities and social complexity.\n\nEthnographic evidence suggests that the ability to produce surplus food, whether through agriculture or other means such as fishing or hunting in resource-rich environments, can contribute to economic inequalities and social complexity. This surplus allows some individuals or groups to accumulate more resources than others, leading to differences in wealth and power."
