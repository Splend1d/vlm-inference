According to Newton's second law of motion (F = ma), the force (F) acting on an object equals its mass (m) times its acceleration (a). In the case of objects in free fall near the Earth's surface, the force is primarily due to gravity, which can be expressed as \\( F = mg \\), where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\nFor any two objects, regardless of their masses, the gravitational force acting on them is proportional to their masses. However, when you divide this force by the mass to find the acceleration (\\( a = \\frac{F}{m} \\)), the mass terms cancel out, leaving only the constant acceleration due to gravity (\\( g \\)).\n\nTherefore, the heavy rock and the light rock will have the same acceleration because the ratio of the force due to gravity to their respective masses is the same for both. This is why they fall at the same rate in the absence of air resistance."
