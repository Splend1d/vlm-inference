The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThe first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions?\n\nA. That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era\nB. That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n"

                    "text": "To determine which traditional historical assumption the first passage supports, let's analyze the content of the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage discusses the views of medieval Muslim scholars on the concept of jihad. It highlights that while some theorists saw jihad as a defensive war, most authorities believed it was an ongoing obligation until all the world was under Islamic rule.\n\n2. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era. However, the passage does not provide comparative data between Muslims and Christians regarding peacefulness.\n   - **Option B**: This option states that most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory. The passage indicates that the majority view was that the obligation of jihad did not end until the entire world was under Islamic rule, which contradicts this option.\n   - **Option C**: This option implies that many Muslims during the crusading era were inherently violent due to their Islamic faith. While the passage mentions the obligation of jihad, it does not explicitly state that Muslims were inherently violent.\n   - **Option D**: This option suggests that the ideology of holy war (jihad) was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era. The passage supports this by stating that most authorities believed in the continuous obligation of jihad until the world was under Islamic rule and that failing to prosecute the jihad was considered corrupting.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the first passage tends to support the idea that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**D. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era**"
