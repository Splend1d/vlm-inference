This could lead to a homogenization of traits and potentially reduce the resilience of the human population.\n\nB. **The effects of engineering children to have positional goods**: Positional goods are those that confer status or advantage relative to others (e.g., intelligence, physical attractiveness). Engineering these traits could exacerbate social inequalities and create new forms of competition and discrimination.\n\nC. **Loss of equality of opportunity**: If some individuals can afford genetic enhancements while others cannot, it could lead to a situation where opportunities are no longer based on merit but on genetic advantages. This would undermine the principle of equal opportunity for all.\n\nD. **Increased disparity between the rich and the poor**: Genetic enhancements available only to the wealthy could further widen the gap between the rich and the poor, leading to greater social stratification and inequality.\n\nGiven these options, the least serious issue might be seen as one that has less immediate impact on fundamental human rights and societal structures. While all these issues are significant, the loss of human diversity (Option A) might be considered less immediately harmful compared to the direct impacts on equality and opportunity (Options C and D) or the creation of new forms of social stratification (Option B).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**A. Loss of human diversity**"
