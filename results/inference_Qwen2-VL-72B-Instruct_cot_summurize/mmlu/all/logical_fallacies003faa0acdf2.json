In categorical syllogisms, each term (subject and predicate) should appear exactly twice. Conditional syllogisms do not follow this rule.\n\nB. **If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative**\n   - This is a rule that applies to categorical syllogisms. It does not directly relate to conditional syllogisms, which involve \"if-then\" statements.\n\nC. **The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent**\n   - This statement aligns with the structure of a conditional syllogism. A valid conditional syllogism typically involves affirming the antecedent in the minor premise or denying the consequent in the major premise.\n\nD. **The alternatives presented must be mutually exclusive**\n   - This statement is related to logical arguments involving disjunctions (either-or scenarios), but it does not specifically address the structure or validity of conditional syllogisms.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent**"
