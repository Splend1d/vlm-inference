                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Price Increase for Firm A**: The price of firm A's cell phone service rises by 5 percent.\n2. **Quantity Demanded for Firm B**: The quantity demanded for firm B's cell phone service increases by 10 percent.\n\nThe relationship between the price change of one good (firm A) and the quantity demanded of another good (firm B) is described by the **cross-price elasticity of demand**. Cross-price elasticity measures how much the quantity demanded of one good changes in response to a change in the price of another good.\n\n### Calculating Cross-Price Elasticity:\n\\[ \\text{Cross-Price Elasticity} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded of Good B}}{\\text{Percentage Change in Price of Good A}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Percentage change in quantity demanded of Good B: +10%\n- Percentage change in price of Good A: +5%\n\n\\[ \\text{Cross-Price Elasticity} = \\frac{+10\\%}{+5\\%} = +2 \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\n- A positive cross-price elasticity (+2) indicates that goods A and B are substitutes. When the price of one good (A) increases, the demand for the other good (B) increases, suggesting that consumers switch from A to B.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Demand for firm B is price elastic**: This statement is not directly related to the cross-price elasticity but rather to the own-price elasticity of demand for firm B. It does not address the relationship between the two firms' products.\n\nB. **Supply for firm B is price elastic**: This statement is irrelevant to the given scenario, as it pertains to the supply side rather than the demand side.\n\nC. **Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero**: This is correct. A positive cross-price elasticity (+2) indicates that an increase in the price of firm A's service leads to an increase in the demand for firm B's service, confirming that they are substitutes.\n\nD. **Firms A and B are complements because the cross-price elasticity is less than zero**: This is incorrect. Complements have a negative cross-price elasticity, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero."
