Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\nIn the short run, the aggregate supply curve is typically upward sloping because nominal wages and other input prices are somewhat sticky and do not adjust immediately to changes in the price level. This means that as the price level increases, firms can produce more output at higher prices without a corresponding increase in costs, leading to an increase in the quantity supplied.\n\nIn contrast, in the long run, all prices including nominal wages are fully flexible and will adjust to changes in the price level. As a result, the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, indicating that the economy's potential output is determined by factors such as technology, labor, and capital, rather than the price level."
