                    "text": "To determine what happens to the mean when the largest score in a group of 10 scores is increased by 40 points, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Mean Calculation**: Let's denote the initial sum of all 10 scores as \\( S \\). The initial mean (\\( M_{\\text{initial}} \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   M_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{S}{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Increase in Largest Score**: Suppose the largest score is initially \\( L \\). After increasing it by 40 points, the new largest score becomes \\( L + 40 \\).\n\n3. **New Sum Calculation**: The new sum of all 10 scores (\\( S_{\\text{new}} \\)) is:\n   \\[\n   S_{\\text{new}} = S - L + (L + 40) = S + 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **New Mean Calculation**: The new mean (\\( M_{\\text{new}} \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   M_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{S_{\\text{new}}}{10} = \\frac{S + 40}{10} = \\frac{S}{10} + 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Change in Mean**: The change in the mean (\\( \\Delta M \\)) is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta M = M_{\\text{new}} - M_{\\text{initial}} = \\left(\\frac{S}{10} + 4\\right) - \\frac{S}{10} = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean increases by 4 points.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. It will increase by 4 points."
