Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour\n\nThis statement is true because impacted faeces can sometimes mimic the symptoms and physical findings of a rectal tumour, such as causing discomfort or a mass-like sensation during a digital rectal examination. It is important to differentiate between these conditions through further evaluation and diagnostic tests.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding - This statement is incorrect. A palpable median groove in the prostate is considered a normal finding and does not indicate an adverse condition.\n\nC. A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless - This statement is incorrect. Thrombosed haemorrhoids are typically painful due to the presence of a blood clot within the haemorrhoid.\n\nD. Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy - This statement is incorrect. Peri-anal warts can often be visible upon inspection of the anal area without the need for proctoscopy. Proctoscopy may be used to evaluate internal lesions or to obtain a more detailed view, but peri-anal warts themselves can usually be diagnosed by visual examination."
