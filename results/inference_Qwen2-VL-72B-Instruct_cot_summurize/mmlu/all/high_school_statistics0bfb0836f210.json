However, since the problem does not specify the total number of potential jurors in the pool, we cannot directly calculate the exact probability using the binomial distribution formula.\n\nThe binomial distribution formula is given by:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, selecting 12 jurors),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes (selecting at least 3 women),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (probability of selecting a woman, which is 30% or 0.3),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials.\n\nHowever, without knowing the total number of potential jurors in the pool, we cannot compute the exact probability because the binomial distribution assumes a fixed population size and independence between trials, which would be violated if the pool size is small relative to the number of jurors selected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The answer cannot be determined without knowing the size of the jury pool."
