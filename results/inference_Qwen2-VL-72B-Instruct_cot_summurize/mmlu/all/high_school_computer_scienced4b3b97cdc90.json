A lossless transformation is one where no information is lost or altered in such a way that it cannot be perfectly restored to its original state.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.**\n   - This option explicitly mentions losing information, even if it's a small amount. Therefore, it is not lossless.\n\nB. **Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.**\n   - This process reduces the color information to grayscale, which means some information (the specific RGB values) is lost and cannot be fully recovered. Thus, it is not lossless.\n\nC. **Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.**\n   - This operation is reversible because you can add the original value back to the new value to get the original RGB triplet. Hence, it is lossless.\n\nD. **Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.**\n   - This operation involves moving pixels around but does not alter the actual pixel values. It is reversible and thus lossless.\n\nGiven these analyses, both options C and D describe lossless transformations. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, and considering the context of the operations described, option C is more directly related to a transformation that reverses the image without altering the original pixel values.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**C. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.**"
