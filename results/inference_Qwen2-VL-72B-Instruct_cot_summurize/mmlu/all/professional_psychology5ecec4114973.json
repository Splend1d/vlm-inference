                    "text": "To determine which option correctly describes the differences in vocalizations between deaf and normal children, let's analyze each choice:\n\nA. **During the second half of the first year, normal children increase the variety of sound, whereas deaf children do not.**\n   - This option suggests that normal children expand their vocal repertoire after six months, while deaf children do not show this increase. This is a plausible difference because hearing plays a crucial role in developing speech sounds.\n\nB. **Deaf children vocalize more than normal children during the first 6 months, then less thereafter.**\n   - This statement implies that initially, deaf children vocalize more but later decrease their vocalization compared to normal children. There isn't strong evidence supporting this specific pattern, making it less likely to be correct.\n\nC. **Normal children babble extensively, whereas deaf infants do not.**\n   - Babbling is a stage where children produce repetitive consonant-vowel combinations. Deaf children might not engage in extensive babbling due to lack of auditory feedback, making this a reasonable difference.\n\nD. **During the first 6 months, normal children increase their range of sound output more than deaf children do.**\n   - This option indicates that within the first six months, normal children develop a broader range of sounds compared to deaf children. This aligns with the idea that hearing influences early vocal development.\n\nGiven these analyses, options A and D both seem plausible, but option C directly addresses a key developmental milestone (babbling) that is significantly impacted by hearing ability.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Normal children babble extensively, whereas deaf infants do not.**"
