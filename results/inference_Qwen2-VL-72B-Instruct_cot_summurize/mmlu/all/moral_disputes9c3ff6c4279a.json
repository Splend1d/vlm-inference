Duties of fair dealing (e.g., nonexploitation) - This involves treating nonmembers fairly and not exploiting them.\nB. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties (e.g., ensuring that everyone has equal wealth) - This involves promoting equality in wealth distribution among all people, regardless of their membership in a particular society.\nC. Duties of rectification and redress (e.g., redressing those who were oppressed) - This involves addressing past injustices and oppression suffered by nonmembers.\nD. Humanitarian duties (e.g., preventing systematic violations of human rights) - This involves protecting the basic human rights of nonmembers and preventing their violation.\n\nGiven these options, the duty that is not typically associated with the responsibilities societies have toward nonmembers is:\n\nB. Cosmopolitan egalitarian duties (e.g., ensuring that everyone has equal wealth)\n\nThis is because ensuring equal wealth for everyone is an extremely broad and ambitious goal that goes beyond the typical scope of duties societies owe to nonmembers. While societies may have duties to prevent exploitation, address past injustices, and protect human rights, ensuring equal wealth for everyone is a more complex and far-reaching objective that is not commonly listed as a specific duty owed to nonmembers."
