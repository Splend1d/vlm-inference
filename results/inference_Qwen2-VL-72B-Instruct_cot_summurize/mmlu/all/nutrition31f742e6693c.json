Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nAgricultural research that targets the needs of poor farmers and consumers can significantly contribute to reducing hunger and poverty by improving crop yields, enhancing nutritional value, and increasing resilience to environmental challenges. This type of research often lacks immediate commercial profitability, making it less attractive to private sector firms. Therefore, public investment is crucial to support such research, ensuring that the benefits reach those who need them most."
