Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6.\n\nTransamination is a reversible reaction that involves the transfer of an amino group from one \u03b1-amino acid to an \u03b1-keto acid, forming a new \u03b1-amino acid and a new \u03b1-keto acid. This process is catalyzed by enzymes known as transaminases or aminotransferases, which require pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)."
