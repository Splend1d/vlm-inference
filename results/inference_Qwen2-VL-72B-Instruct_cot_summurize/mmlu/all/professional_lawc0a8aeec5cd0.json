A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB. No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\nC. Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.\nD. Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n"

No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\n\nPublic sidewalks are generally considered traditional public forums where individuals have a strong First Amendment right to free speech and assembly. Restrictions on speech in such forums must be content-neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\n\nIn this case, the state law prohibits the display of any sign on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. This blanket prohibition appears overly broad and does not appear to be narrowly tailored to serve a specific, substantial government interest. It effectively silences all forms of expression on the sidewalk, which is likely unconstitutional given the nature of the public forum involved.\n\nTherefore, the court should not uphold the law's constitutionality as it stands."
