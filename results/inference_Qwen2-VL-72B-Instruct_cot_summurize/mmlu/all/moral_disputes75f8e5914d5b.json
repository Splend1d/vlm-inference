While important, it doesn't directly address the core principles of justice in legal and economic frameworks.\n\nB. **They minimize the amount of suffering in the world.**\n   - Minimizing suffering is a significant ethical goal but may not be the primary criterion for assessing the justice of legal and economic structures.\n\nC. **They recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.**\n   - This option aligns closely with the concept of justice as it emphasizes the protection and enforcement of fundamental human rights, which are central to many theories of justice.\n\nD. **They are universalizable.**\n   - Universalizability refers to the idea that principles should apply universally without exception. While this is an important aspect of moral reasoning, it does not specifically address the justice of legal and economic structures in terms of their impact on individuals' rights.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. They recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the core principles of justice within legal and economic structures by ensuring that they uphold and protect human rights."
