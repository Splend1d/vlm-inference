The player scored 18 points in his first game, which is 4 points fewer than what he scored in his second game. Therefore, if we let \\(p\\) represent the points scored in the second game, we can write:\n\n\\[18 = p - 4\\]\n\nThis equation states that the points scored in the first game (18) is equal to the points scored in the second game (\\(p\\)) minus 4. To solve for \\(p\\), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[18 + 4 = p - 4 + 4\\]\n\\[22 = p\\]\n\nSo, the player scored 22 points in his second game. The correct answer is:\n\nB. 18 = p \u2212 4; 22"
