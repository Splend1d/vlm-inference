Liberalism acknowledges the diversity of international politics but does not necessarily align with this statement.\n\nB. **The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.**\n   - Liberalism often emphasizes non-state actors such as international organizations, NGOs, and multinational corporations, suggesting that the nation state is not always the central actor. This aligns with liberalist views.\n\nC. **Nation states are not basically alike.**\n   - Liberalism recognizes that states have different characteristics and interests, which aligns with this statement.\n\nD. **States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.**\n   - This statement aligns more closely with realism, which focuses primarily on states as the key actors. Liberalism, on the other hand, considers multiple actors beyond just states.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that does not describe the liberalist conception of the international system is:\n\n**D. States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.**"
