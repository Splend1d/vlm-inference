This can happen even with relatively low voltages if the resistance of the body is low enough, such as when the skin is wet or there is direct contact with conductive materials. High voltage and low body resistance (option C) can indeed increase the severity of the shock, but the fundamental requirement for an electric shock is a voltage difference that allows current to flow through the body."
