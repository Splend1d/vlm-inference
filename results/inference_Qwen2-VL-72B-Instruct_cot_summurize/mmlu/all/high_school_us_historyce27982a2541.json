The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which group would most likely support the scenario described in the passage, let's analyze the context and content of the passage:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage is from an article in The New York Times dated October 15, 1905. It discusses how economic necessity has led women to enter the workforce and dine publicly, unescorted by men.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - The passage highlights the impact of economic necessity on women's roles and societal norms.\n   - It mentions the \"annihilation\" of the old idea that women should eat only in private settings.\n   - It notes the creation of a new social phenomenon where women dine in public restaurants.\n\nGiven these points, we need to identify which group would be supportive of such changes in women's roles and societal norms.\n\n- **A. Ku Klux Klan**: This organization was known for its racist and sexist ideologies, opposing civil rights and equality for women and minorities. They would not support the empowerment of women as described in the passage.\n\n- **B. American Temperance Union**: This group focused primarily on promoting temperance (abstaining from alcohol) and did not have a primary focus on women's rights or societal changes related to women's roles outside the home.\n\n- **C. National Woman Suffrage Association**: This organization was dedicated to securing women's suffrage (the right to vote) and broader women's rights. They would likely support any movement that advanced women's independence and societal roles, including women entering the workforce and dining publicly.\n\n- **D. Southern Christian Leadership Conference**: This organization was formed much later (in 1957) and focused on civil rights for African Americans. While it supported equality, it was not directly involved in early 20th-century women's rights movements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the group most likely to support the scenario described in the passage is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. National Woman Suffrage Association.**"
