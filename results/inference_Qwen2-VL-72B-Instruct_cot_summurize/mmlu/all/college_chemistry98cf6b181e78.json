Molecular compounds generally have low melting points.\n\nB. **AgCl (Silver chloride)**: This is an ionic compound. Ionic compounds typically have high melting points due to strong electrostatic forces between ions.\n\nC. **CaCl2 (Calcium chloride)**: This is also an ionic compound and would have a high melting point for the same reason as AgCl.\n\nD. **CCl4 (Carbon tetrachloride)**: This is another molecular compound. Like HCl, it has weak intermolecular forces, but these are primarily London dispersion forces, which are weaker than hydrogen bonding.\n\nGiven this analysis, both HCl and CCl4 are molecular compounds with relatively low melting points. However, since HCl has hydrogen bonding, which is stronger than the London dispersion forces in CCl4, we can conclude that CCl4 likely has the lowest melting point of the four.\n\nTherefore, the compound with the lowest melting point is:\n\n**D. CCl4**"
