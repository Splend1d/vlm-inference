However, it's important that this practice doesn't result in fraudulent billing practices or misrepresentation of services to the insurance company. Billing the insurance company for an increased hourly fee to recoup the waived co-payment would be considered unethical and potentially fraudulent. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement regarding the ethical considerations involved in waiving co-payments for low-income clients."
