Withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements.\n\nWhen an accountant encounters significant misapplications of accounting principles or unreasonable accounting estimates in a nonissuer's financial statements and management is unwilling to revise them, the accountant should withdraw from the engagement. This action is necessary because issuing a compilation report under such circumstances would not adequately communicate the deficiencies and could potentially mislead users of the financial statements. The accountant should also consider communicating the reasons for withdrawal to those charged with governance, such as the board of directors, if appropriate."
