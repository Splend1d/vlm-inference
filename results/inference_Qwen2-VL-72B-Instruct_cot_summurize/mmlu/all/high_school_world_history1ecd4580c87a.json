The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan\u2026In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China\u2026\nWhen we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]\u2026\"\nIbn Battuta, Voyages, 1332\u20131346 C.E.\nWhich of the following changes to Chinese policies regarding trade occurred under the Ming Dynasty of China?\n\nA.

The Ming Dynasty implemented the \"Sea Ban\" policy (Haijin), which restricted maritime trade and limited foreign merchants to specific ports.\n\nB. **The Chinese government monopolized the production and sale of key resources, such as salt and iron.**\n   - While the Ming Dynasty did control certain industries, this option does not specifically address trade policies but rather economic control over resources.\n\nC. **The Chinese government endorsed Chinese merchants to conduct trade missions abroad.**\n   - This contradicts the Ming Dynasty's restrictive trade policies. The Ming Dynasty generally discouraged and limited overseas trade.\n\nD. **The Chinese government abandoned Confucian principles to allow merchants a greater participation in local government.**\n   - This statement is inaccurate. The Ming Dynasty continued to uphold Confucian principles and did not significantly alter the social status or political involvement of merchants.\n\nGiven the historical context and the analysis of each option, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The Chinese government restricted foreign merchants to specific sites in the coastal cities.**"
