Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.\nC. inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.\nD. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the admissibility of the wife's proposed testimony, we need to consider two legal principles: hearsay and privilege.\n\n1. **Hearsay**: Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the wife's testimony about what her husband told her would be considered hearsay unless it falls under a recognized exception.\n\n2. **Privilege**: Marital communications privilege protects confidential communications between spouses from being disclosed by either spouse without the consent of the other. This privilege generally applies to conversations that occur during the marriage.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.**\n- This option is incorrect because the wife's testimony about what her husband told her is hearsay. It is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the husband stole the money).\n\n**Option B: Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.**\n- This option is partially correct. The wife's testimony is indeed hearsay and does not fall under any recognized exception. However, it also touches upon the issue of privilege, which needs to be addressed.\n\n**Option C: Inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.**\n- This option is incorrect because the wife's testimony is hearsay. Additionally, while marital communications may be privileged, the specific context of the conversation (whether it occurred during the marriage and whether it was confidential) needs to be evaluated.\n\n**Option D: Inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.**\n- This option correctly identifies that the testimony is both hearsay and potentially privileged. The conversation between the husband and wife could be protected by the marital communications privilege if it was made in confidence during their marriage.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.**"
