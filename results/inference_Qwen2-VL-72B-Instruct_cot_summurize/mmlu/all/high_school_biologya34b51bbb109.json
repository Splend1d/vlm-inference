The patterns of trait inheritance observed in pea plants were repeatedly demonstrated in other eukaryotes.\n\nMendel's principle of segregation, which states that alleles segregate during the formation of gametes, became widely accepted as a fundamental law of genetics because it was not only observed in pea plants but also consistently replicated in various other organisms. This widespread applicability across different species provided strong evidence for its validity as a general principle of heredity."
