The primary pathways for this conversion involve the synthesis of alanine and glutamine. Alanine can be transported to the liver via the bloodstream, where it can be further metabolized, while glutamine serves as a major carrier of ammonia in the body and can be used by various tissues. This process helps to prevent the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body."
