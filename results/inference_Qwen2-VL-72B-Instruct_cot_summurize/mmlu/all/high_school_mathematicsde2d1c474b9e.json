There are $100/2 = 50$ even numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nNext, we need to exclude those even numbers that are also divisible by 3. A number is divisible by both 2 and 3 if it is divisible by their least common multiple, which is 6. So, we count how many multiples of 6 there are between 1 and 100: $100/6 = 16.66...$, which means there are 16 multiples of 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of even numbers that are not divisible by 3 is $50 - 16 = 34$.\n\nThe total number of integers in the set is 100. Thus, the probability that a randomly selected integer is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is $\\frac{34}{100} = \\frac{17}{50}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $\\frac{17}{50}$."
