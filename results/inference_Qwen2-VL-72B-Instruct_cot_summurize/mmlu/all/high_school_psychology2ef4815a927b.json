It can show structural abnormalities and differences in brain anatomy, which might indicate unusual language processing areas.\n\nC. **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)**:\n   - PET scans measure metabolic activity in the brain. They can show which parts of the brain are more active during specific tasks, such as language processing. If the right hemisphere shows increased activity during language tasks, this would support the doctor's suspicion.\n\nD. **MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)**:\n   - The MMPI is a psychological test used to assess personality traits and psychopathology. It does not provide any information about brain structure or function.\n\nGiven the need to identify the location of language processing areas in the brain, the most appropriate tool would be one that can show functional activity during language tasks. Therefore, the best choice for corroborating the doctor's suspicion is:\n\n**C. PET**"
