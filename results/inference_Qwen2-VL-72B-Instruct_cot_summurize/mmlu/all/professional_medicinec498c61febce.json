Atrial septal defect\n\nThe presence of a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border are characteristic findings associated with an atrial septal defect (ASD). An ASD allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, leading to increased blood flow through the pulmonary circulation and a characteristic murmur pattern.\n\nAortic stenosis typically presents with a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space, which is not described here.\n\nCoarctation of the aorta usually presents with hypertension in the upper extremities and decreased or absent femoral pulses, which are not mentioned in the examination findings.\n\nMitral valve prolapse often presents with a late systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur, which is different from the described findings.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, an atrial septal defect is the most consistent diagnosis."
