Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens.\n\nOffshore Balancing is a grand strategy that advocates for the United States to maintain a strategic presence abroad while encouraging regional powers to take primary responsibility for their own security. This approach involves embracing a multipolar world order, showing greater restraint in international interventions, and requiring other states to bear more of the burden for their own defense and regional stability. The goal is to reduce the direct military involvement of the United States while still maintaining influence and preventing any single power from dominating a region."
