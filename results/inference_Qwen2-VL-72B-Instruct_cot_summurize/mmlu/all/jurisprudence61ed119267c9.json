Punishment should fit the crime.\n\nConsequentialism, particularly in the context of punishment, focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions rather than on intrinsic principles such as proportionality between the crime and the punishment. The consequentialist approach would prioritize the effectiveness of punishment in achieving desired outcomes, such as deterring crime, protecting society, or rehabilitating offenders, over ensuring that the punishment exactly fits the crime."
