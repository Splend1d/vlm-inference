Their bloodstream continues to contain elevated levels of adrenaline.\n\nThis is because during a crisis or stressful event, the body releases adrenaline (epinephrine) as part of the fight-or-flight response. Even after the crisis is over, it takes time for these hormone levels to return to normal, which can cause the person to remain in a heightened state of alertness and arousal."
