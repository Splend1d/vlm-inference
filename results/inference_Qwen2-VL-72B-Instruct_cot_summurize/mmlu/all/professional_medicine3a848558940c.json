Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone\nB. Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine\nC. Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine\nD. Recommend beginning a weight loss program\n"

The patient's BMI of 37 kg/m2 indicates that she is obese, which can contribute to low back pain. Weight loss can help alleviate this pain by reducing the strain on the lower back muscles and joints. Additionally, the patient's history of gestational diabetes and lack of current medication use suggest that lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise may be beneficial in managing her symptoms. An epidural injection of methylprednisolone or imaging studies such as MRI or X-rays may be considered if the pain persists despite weight loss efforts."
