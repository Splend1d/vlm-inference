The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?\n\nA. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\nB. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\nC. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court will uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Contractual Obligations**: The contractor was responsible for building the bridge within a specified timeframe. The contract included a liquidated damages clause that penalized the contractor for each day of delay.\n\n2. **City's Role**: The city was supposed to connect a road to the bridge. However, the city failed to do so, which means the bridge could not be used even if it were completed on time.\n\n3. **Purpose of Liquidated Damages**: Liquidated damages clauses are typically included to provide a pre-determined amount of compensation for breaches of contract, simplifying the calculation of damages without needing to prove actual losses.\n\n4. **Impact of City's Failure**: Since the city did not connect the road, there was no traffic flow through the bridge, implying that the city did not suffer any immediate financial loss due to the delay in bridge completion.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n\"No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\"\n- This option suggests that since the city did not connect the road, the purpose of the liquidated damages clause (to compensate for lost traffic flow) is frustrated. The city did not suffer any damages because there was no traffic flow.\n\n**Option B:**\n\"Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\"\n- This option argues that the liquidated damages clause should still apply because the contractor breached the contract by delaying the bridge completion. It disregards the city's failure to connect the road.\n\n**Option C:**\n\"Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\"\n- This option implies that the delay in the bridge completion caused the city to delay the road connection, justifying the enforcement of the liquidated damages clause. However, this does not align with the fact that the city had an independent obligation to connect the road.\n\n**Option D:**\n\"No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\"\n- This option states that the city's failure to connect the road constitutes a breach of contract, which would negate the applicability of the liquidated damages clause against the contractor.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.**"
