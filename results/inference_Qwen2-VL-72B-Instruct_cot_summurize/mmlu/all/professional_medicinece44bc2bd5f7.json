The physician informs the patient that his wife's right to know is paramount because she could also be HIV positive.

This recommendation is based on the principle of beneficence, which suggests that the physician should act in ways that promote the welfare of others. By informing his wife, the patient would enable her to take necessary precautions to protect her own health and potentially seek testing and treatment if needed.\n\nHowever, the patient's resistance to disclosure is rooted in his desire to maintain his autonomy and privacy regarding his personal choices and relationships. Autonomy is a fundamental principle in medical ethics that respects an individual's right to make decisions about their own life without undue influence from others.\n\nGiven these considerations, the physician's recommendation can be understood as an instance where beneficence (acting in the best interest of the patient's wife) is being prioritized over the patient's autonomy (his right to keep his HIV status private). Therefore, the relationship that best describes the rationale for the physician's recommendation is:\n\nC. beneficence overrides autonomy\n\nThis choice reflects the physician's emphasis on protecting the health and well-being of the patient's wife by encouraging disclosure, even though it may conflict with the patient's desire to maintain his privacy."
