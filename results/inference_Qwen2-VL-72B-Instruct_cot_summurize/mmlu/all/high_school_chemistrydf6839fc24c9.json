Elementary processes\n\nThe rate law for a reaction is typically derived from the mechanism of the reaction, particularly from the slowest step in the mechanism, known as the rate-determining step. For elementary processes, the rate law can often be written directly from the stoichiometry of the reaction because each molecule or ion that appears in the balanced equation participates in the reaction step.\n\nFor complex reactions that involve multiple steps, the overall rate law cannot usually be written directly from the stoichiometry of the net reaction; it must be determined experimentally or by considering the mechanism of the reaction. Therefore, options A, B, and D (precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions, and solubility reactions) do not necessarily follow this rule because they may involve more than one elementary step, and their rate laws cannot be written simply from the stoichiometric coefficients."
