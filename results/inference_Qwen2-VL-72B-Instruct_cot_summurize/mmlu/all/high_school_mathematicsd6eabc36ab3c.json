The smallest even positive integer is \\(2\\), and they continue as \\(4, 6, 8, \\ldots\\), increasing by \\(2\\) each time.\n\nTo find how many even numbers there are up to but not including \\(91\\), we can use the formula for finding the \\(n\\)th term in an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term (\\(2\\) in this case),\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference (\\(2\\) in this case),\n- \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the number of terms (\\(n\\)) directly, we rearrange the formula to solve for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1\\]\n\nBut instead of using \\(a_n = 91\\), we use \\(a_n = 90\\) because we're looking for numbers less than \\(91\\). So,\n\n\\[n = \\frac{90 - 2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{88}{2} + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(45\\) even positive integers less than \\(91\\).\n\nThe correct answer is A. 45."
