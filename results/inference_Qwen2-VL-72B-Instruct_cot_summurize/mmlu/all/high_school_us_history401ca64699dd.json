It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn his opinion on the case Dred Scott v.

Sandford case.\n\nA. Separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional:\n- This principle was established later in the Plessy v. Ferguson case (1896), not in the Dred Scott case.\n\nB. Corporations were entitled to the same protections guaranteed to individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment:\n- This concept was developed much later, particularly in the late 19th century through various court decisions, notably Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad (1886).\n\nC. School prayer violated the principle of \"separation of church and state\":\n- This issue pertains to the First Amendment and was addressed in cases like Engel v. Vitale (1962) and Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), which occurred long after the Dred Scott case.\n\nD. Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories:\n- This is directly related to the Dred Scott v. Sandford case. In his opinion, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that Congress did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the territories, thereby upholding the sentiment expressed by Frederick Douglass about the federal government's support for slavery.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories"
