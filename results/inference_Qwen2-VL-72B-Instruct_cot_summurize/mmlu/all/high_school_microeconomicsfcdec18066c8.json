Fixed factors are those that cannot be easily changed in the short run, while variable factors can be adjusted as needed. The size of a McDonald's kitchen is a fixed factor because it cannot be easily changed in the short run. On the other hand, the amount of wood used to make a desk, the number of pickles put on a sandwich, and the number of teacher's assistants in local high schools are all variable factors that can be adjusted in the short run."
