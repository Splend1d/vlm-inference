Personal adornments often signify individuality, status, or group affiliation, suggesting an increased awareness and importance of individual identity.\n\nD. **greater intelligence and willingness to cooperate**:\n   - While personal adornment may reflect cognitive abilities and social interactions, it is more specific to individual identity rather than directly indicating general intelligence or cooperation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible interpretation based on Randall White's views would be:\n\n**C. increasing awareness and importance of individual identity**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the idea that personal adornments serve as markers of individuality and social roles within a community."
