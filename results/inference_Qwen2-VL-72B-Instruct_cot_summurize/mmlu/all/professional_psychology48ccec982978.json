Six months after termination they meet at an art opening reception and begin to date. Over the next few months, the relationship progresses and they become sexual. In this situation, the psychologist has acted:\n\nA. Ethically because it had been 6 months since termination\nB. Probably ethically since there was no coercion involved and the relationship was consensual\nC. Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances\nD. Ethically according to professional standards, but the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment\n"

Unethically, because she engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances\n\nAccording to ethical guidelines established by professional psychological associations such as the American Psychological Association (APA), psychologists are generally prohibited from engaging in sexual relationships with former clients for a specified period of time after the termination of therapy. This period can vary depending on the specific guidelines, but it often extends beyond just a few months. The rationale behind these prohibitions includes concerns about power imbalances, the potential for exploitation, and the need to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nIn the scenario described, even though six months have passed since the termination of therapy, the psychologist's actions would still be considered unethical due to the prohibition against sexual relationships with former clients."
