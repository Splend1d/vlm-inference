Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, venturing into the forest to pick mushrooms is generally not considered morally wrong unless it involves trespassing on private property or violating local laws or regulations. Assuming that the person has the right to be in the forest and is not causing harm, this action is typically seen as acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving a car off a bridge with one's family inside is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action would likely result in severe harm or death to the individuals involved and is considered a grave violation of moral and legal norms."
