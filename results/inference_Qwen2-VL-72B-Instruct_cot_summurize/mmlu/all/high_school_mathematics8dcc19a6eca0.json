Connecting these points forms a triangle.\n\n### Calculating the Area:\nThe base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercepts, which is \\(5 - (-1) = 6\\). The height of the triangle is the absolute value of the y-intercept, which is \\(\\left|-\\frac{5}{3}\\right| = \\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\):\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = 3 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon (triangle in this case) is \\(5\\), which corresponds to option A."
