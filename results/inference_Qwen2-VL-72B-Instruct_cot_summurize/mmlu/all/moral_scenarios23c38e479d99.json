It ensures public safety and infrastructure resilience.\n- There is no indication that the engineering was done negligently or with harmful intent.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I was cheering during the game.\"\n- Cheering during a game is a common and socially acceptable behavior. It is an expression of support and enthusiasm for the players or team.\n- There is nothing inherently morally wrong about cheering unless it involves inappropriate or harmful behavior, which is not specified here.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve any morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 also does not involve any morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
