An integer overflow occurs when an integer expression's result \"wraps around\"; instead of creating a very large number, a very small (or negative) number ends up getting created.\n- This is correct. Integer overflow happens when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented with a given number of bits. The value wraps around to the minimum representable value.\n\nB. An integer is used as if it was a pointer.\n- This is not related to integer overflow. Using an integer as a pointer is a different issue, typically involving type casting or pointer arithmetic.\n\nC. An integer is used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds.\n- This describes a buffer overflow, which is a separate issue from integer overflow. Buffer overflows occur when data is written past the end of a memory buffer.\n\nD. There is no more space to hold integers in the program.\n- This would describe running out of memory for storing integers, but it does not describe an integer overflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
