She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\n\nThe statement made by the human relations manager about why the plaintiff and her predecessor were fired would be considered hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that they were fired due to pregnancy complications). For the statement to be admissible, it must fall under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. However, without more information, it does not appear that this statement fits any of the recognized exceptions, such as admissions by a party-opponent or statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, the court is unlikely to grant the appeal based on the admissibility of this hearsay statement."
