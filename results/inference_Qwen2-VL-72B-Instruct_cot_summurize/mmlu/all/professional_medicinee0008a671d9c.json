Examination shows a mild hearing loss of the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acoustic neuroma\nB. Benign positional vertigo\nC.

This condition typically involves episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, accompanied by fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of pressure or fullness in the affected ear.\n\nLet's briefly review why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. **Acoustic neuroma**: This is a benign tumor that grows on the cranial nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain. While it can cause hearing loss and tinnitus, it usually does not present with episodic vertigo as described.\n\nB. **Benign positional vertigo (BPPV)**: This condition causes brief, intense episodes of vertigo triggered by specific changes in head position. It does not typically involve hearing loss, tinnitus, or a sense of fullness in the ear.\n\nC. **Brain stem transient ischemic attacks (TIA)**: These are temporary episodes of neurological dysfunction caused by lack of blood flow to part of the brain. They can cause dizziness and imbalance but usually do not include the auditory symptoms like hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\nGiven the combination of symptoms and the episodic nature of the patient's complaints, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**D. Meniere's disease**"
