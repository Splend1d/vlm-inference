The first question, \"what do you mean?\" seeks to clarify the concepts and terms being used in an argument or discussion. The second question, \"how do you know?\" asks for evidence or reasons to support a particular belief or claim. Together, these questions help philosophers to critically evaluate arguments and beliefs, and to develop a deeper understanding of the nature of knowledge and reality."
