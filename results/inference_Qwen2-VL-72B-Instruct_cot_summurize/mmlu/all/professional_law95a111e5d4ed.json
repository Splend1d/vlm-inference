The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nExplanation:\n- The nephew has a life estate because the grant specifies that the property is held \"for the life of my nephew.\" This means he has the right to use and enjoy the property during his lifetime.\n- The niece has a life estate pur autre vie because her interest is tied to the life of another person (the nephew). Her interest will continue as long as the nephew lives.\n- The gardener has a vested remainder because the grant specifies that after the life estates of the nephew and niece expire, the property will go to the gardener. This creates a future interest that is certain to vest upon the death of the nephew."
