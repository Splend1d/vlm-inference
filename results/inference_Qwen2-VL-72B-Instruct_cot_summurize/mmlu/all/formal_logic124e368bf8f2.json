This is represented as \\( E \\rightarrow F \\) or equivalently \\( E \\supset F \\).\n2. \"China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds\" translates to: If \\( S \\), then \\( C \\). This is represented as \\( S \\rightarrow C \\) or equivalently \\( S \\supset C \\).\n\nFinally, the sentence states that either one of these conditions must hold. Therefore, we use the disjunction (\u2228) to combine them:\n\n\\[ (E \\supset F) \\lor (S \\supset C) \\]\n\nNow, let's compare this with the provided options:\nA. \\( (E \\supset F) \\lor (S \\supset C) \\)\nB. \\( (F \\supset E) \\lor (C \\supset S) \\)\nC. \\( (E \\supset F) \\lor (C \\supset S) \\)\nD. \\( (F \\supset E) \\lor (S \\supset C) \\)\n\nOption A matches our derived expression exactly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. \\( (E \\supset F) \\lor (S \\supset C) \\)"
