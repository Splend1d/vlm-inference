Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nWhich other nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written here by Susan B.

                    "text": "To determine which nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written by Martin Luther King, Jr., in his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" let's analyze the key themes present in the excerpt:\n\n1. **Injustice**: King emphasizes the presence of injustice and the need to address it.\n2. **Interrelatedness of Communities**: He highlights the interconnectedness of all communities and states, suggesting that injustice in one place affects everyone.\n3. **Mutuality and Shared Destiny**: King argues for a sense of shared responsibility and mutual concern across different regions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these themes:\n\nA. **The temperance movement**: This movement focused on reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption. While it was a significant social reform movement, its primary focus was on alcohol rather than broader issues of injustice and community interdependence.\n\nB. **Utopian communities**: These were experimental communities aiming to create ideal societies. They often emphasized communal living and shared values but did not necessarily focus on addressing widespread injustice or the interconnectedness of communities outside their own.\n\nC. **The abolition movement**: This movement aimed to end slavery and advocated for racial equality. It frequently highlighted the moral imperative to fight against injustice and recognized the interconnectedness of communities, as the struggle against slavery was seen as a national issue affecting all Americans.\n\nD. **Public school advocates**: This movement focused on establishing free public education. While important, its primary concern was educational access rather than the broader themes of justice and community interdependence.\n\nGiven the themes of injustice, interrelatedness, and shared responsibility, the abolition movement aligns most closely with the arguments presented by Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. The abolition movement."
