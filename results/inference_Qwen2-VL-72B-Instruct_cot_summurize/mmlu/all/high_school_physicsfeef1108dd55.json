The temperature gradient itself is influenced by the length \\( \\ell \\) of the rod because it affects how quickly the temperature changes along the rod.\n\nTherefore, both the length and the area of the rod play roles in determining the rate of heat transfer.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Both the length and area"
