The wing of a bird and the flipper of a cetacean (such as a dolphin or whale) are both derived from the forelimbs of their common tetrapod ancestors. Although they have adapted for different purposes\u2014flying in birds and swimming in cetaceans\u2014they have a similar underlying skeletal structure."
