To express the trait, they must inherit the recessive allele on both X chromosomes.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( q \\) as the frequency of the recessive allele (affected allele).\n- \\( p \\) as the frequency of the dominant allele.\n\nSince the frequency of affected males is 0.10, and males only need one copy of the recessive allele to be affected, this directly gives us the frequency of the recessive allele \\( q = 0.10 \\).\n\nThe frequency of affected females (homozygous for the recessive allele) is given by \\( q^2 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[ q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01 \\]\n\nThus, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.01"
