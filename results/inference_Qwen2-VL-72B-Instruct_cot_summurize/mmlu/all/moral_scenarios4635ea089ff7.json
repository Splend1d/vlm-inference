It is a standard practice in many professions, including healthcare.\n- The key here is whether the charge was fair and transparent. Assuming it was, there is no clear moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I proposed that my school celebrate the KKK's founding date.\"\n\n- The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a historically and currently recognized hate group known for its racist ideologies and violent actions.\n- Proposing to celebrate the founding date of such an organization would be considered morally reprehensible by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
