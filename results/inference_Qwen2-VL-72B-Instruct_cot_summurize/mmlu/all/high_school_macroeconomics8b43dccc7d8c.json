                    "text": "To determine which statement is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table regarding the labor hours needed to produce a unit of wine and cheese in France and Belgium.\n\nFirst, let's define some terms:\n- **Absolute Advantage**: A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good if it can produce that good using fewer resources (in this case, labor hours) than another country.\n- **Comparative Advantage**: A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it can produce that good at a lower opportunity cost compared to another country.\n\n### Absolute Advantage Analysis:\n- For Wine:\n  - France: 40 hours\n  - Belgium: 15 hours\n  - Belgium has the absolute advantage in wine because it requires fewer labor hours (15 hours) compared to France (40 hours).\n\n- For Cheese:\n  - France: 80 hours\n  - Belgium: 60 hours\n  - Belgium also has the absolute advantage in cheese because it requires fewer labor hours (60 hours) compared to France (80 hours).\n\nSince Belgium has the absolute advantage in both products, option A (\"France has the absolute advantage in both products.\") is incorrect.\n\n### Comparative Advantage Analysis:\nTo determine comparative advantage, we calculate the opportunity cost for each country. Opportunity cost is the amount of one good that must be given up to produce one more unit of another good.\n\n- Opportunity Cost of Wine in France:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Opportunity Cost of Wine} = \\frac{\\text{Labor Hours for Cheese}}{\\text{Labor Hours for Wine}} = \\frac{80}{40} = 2 \\text{ units of cheese per unit of wine}\n  \\]\n\n- Opportunity Cost of Wine in Belgium:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Opportunity Cost of Wine} = \\frac{\\text{Labor Hours for Cheese}}{\\text{Labor Hours for Wine}} = \\frac{60}{15} = 4 \\text{ units of cheese per unit of wine}\n  \\]\n\n- Opportunity Cost of Cheese in France:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Opportunity Cost of Cheese} = \\frac{\\text{Labor Hours for Wine}}{\\text{Labor Hours for Cheese}} = \\frac{40}{80} = 0.5 \\text{ units of wine per unit of cheese}\n  \\]\n\n- Opportunity Cost of Cheese in Belgium:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Opportunity Cost of Cheese} = \\frac{\\text{Labor Hours for Wine}}{\\text{Labor Hours for Cheese}} = \\frac{15}{60} = 0.25 \\text{ units of wine per unit of cheese}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n- France has a lower opportunity cost in producing cheese (0.5 units of wine per unit of cheese) compared to Belgium (0.25 units of wine per unit of cheese), indicating that France has a comparative advantage in cheese.\n- Belgium has a lower opportunity cost in producing wine (4 units of cheese per unit of wine) compared to France (2 units of cheese per unit of wine), indicating that Belgium has a comparative advantage in wine.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**C. France has the comparative advantage in cheese.**"
