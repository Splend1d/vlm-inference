Since \\(Q\\) appears in the denominator of the natural logarithm term in the Nernst equation, increasing \\(Q\\) will decrease the value of \\(-\\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q\\), leading to an increase in \\(E\\).\n\nB. **Adding more Fe(s)**\n   - Adding more solid iron does not change the concentration of any species in solution because solids do not have concentrations that affect the equilibrium. Therefore, this does not affect the cell potential.\n\nC. **Decreasing [Fe2+]**\n   - Decreasing the concentration of \\(\\text{Fe}^{2+}\\) decreases \\(Q\\). Since \\(Q\\) appears in the denominator of the natural logarithm term in the Nernst equation, decreasing \\(Q\\) will increase the value of \\(-\\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q\\), leading to a decrease in \\(E\\).\n\nD. **Removing some Fe(s)**\n   - Similar to adding more solid iron, removing some solid iron does not change the concentration of any species in solution. Therefore, this does not affect the cell potential.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Increasing [Fe2+]**"
