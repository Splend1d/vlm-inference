They must be used cautiously because they can lead to physical and psychological dependence if taken regularly over a long period or in high doses. Dependence can result in withdrawal symptoms when the medication is stopped. Additionally, benzodiazepines can interact with other substances, such as alcohol, increasing the risk of adverse effects."
