The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\n\nExplanation:\nStarch and cellulose are both polysaccharides made up of glucose monomers, but they differ in their structure due to the way these monomers are linked together. In starch, the glucose units are linked by alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which form a helical structure that can be easily broken down by enzymes in the human digestive system. In contrast, cellulose has beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which result in a linear structure that is more rigid and resistant to digestion by human enzymes. This structural difference is the primary reason why humans can digest starch but not cellulose."
