                    "text": "To determine the cause of the large percent difference between the predicted velocity and the measured velocity, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The ball changes its shape while falling.**\n   - Changing shape could affect the aerodynamics of the ball, but it is unlikely to significantly alter the acceleration due to gravity or the overall motion in such a short distance.\n\nB. **The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.**\n   - The acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) on Earth) does not vary significantly over small distances like 6 meters. This can be ruled out as a significant factor.\n\nC. **Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.**\n   - Air resistance typically acts against the direction of motion, reducing the acceleration rather than increasing it. Therefore, this option would not explain why the measured velocity is lower than the predicted one.\n\nD. **The acceleration of the ball varies with the velocity.**\n   - This option suggests that air resistance is affecting the ball's acceleration. As the ball falls faster, air resistance increases, which reduces the net acceleration below the free-fall acceleration due to gravity. This would result in a lower terminal velocity than expected without considering air resistance.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most plausible explanation for the large percent difference between the predicted and measured velocities is:\n\n**D. The acceleration of the ball varies with the velocity.**\n\nThis indicates that air resistance is causing the actual acceleration to be less than the theoretical value calculated assuming no air resistance."
