Liberalism holds that international organisations can enhance national and international security. It advocates the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities.\nB. The liberalist advocacy of cooperation as enhancing security is undermined by the failure of international organisations such as the league of nations in preventing global conflicts.\nC. Under liberalism's different schools of thought, there is a general consensus that the involvement of international organisations in the political system ultimately undermines security by disempowering the state as a unitary actor.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Liberalists generally believe that international institutions and organisations can foster cooperation among states, reduce the likelihood of conflict, and promote peace and security. They also support the involvement of non-state actors like NGOs to further these goals."
