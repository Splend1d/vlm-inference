The enforcement provision of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the amendment through appropriate legislation. The Fourteenth Amendment includes the Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This clause is often used as a basis for federal civil rights legislation aimed at preventing discrimination, including racial discrimination in housing. Therefore, Congress could use its authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact such a statute."
