The presence of numerous neutrophils with intracellular gram-negative diplococci on a Gram stain is characteristic of this bacterial infection.\n\nAntigenic variation is a property of N. gonorrhoeae that allows it to change its surface antigens, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and eliminate the bacteria effectively. This can lead to recurrent infections, as the immune system may not be able to mount an effective response against the altered antigens. Therefore, option A is the correct choice in explaining the reinfection.\n\nOptions B (catalase), C (inhibition of B-lymphocyte function), and D (inhibition of T-lymphocyte function) do not directly explain the mechanism of reinfection in this context."
