It does not generate external income but rather supports the local population. Therefore, it is a non-basic job.\n\nB. **Social worker**: Social workers provide support and services to individuals and families within the local community. They do not generate external income but rather serve the local population. Thus, this is also a non-basic job.\n\nC. **Dry cleaner**: Dry cleaning services cater to the local residents' needs for laundry and garment care. These services do not generate external income but rather serve the local population. Hence, this is a non-basic job.\n\nD. **Garment factory worker**: Garment factories often produce goods for sale outside the local area, contributing to the local economy through exports. This type of work generates external income and thus is considered a basic job.\n\nTherefore, the job that is NOT a non-basic job is:\n\n**D. garment factory worker.**"
