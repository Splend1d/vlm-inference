Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars.\n\nAsteroids are typically detected in sky surveys by their apparent motion against the background of relatively stationary stars. As asteroids orbit the Sun, they move across the sky at different rates depending on their distance from Earth and the Sun. This motion can be observed over short periods, such as hours or days, allowing astronomers to distinguish asteroids from stars, which appear fixed in position over these timescales."
