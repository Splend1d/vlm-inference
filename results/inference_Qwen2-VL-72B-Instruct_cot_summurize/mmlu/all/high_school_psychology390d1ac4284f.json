After a time, the dogs salivated in response to the presenter (CR).\n\nIn Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning experiment, the food is the Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS), which naturally triggers the Unconditioned Response (UCR) of salivation. The sights and sounds of the presenter are the Conditioned Stimuli (CS), which over time come to elicit the Conditioned Response (CR) of salivation when they are repeatedly paired with the UCS."
