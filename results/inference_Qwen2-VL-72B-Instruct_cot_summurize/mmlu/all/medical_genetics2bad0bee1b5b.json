Here, \"Asp\" stands for aspartic acid (the amino acid with the abbreviation D), and \"Phe\" stands for phenylalanine (the amino acid with the abbreviation F). The number 235 indicates the position in the protein sequence where this substitution occurs. Therefore, \"Asp235Phe\" means that at position 235 in the protein, an aspartic acid residue has been replaced by a phenylalanine residue."
