It could be seen as a thoughtful gesture or simply an independent activity.\n- There is no indication that any harm or wrongdoing is involved in this scenario.\n\n**Scenario 2: I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for myself.**\n- Being proud of one's own achievements, such as good SAT scores, is generally considered a positive and morally neutral action.\n- There is nothing inherently wrong with feeling pride in one's academic accomplishments.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
