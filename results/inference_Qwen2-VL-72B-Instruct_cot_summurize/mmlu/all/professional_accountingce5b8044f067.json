Finally, we'll divide the net profit by the initial investment to find the percentage yield.\n\nLet's break down the calculations step-by-step:\n\n1. **Daily Revenue Calculation:**\n   - Hourly rental rate: $245\n   - Average hours per day: 2 hours\n   - Daily revenue = $245 * 2 = $490\n\n2. **Annual Revenue Calculation:**\n   - Days in a year: 365 days\n   - Annual revenue = $490 * 365 = $178,550\n\n3. **Daily Costs Calculation:**\n   - Daily costs: $50\n   - Annual costs = $50 * 365 = $18,250\n\n4. **Net Profit Calculation:**\n   - Net profit = Annual revenue - Annual costs\n   - Net profit = $178,550 - $18,250 = $160,300\n\n5. **Yield on Investment Calculation:**\n   - Initial investment: $98,000\n   - Yield on investment (percentage) = (Net profit / Initial investment) * 100\n   - Yield on investment = ($160,300 / $98,000) * 100 \u2248 163.57%\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is approximately 163.57%.\n\nThe closest option to this calculated value is:\n\n**A. 164%**"
