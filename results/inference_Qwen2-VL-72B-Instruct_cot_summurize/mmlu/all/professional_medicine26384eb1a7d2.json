The daughter says, \"I visited Mom today for the first time in 6 months; her memory has worsened, her bills are unpaid, and her house is unusually messy.\" The patient says, \"I'm perfectly healthy.\" Medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed more than 25 years ago, and two small strokes occurring 3 years and 7 months ago. The daughter gives you three empty medicine bottles from her mother's home: metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and aspirin. The patient is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4\u00b0C (97.6\u00b0F), pulse 76/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 196/112 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Muscle strength in her left hand is 1/5. Strength in the right extremities is 4/5. The patient is oriented only to self; she does not know the day of the week or today's date. She recalls 0 of 3 words at 5 minutes, and she is unable to name 2 objects, correctly draw interlocking pentagons, or count backwards by serial sevens. Complete blood count, renal function studies, liver function studies, and urinalysis are all within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nB. Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration\nC. Neurosyphilis\nD. Vascular dementia\n"

Vascular dementia.\n\nVascular dementia is a type of dementia caused by impaired blood flow to the brain, often due to a series of small strokes or other conditions that affect the blood vessels in the brain. The patient's history of hypertension and previous strokes, along with her cognitive decline, memory loss, and physical symptoms such as muscle weakness, are consistent with vascular dementia. The other options listed do not fit the clinical presentation as well:\n\nA. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) primarily affects motor neurons and typically presents with progressive muscle weakness and atrophy without the cognitive decline described.\nB. Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that can cause movement disorders and cognitive impairment but usually has a different pattern of symptoms and progression.\nC. Neurosyphilis would require a history of syphilis infection and typically presents with a different constellation of neurological symptoms, including psychiatric changes and meningitis-like symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient's history and current presentation, vascular dementia is the most plausible diagnosis. Further diagnostic workup, including imaging studies like MRI or CT scans, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes."
