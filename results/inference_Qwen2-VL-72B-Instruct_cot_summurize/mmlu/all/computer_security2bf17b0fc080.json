As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called.\n\nLocal variables are typically allocated on the stack, which is a region of memory used for storing temporary data during the execution of a function. When a function is called, space is allocated on the stack for its local variables, and when the function returns, this space is deallocated. Because the exact location of a local variable on the stack can vary depending on when the function is called, the compiler cannot know the absolute address of the variable at compile time. Instead, the compiler generates code that accesses the variable relative to the current stack frame pointer, which allows the code to work correctly regardless of the specific location of the variable on the stack.\n"
