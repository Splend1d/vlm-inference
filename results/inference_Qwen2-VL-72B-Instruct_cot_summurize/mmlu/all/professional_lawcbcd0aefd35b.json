I absolutely did not drive erratically.\" On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks, \"Isn't it true you lied in your divorce trial last year?\" If Jones' attorney objects, the court will likely hold the prosecutor's question is\n\nA.

Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.\n\nIn legal proceedings, the rules of evidence generally prohibit the use of extrinsic evidence (evidence from outside the current proceeding) to prove specific instances of conduct for the purpose of attacking a witness's character for truthfulness. This rule is designed to prevent the introduction of potentially prejudicial information that could distract from the issues at hand.\n\nHowever, if the witness has testified about their own good character or truthfulness, then the opposing party may introduce evidence of specific instances of conduct to rebut that testimony. In this case, since Jones testified that he is an honest person, the prosecutor might be able to introduce evidence of specific instances of dishonesty to challenge his credibility. But this would typically require the prosecutor to follow specific procedures and rules regarding the admissibility of such evidence.\n\nTherefore, while the prosecutor's question might be aimed at challenging Jones' credibility, the method used (asking about a past instance of lying without proper foundation) is generally not admissible under the rules of evidence."
