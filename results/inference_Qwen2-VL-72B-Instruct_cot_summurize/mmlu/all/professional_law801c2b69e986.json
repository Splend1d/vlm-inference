Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

This could potentially make both individuals liable under the doctrine of apparent authority or estoppel.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n- **Option A: Only Bob Wilson is liable.**\n  - This option does not account for the apparent partnership created by Bob Wilson's actions and Ted Lamar's acquiescence.\n\n- **Option B: Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.**\n  - This option aligns with the apparent partnership created by Bob Wilson's actions and the reasonable belief of Pete Smith that both were partners.\n\n- **Option C: Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.**\n  - This option suggests a secondary liability for Ted Lamar, which may not fully capture the apparent partnership created.\n\n- **Option D: Only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.**\n  - This option implies that the partnership itself is liable, but it does not specify individual liability, which might be less clear than stating joint liability directly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most appropriate advice to Pete Smith would be:\n\n**B. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.**\n\nThis option best reflects the apparent partnership created by Bob Wilson's actions and the reasonable belief of Pete Smith that both were partners in the business."
