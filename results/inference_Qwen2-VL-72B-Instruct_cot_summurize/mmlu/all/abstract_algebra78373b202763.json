Then there exist \\( b_1, b_2 \\in B \\) with \\( b_1 \\neq b_2 \\) such that \\( g(b_1) = g(b_2) \\). Let \\( a_1 = g(b_1) \\) and \\( a_2 = g(b_2) \\). Since \\( g(b_1) = g(b_2) \\), we have \\( a_1 = a_2 \\).\n\nNow consider \\( f(a_1) \\) and \\( f(a_2) \\):\n\\[ g(f(a_1)) = a_1 \\]\n\\[ g(f(a_2)) = a_2 \\]\n\nSince \\( a_1 = a_2 \\), it follows that:\n\\[ g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2)) \\]\n\nBut this implies:\n\\[ f(a_1) = f(a_2) \\]\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that \\( g \\) is not injective because if \\( g \\) were not injective, then \\( f \\) would also not be well-defined due to the contradiction in the equality of elements in \\( A \\). Therefore, \\( g \\) must be injective.\n\n### Statement 2: The function \\( g \\) must necessarily be surjective.\nSurjectivity (or onto property) means that for every \\( a \\in A \\), there exists a \\( b \\in B \\) such that \\( g(b) = a \\).\n\nGiven that \\( g(f(a)) = a \\) for all \\( a \\in A \\), it directly implies that for every element \\( a \\) in \\( A \\), there exists an element \\( f(a) \\) in \\( B \\) such that \\( g(f(a)) = a \\). This shows that \\( g \\) maps every element in \\( A \\) to some element in \\( B \\) and back to itself, hence \\( g \\) is surjective.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.
