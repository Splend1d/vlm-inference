On May 1, the collector sent the following letter to a retailer who had long coveted the collector's coin collection:\"I've decided to part with my coin collection. Since you've always been interested in purchasing my collection for your store, I'll sell you my entire collection for $50,000. You have until May 15 to make up your mind. \"The retailer received this letter on May 3. On May 10, without notif'ing the retailer, the collector sold her coin collection to a novice collector, for $60,000. The next day, the collector sent a letter to the retailer, regretfully informing him that she had sold the coin collection. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12. In all likelihood was the retailer's e-mail to the collector on May 12 effective as an acceptance?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.\nB. Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.\nC. No, because the collector's sale of the coin collection on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\nD. No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the retailer's email to the collector on May 12 was effective as an acceptance, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Initial Offer**: On May 1, the collector offered to sell the coin collection to the retailer for $50,000, giving the retailer until May 15 to decide.\n2. **Receipt of Offer**: The retailer received the offer on May 3.\n3. **Sale to Novice Collector**: On May 10, the collector sold the coin collection to a novice collector for $60,000.\n4. **Notification of Sale**: On May 11, the collector sent a letter to the retailer informing them about the sale. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13.\n5. **Article Publication**: On May 12, the retailer read an article online about the sale of the coin collection to the novice collector.\n6. **Acceptance Attempt**: On May 12, after reading the article, the retailer sent an email to the collector accepting the offer to buy the coin collection.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Revocation of Offer**: The collector's sale of the coin collection to the novice collector on May 10 effectively revoked the original offer made to the retailer. According to common law principles, once an offeror sells the subject matter of the offer to a third party, the offer is terminated, and the offeree (in this case, the retailer) no longer has the power to accept the offer.\n  \n- **Effectiveness of Acceptance**: For an acceptance to be valid, it must occur while the offer is still open and before it has been revoked. Since the offer was revoked by the sale on May 10, any attempt at acceptance after that date would be ineffective.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the collector's sale of the coin collection on May 10 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that the sale of the coin collection to a third party effectively revoked the original offer, thereby terminating the retailer's power to accept the offer."
