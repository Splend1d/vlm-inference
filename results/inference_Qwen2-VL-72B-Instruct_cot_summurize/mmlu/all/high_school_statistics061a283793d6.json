This is particularly important for small sample sizes (like the five applicants in each group in this case), as the t-distribution is used to estimate the sampling distribution of the difference between the means when the population standard deviations are unknown and the sample sizes are small.\n\nWhile options A and B relate to whether the population variances are known or unknown, these do not directly affect the necessity of assuming normality for the t-test. Option C, which states that the population variances from the two groups are equal, is an assumption for certain types of t-tests (e.g., the pooled t-test), but it is not a necessary assumption for all t-tests. For instance, if the variances are unequal, a Welch's t-test can be used instead, which does not assume equal variances.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental assumption that must hold for the validity of the t-test in this scenario is that the populations of SAT scores from both groups are normally distributed."
