This meant extending the right to vote to all adult males, regardless of property ownership or social status. The movement's goals were outlined in the People's Charter of 1838, which included demands such as secret ballots, equal electoral districts, and annual parliamentary elections. While the movement did address broader social and economic issues, its central focus was on political reform and expanding voting rights for men."
