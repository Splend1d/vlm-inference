Therefore, the correct symbolization is:\n\nB \u2283 W\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. B \u2283 W - This correctly represents the conditional statement.\nB. W \u2283 B - This would mean \"If Beth gets to work earlier, then she rides her bike,\" which is not what the original sentence states.\nC. B \u2261 W - This would mean \"Beth rides her bike if and only if she gets to work earlier,\" which is a biconditional statement and does not match the original sentence.\nD. Both A and B - This is incorrect because only one of them matches the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is:\n\nA. B \u2283 W"
