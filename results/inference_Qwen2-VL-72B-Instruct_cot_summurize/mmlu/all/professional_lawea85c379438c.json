During the party, the defendant invited the victim into his bedroom to show her his tattoos. When she entered his bedroom, the defendant ripped off her blouse and threw her onto his bed. He then jumped on the victim and tried to pull off her skirt. When the victim began to scream, some of the guests rushed into the bedroom and pulled the defendant off the victim. At trial, the defendant testified that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with the victim but he believed that she was consenting. The defendant further testified that he had consumed a pint of whiskey earlier in the evening and was intoxicated at the time the incident occurred. If the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because consent is determined by the objective manifestations of the victim and not the subjective beliefs of the defendant.\nB. guilty, because voluntary intoxication is no defense.\nC. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\nD. not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n"

Consent must be freely given, informed, and voluntary. It is typically evaluated based on the objective manifestations of the victim, such as words or actions indicating agreement, rather than the subjective beliefs of the defendant. \n\nThe defendant's intoxication does not provide a legal defense for the crime of attempted rape. Voluntary intoxication generally does not excuse criminal conduct, particularly when it comes to crimes involving specific intent, like attempted rape. The defendant's belief about the victim's consent is irrelevant if the victim did not actually consent.\n\nTherefore, if the jury finds that the victim did not consent, the defendant's subjective belief that she was consenting would not absolve him of guilt. The defendant's intoxication does not change this fact."
