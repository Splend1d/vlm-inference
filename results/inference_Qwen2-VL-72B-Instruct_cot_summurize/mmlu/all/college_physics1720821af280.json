                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the frequency of sound waves in a pipe changes with temperature. The frequency of sound waves in a pipe depends on the speed of sound and the length of the pipe. When the temperature decreases, the speed of sound also decreases, which affects the frequency at which the pipe resonates.\n\nThe speed of sound in air can be approximated by the formula:\n\n\\[ v = 331 + 0.6T \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in meters per second and \\( T \\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is approximately:\n\n\\[ v_{20} = 331 + 0.6 \\times 20 = 331 + 12 = 343 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nOn a particularly cold day, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C. Therefore, the new speed of sound \\( v_{cold} \\) is:\n\n\\[ v_{cold} = v_{20} - 0.03 \\times v_{20} \\]\n\\[ v_{cold} = 343 - 0.03 \\times 343 \\]\n\\[ v_{cold} = 343 - 10.29 \\]\n\\[ v_{cold} = 332.71 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nThe frequency of sound waves in a pipe open at both ends is given by:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{n \\cdot v}{2L} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the frequency, \\( n \\) is the harmonic number (for the fundamental frequency, \\( n = 1 \\)), \\( v \\) is the speed of sound, and \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe.\n\nSince the length of the pipe \\( L \\) remains constant, the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound. Therefore, if the speed of sound decreases by 3%, the frequency will also decrease by 3%.\n\nThe original frequency \\( f_{20} \\) is 440 Hz. The new frequency \\( f_{cold} \\) is:\n\n\\[ f_{cold} = f_{20} - 0.03 \\times f_{20} \\]\n\\[ f_{cold} = 440 - 0.03 \\times 440 \\]\n\\[ f_{cold} = 440 - 13.2 \\]\n\\[ f_{cold} = 426.8 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 427 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 427 Hz."
