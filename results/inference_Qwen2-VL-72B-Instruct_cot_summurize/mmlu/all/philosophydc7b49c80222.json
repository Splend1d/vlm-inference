Hare's concept of \"prescriptivism\" in ethics, which suggests that moral statements are prescriptions or recommendations rather than factual claims. According to Hare, if two people agree on the meaning of \"ought,\" their disagreements about what one ought to do would stem from differing views on the relevant facts of the situation, not from differing meanings of the term itself."
