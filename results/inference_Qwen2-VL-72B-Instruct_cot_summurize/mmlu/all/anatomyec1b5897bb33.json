Pupillary constriction and vasodilation of facial vessels\n\nDamage to the cervical sympathetic chain can lead to Horner's syndrome, which includes signs such as pupillary constriction (miosis), ptosis (drooping eyelid), and vasodilation of facial vessels leading to a flushed appearance on the affected side of the face. Increased facial sweating and decreased lacrimation are not typically associated with Horner's syndrome."
