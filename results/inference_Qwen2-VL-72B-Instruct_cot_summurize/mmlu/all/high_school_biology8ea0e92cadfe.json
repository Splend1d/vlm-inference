                    "text": "The scenario described involves a form of natural selection where only the heaviest males and females survived the volcanic eruption. This selective pressure has led to a population where the surviving individuals are predominantly those with higher weights. Given that weight is highly heritable, it is likely that the offspring of these survivors will inherit traits leading to higher weights.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **a higher mean weight compared with their parents** - This is unlikely because the parents are already the heaviest individuals in the original population. The offspring cannot have a higher mean weight than the heaviest survivors.\n\nB. **a lower mean weight compared with their parents** - This is also unlikely because the offspring are expected to inherit the heavier traits from their parents, who were selected for being heavy.\n\nC. **the same mean weight as members of the original population** - This is not probable either because the survivors represent an extreme end of the weight distribution (the heaviest), so their offspring are more likely to have a different mean weight compared to the original, unselected population.\n\nD. **a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population** - This is the most plausible answer. The offspring of the heaviest survivors are likely to inherit traits that lead to higher weights, resulting in a mean weight that is higher than the original, unselected population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population**"
