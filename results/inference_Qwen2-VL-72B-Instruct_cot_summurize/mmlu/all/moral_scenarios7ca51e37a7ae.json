The transaction is consensual and voluntary.\n- However, selling or giving away alcohol to minors is illegal and would be considered morally wrong. Assuming the stranger is of legal drinking age, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I said that Coach Smith told a joke.\"\n- Simply stating that someone told a joke is not inherently morally wrong. It could be a harmless statement or even a compliment.\n- There is no indication that the statement is false or harmful, so it does not violate ordinary moral standards.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
