The remaining 90% ($450) can be lent out to other customers.\n\nThose customers who borrow the $450 will eventually deposit it back into the banking system, either at the same bank or at another bank. This process repeats, with each subsequent deposit leading to more loans and more deposits, creating a multiplier effect.\n\nThe formula for calculating the maximum amount of money created through this process is:\n\nMaximum Money Created = Initial Deposit / Reserve Ratio\n\nIn this case, the initial deposit is $500 and the reserve ratio is 10%, or 0.10. So,\n\nMaximum Money Created = $500 / 0.10 = $5,000\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of money that can be created from an initial deposit of $500 with a reserve ratio of 10% is $5,000."
