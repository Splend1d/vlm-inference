Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage above most directly reflect those of which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which political ideas Geraldine Ferraro's speech most closely reflects, let's analyze the key points she makes:\n\n1. **Fairness in Taxation**: Ferraro criticizes the current administration for rigging the tax system against individuals while benefiting large corporations. This suggests a concern for economic fairness and equity.\n\n2. **Social Responsibility**: She mentions the need for a vision where young couples feel secure enough to start families, indicating a broader concern for social welfare and security.\n\n3. **Reclaiming the Dream**: Ferraro speaks about reclaiming the American dream, implying a desire to restore or enhance opportunities for all Americans.\n\n4. **Empowerment of Women**: She emphasizes the potential contributions women can make to America, advocating for gender equality and empowerment.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Colonial opponents of British taxation in the 1760s and 1770s**: While there is a mention of unfair taxation, the broader context of Ferraro's speech does not align with the colonial opposition to British rule.\n\nB. **Abolitionists of the antebellum period**: Ferraro's speech does not focus on the abolition of slavery or racial equality, so this option does not fit well.\n\nC. **Republicans of the 1920s**: The 1920s were characterized by laissez-faire economics and a focus on business interests, which contrasts with Ferraro's emphasis on fairness and social responsibility.\n\nD. **New Dealers of the 1930s**: The New Deal era under Franklin D. Roosevelt was marked by significant government intervention to address economic inequality, promote social welfare, and provide opportunities for all Americans. Ferraro's concerns about fair taxation, social responsibility, and reclaiming the American dream align closely with New Deal principles.\n\nTherefore, the political ideas expressed by Ferraro most directly reflect those of the New Dealers of the 1930s.\n\n**Final Answer: D. New Dealers of the 1930s**"
