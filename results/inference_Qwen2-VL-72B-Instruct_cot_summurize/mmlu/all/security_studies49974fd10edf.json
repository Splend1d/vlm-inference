All of these options.\n\nThe concept of 'deepening and broadening' in security studies refers to an expansion of the traditional understanding of security beyond just military threats to include a wider range of issues that can affect the safety and well-being of individuals and societies. This includes:\n\nA. The nexus between identity and security - recognizing how cultural, ethnic, and religious identities can influence security dynamics.\nB. War, the military, and the sovereign state - traditional aspects of security but often re-examined in the context of new threats and changing power structures.\nC. Environmental changes - understanding how environmental issues such as climate change, natural disasters, and resource scarcity can impact security.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are considered part of the 'deepening and broadening' of security."
