Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine whether the neighbor will recover the $50 after the man's attempted revocation, we need to analyze the elements of contract law involved in this scenario.\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The man made an offer to pay $50 if the neighbor would mow his lawn. This is a unilateral contract where the acceptance is by performing the act (mowing the lawn).\n\n2. **Revocation**: The man revoked his offer before the neighbor completed the task. In unilateral contracts, the offeror can revoke the offer at any time before the offeree completes the performance.\n\n3. **Partial Performance**: The neighbor purchased gasoline and started the mower but did not complete the mowing. This constitutes preparation or partial performance rather than full performance.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A**: This suggests that the offer became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation. However, in unilateral contracts, the offer remains revocable until the performance is completed. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option B**: This refers to the doctrine of quasi-contract, which applies when one party benefits from another's work without a formal contract. Here, the neighbor has not fully performed the service, so the doctrine of quasi-contract does not apply. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: This states that the man's revocation was effective because the neighbor had not completed performance. This aligns with the principles of unilateral contracts, where revocation is valid before completion of performance. Hence, this option is correct.\n\n- **Option D**: This suggests that the neighbor had only prepared to accept the offer and not performed any part of it. While the neighbor did purchase gasoline and start the mower, this preparation does not constitute performance. Therefore, this option is partially correct but less precise than Option C.\n\n**Final Answer: C. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.**"
