This type of behavior is characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which involves both obsessions (repetitive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors).\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nC. obsessive\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a proper diagnosis should be made by a mental health professional who can evaluate the full range of symptoms and their impact on the individual's life.
