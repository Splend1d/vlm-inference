This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

However, the landscaper breached the contract by stopping the work after four months and taking another job.\n\nTo determine the likely outcome in a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, we need to consider principles of contract law, specifically focusing on damages and unjust enrichment.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Homeowner's Loss:**\n   - The homeowner expected six months of landscaping services for $1,800.\n   - The homeowner received four months of service, which would be valued at $1,200 (4 months * $300/month).\n   - The homeowner still needs two more months of service, which would cost an additional $600 (2 months * $300/month).\n\n2. **Landscaper's Performance:**\n   - The landscaper provided four months of service, which is worth $1,200.\n   - The landscaper did not fulfill the remaining two months of the contract.\n\n### Legal Principles:\n- **Damages:** The homeowner can seek compensation for the breach of contract. The homeowner could claim the cost to hire another landscaper to complete the remaining two months of work, which is $600.\n- **Unjust Enrichment:** The landscaper may argue that they should be compensated for the work already performed. However, since the homeowner has not yet paid anything, there is no unjust enrichment from the homeowner\u2019s perspective.\n\n### Likely Result:\nGiven these considerations, the homeowner would likely be entitled to recover the cost of completing the remaining two months of work, which is $600. The landscaper would not be entitled to payment for the work already performed because they breached the contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.**"
