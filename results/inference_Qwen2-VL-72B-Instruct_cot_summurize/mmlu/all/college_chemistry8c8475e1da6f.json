Potassium hydrogen phthalate\n\nPotassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) is commonly used as a primary standard in acid-base titrations, particularly for standardizing bases like sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. It is chosen because it is stable, readily available in high purity, and has a known stoichiometry in reactions with bases."
