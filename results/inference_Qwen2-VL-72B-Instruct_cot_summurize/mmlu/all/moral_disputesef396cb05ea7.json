                    "text": "To determine which option represents the problematic \"hidden assumption\" of harm arguments against homosexuality that Corvino identifies, we need to understand the context and core of his argument.\n\nCorvino's critique often centers around the idea that harm arguments against homosexuality mistakenly assume that any risk associated with homosexual practices makes them inherently immoral or imprudent. This assumption overlooks the fact that many other activities also carry risks but are not condemned in the same way.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is moral, prudent, or otherwise to be pursued.**\n   - This statement suggests that riskier practices should be pursued, which doesn't align with Corvino's critique. His concern is about practices being deemed immoral due to their risks, not about promoting risky behaviors.\n\nB. **If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.**\n   - This statement aligns closely with Corvino's critique. It reflects the assumption that any increased risk automatically makes a practice immoral or imprudent, which is the hidden assumption he argues against.\n\nC. **If a practice is safer than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.**\n   - This statement is contradictory and doesn't make logical sense. It suggests avoiding practices simply because they are safer, which doesn't fit into Corvino's critique.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option would imply that none of the provided statements capture the hidden assumption Corvino critiques, which is not accurate based on the analysis above.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. If a practice is riskier than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided.**"
