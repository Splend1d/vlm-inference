May cause oesophageal obstruction\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus characterized by an abnormal number of eosinophils in the esophageal tissue. This condition can lead to various symptoms and complications, including difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), food impaction, and esophageal strictures or narrowing, which may result in obstruction. Antacid therapy is generally not effective for EoE; instead, treatments often involve topical corticosteroids, dietary modifications, and dilation procedures."
