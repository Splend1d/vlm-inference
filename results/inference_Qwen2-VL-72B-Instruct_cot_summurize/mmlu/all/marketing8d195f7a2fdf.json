Marketing intelligence is crucial for making informed decisions in marketing strategies.\n\nB. **Develop sales tactics** - While sales tactics are closely related to marketing, they are more specifically focused on the immediate actions taken to sell products or services. Sales tactics can be seen as part of the broader marketing strategy but are often executed by the sales team rather than the marketing department.\n\nC. **Develop the customer proposition** - This involves creating a unique value proposition that differentiates a product or service from competitors and appeals to target customers. It is a core aspect of marketing strategy.\n\nD. **Work with other business functions and third parties** - Collaboration across departments and with external partners is essential for effective marketing. This includes working with finance, operations, and other teams to ensure alignment and success.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not primarily considered a marketing function according to the British Government is:\n\n**B. Develop sales tactics**\n\nThis is because sales tactics are typically handled by the sales department, although they are closely aligned with marketing strategies."
