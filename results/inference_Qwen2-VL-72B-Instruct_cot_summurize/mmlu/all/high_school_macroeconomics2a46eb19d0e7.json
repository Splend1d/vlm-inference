Medium of exchange\n\nIn this scenario, the individuals need a way to exchange their goods for what they want without having to engage in direct barter (i.e., Kevin trading shoes for turnips, Lisa trading turnips for sheet metal, and Bob trading sheet metal for shoes). Money serves as a medium of exchange, allowing each person to sell what they have for money and then use that money to buy what they want from someone else. This eliminates the need for a double coincidence of wants and makes transactions more efficient."
