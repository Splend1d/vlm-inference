The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered as an issue of high security politics.\nB. Environmental security has led to a 'trading off' of military security for environmental security with the allocation of resources committed to solving environmental problems. A particular emphasis has been placed on environmental change as the cause of violent conflict and addressing environmental threats from other factors than domestic causes.\nC. The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security.\nD. The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.\n"

This statement suggests that environmental security concerns have been successfully integrated into the high-level political agenda, leading to increased recognition and prioritization by policymakers and agencies. While this may be true to some extent, it oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and ignores potential challenges and limitations.\n\nB. This option highlights the trade-offs between military and environmental security, emphasizing the allocation of resources towards environmental problems. However, it does not fully capture the nuances of securitization, which involves more than just resource allocation.\n\nC. This statement accurately reflects the idea of securitization, where environmental issues are framed as matters of high politics, raising their profile among policymakers. However, it also acknowledges the limited impact on actual policy and action, indicating that while the issue has gained attention, concrete changes may be lacking.\n\nD. This option argues that the national security perspective on environmental issues has hindered the effectiveness of environmental security as a concept. It suggests that the militarization of environmental problems has made it difficult for policymakers to address the underlying vulnerabilities and complexities associated with environmental issues.\n\nIn summary, the environment has indeed been securitized to some extent, but the effects vary. While it has raised awareness and prioritization among policymakers, translating this into meaningful policy and action remains a challenge. The national security perspective on environmental issues may also limit the effectiveness of addressing environmental security concerns."
