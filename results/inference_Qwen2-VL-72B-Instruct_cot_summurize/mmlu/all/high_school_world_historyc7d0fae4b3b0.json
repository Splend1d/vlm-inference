They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas\nC. The Industrial Revolution\nD.

                    "text": "To determine which development most directly undid the trade patterns described in the first paragraph, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants**: This would likely enhance trade rather than undo it, as it would provide new opportunities for exchange.\n\nB. **Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas**: While these revolutions had significant political and social impacts, they do not directly relate to the specific trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan described in the text.\n\nC. **The Industrial Revolution**: The Industrial Revolution led to significant changes in production methods and increased demand for raw materials. It also facilitated the rise of new trading powers and the expansion of global trade networks. This could have disrupted traditional trade routes and patterns by introducing new products and altering the balance of trade.\n\nD. **The colonization of Africa**: While colonization had profound effects on global politics and economics, it does not directly address the specific trade dynamics between Portugal, China, and Japan.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, which focuses on the trade of specific goods like silk, gold, musk, porcelain, and silver, the development that most directly impacted these trade patterns would be one that introduced new products or altered the demand for existing ones. The Industrial Revolution fits this description best, as it transformed production and consumption patterns globally.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The Industrial Revolution**"
