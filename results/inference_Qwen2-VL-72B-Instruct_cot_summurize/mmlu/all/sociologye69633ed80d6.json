Ethnic communities, based on shared identity and experiences of discrimination - These are well-recognized forms of communities that have existed for a long time.\n\nB. Gay villages, which are formed in certain parts of large cities - These are also recognized as modern forms of communities, particularly in urban settings.\n\nC. Sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers - This option seems unusual and does not fit the typical definition of a community. Communities usually form around shared interests, identities, or experiences, not necessarily around unpopular lecturers.\n\nD. Virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace - These are widely recognized as new forms of communities due to the rise of the internet and social media platforms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not identified as a new form of community is:\n\nC. Sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers"
