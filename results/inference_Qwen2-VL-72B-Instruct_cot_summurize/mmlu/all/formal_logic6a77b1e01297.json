If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons.\n4. And we don't want to build more prisons.\n\nThe first statement (\"We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.\") is the main claim that the rest of the argument supports. The subsequent statements provide reasons why we should not abolish capital punishment: it would lead to overcrowded prisons, which in turn would necessitate building more prisons, and the argument asserts that we don't want to build more prisons.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is:\n\nA. We shouldn't abolish capital punishment."
