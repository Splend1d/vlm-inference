Myosin-actin detachment\n\nIn muscle contraction, ATP is required not only for the power stroke (the movement of myosin heads that pulls actin filaments) but also for the detachment of myosin from actin after the power stroke. This detachment allows myosin to bind to another site on actin and repeat the cycle, which is essential for sustained muscle contraction. The other processes listed do not directly require ATP."
