The last in time prevails\n\nIn the United States, when there is a conflict between a congressional act and a valid treaty, the principle of \"last in time\" prevails. This means that whichever document was enacted or ratified most recently takes precedence over the other. This rule helps to resolve conflicts by giving effect to the more recent expression of legislative intent or international agreement."
