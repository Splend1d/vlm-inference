The parties signed a written land-sale agreement that provided for 30 monthly installment payments of $10,000 each. According to the terms of the sale agreement, the veterinarian would deliver a warranty deed to the investor upon payment of the last installment. In accordance with state law, the farmland's land-sale agreement was properly recorded. After making the first 10 installment payments, the investor discovered that there was an unrecorded mortgage on the farmland. The veterinarian, who is the mortgagor, has regularly made her mortgage payments and is not in default. This jurisdiction has the following recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or instrument is good as against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase. \"After the investor learned of the outstanding mortgage, he discontinued making further installment payments to the veterinarian. The investor alleged that the veterinarian was in breach of the land-sale agreement due to the existence of the unrecorded mortgage. The investor sues the veterinarian for breach of contract. Ifjudgment is rendered in favor of the veterinarian, it will be because\n\nA. the installment land-sale agreement is a security device.\nB. although the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage, it does not impair the investor's right of redemption.\nC. the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement.\nD. the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the installment land-sale agreement is a security device. While this might be true in some contexts, it doesn't directly address the issue at hand regarding the unrecorded mortgage and the investor's claim of breach of contract.\n\n- **Option B** implies that the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage and that it does not impair the investor's right of redemption. However, the nature of the agreement (whether it is a mortgage or a land-sale agreement) is not the central issue here. The key point is whether the veterinarian breached the contract by failing to provide clear title.\n\n- **Option C** states that the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement. This is incorrect because the unrecorded mortgage could indeed affect the investor's rights if it were to become a lien on the property before the final transfer of title.\n\n- **Option D** correctly identifies that the time for the veterinarian to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived. Since the agreement stipulates that the warranty deed will be delivered upon payment of the last installment, the veterinarian has not yet breached the contract by failing to deliver marketable title. The investor's cessation of payments before the final installment is due means that the veterinarian has not yet had the opportunity to fulfill her obligation to deliver clear title.\n\nTherefore, if judgment is rendered in favor of the veterinarian, it will be because the time for her to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived."
