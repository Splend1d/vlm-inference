They see it as an ideological fa\u00e7ade for US imperialism\n\nContemporary European liberal democrats often object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because they perceive it as a justification for US actions that may be seen as imperialistic or overly assertive in international affairs. The concept of American exceptionalism, which posits that the United States has a unique mission to promote democracy and freedom around the world, can sometimes be viewed by others as a cover for pursuing national interests at the expense of other nations' sovereignty and autonomy. This perception can lead to tensions between the United States and its European allies, who may prefer a more multilateral approach to global challenges."
