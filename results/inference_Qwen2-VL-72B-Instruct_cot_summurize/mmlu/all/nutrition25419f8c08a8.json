It forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with vitamin C\n\nVitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol) acts as an antioxidant primarily by donating an electron to a free radical, thereby neutralizing it and forming a relatively stable tocopheroyl radical. This tocopheroyl radical can then be reduced back to its active form by other antioxidants, such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thus regenerating the vitamin E and allowing it to continue its antioxidant function."
