All of the above\n\nRisk assessment in the context of toxicity and human exposure is a comprehensive process that includes several key components:\n\n1. **Estimate the likelihood, or probability, of a toxic effect on exposed humans (Option A)**: This involves evaluating the potential health risks associated with exposure to a substance by assessing the dose-response relationship and the exposure levels.\n\n2. **Support risk management decisions for food substances (Option B)**: Risk assessment provides scientific information that helps regulatory bodies make informed decisions about the safety of food substances, including additives, contaminants, and residues.\n\n3. **Derive Allowable Daily Intakes (Option C)**: Based on the results of risk assessment, Allowable Daily Intakes (ADIs) can be established. These are the maximum amounts of a substance that can be consumed daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.\n\nTherefore, all three options are correct, making D the best answer."
