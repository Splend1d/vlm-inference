One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nThe acrosome reaction is a process that occurs when a sperm cell binds to the zona pellucida (the outer layer) of an egg. This reaction causes the acrosomal enzymes to be released, which help the sperm penetrate the zona pellucida and reach the egg's plasma membrane. The cortical reaction, on the other hand, involves the release of enzymes from the egg's cortical granules, which modify the zona pellucida to prevent additional sperm from binding and entering the egg. These reactions together ensure that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing polyspermy (the fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm)."
