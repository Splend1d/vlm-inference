It does not directly address the specific qualifications or responsibilities of doctors under the law.\n\nB. **Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.**\n   - This statement implies that doctors regularly make life-and-death decisions in their professional capacity, and the Oregon law is consistent with these existing responsibilities. It supports the idea that doctors are already accustomed to making significant decisions about patients' lives.\n\nC. **The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.**\n   - This statement dismisses the argument based on its origin rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. It does not provide a substantive response to the claim about doctors' qualifications.\n\nD. **The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.**\n   - This statement clarifies that the Oregon law confines doctors' roles to making medical assessments regarding life expectancy and prognosis, rather than judging the overall value of a life. It directly addresses the specific scope of doctors' responsibilities under the law.\n\nGiven the context and the need to address the specific argument about doctors' qualifications under the Oregon law, the most appropriate response would be one that clarifies the role doctors play according to the law itself.\n\nTherefore, the best description of Gill's response is:\n\n**D. The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.**"
