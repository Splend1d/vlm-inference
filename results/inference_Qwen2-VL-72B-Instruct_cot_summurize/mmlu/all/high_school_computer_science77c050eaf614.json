Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\nC. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack\nD. Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map\n"

Each driver gets out of the car at the entrance, and the car is moved through the car wash automatically.\n- **Analysis**: This scenario describes a situation where cars enter and leave in the order they arrive (first-in, first-out), which is characteristic of a **queue**.\n\n### Scenario 2:\n- **Description**: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form.\n- **Analysis**: Assigning a unique numeric ID to each contestant implies a mapping between the contestant and their ID. This type of relationship is best modeled by a **dictionary/map**, where each contestant is associated with a unique ID.\n\n### Scenario 3:\n- **Description**: Tennis balls are placed and removed from a cylindrical can one at a time through the same opening. The last ball placed in the can is the first one removed.\n- **Analysis**: This scenario describes a situation where the last item added is the first one removed, which is characteristic of a **stack**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
