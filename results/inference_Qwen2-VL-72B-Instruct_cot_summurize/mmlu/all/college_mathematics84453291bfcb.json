By factoring or using numerical methods, we find that the eigenvalues are approximately -0.78, 1.39, and 3.39. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nThe trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. So, the trace of A is approximately -0.78 + 1.39 + 3.39 = 4. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. So, the determinant of A is approximately -0.78 * 1.39 * 3.39 = -3.56. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. I only."
