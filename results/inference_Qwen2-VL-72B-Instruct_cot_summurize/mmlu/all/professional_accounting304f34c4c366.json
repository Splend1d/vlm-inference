The ranking of projects by NPV can change with changes in the discount rate (market rate). NPV is sensitive to the discount rate.\n- B. The IRR and NPV do not always agree, especially when comparing mutually exclusive projects or projects with different scales or timing of cash flows.\n- C. The IRR can change the ranking of projects under certain conditions, such as when there are multiple rates of return or when comparing projects with significantly different scales or timing of cash flows.\n- D. Using a single metric for comparison ensures consistency and coherence in evaluating investment projects. Both NPV and IRR have their own merits and limitations, but using one consistently helps avoid confusion and inconsistencies in decision-making."
