A thirty-six-year-old man who experiences damage to his hippocampus and can't transfer information into his long-term memory\n\nAnterograde amnesia refers to the inability to form new memories after the onset of the condition, typically due to brain injury or disease affecting areas of the brain involved in memory formation, such as the hippocampus. This means that while the individual may retain their existing long-term memories, they struggle to create new ones. The other options describe scenarios more consistent with retrograde amnesia (difficulty recalling past memories) or normal childhood development and typical memory lapses."
