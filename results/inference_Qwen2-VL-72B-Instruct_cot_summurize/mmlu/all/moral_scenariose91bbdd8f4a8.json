It might be seen as slightly disrespectful or inconsiderate if it causes inconvenience or messes up her bathroom, but it is not a morally reprehensible act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, helping someone by taking a test for them in their math class is considered morally wrong. This action constitutes academic dishonesty and cheating, which violates ethical standards and undermines the integrity of the educational process."
