The Mesolithic era, which followed the Paleolithic and preceded the Neolithic, is characterized by significant cultural developments such as the domestication of animals (B), the introduction of canoes (A) for water transportation, and the development of more sophisticated tools like the European bow and arrow (C). However, crop irrigation systems are generally considered to be innovations that emerged during the Neolithic period or later, when agriculture became more advanced."
