There exists some positive integer \\( n_0 \\) such that \\( S(n_0) \\) is not true.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**Option A: \\( S(n_0 + 1) \\) is not true.**\n\n- Since \\( S(n_0) \\) is not true, we cannot conclude anything directly about \\( S(n_0 + 1) \\). The condition only tells us that if \\( S(k) \\) is true, then \\( S(k+1) \\) must be true. It does not provide information about what happens when \\( S(k) \\) is false.\n\n**Option B: \\( S(n_0 - 1) \\) is not true.**\n\n- This option suggests that \\( S(n_0 - 1) \\) is not true. However, the given information does not provide any direct relationship between \\( S(n_0) \\) being false and the truth value of \\( S(n_0 - 1) \\).\n\n**Option C: \\( S(n) \\) is not true for any \\( n \\leq n_0 \\)**\n\n- This option implies that all statements \\( S(n) \\) up to and including \\( n_0 \\) are false. We do not have enough information to make this claim. The given information only specifies that \\( S(n_0) \\) is false, but it does not provide any information about the truth values of \\( S(n) \\) for \\( n < n_0 \\).\n\n**Option D: \\( S(n) \\) is not true for any \\( n \\geq n_0 \\)**\n\n- This option states that all statements \\( S(n) \\) from \\( n_0 \\) onwards are false. Let\u2019s consider this more closely:\n    - If \\( S(n_0) \\) is false, and since \\( S(k) \\) being true implies \\( S(k+1) \\) is true, it follows that \\( S(n_0 + 1) \\), \\( S(n_0 + 2) \\), etc., cannot be true because they would require \\( S(n_0) \\) to be true in the first place (which it isn\u2019t).\n    - Therefore, if \\( S(n_0) \\) is false, then \\( S(n) \\) must be false for all \\( n \\geq n_0 \\).\n\nGiven the analysis above, the strongest conclusion that can be drawn based on the provided information is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. \\( S(n) \\) is not true for any \\( n \\geq n_0 \\)**"
