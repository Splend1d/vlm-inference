In humans, this condition is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that accommodates the large brain size relative to body size. Bipedalism (walking on two legs) led to changes in the shape of the female pelvis, which became narrower to support upright walking. This narrowing made it difficult for larger-brained infants to pass through the birth canal. As a result, human infants are born with brains that are only partially developed, allowing them to fit through the narrowed birth canal. After birth, the brain continues to grow rapidly, reaching about 75% of its adult size by the age of two. This extended period of brain development post-birth is facilitated by the secondary altricial condition."
