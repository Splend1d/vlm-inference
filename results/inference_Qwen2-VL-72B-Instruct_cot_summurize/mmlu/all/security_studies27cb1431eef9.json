Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets.\nB. Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.\nC. Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nCommon structural adjustment policies often have significant impacts on the poor, including:\n\n- Increased costs for essential goods and services (Option A).\n- Reductions in public spending on health, education, and social welfare, along with the introduction of fees that make these services unaffordable for many (Option B).\n- Increased unemployment and reduced access to credit, which can exacerbate poverty and force businesses to scale back or close (Option C).\n\nTherefore, all of the listed impacts are potential consequences of structural adjustment policies on the poor."
