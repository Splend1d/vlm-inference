The ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction is typically territorial, meaning that a court has jurisdiction over matters that occur within its own territory or jurisdictional boundaries. This is based on the principle of sovereignty, where each state has the authority to govern and enforce laws within its own territory.\n\nWhile there are exceptions and special circumstances where jurisdiction may extend beyond territorial boundaries (such as in cases involving international law, extraterritorial jurisdiction, or crimes committed on the high seas), the default and most common scope of jurisdiction remains territorial."
