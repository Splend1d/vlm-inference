In predicate logic, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\neg Mmis \\]\n\nThis means \"It is not the case that Marco moves to Italy from Spain.\"\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\(\\neg Mmsi\\)\n   - This would mean \"It is not the case that Marco moves to Spain from Italy,\" which is incorrect.\n\nB. \\(M\\neg mis\\)\n   - This notation is not standard in predicate logic. It seems to suggest \"Marco moves to not Italy from Spain,\" which is also incorrect.\n\nC. \\(\\neg Mmis\\)\n   - This correctly translates to \"It is not the case that Marco moves to Italy from Spain,\" which matches our original sentence.\n\nD. \\(M\\neg msi\\)\n   - Similar to B, this notation is not standard and suggests \"Marco moves to not Spain from Italy,\" which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nC. \\(\\neg Mmis\\)"
