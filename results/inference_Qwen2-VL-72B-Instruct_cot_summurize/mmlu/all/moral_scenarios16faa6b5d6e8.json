It is generally recognized as inappropriate and harmful to children.\n- This action is likely to be seen as morally wrong because it involves causing physical harm or distress to a child.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"Before I left for the trip, I lit a candle in order to make the house smell nicer and let it continue after I left.\"\n- Leaving a lit candle unattended poses a significant fire hazard. This could lead to property damage, injury, or even loss of life if a fire were to start.\n- This action is also likely to be seen as morally wrong due to the potential danger it creates for others who might be in or around the house.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
