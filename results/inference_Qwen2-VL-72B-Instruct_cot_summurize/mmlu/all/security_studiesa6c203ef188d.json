It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was \"theory has already been done\" kind of work.\nB. The think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving succumbing to 'hectic empiricism': the internal logic of its key contribution (deterrence) broke down.\nC. Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter.\nD.

This option discusses the role of think tanks in producing empirical research and the potential limitations of their contributions, particularly in relation to the concept of deterrence.\n\nC. This option points out the development of peace research as a separate discipline with its own critical branch, which was not always recognized or integrated into mainstream security studies.\n\nTogether, these options cover various dimensions of the academic institutionalization process, including the importation of ideas, the role of think tanks, and the evolution of related fields such as peace research."
