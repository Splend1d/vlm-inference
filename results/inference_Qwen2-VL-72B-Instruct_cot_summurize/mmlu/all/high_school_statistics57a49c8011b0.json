If no prior estimate is available, it is common to use \\( \\hat{p} = 0.5 \\) because it maximizes the required sample size.\n- \\( E \\) is the desired margin of error (in this case, 2.5%).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{1.96^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (1 - 0.5)}{0.025^2} \\right) \\]\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{3.8416 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5}{0.000625} \\right) \\]\n\\[ n = \\left( \\frac{0.9604}{0.000625} \\right) \\]\n\\[ n = 1536.64 \\]\n\nSince the sample size must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us:\n\n\\[ n = 1537 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1537"
