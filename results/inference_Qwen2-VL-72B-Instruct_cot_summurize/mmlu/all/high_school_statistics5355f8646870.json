Lack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.\nC. The placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.\nD.

This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n\nThis statement is correct because the study involved an intervention (consumption of three beers) and measured the effect of that intervention on reaction time by comparing the subjects' performance before and after the intervention. This design allows each subject to serve as their own control, which helps to control for individual differences among subjects."
