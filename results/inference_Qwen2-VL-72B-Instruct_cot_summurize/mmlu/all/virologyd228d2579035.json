Aerosols of urine from infected small mammals\n\nArenaviruses are typically spread through contact with aerosolized particles from the urine, saliva, or feces of infected rodents. These viruses can cause diseases such as Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever in humans. Transmission to humans usually occurs when people come into contact with contaminated environments where infected rodents live."
