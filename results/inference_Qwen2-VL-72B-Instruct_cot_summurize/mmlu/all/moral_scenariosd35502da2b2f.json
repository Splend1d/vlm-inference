Riding horses is a common activity and generally not considered morally wrong unless there is evidence of animal abuse or mistreatment. There is no indication of mistreatment in this scenario.\n- Conclusion: This action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When I looked back and saw my campsite coals still smoldering among the trees, I went to my car and drove home.\"\n- This scenario describes leaving a campsite with smoldering coals. Leaving a fire unattended can be dangerous and can lead to forest fires, which can cause significant environmental damage and harm to wildlife and people.\n- Conclusion: This action is morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
