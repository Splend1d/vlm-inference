Specifically, we want to find the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) such that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces is less than 0.01 (or 1%).\n\nGiven:\n- Standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 0.3 ounces\n- Desired probability of overflowing \\( P(X > 12) < 0.01 \\)\n\nFirst, we convert this problem into a standard normal distribution problem by using the z-score formula:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe need to find the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.99 (since \\( P(Z > z) = 0.01 \\) implies \\( P(Z \\leq z) = 0.99 \\)). From the standard normal distribution table or using statistical software, the z-score for a cumulative probability of 0.99 is approximately 2.326.\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3} = 2.326 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu\\):\n\n\\[ 12 - \\mu = 2.326 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ 12 - \\mu = 0.6978 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12 - 0.6978 \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 11.3022 \\]\n\nThus, the mean setting should be approximately 11.3022 ounces to ensure that a 12-ounce cup overflows less than 1% of the time.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces\nD. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces"
