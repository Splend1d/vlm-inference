It is usually measured as the annual percent change in gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. Economic growth is indeed critical in determining the standard of living in a nation because it can lead to higher incomes, more employment opportunities, and improved access to goods and services."
