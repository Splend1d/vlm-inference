                    "text": "The atrioventricular (AV) bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is a crucial part of the heart's conduction system. It is responsible for transmitting electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, ensuring coordinated contraction of the heart chambers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\"\n- This statement is incorrect because the AV bundle is not formed of autonomic nerve processes but rather specialized cardiac muscle fibers.\n\nB. \"It is formed of Purkinje fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\"\n- This statement is partially correct. The AV bundle does consist of specialized cardiac muscle fibers, including Purkinje fibers in its terminal parts, and it is indeed the only direct electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n\nC. \"It is formed of autonomic nerve processes and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.\"\n- This statement is incorrect because the AV bundle is not formed of autonomic nerve processes, and it is the only direct electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n\nD. \"It is formed of Purkinje fibres and forms one of several electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.\"\n- This statement is incorrect because while the AV bundle does include Purkinje fibers, it is the only direct electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It is formed of Purkinje fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles."
