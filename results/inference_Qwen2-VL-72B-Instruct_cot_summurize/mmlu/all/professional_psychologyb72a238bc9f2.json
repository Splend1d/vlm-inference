This potential source of error is best described as a:\n\nA. Rosenthal effect.\nB. Hawthorne effect.\nC. carryover effect.\nD. cohort effect.\n"

This type of confounding variable is known as a cohort effect. Cohort effects occur when members of different age groups have been exposed to different historical or environmental conditions that can influence their behavior or responses in a study. In this case, the differing levels of computer experience among age groups could potentially affect the reaction times measured in the study."
