The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD.

There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n\nHere\u2019s why this argument is the most compelling:\n\n- **Privity of Estate**: This legal concept refers to the relationship between successive owners of the same property. In this case, the landscaper has taken ownership of Lot 29 from the gardener. If the Declaration of Covenants imposes obligations that run with the land (i.e., are binding on subsequent owners), then the landscaper would be bound by those obligations regardless of whether they were explicitly mentioned in the deed. However, if the landscaper can argue that there is no privity of estate, it could suggest that the obligations did not pass to them along with the property.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. **There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.**\n   - This argument is irrelevant because the issue at hand is the relationship between the gardener (previous owner) and the landscaper (current owner), not the relationship between the housing corporation and the community association.\n\nB. **Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.**\n   - This argument is flawed because the lien itself implies a financial obligation. The existence of a lien does not negate the obligation; rather, it enforces it through a security interest in the property.\n\nC. **There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.**\n   - While this might seem relevant, the key issue here is the transfer of obligations related to the property, which is more about privity of estate than privity of contract. Contractual obligations typically require a direct agreement between parties, whereas estate obligations often bind successors in title.\n\nTherefore, the strongest argument for the landscaper is that there is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper, suggesting that the obligations imposed by the Declaration of Covenants may not have been properly transferred to the landscaper."
