                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the Hardy-Weinberg principle and how it applies to X-linked recessive disorders.\n\nFor an X-linked recessive disorder:\n- Males (XY) only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the recessive allele, they will express the disorder.\n- Females (XX) have two X chromosomes, so they must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to express the disorder.\n\nGiven that the incidence of the disorder in males is 1 in 100, this means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is also 1/100 or 0.01.\n\nThe frequency of the dominant allele (p) can be calculated as:\n\\[ p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 \\]\n\nFor females to be affected (homozygous for the recessive allele), both alleles must be recessive. The probability of this happening is \\( q^2 \\):\n\\[ q^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 \\]\n\nTherefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nC. 1 in 10 000"
