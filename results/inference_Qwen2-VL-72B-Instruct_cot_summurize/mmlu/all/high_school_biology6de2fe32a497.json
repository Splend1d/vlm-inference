For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\n\nGlycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration where glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a small amount of ATP (2 net ATP per glucose molecule) through substrate-level phosphorylation. However, the primary importance of glycolysis lies in its ability to regenerate NAD+ from NADH, which is essential for the continuation of the glycolytic pathway. Without this regeneration, glycolysis would quickly come to a halt due to the depletion of NAD+."
