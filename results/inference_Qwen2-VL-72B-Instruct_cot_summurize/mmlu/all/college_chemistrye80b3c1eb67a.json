The difference between these two values is 0.010 M. Since the mean result is not very close to the actual concentration, the titration results are not accurate.\n\n### Precision Analysis:\nThe standard deviation (0.001 M) indicates the spread of the individual measurements around the mean. A low standard deviation suggests that the measurements are tightly clustered around the mean, indicating high precision.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The titration results are not accurate because the mean result differs significantly from the actual concentration.\n- The titration results are precise because the standard deviation is small, indicating that the measurements are consistent with each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Precise but not accurate**"
