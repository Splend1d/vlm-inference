Basic knowledge of hand washing and food hygiene\n\nAstroviruses are primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, which means they can be effectively controlled by maintaining good personal hygiene practices such as regular hand washing and ensuring proper food handling and sanitation. While there is ongoing research into vaccines for astroviruses, currently, no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment is available. Passive antibodies might offer some protection but are not widely used for this purpose. Quarantine may be effective in controlling outbreaks in specific settings, but it is not a practical long-term solution for controlling the spread of astroviruses in the general population."
