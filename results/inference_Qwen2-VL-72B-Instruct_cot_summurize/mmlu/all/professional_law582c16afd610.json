The buyer tried to stop the van for a red light, but the brakes failed to operate. As a consequence, the buyer drove through the red light and collided with a car driven by a woman. Subsequently, the woman asserted a claim against the buyer to recover for the injuries she suffered in the accident. At trial, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff concerning the cause of the accident was the testimony of an engineering expert. He testified that a manufacturing defect had caused the brakes to suddenly fail. Based on the facts stated above, a motion by the buyer to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be\n\nA. granted, because the woman presented no evidence that the buyer was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman was neither the user nor the consumer of the defective product.\nC. denied, because the buyer had a non-delegable duty to maintain the brakes in a safe condition.\nD. denied, because the buyer is strictly liable for injuries caused by a manufacturing defect in an auto that he had purchased.\n"

The woman who was injured has brought a claim against the buyer. \n\nStrict liability in tort applies to manufacturers and sellers of products, including vehicles, for defects that cause injury. This means that the seller or manufacturer can be held liable for damages caused by a defective product without the need to prove negligence. In this case, since the brakes failed due to a manufacturing defect, the buyer, as the seller of the vehicle (in the context of transferring ownership), could be held strictly liable for the injuries caused by the defective product.\n\nTherefore, a motion by the buyer to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be denied based on the principle of strict liability for manufacturing defects."
