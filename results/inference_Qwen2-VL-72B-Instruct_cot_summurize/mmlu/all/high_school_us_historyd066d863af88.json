But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nWhich of the following best expresses the perspective of William Bradford in the passage above?\n\nA. The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\nB. The native peoples of America need to be converted to Christianity.\nC. Native Americans need to be incorporated into their new colony.\nD. Surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\n"

Surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\n\nThe passage describes how the Pilgrims were surprised to find that some Native Americans, such as Samoset and Squanto, could speak English and provide valuable information about the local area. This suggests that William Bradford was surprised by the ability of Native Americans to learn English and act as cultural intermediaries between the two groups. There is no indication in the passage that Bradford held the views expressed in options A, B, or C."
