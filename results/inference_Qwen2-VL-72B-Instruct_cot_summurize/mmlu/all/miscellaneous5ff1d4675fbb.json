Therefore, a $100 billion increase in government spending would lead to an increase in real output of:\n\\[ \\$100 \\text{ billion} \\times 4 = \\$400 \\text{ billion} \\]\n\nB. **From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.**\n\nThis statement is correct. As calculated above, the spending multiplier indeed increased from 4 in year 1 to 5 in year 2.\n\nC. **A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Since the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5, a given change in government spending would have a more powerful effect in year 2 compared to year 1.\n\nD. **The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is calculated as \\( 1 - \\text{MPC} \\). If MPC increases from 0.75 to 0.80, MPS decreases from 0.25 to 0.20.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**B. From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.**"
