The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, as to the cocaine only.\nB. granted, as to the marijuana only.\nC. granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.\n"

For a search to be lawful without a warrant, it must fall under one of the recognized exceptions, such as exigent circumstances, plain view, consent, or probable cause combined with exigent circumstances.\n\n#### Probable Cause:\n- The informant\u2019s tip, combined with the police observation of a matching vehicle and person, could provide probable cause for the police to believe that criminal activity (selling narcotics) was occurring or had recently occurred.\n\n#### Exigent Circumstances:\n- Exigent circumstances typically involve situations where immediate action is necessary to prevent harm, escape of suspects, destruction of evidence, or other urgent situations. If the police believed that the suspect might flee or destroy evidence, this could justify a warrantless search.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the details provided, it appears that the police had probable cause to believe that criminal activity was taking place based on the informant's tip and their observations. However, the specific actions taken (opening the doors, prying open the tool case, and opening the glove compartment) need to be justified under exigent circumstances or another exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nWithout more specific information about the urgency or necessity of the police actions, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the search was reasonable. However, if the police can demonstrate that they acted reasonably and within the bounds of the law (e.g., exigent circumstances), the motion to exclude the evidence may not be granted.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**D. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the police can justify their actions under the circumstances described."
