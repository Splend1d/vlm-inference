Among the options provided, the muscle most commonly associated with such symptoms is:\n\nD. supraspinatus\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle is one of the four muscles that make up the rotator cuff, and it is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm. Dysfunction or injury to the supraspinatus can lead to pain and difficulty with shoulder movements, particularly abduction."
