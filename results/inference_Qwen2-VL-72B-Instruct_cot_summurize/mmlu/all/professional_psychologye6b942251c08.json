According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, this can be evidence of discrimination if it is not justified by business necessity. The \"four-fifths rule\" is often used as a guideline to determine whether there is adverse impact: if the selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than four-fifths (or 80%) of the rate for the group with the highest rate, this may indicate adverse impact."
