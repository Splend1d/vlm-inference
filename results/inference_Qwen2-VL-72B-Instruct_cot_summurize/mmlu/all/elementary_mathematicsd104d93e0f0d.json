Since \\(8 = \\frac{32}{4}\\), we can rewrite the mixed number as:\n\n\\(\\frac{32}{4} + \\frac{2}{4}\\)\n\nNow, add the two fractions together:\n\n\\(\\frac{32}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{34}{4}\\)\n\nHowever, this fraction can be simplified further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n\\(\\frac{34 \\div 2}{4 \\div 2} = \\frac{17}{2}\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 17 over 2."
