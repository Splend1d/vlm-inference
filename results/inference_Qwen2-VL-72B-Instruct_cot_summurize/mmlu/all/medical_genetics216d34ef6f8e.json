It does not typically cause elevated blood ammonia levels.\n\nB. **Hurler's syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1)**: This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down certain complex carbohydrates, leading to their accumulation in various tissues and organs. While it can cause many health problems, it does not directly lead to high blood ammonia levels.\n\nC. **Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency**: This is a genetic disorder that impairs the urea cycle, a series of reactions that convert ammonia into urea for excretion. A defect in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood, resulting in hyperammonemia.\n\nD. **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**: This is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. It does not affect the urea cycle or ammonia metabolism, so it does not typically cause high blood ammonia levels.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.**"
