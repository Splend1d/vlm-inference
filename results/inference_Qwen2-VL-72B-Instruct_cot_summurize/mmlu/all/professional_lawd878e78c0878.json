Soon thereafter, she had sex with her husband, who contracted the disease within a few days. The woman revealed the source to her husband, and he then sued the paramour for negligence in failing to tell the woman that he had the disease. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\nC. There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\nD. There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause.\n"

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nIn this scenario, the paramour had a venereal disease and failed to inform the woman about it. This failure could be considered a breach of his duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent the spread of the disease. Therefore, the appellate court may find that there is a cause of action based on the paramour's negligence in failing to disclose his condition.\n\nOption A is incorrect because strict liability typically applies to situations where the defendant's actions inherently create a high risk of harm, regardless of fault. Venereal diseases generally fall under negligence rather than strict liability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because assuming the risk would imply that the woman knew or should have known about the risk of contracting a disease from the paramour, which is not indicated in the scenario.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the wife's subsequent sexual activity with her husband does not necessarily negate the paramour's initial negligence. The paramour's failure to disclose his disease remains a contributing factor to the husband's infection."
