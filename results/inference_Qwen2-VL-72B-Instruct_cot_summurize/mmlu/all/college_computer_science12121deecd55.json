The graph must be connected.\n2. Every vertex in the graph must have an even degree.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**I. A complete graph with 12 vertices:**\n- In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n- The number of edges connected to each vertex (degree) is \\( n - 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of vertices.\n- For a complete graph with 12 vertices, each vertex has a degree of \\( 12 - 1 = 11 \\).\n- Since 11 is odd, this graph does not satisfy the condition that all vertices must have even degrees.\n- Therefore, a complete graph with 12 vertices cannot have an Euler circuit.\n\n**II. A complete graph with 13 vertices:**\n- Similarly, in a complete graph with 13 vertices, each vertex has a degree of \\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\).\n- Since 12 is even, this graph satisfies the condition that all vertices must have even degrees.\n- Additionally, a complete graph is connected by definition.\n- Therefore, a complete graph with 13 vertices can have an Euler circuit.\n\n**III. A tree with 13 vertices:**\n- A tree is a connected acyclic graph.\n- In any tree, there is at least one leaf node (a vertex with degree 1).\n- Since a tree with 13 vertices will have at least one vertex with an odd degree (specifically, degree 1), it does not satisfy the condition that all vertices must have even degrees.\n- Therefore, a tree with 13 vertices cannot have an Euler circuit.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**B.
