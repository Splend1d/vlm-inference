These electoral votes are typically awarded on a winner-takes-all basis within each state (except for Maine and Nebraska, which use a proportional allocation). Therefore, presidential candidates focus on winning states that have a significant number of electoral votes and where the outcome is uncertain or competitive, known as \"battleground\" or \"swing\" states. Winning these states can significantly impact the overall electoral vote count and thus the election result."
