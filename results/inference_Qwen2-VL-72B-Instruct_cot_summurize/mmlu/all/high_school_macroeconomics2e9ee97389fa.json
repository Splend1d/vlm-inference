                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States\n\nAn increase in per capita GDP in China would likely lead to higher purchasing power for Chinese consumers, enabling them to buy more imported goods from the United States. This increased demand for U.S. goods would lead to an increased demand for U.S. dollars to pay for these imports, thereby appreciating the value of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options do not cause an appreciation of the dollar relative to the yuan:\n\nA. Lower interest rates in the United States relative to China: Lower interest rates in the U.S. would typically make U.S. investments less attractive compared to those in China, leading to a potential outflow of capital from the U.S., which could depreciate the dollar against the yuan.\n\nB. Lower price levels in China relative to the United States: Lower prices in China would make Chinese goods more attractive to U.S. consumers, increasing the demand for yuan to purchase these goods. This would appreciate the yuan relative to the dollar.\n\nC. Growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods: If Americans prefer to consume more Chinese-made goods, they will need more yuan to purchase these goods, which would increase the demand for yuan and thus appreciate the yuan relative to the dollar."
