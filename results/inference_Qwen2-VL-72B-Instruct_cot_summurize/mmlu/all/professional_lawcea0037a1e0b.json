As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment, we need to analyze the legal principles involved and the evidence presented.\n\n1. **Latent Defect**: A latent defect is a hidden flaw that is not apparent upon reasonable inspection. If the patient can argue that there was a latent defect in the doors, this could potentially support their claim. However, the patient has not provided any evidence of specific conduct or neglect by the hospital that would indicate such a defect.\n\n2. **Res Ipsa Loquitur**: This doctrine allows a plaintiff to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of certain types of accidents, especially when the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the harm and the accident would not normally occur without negligence. In this case, the automatic doors closing on the patient's foot might suggest negligence if the hospital had exclusive control over the doors and such an incident would not typically happen without some form of negligence. However, the patient must still show that the hospital had exclusive control over the doors and that the incident would not normally occur without negligence.\n\n3. **Proof of Accident Alone**: Proof of an accident alone is generally insufficient to establish negligence. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant breached a duty of care that resulted in the injury. Since the patient has not provided evidence of specific conduct or neglect by the hospital, merely proving the accident occurred does not establish negligence.\n\n4. **Superseding Cause**: A superseding cause is an unforeseeable event that breaks the chain of causation between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injury. If the nurse's action in pulling the wheelchair back through the doors was unforeseeable and directly caused the additional injury, it could be considered a superseding cause. However, this would depend on whether the nurse's action was reasonable under the circumstances and whether it was foreseeable.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A** (latent defect) is unlikely to succeed since the patient has not provided evidence of a specific defect.\n- **Option B** (res ipsa loquitur) could potentially apply if the hospital had exclusive control over the doors and the incident would not normally occur without negligence, but the lack of specific evidence weakens this argument.\n- **Option C** (proof of accident alone) correctly states that an accident alone does not establish negligence, which aligns with the absence of specific evidence of negligence.\n- **Option D** (superseding cause) could be relevant if the nurse's action was unforeseeable and directly caused the additional injury, but this would require a detailed analysis of the nurse's actions and whether they were reasonable.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the absence of specific evidence of negligence or a latent defect, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.**\n\nThis option accurately reflects the principle that an accident alone is insufficient to prove negligence without additional evidence of wrongdoing."
