Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n"

No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nIn a simple random sample, every possible subset of the population (in this case, every possible group of 30 employees) has an equal chance of being selected. However, in the described method, the selection process involves multiple steps where each manager selects six employees from their own plant. This means that the probability of any specific group of 30 employees being selected depends on the combination of selections made by the five managers. Therefore, not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected, making it not a simple random sample."
