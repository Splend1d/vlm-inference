Therefore, options A, B, and D are more plausible than C.\n\nBetween A, B, and D:\n- \"Too complicated\" (A) might be a criticism but doesn't necessarily address the effectiveness or legitimacy of the reasoning.\n- \"Weak\" (B) directly addresses the persuasiveness of the analogy.\n- \"Not based on a legitimate method of reasoning\" (D) speaks to the fundamental validity of the reasoning behind the analogy.\n\nConsidering Philo's typical skepticism and critical approach, the most fitting critique would likely be one that questions the very foundation of the reasoning used in the analogy.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**D. not based on a legitimate method of reasoning**"
