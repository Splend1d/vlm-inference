To incorporate this value into therapy, a therapist should show genuine interest in the client's life, including their family, work, or school. This approach helps to build trust and rapport, which are essential for effective therapy. While integrating family members (A) can also be beneficial, it may not always be feasible or appropriate. Maintaining neutrality (B) is important in therapy, but it does not directly address the value of personalismo. Demonstrating knowledge of indigenous healing practices (D) can be helpful, but it is not the primary way to incorporate personalismo into therapy."
