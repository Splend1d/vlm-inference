Middle ear effusion\n\nMiddle ear effusion (MEE) is a common complication of otitis media, especially in children. It involves the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear space, which can appear as a mass behind the tympanic membrane. The fluid can be serous, mucoid, or purulent, and its appearance may vary from clear to cloudy, yellow, or even brownish. In this context, the brown, irregular mass is likely indicative of MEE rather than other conditions listed.\n\n- A. Epithelial tissue proliferation: This would not typically present as a brown, irregular mass behind an intact tympanic membrane.\n- B. Lingual papillae loss: This condition affects the tongue and would not be relevant to findings in the ear.\n- D. Midface hypoplasia: This is a congenital condition affecting the development of the midface and would not cause the described findings in the ear.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Middle ear effusion."
