It will have negative impacts in most developing countries because of the increased frequency of droughts, storms and floods.\n\nClimate change is expected to have significant negative impacts on food security, particularly in developing countries. These impacts include:\n\n1. **Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events**: Droughts, storms, and floods are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. These events can destroy crops, livestock, and infrastructure, leading to food shortages and price increases.\n\n2. **Changes in Rainfall Patterns**: Shifts in rainfall patterns can disrupt traditional farming practices, making it difficult for farmers to predict when to plant and harvest crops. This can lead to reduced yields and increased food insecurity.\n\n3. **Soil Degradation**: Higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns can lead to soil degradation, reducing the fertility of agricultural lands and making it harder to grow crops.\n\n4. **Water Scarcity**: Increased evaporation rates and changes in water availability can lead to water scarcity, which is essential for agriculture. This can limit the amount of land that can be irrigated and reduce crop yields.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Incidence**: Warmer temperatures can increase the incidence of pests and diseases that affect crops, further reducing yields.\n\nWhile some regions may experience short-term benefits from increased CO2 levels (option C), these benefits are generally outweighed by the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security. Option B is not relevant to food security and focuses on a potential health benefit that does not address the broader issues related to climate change and agriculture. Option D is incorrect as there is a strong scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and will continue to do so over the next 50 years."
