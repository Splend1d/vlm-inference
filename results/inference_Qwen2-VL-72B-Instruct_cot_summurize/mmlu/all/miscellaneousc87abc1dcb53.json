While it does contribute some salts, it is not the main source.\n\nC. **The weathering of continental rocks**: This process involves the breakdown of rocks on land by wind, water, and temperature changes, releasing minerals that eventually wash into rivers and flow into the ocean. This is a significant and continuous source of dissolved salts.\n\nD. **The eruptions of undersea hot-spot volcanoes**: Volcanic activity can introduce minerals and salts into the ocean, but this is generally less consistent and less voluminous compared to the weathering of continental rocks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. The weathering of continental rocks**"
