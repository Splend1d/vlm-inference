Riles was a landmark legal case in the United States that addressed the issue of racial discrimination in standardized testing. The case involved a group of African American students who claimed that the IQ tests used by the San Francisco Unified School District were biased against them and led to their disproportionate placement in special education classes. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing that schools must provide tests that do not discriminate on the basis of race. This precedent has had significant implications for educational policy and practice, particularly in relation to the use of standardized tests and the need to ensure that they are fair and unbiased."
