It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\n\nA. The War of the Roses\nB. The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793\nC. The Seven Years' War\nD. Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688\n"

The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793 was a pivotal event in European history that marked the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime and the rise of the bourgeoisie. This revolution significantly advanced the interests of the middle class and paved the way for the development of capitalist societies, aligning closely with the themes of class struggle and societal transformation emphasized by Marx and Engels in \"The Communist Manifesto.\""
