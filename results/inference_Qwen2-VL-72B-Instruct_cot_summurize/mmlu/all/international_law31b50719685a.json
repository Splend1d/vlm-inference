No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts\n\nObligations erga omnes refer to duties owed by states towards the international community as a whole. While peremptory norms (jus cogens) are indeed a significant source of such obligations due to their fundamental importance and non-derogable nature, obligations erga omnes can also arise from other sources. These include treaties that establish objective regimes benefiting the international community at large, and unilateral acts by states that create legal obligations recognized by the international community. Therefore, while peremptory norms are a critical part of obligations erga omnes, they are not the sole source."
