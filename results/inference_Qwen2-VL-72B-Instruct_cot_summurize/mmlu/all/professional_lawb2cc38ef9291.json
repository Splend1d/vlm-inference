                    "text": "There has been a great deal of news media coverage regarding the problem of underage drinking. Many high school and college students have been purchasing fraudulent driver's licenses with phony birthdates showing \"proof' of being 21 years of age or older. As a consequence, many teenagers are able to purchase alcoholic beverages at liquor stores, restaurants, and bars. The situation is becoming especially alarming on many college campuses. A magazine article reported that the majority of freshmen between the ages of 18 and 19 at many colleges had illegally purchased evidence of phony \"proof. \"With underage drinking reaching epidemic proportions, Congress enacted a statute establishing a federal commission to monitor and curtail alcoholic beverage sales to underage drinkers. To implement the program on a national scale, the bill required each state to pass legislation establishing a local \"watchdog\" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent. A state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute. The law is likely to be held\n\nA. valid, because the sale of alcoholic beverages has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nB. valid, because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme is consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment.\nC. invalid, because it violates the fundamental principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.\nD. invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of federalism and the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. The Supreme Court has ruled in cases such as Printz v. United States (1997) and New York v. United States (1992) that the federal government cannot compel state governments to enact or enforce federal regulatory programs. This principle is often referred to as the anti-commandeering doctrine.\n\nWhile the sale of alcoholic beverages does have an impact on interstate commerce, this alone does not justify the federal government compelling states to act in a certain way. The Twenty-First Amendment, which repealed Prohibition and gave states the power to regulate alcohol within their borders, does not authorize the federal government to commandeer state legislative processes either.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D, as it correctly identifies the constitutional limitation on the federal government's ability to require states to enact and enforce federal laws."
