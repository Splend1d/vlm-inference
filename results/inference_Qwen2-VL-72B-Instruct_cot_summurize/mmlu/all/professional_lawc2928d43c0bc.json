The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man's property.\n\nIn this scenario, the neighbor knowingly entered the man's fenced-in yard without permission, which constitutes trespassing. Even though the neighbor was aware of the presence of the dangerous dogs due to the \"Beware of Dogs\" signs, the act of entering the property without authorization makes him a trespasser. As a trespasser, the neighbor does not have the same level of protection under the law as an invitee or a licensee would. Therefore, the neighbor is unlikely to prevail in a lawsuit against the man for his injuries sustained from the dog attack."
