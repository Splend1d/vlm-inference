                    "text": "To determine which combination of thermodynamic quantities (\u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394G) applies to the given scenario, we need to consider the conditions under which the reaction changes from nonspontaneous to spontaneous.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) is given by the equation:\n\\[ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \u0394H is the enthalpy change,\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \u0394S is the entropy change.\n\nFor a reaction to be spontaneous, \u0394G must be negative. Conversely, if \u0394G is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous.\n\nGiven:\n- The reaction is nonspontaneous at 1 atm and 298 K.\n- Cooling the system with dry ice (-78\u00b0C or 195 K) makes the reaction spontaneous.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G = 0**\n- If \u0394G = 0, the reaction is at equilibrium, not nonspontaneous or spontaneous. This does not fit the given scenario.\n\n**Option B: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0**\n- With \u0394H > 0 (endothermic), \u0394S < 0 (decrease in entropy), and \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous), this fits the initial condition where the reaction is nonspontaneous at 298 K. However, when cooled to 195 K, the term \\(T\\Delta S\\) becomes smaller due to the lower temperature, potentially making \u0394G negative and thus spontaneous. This fits the scenario.\n\n**Option C: \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0**\n- With \u0394H < 0 (exothermic), \u0394S < 0 (decrease in entropy), and \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous), the exothermic nature would tend to make \u0394G more negative, but the decrease in entropy opposes it. Cooling the system would reduce the \\(T\\Delta S\\) term, possibly making \u0394G negative. However, the exothermic nature already tends to make \u0394G negative, so this combination is less likely to fit the scenario perfectly.\n\n**Option D: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0**\n- With \u0394H > 0 (endothermic), \u0394S > 0 (increase in entropy), and \u0394G > 0 (nonspontaneous), the increase in entropy would tend to make \u0394G more negative, but the endothermic nature opposes it. Cooling the system would reduce the \\(T\\Delta S\\) term, potentially making \u0394G negative. However, the endothermic nature already tends to make \u0394G positive, so this combination is less likely to fit the scenario perfectly.\n\nConsidering all options, **Option B** best fits the scenario described, as it explains why the reaction is nonspontaneous at 298 K and becomes spontaneous when cooled to 195 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**B. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0**"
