Therefore, we are looking at squares from \\(3^2\\) to \\(14^2\\).\n\nSince we are interested in odd perfect squares, we only consider squares of odd numbers because the square of an odd number is always odd. The odd numbers between 3 and 14 (inclusive) are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13.\n\nThus, the odd perfect squares in this range are:\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n- \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n- \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\nThere are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 6."
