The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C. Calhoun, \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest,\" 1828\nThe issue that precipitated the passage excerpted above was\n\nA. the removal of American Indians from the South.\nB. the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.\nC. the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.\nD. the funding of \"internal improvements.\"\n"

This directly relates to the discussion about states' rights and federal overreach.\n\nD. **The funding of \"internal improvements\"**:\n   - While internal improvements (like roads and canals) were a federal initiative, they do not specifically address the core issue of states' rights and federal overreach in economic policy as clearly as tariffs do.\n\nConsidering the context and the emphasis on states' rights and economic policy, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**C. the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.**\n\nThus, the final answer is C."
