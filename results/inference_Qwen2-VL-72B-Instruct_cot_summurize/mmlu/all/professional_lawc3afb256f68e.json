Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?\n\nA. No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\nB. Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\nC. Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.\nD. No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.\n"

Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the scenario described, both brothers signed the deed as grantors, indicating their intent to convey the property. The first brother instructed the second brother to take the deed to their lawyer for approval before delivery. However, the second brother, without permission, delivered the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price.\n\nIn property law, if one party signs a deed, it generally indicates an intention to transfer ownership. The act of signing the deed by both brothers shows their intent to sell the property. The issue here revolves around the delivery of the deed.\n\nDelivery of a deed is a crucial step in transferring title. If the first brother had explicitly instructed the second brother to deliver the deed only after obtaining legal approval, and the second brother failed to follow those instructions, there might be grounds for arguing that the delivery was improper. However, the second brother's actions could be seen as acting on behalf of the first brother, especially since the first brother had already signed the deed and given it to the second brother with instructions related to its handling.\n\nThe concept of \"apparent agency\" can come into play here. Apparent agency occurs when a third party (in this case, the buyer) reasonably believes that one party (the second brother) has the authority to act on behalf of another (the first brother), based on the circumstances. Since the second brother had possession of the deed and was involved in the transaction, the buyer could reasonably believe that the second brother had the authority to complete the delivery of the deed.\n\nTherefore, despite the first brother's instructions, the second brother's actions could be considered valid under the principle of apparent agency, making the deed effective as to both partners."
