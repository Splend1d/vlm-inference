Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nThe passage is most closely related with which of the following broad developments?\n\nA. Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens\nB. Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China\nC. Europe's economic domination of China\nD. Europe's colonization of Chinese territory\n"

The passage discusses the importation of opium into China by foreigners (Europeans).\n2. It mentions the harmful effects of opium on the Chinese population.\n3. It highlights the hypocrisy of Europeans who prohibit opium in their own countries but allow its sale in China.\n4. It emphasizes the economic aspect, noting that Chinese exports to European countries are beneficial.\n\nGiven this analysis, the passage is primarily concerned with the economic relationship between China and Europe, specifically the negative impact of opium trade on China.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens**: The passage does not mention slavery or the enslavement of Chinese citizens.\n\nB. **Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China**: There is no reference to missionary activities or religious influence in the passage.\n\nC. **Europe's economic domination of China**: This option aligns well with the passage's focus on the economic harm caused by the opium trade and the broader economic relationship between China and Europe.\n\nD. **Europe's colonization of Chinese territory**: While colonization could be part of the broader historical context, the passage specifically addresses economic issues rather than territorial control.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the passage is most closely related to:\n\n**Final Answer: C. Europe's economic domination of China**"
