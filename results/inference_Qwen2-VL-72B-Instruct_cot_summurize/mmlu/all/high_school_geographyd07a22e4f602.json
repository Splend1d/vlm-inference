More infrastructure in the core.\n\nIn the core-periphery model of development, \"more infrastructure in the core\" is not considered a spread effect. Instead, it is typically a characteristic of the core region itself, which attracts economic activities and investments due to its existing infrastructure and other advantages.\n\nSpread effects refer to the positive externalities or benefits that flow from the core to the periphery, such as technology transfer, increased access to markets, and improved infrastructure in the periphery. The other options (A, B, and C) describe conditions that can occur in the core but are not spread effects in the traditional sense of the term."
