In Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), increasing the number of hidden states can indeed lead to a higher likelihood of the observed data because additional states provide more flexibility in fitting the data. However, this does not necessarily mean that the model will generalize better or be more accurate on unseen data. Overfitting can occur if too many states are added without sufficient evidence from the data.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\"Collaborative filtering is often a useful model for modeling users' movie preference.\"\n\nThis statement is also true. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommendation systems, including those for movies. It works by predicting an individual's interest based on the preferences of similar users. This approach has been shown to be effective in various domains, including movie recommendations.\n\nGiven these analyses, both statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
