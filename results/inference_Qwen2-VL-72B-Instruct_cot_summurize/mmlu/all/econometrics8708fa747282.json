(i), (ii), and (iii)\n\nPanel data, also known as longitudinal data, combines elements of both cross-sectional and time-series data by observing multiple subjects over multiple time periods. This offers several advantages:\n\n(i) **Increased Degrees of Freedom**: Panel data increases the number of observations, which in turn increases the degrees of freedom. This can lead to more powerful statistical tests because the larger sample size reduces the standard errors of the estimates.\n\n(ii) **Variation in Dependent Variable**: With panel data, you can observe how the average value of the dependent variable changes across different entities (cross-sectionally) and over time. This provides a richer understanding of the behavior of the dependent variable.\n\n(iii) **Flexibility in Estimated Relationships**: Panel data allows for the estimation of models where the relationship between independent and dependent variables can vary across entities or over time. This is particularly useful when there are expected differences in these relationships due to individual characteristics or changing conditions over time.\n\nTherefore, all three points (i), (ii), and (iii) are advantages of using panel data over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modeling."
