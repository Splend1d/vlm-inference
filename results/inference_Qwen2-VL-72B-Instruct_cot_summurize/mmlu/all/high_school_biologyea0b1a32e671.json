According to this principle, for a gene with two alleles (let's call them A and a), the frequencies of the genotypes in a population at equilibrium are given by:\n\n- \\( p^2 \\): Frequency of AA (homozygous dominant)\n- \\( 2pq \\): Frequency of Aa (heterozygous)\n- \\( q^2 \\): Frequency of aa (homozygous recessive)\n\nGiven:\n- The frequency of black (aa, homozygous recessive) is 4%.\n- The frequency of brown (either AA or Aa) is 96%.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( q \\) as the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n- \\( p \\) as the frequency of the dominant allele (A).\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\\[ q^2 = 0.04 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[ q = \\sqrt{0.04} = 0.2 \\]\n\nSince \\( p + q = 1 \\):\n\\[ p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 \\]\n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous condition (Aa) is given by:\n\\[ 2pq = 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.2 = 0.32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 32%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. 32 percent"
