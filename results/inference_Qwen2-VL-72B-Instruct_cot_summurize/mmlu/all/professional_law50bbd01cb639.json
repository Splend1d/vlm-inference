One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. \"Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover\n\nA. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.\nB. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.\nC. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\nD. $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Contract Formation**: The contractor submitted a bid to the owner for $75,000, which the owner accepted by sending a signed confirmation letter. This acceptance created a binding contract between the contractor and the owner for the renovation work at the agreed price of $75,000.\n\n2. **Contract Terms**: Once the contract was formed, both parties were bound by its terms. The contractor agreed to perform the renovation work for $75,000, and the owner agreed to pay this amount upon completion of the work.\n\n3. **Subcontractor Issue**: The fact that the electrician initially bid a certain amount and later backed out does not affect the contract between the contractor and the owner. The contractor's reliance on the electrician's bid is an internal issue between the contractor and the electrician, not something that can alter the terms of the contract with the owner.\n\n4. **Quantum Meruit**: Quantum meruit is a legal principle that allows recovery for the reasonable value of services when there is no express contract. However, in this case, there is an express contract (the $75,000 bid accepted by the owner), so quantum meruit does not apply.\n\n5. **Repudiation**: While the contractor attempted to renegotiate the price due to unforeseen circumstances, the owner refused to accept the new price. The contractor still performed the work as per the original contract terms, so there was no repudiation of the contract by the contractor.\n\nTherefore, in an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will likely be able to recover the contract price of $75,000. Any additional costs incurred by the contractor due to the electrician's withdrawal would need to be addressed separately, potentially through a claim against the electrician for breach of contract or other remedies."
