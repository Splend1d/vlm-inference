                    "text": "A police department filed a complaint charging Bill with the sale of narcotic drugs in violation of a state statute and obtained a valid warrant for his arrest. Two police officers went to Bill's house, a two-story colonial. After knocking at the door, they were admitted by Bill's brother, Mark. One of the policemen showed Mark the arrest warrant and asked if he was Bill. He replied that he was Bill's brother and that he was staying at his brother's house while Bill was away on a business trip. The police officer then asked Mark for some identification. Mark was only able to produce an out-of-state driver's license. The other policeman then became suspicious and proceeded to frisk Mark. During the pat-down, the police officer found the following letter, which read:\"Dear Mark,If you could get rid of your brother permanently, we could be together forever. With love,your favorite girl. \"Nervously, Mark then agreed to allow the policemen to search the house. The officers conducted an extensive two-hour search of the house and found nothing of interest to them. As they were leaving, one of the police officers walked over to a parked car in the driveway of the house and noticed that the car's trunk was slightly open. When he looked in the trunk, the police officer discovered Bill's body. If Mark's attorney files a motion to suppress the introduction of the letter into evidence, the court should rule that the evidence is\n\nA. admissible, because it was on the person, or in the presence of the person, who was later arrested.\nB. admissible, because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search.\nC. inadmissible, because the letter was obtained as a result of a non-consensual search and seizure.\nD. inadmissible, because the letter was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the letter found during the police search should be admissible in evidence, we need to analyze the circumstances surrounding its discovery and the legality of the actions taken by the police.\n\n1. **Initial Interaction and Arrest Warrant**: The police had a valid warrant for Bill's arrest. They approached the house and were admitted by Mark, who identified himself as Bill's brother.\n\n2. **Suspicion and Frisking**: The police officer became suspicious when Mark produced an out-of-state driver's license. Based on this suspicion, the officer conducted a pat-down (frisk) of Mark.\n\n3. **Discovery of the Letter**: During the pat-down, the officer found the letter in Mark's possession.\n\n4. **Search of the House**: Mark nervously consented to a search of the house, which turned up nothing of interest.\n\n5. **Discovery of Bill's Body**: As the officers were leaving, one officer noticed the car's trunk was slightly open and found Bill's body inside.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Frisking**: The frisking of Mark was based on reasonable suspicion due to the out-of-state driver's license, which is generally permissible under Terry v. Ohio (1968). This means the initial discovery of the letter was lawful.\n\n- **Consent to Search**: Mark's consent to search the house was given after the discovery of the letter, which might have influenced his decision. However, the legality of the consent search depends on whether it was voluntary or coerced by the police.\n\n- **Discovery of Bill's Body**: The discovery of Bill's body in the car's trunk was incidental and not part of the original search warrant or consent search.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the letter was found during a lawful frisk based on reasonable suspicion, the letter itself was lawfully obtained. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. admissible, because it was on the person, or in the presence of the person, who was later arrested.**\n\nThe letter was found during a lawful pat-down, making it admissible evidence."
