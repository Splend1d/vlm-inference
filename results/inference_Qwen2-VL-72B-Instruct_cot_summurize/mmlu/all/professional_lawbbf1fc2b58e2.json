The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. In the context of sales of goods, this typically applies to contracts for the sale of goods valued at $500 or more. For such contracts to be enforceable, they must be evidenced by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, and the writing must include sufficient terms to identify the parties, the subject matter, and the quantity of goods involved.\n\nIn this scenario, the manufacturer's representative verbally agreed to purchase 300 washing machine motors at $300 each. However, the subsequent unsigned note sent by the manufacturer does not contain all the necessary elements required by the Statute of Frauds. Specifically, the note lacks a signature and does not explicitly state the quantity of motors being ordered (even though it can be inferred from the context).\n\nTherefore, the supplier's defense based on the Statute of Frauds is likely to succeed because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract, which is a critical element required for the enforceability of the contract under the Statute of Frauds."
