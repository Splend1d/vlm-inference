Generally, nonmetals have higher electron affinities than metals because they tend to attract additional electrons more readily.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Fluorine (F) - Fluorine is a halogen and typically has a high electron affinity because it easily gains an electron to achieve a stable octet configuration.\n\nB. Silicon (Si) - Silicon is a metalloid and generally has a lower electron affinity compared to nonmetals like fluorine or oxygen.\n\nC. Oxygen (O) - Oxygen is a nonmetal and has a relatively high electron affinity as it can gain two electrons to achieve a stable configuration.\n\nD. Calcium (Ca) - Calcium is an alkaline earth metal and typically has a very low electron affinity because metals do not readily accept additional electrons.\n\nGiven this information, calcium (Ca) is expected to have the lowest electron affinity among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Ca"
