Shipment contract\n\nIn a shipment contract, the seller's obligation ends when they deliver the goods to the carrier at the specified shipping point. The risk of loss and title typically passes to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier. This contrasts with a destination contract, where the seller's obligation includes delivering the goods to the final destination, and the risk of loss and title pass to the buyer upon delivery at that destination.\n\nF.A.S. (Free Alongside Ship) and F.O.B. (Free On Board) are terms used in international trade contracts to specify when the risk and responsibility for the goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. However, these terms are more specific than just \"shipment contract\" and usually include details about the exact point of transfer (e.g., alongside the ship or on board the ship).\n\nTherefore, the most general term that fits the description provided is a shipment contract."
