They were worried that the rugby club would be forced to disband because the law school had withdrawn its sponsorship. While the student was discussing the problem with his teammates, the owner of the tavern approached the players. The owner indicated that he was interested in sponsoring the rugby club because he felt it would help business at the pub. During their ensuing discussion, the owner agreed to sponsor the rugby club. The parties then orally agreed that the owner \"would pay for all the usual sponsoring fees\" incurred by the club. The owner had understood the agreement to mean that he would pay for the rugby shirts and supply the keg of beer following each \"home\" game that the rugby club played. Conversely, the student thought that the owner would be reimbursing the team for (a) the shirts, (b) the keg of beer (following \"home\" games), as well as (c) transportation expenses for \"away\" games and (d) equipment expenses (balls, etc. ). Assume that it was the customary practice of the rugby teams in the community to have the sponsors pay for (a) the shirts and (b) beer only. Before the rugby club was to play its first game under the owner's sponsorship, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.\nB. A contract exists on the terms understood by the student.\nC. A contract exists on the terms that are customary for the other teams in the community.\nD. No contract exists.\n"

No contract exists.\n\nFor a contract to exist, there must be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent (meeting of the minds). In this scenario, while there was an offer and acceptance, there was no clear meeting of the minds regarding the terms of the sponsorship. The owner and the student had different understandings of what \"all the usual sponsoring fees\" included. Since there was no clear agreement on the specific terms of the sponsorship, the essential element of mutual assent is missing, and thus no enforceable contract exists."
