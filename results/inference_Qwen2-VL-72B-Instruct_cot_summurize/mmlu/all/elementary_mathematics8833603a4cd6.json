Let's re-examine the given formula: \"The total length of the music showcase is 3(20 + 10) + 40 minutes.\"\n\nUsing this formula:\n- \\(3(20 + 10) = 3 \\times 30 = 90\\) minutes for the three sets including their breaks.\n- Adding the 40-minute set: \\(90 + 40 = 130\\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 130 minutes"
