It directly relates to the right to goods and services because it involves the possession and use of a tangible item.\n\nB. **John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals that she values**:\n   - This pertains more to personal autonomy and freedom rather than to goods and services. It is about respecting someone's ability to pursue their own goals, which is more aligned with rights of liberty and self-determination.\n\nC. **John's duty to not harm Mary**:\n   - This is a duty related to non-maleficence or avoiding harm to another person. While important, it does not specifically relate to goods and services but rather to personal safety and well-being.\n\nD. **John's duty to not commit suicide**:\n   - This is a duty related to self-preservation and is more about individual responsibility for one's own life rather than duties concerning goods and services.\n\nGiven this analysis, the duty that most clearly corresponds to a right to goods and services is:\n\n**A. John's duty to return to Mary that car that he borrowed from her**\n\nThis option directly involves the handling and return of a tangible good, aligning with the concept of rights to goods and services."
