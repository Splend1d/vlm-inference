Lord Devlin argued that society has a legitimate interest in preserving its moral fabric and that this can justify the use of criminal law to prevent immoral behavior, even if it is consensual and private.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law.**\n   - This directly challenges the fundamental premise of Devlin's argument. If society has no right to use the criminal law for moral preservation, then Devlin's entire rationale falls apart.\n\nB. **Homosexual acts cause public outrage.**\n   - This statement might support Devlin\u2019s view rather than refute it, as it suggests that there is public concern about these acts, which could justify legal intervention according to Devlin.\n\nC. **The courts are the best place to resolve moral questions such as those concerning homosexuality and prostitution.**\n   - This does not necessarily refute Devlin's argument. It merely shifts the venue for resolving moral issues but does not address whether the state should have any role in enforcing morality.\n\nD. **The law is anachronistic.**\n   - While this might suggest that current laws are outdated, it does not directly challenge the principle that society has a right to enforce moral standards through the criminal law.\n\nGiven this analysis, the proposition that most powerfully refutes Lord Devlin's argument is:\n\n**A. Society has no right to preserve its moral and social cohesion through the criminal law.**\n\nThis option directly undermines the central claim of Devlin's argument by denying the legitimacy of using criminal law for moral preservation."
