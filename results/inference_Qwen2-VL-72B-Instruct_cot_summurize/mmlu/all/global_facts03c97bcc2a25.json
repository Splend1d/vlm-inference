Income refers to the money earned in a year, while net worth includes all assets minus liabilities.\n\n4. **Analyze the options**:\n   - A. $150,000\n   - B. $75,000\n   - C. $35,000\n   - D. $15,000\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, let's consider the following points:\n- The richest one percent globally typically have significantly higher incomes than the average person.\n- The threshold for being in the top one percent varies by country but is generally quite high.\n\nBased on available data and reasonable assumptions, the correct answer would likely be the highest option provided, which is:\n\nA. $150,000\n\nTherefore, to be among the richest one percent in the world as of 2020, you would need to make approximately $150,000 annually."
