                    "text": "To determine the appropriate charges for the defendant under modern statutory law, let's break down the events described:\n\n1. **Initial Threat**: On one morning in a Laundromat, the defendant threatened the man with physical harm if he did not pay $500 by July 2. This threat constitutes an act of extortion, as it involves obtaining money through coercion or threats of violence.\n\n2. **Demand and Payment**: On July 2, the defendant met the man at a local bar and demanded the money. The man handed over the $500. This act can be considered robbery because the defendant used the initial threat to obtain money from the man.\n\n3. **Physical Assault**: After receiving the money, the defendant punched the man in the stomach and left. This physical attack is an act of battery, as it involves the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person.\n\nGiven these actions, the defendant can be charged with both extortion (for the initial threat) and robbery (for obtaining money through the threat). Additionally, the defendant can also be charged with battery for the physical assault.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Extortion and robbery.**\n\nThis choice captures both the initial threat to obtain money and the subsequent act of obtaining the money through that threat, which together constitute extortion and robbery."
