Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n"

Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n\nThis situation describes an example of natural selection, where the environment (the dark lava formations and the light sandy desert) selects for different phenotypes (dark-colored mice on the lava and light-colored mice in the desert). This is a classic case of adaptive camouflage, where the coloration of the mice helps them blend into their respective environments, reducing their visibility to predators and thus increasing their chances of survival and reproduction."
