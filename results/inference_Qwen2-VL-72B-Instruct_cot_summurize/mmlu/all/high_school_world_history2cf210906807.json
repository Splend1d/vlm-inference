The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth?\n\nA. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires\nB. The development of joint-stock companies\nC. The importation of food crops from the New World\nD. The African slave trade\n"

                    "text": "To determine which historical development most inspired the instructions to boycott foreign cloth, let's analyze the context and content of the passage.\n\nMahatma Gandhi's message emphasizes the importance of remaining non-violent, maintaining Hindu-Muslim unity, and boycotting foreign cloth while promoting local industries such as spinning and weaving. This reflects a broader movement towards self-reliance and resistance against foreign economic dominance.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires**: While this had significant impacts on Indian history, it does not directly relate to the economic aspects of boycotting foreign cloth.\n\nB. **The development of joint-stock companies**: Joint-stock companies, particularly those involved in colonial trade (like the East India Company), played a crucial role in the economic exploitation of India. Gandhi's call to boycott foreign cloth can be seen as a response to the economic dominance exerted by these companies.\n\nC. **The importation of food crops from the New World**: This development primarily affected agriculture and diet rather than the textile industry, making it less relevant to the specific call to boycott foreign cloth.\n\nD. **The African slave trade**: Although the slave trade had profound global consequences, it did not directly inspire the economic boycott of foreign cloth in India.\n\nGiven this analysis, the development that most inspired the instructions to boycott foreign cloth is:\n\n**B. The development of joint-stock companies**\n\nThese companies were instrumental in establishing colonial trade networks and economic control over India, which Gandhi sought to resist through the promotion of local industries and the boycott of foreign goods."
