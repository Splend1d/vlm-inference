Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard. The resulting P-value was 0.07. Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?\n\nA. The null hypothesis should be rejected.\nB. The null hypothesis should be accepted.\nC. There is a 7% chance that the null hypothesis is correct.\nD.

In this case, the null hypothesis would likely state that there is no difference in the proportion of injuries between the traditional keyboard and the new design. A P-value of 0.07 means that if the new keyboard does not actually prevent injuries any better than the traditional one, we would still observe the current results (or more extreme ones) about 7% of the time just by random chance."
