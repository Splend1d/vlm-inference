There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\nC. U.S. markets will have access to less expensive beef.\nD. Deforestation will allow more sunlight to penetrate areas that were kept dark by dense vegetation.\n"

There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\n\nTropical rain forests play a crucial role in maintaining local and global climate patterns. When they are cleared, it disrupts the water cycle, leading to reduced rainfall and altered weather patterns in the affected regions. This can have severe ecological and environmental impacts, including soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and changes in regional climates."
