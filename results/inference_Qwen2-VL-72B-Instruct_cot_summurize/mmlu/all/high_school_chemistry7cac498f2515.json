A buffer resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added to it.\n\nGiven that the student starts with a strong acid (0.100 M), to create a buffer, they would need to mix it with a weak base. This is because mixing a strong acid with a weak base will result in the formation of a weak acid (the conjugate acid of the weak base) and its conjugate base (the salt formed from the reaction between the strong acid and the weak base).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a weak base"
