However, in general, a span of control of 5-7 direct reports per manager is often considered effective for most organizations. This allows managers to effectively supervise and support their team members without becoming overwhelmed or stretched too thin. Therefore, option B (5) or C (7) could be considered correct answers, but it ultimately depends on the specific context and needs of the organization. Option D (None of the above) would also be a correct answer if the organization's optimal span of control falls outside of these ranges."
