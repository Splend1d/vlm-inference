This involves determining the criteria that will be used to divide the market into distinct groups of customers who have similar needs and characteristics. These criteria could include demographic factors such as age, gender, income, education level, or geographic location, as well as psychographic factors such as lifestyle, values, and attitudes. Once the bases for segmentation have been identified, the firm can then proceed with the other steps in the market segmentation process, such as forecasting total market potential, forecasting market share, and selecting target market segments."
