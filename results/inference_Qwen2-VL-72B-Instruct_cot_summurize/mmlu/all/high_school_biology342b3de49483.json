Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.\n\nThis statement is correct because all somatic (body) cells in an organism typically contain the same DNA. The differences between cell types, such as liver cells and white blood cells, arise from differential gene expression rather than having different sets of genes. Each cell type expresses a subset of genes that are necessary for its specific functions, but the underlying genetic material is the same across all cells in the body."
