Acceleration due to gravity: The pressure at the bottom of a pond is directly related to the weight of the water above it, which depends on the gravitational force acting on the water. Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity affects the pressure.\n\nB. Water density: Pressure is also dependent on the density of the water because denser water will exert more pressure for a given depth and gravitational force.\n\nC. Depth of the pond: The deeper the water, the greater the pressure at the bottom due to the increased weight of the water column above.\n\nD. Surface area of the pond: The surface area of the pond does not affect the pressure at the bottom. Pressure is defined as force per unit area, but the total force (and thus the pressure) at the bottom is independent of the surface area of the pond; it only depends on the depth, density, and gravitational acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Surface area of the pond."
