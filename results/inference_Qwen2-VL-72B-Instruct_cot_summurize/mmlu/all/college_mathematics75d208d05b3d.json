This follows directly from the definition of continuity and the properties of compact sets in topology.\n\nNow let's analyze the other options:\n\nA. **f is a homeomorphism**:\n   - A homeomorphism is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) continuous function with a continuous inverse. While this condition ensures that \\( T \\) is compact, it is stronger than just requiring \\( f \\) to be continuous because it also requires \\( f \\) to be bijective and its inverse to be continuous.\n\nB. **f is continuous and one-to-one**:\n   - Being continuous and one-to-one is stronger than just being continuous. It implies that \\( f \\) is injective but not necessarily surjective. However, since we already know \\( f \\) is onto (surjective), this condition is redundant for ensuring compactness of \\( T \\).\n\nD. **f is one-to-one**:\n   - Being one-to-one (injective) alone does not guarantee that \\( T \\) is compact even if \\( S \\) is compact. The continuity of \\( f \\) is necessary to preserve compactness.\n\nTherefore, the weakest condition that suffices to ensure the compactness of \\( T \\) is that \\( f \\) is continuous."
