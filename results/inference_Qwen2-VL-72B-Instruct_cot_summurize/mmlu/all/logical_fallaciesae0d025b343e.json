A disjunctive syllogism typically begins with a statement that presents two or more alternatives (e.g., \"Either P or Q\").\n\nB. **Classifies subjects** - This is not specific to disjunctive syllogisms. While classification can be part of logical arguments, it does not define the structure of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nC. **Affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent** - This describes modus ponens or modus tollens, which are forms of deductive reasoning involving conditional statements, not disjunctive syllogisms.\n\nD. **Leads to a valid conclusion** - While this is true for any valid argument, it is not specific to the structure of a disjunctive syllogism itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Includes two or more alternatives"
