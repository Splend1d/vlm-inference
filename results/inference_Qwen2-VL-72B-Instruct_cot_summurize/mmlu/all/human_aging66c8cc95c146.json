Less than 25%: This suggests that fewer than one in four people prefer bridge jobs over career jobs.\n   - B. Less than 50%: This suggests that fewer than half of the people prefer bridge jobs over career jobs.\n   - C. More than 50%: This suggests that more than half of the people prefer bridge jobs over career jobs.\n   - D. More than 75%: This suggests that more than three-quarters of the people prefer bridge jobs over career jobs.\n\n3. **Contextual Knowledge**: Bridge jobs typically refer to temporary or part-time work often taken after retirement or between full-time career jobs. Career jobs are usually long-term, stable positions with higher responsibilities and benefits.\n\n4. **Logical Reasoning**: Given that career jobs generally offer more stability, benefits, and potentially higher pay compared to bridge jobs, it is less likely that a majority (more than 50%) would find bridge jobs better than career jobs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most reasonable answer is:\n\nB. Less than 50%"
