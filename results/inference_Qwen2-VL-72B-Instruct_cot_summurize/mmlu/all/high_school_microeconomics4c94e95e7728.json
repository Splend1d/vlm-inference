MC that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that as more units of a variable input (such as labor) are added to a fixed input (such as capital), the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease. This means that each additional unit of input results in a smaller increase in output. As a result, the marginal cost (MC), which is the cost of producing one additional unit of output, initially decreases because the additional units of input are being used more efficiently. However, once diminishing returns set in, the MC starts to rise because each additional unit of input results in a smaller increase in output, making it more costly to produce each additional unit."
