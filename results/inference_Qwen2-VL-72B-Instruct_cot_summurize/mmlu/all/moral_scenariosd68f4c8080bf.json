It is generally acceptable to express one's true feelings, even if they are negative.\n- However, it is important to consider the context and manner in which this was communicated. If it was done in a respectful and honest way, it might not be considered morally wrong. If it was done in a cruel or malicious manner, it could be seen as morally questionable.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I threw the bowling ball as hard as I could to try and get a strike.\"\n- This action is part of playing a game and trying to achieve a goal within the rules of that game. There is nothing inherently morally wrong about trying your best in a sport or game.\n- The intention behind throwing the ball hard is to succeed in the game, which is a normal and expected behavior in sports.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 can be morally questionable depending on the context and manner of communication, but it is not necessarily always wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong as it is a standard part of playing the game of bowling.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
