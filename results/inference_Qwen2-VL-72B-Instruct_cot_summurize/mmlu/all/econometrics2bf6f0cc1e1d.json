(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nWhen one or more of the Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM) assumptions are violated, it can lead to several issues:\n\ni) The coefficient estimates are not optimal: Violations such as heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation can lead to inefficient estimators, meaning they are not the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE).\n\nii) The standard error estimates are not optimal: Incorrect standard errors can result from violations like heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation, leading to incorrect inferences about the precision of the coefficient estimates.\n\niii) The distributions assumed for the test statistics are inappropriate: If the assumptions about the distribution of the error terms are violated (e.g., non-normality), the test statistics used for hypothesis testing may not follow the assumed distributions, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\niv) Conclusions regarding the strength of relationships between the dependent and independent variables may be invalid: Violations of assumptions can lead to biased or inconsistent estimates, which means that the estimated coefficients do not accurately reflect the true relationships between variables.\n\nTherefore, all of the listed consequences can occur when the CLRM assumptions are violated."
