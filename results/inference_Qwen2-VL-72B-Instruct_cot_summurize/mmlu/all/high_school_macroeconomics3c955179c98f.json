This shift in consumer preference leads to an increase in the demand for good Z.\n\nHere's how this affects the market for good Z:\n\n1. **Increase in Demand**: As more consumers buy good Z instead of good X, the demand curve for good Z shifts to the right. This means that at any given price, there is now a higher quantity demanded.\n\n2. **Equilibrium Price**: With the increased demand, the new equilibrium price will be higher than the original equilibrium price because the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at the original price level.\n\n3. **Equilibrium Quantity**: At the new higher price, the quantity supplied increases to meet the higher quantity demanded, leading to a new equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at a higher price level.\n\nTherefore, both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of good Z will rise.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise."
