Realists prioritize state sovereignty, national interests, and the balance of power in the international system. They believe that states should act in their own self-interest and that international cooperation should be based on pragmatic calculations rather than idealistic or moral considerations.\n\nExceptionalism, particularly American exceptionalism, often implies a belief in the inherent superiority or uniqueness of the United States and its values, which can lead to policies that prioritize unilateral action over multilateral cooperation. This can result in a diminished focus on collective security arrangements, such as alliances and international institutions, which realists see as important for maintaining stability and order in the international system.\n\nOptions B and C are not accurate from a realist perspective because realists generally oppose the idea of world government, seeing it as a threat to state sovereignty. Option D is also incorrect because realists would argue that exceptionalism does not necessarily lead to a diminished focus on security, power, and interest; rather, they might see it as an obstacle to achieving these goals effectively through realistic and pragmatic means."
