Mercury(II) oxide\n\nHeating mercury(II) oxide can pose a significant safety risk because it decomposes to release elemental mercury, which is highly toxic and volatile. The vapor can be inhaled, leading to serious health issues. In contrast, the other substances listed do not present such immediate or severe hazards when heated under typical laboratory conditions."
