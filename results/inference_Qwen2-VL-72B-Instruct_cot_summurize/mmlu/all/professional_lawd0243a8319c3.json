The man's friend is the owner of parcel \"B,\" which is situated lower than \"A\" on the mountainside. The man's cousin owns parcel \"C,\" which lies below parcels \"A\" and \"B\" on the mountain slope. In 2000, the man who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the man sold parcel \"B\" to his friend. The following year, the cousin purchased parcel \"C\" from the man. The deeds to the friend and the cousin did not contain any mention of the man's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. From the standpoint of the friend and the cousin, thedrainage system would most likely be defined as a(an)\n\nA. easement appurtenant.\nB. easement by implication.\nC. prescriptive easement.\nD. express easement.\n"

To determine how the drainage system would most likely be defined from the standpoint of the friend (owner of parcel \"B\") and the cousin (owner of parcel \"C\"), we need to consider the nature of easements.\n\nAn **easement** is a right to use another person's land for a specific purpose. There are several types of easements:\n\n1. **Easement Appurtenant**: This type of easement benefits a particular piece of land and is attached to it, passing with the land when it is sold.\n2. **Easement by Implication**: This arises when there is a necessity for the easement due to the prior unity of ownership and the subsequent division of the land.\n3. **Prescriptive Easement**: This is acquired through continuous, open, and notorious use over a statutory period.\n4. **Express Easement**: This is created by a written agreement or deed.\n\nGiven the context:\n- The drainage system was initially constructed by the original owner of all three parcels.\n- The system was not mentioned in the deeds when parcels \"B\" and \"C\" were sold.\n- The system has been in use since before the parcels were divided.\n\nFrom this information, the most appropriate classification would be:\n\n**B. Easement by Implication**\n\nThis is because the drainage system was necessary for the proper functioning of the properties when they were under single ownership. When the parcels were divided, the necessity for the drainage system continued, implying that the easement should continue to exist even though it was not explicitly mentioned in the deeds."
