This condition is prevalent in many populations around the world, with estimates suggesting that about 70% to 75% of adults globally are lactase non-persisters. The prevalence varies widely by region and ethnicity, with higher rates in certain populations such as those of African, Asian, and Native American descent, and lower rates among people of Northern European descent."
