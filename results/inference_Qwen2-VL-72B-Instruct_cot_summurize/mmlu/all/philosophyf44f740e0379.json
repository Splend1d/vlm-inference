He argues that saying something is \"good\" is not just a matter of describing its natural properties but involves a distinct, non-natural quality. This critique is aimed at what he calls the \"naturalistic fallacy,\" where philosophers attempt to define \"good\" in terms of natural properties or characteristics."
