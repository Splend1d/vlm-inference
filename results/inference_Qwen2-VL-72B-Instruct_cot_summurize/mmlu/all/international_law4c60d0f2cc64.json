Protocol 14 introduced a single judge formation to decide on admissibility issues.\n\nB. **Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility**:\n   - This is true. Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion related to the exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n\nC. **Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights**:\n   - This is true. Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights and replaced it with a single-judge formation within the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nD. **Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights**:\n   - This is false. Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for judges of the European Court of Human Rights. The term remained at nine years.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\n**D. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights**."
