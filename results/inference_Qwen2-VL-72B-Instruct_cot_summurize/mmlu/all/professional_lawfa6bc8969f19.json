The agency is authorized to enter into and carry out such contracts or agreements as are necessary in the conduct of its business. An export company entered into a contract with the federal agency to transport a variety of goods to foreign countries. Thereafter, the federal agency suspended the export company pending an investigation into possible misuse of official inspection certificates relating to commodities exported to a foreign country. During an investigation relevant to the charge, the president of the export company presented information to the federal agency. Subsequently, the president was charged with violation of a federal statute that states:\"It is a felony for any person in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency to knowingly make a false statement. \"At the president's trial, the government presented evidence to show that he falsified bills of lading and embezzled over $500,000 of surplus commodities for export. The president testified that he did not know that he was dealing with a federal agency and, hence, the federal government would have jurisdiction over his company's export contract with the federal agency. As to the significance of the president's ignorance, the court should instruct the jury that it may convict the president\n\nA. if it finds that the president knew that he was doing business with a federal agency.\nB. if it finds that the president was aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nC. if a reasonable person would have been aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nD. even if there was no reason the president should have known that he was doing business with a federal agency.\n"

Knowledge of the agency's federal status is crucial to establishing the requisite mens rea (criminal intent) for the offense. Therefore, the jury must find that the president had knowledge of the federal nature of the agency to convict him of violating the statute."
