                    "text": "To determine which statement must be true if the voting law is upheld by the court, we need to consider the different levels of scrutiny applied by courts when reviewing laws:\n\n1. **Rational Basis Review**: This is the lowest level of scrutiny and applies when the law is not related to a fundamental right or a suspect classification. The law must be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\n\n2. **Intermediate Scrutiny**: This applies when the law involves quasi-suspect classifications (such as gender) or affects important rights (but not fundamental ones). The law must be substantially related to an important government purpose.\n\n3. **Strict Scrutiny**: This is the highest level of scrutiny and applies when the law involves a fundamental right or a suspect classification (such as race). The law must be necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.\n\nGiven these levels of scrutiny, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.**\n   - This would imply strict scrutiny, which is typically not applied to voting laws unless they involve fundamental rights or suspect classifications.\n\nB. **The law is substantially related to an important government purpose.**\n   - This would imply intermediate scrutiny, which might apply in some cases but is not the most common standard for voting laws.\n\nC. **The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.**\n   - This implies rational basis review, which is the most common standard applied to voting laws. It is generally assumed that voting laws will be upheld under this standard unless they are clearly irrational.\n\nD. **The law is substantially related to a legitimate government purpose.**\n   - This is a mix of standards and does not fit neatly into any of the established levels of scrutiny.\n\nConsidering the typical application of scrutiny levels to voting laws, the most likely scenario is that the law would be upheld under rational basis review. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.**"
