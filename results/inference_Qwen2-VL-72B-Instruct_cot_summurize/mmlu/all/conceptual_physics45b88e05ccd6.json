This is because the resistances of the individual components add up when they are connected in series.\n\nThe relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit is given by Ohm's Law:\n\n\\[ V = I \\times R \\]\n\nIf the voltage supplied by the power source remains constant, and the total resistance of the circuit increases due to adding more lamps in series, then according to Ohm's Law, the current (I) must decrease to maintain the equality.\n\nTherefore, as more lamps are connected in a series circuit, the current in the power source **decreases**.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. decreases."
