As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\nA. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\nB. He intended only to wound the friend.\nC. He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nD. The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best defense for the defendant in this case, we need to analyze the elements of first-degree murder under the given statutes. According to Section 169, first-degree murder requires an unlawful and intentional killing with malice aforethought. Section 170 defines malice as a deliberate intention to take away the life of another.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.**\n   - This does not negate the element of malice because the defendant still had a deliberate intention to take away the life of someone (the friend). The fact that the victim was unintended does not change the intent to kill.\n\nB. **He intended only to wound the friend.**\n   - This option suggests that the defendant did not have the intent to kill anyone, which directly challenges the requirement of malice aforethought. If the defendant intended only to wound, it could be argued that he lacked the specific intent to kill required for first-degree murder.\n\nC. **He was unaware of the elements of malice.**\n   - Lack of awareness of legal definitions does not typically serve as a valid defense in criminal law. Intent and malice are determined by the defendant's actions and state of mind, not their knowledge of legal terms.\n\nD. **The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.**\n   - Negligence implies a lack of due care rather than an intentional act. However, even if the defendant was negligent in missing the friend, the act of firing the gun with the intent to harm someone (the friend) still demonstrates malice.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best defense for the defendant would be Option B: \"He intended only to wound the friend.\" This option directly addresses the absence of the requisite intent to kill, which is a critical element of first-degree murder.\n\n**Final Answer: B. He intended only to wound the friend.**"
