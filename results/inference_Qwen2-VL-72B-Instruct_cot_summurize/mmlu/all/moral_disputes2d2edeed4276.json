It implies that the prohibition is not paternalistic because it doesn't restrict individual freedom for their own good.\n\nB. **Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.**\n   - This acknowledges that the prohibition is indeed paternalistic but argues that the positive outcomes justify the paternalistic nature of the policy.\n\nC. **Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.**\n   - This implies that since adults are involved, the prohibition cannot be considered paternalistic because paternalism is reserved for children.\n\nD. **Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.**\n   - This statement generalizes that any form of paternalism is justified if it serves the best interests of those affected, regardless of whether it pertains to drug prohibition specifically.\n\nGiven these options, the most plausible response from de Marneffe, considering his stance on drug prohibition and paternalism, would be:\n\n**B. Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the concern about paternalism while suggesting that the benefits of prohibition justify the paternalistic approach."
