                    "text": "To determine which additional fact would help the man the most if he is sued for negligence per se, we need to consider the elements of negligence per se and how each option might impact the case.\n\nNegligence per se occurs when a person violates a statute or ordinance designed to protect a certain class of individuals from a specific type of harm, and the violation results in injury to someone within that protected class. For the man to be found negligent per se, it must be shown that:\n1. He violated the ordinance (by washing his car on the street).\n2. The ordinance was intended to prevent the type of harm that occurred (in this case, the harm caused by the icy road).\n3. The harm actually resulted from the violation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The man was not aware of the ordinance.**\n   - Lack of awareness does not typically excuse a violation of an ordinance. Ignorance of the law is generally not a defense in negligence cases. This fact would likely not help the man.\n\nB. **The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.**\n   - This fact could potentially weaken the argument that the ordinance was specifically intended to prevent the type of harm that occurred (icy roads leading to accidents). If the ordinance was enacted due to a different type of harm (being hit by a truck), it may suggest that the ordinance was not directly aimed at preventing icy roads. This could undermine the claim of negligence per se.\n\nC. **The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.**\n   - This fact does not provide any legal defense against the claim of negligence per se. It simply establishes that the driver had knowledge of the man\u2019s actions but does not affect the legality or intent behind the ordinance.\n\nD. **The driver is not a resident of the city.**\n   - The residency status of the driver does not impact the validity of the claim of negligence per se. The ordinance applies equally to all drivers on the city streets, regardless of their residency status.\n\nBased on the analysis, the fact that would help the man the most is:\n\n**B. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.**\n\nThis fact suggests that the ordinance was not specifically intended to prevent the type of harm that occurred (icy roads leading to accidents) but rather another type of harm (being hit by a truck). This could weaken the argument that the man's violation of the ordinance directly led to the harm suffered by the driver, thereby undermining the claim of negligence per se."
