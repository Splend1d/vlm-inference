Since we want to know if the true proportion is between 60% and 68%, we are looking for a confidence interval that includes these values. \n\nThe margin of error (ME) is given by:\n\\[ ME = z \\times SE \\]\n\nWe need to find the z-score such that the confidence interval \\( \\hat{p} \\pm ME \\) includes both 0.60 and 0.68. This means the interval should be centered around 0.64 with a width that covers from 0.60 to 0.68.\n\nThe distance from 0.64 to either end of the interval (0.60 or 0.68) is 0.04. Therefore, the margin of error is 0.04.\n\nUsing the formula for the margin of error:\n\\[ 0.04 = z \\times 0.024 \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{0.04}{0.024} \\approx 1.67 \\]\n\nThe z-score of approximately 1.67 corresponds to a confidence level of about 90%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 90.4%"
