The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\nDuring the boiling process, the intermolecular forces (in this case, hydrogen bonds) between the NH3 molecules are overcome by the increased kinetic energy of the molecules. This allows the molecules to escape from the liquid phase into the gas phase. The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules do not break; only the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are disrupted."
