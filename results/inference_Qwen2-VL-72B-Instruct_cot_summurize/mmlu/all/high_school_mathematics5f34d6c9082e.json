Since there are 4 packages and 4 houses, each package has 4 choices for delivery, leading to a total of \\(4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\) possible arrangements.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these arrangements have exactly two packages delivered correctly. To do this, we choose 2 out of the 4 packages to be correctly delivered. The number of ways to choose 2 packages out of 4 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So, the number of ways to choose 2 packages out of 4 is:\n\n\\[C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\]\n\nHowever, once we've chosen which 2 packages will be correctly delivered, the remaining 2 packages must be incorrectly delivered with respect to each other (since if they were both correctly delivered, it would mean all 4 packages are correctly delivered, which contradicts our condition). There is only 1 way to arrange the remaining 2 packages such that neither is in its correct place (they must be swapped).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes (exactly 2 packages correctly delivered) is \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n\nFinally, the probability of exactly two packages being correctly delivered is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[P(\\text{exactly 2 correct}) = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)."
