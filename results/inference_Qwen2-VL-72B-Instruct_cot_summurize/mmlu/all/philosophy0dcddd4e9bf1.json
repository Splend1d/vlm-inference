This view is rooted in his understanding of human nature and purpose. Aquinas believed that humans are rational beings with an inherent desire to know and understand the truth. The highest form of knowledge and fulfillment, therefore, comes from contemplating the divine essence, which is God. This contemplation is possible after death when the soul is united with God in heaven. Thus, for Aquinas, ultimate happiness is not found in earthly pleasures or even in the practice of moral virtues alone, but in the direct vision and contemplation of God."
