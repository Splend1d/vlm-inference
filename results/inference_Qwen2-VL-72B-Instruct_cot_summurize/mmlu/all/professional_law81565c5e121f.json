                    "text": "A buyer purchased a new convertible from an automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the buyer began smelling a pungent gasoline odor in the vehicle. The buyer immediately took the car to the dealership and told the service manager what was wrong. The service manager indicated that he would take care of the problem and contact the buyer when the car was ready. The next day, the buyer was informed that the problem had been corrected and the car was available for pickup. The buyer then went to the dealership, took possession of his car, and drove off. After traveling about five miles, the buyer again smelled gasoline fumes. Irritated that the problem had not been corrected, the buyer decided to drive back to the dealership. As he was doing so, the car suddenly exploded, and the buyer suffered third-degree bums over 90 percent of his body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a defective gas tank that had ruptured. This produced a gasoline leak that was ignited by sparks from the car's underbody. A reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defective gas tank. The trouble the buyer had described to the service manager was indicative of such a problem. If the buyer asserts a claim against the manufacturer of the convertible for damages for his injuries, will the buyer prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank.\nB. Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank.\nC. No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred.\nD. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the buyer will prevail in a claim against the manufacturer of the convertible for damages resulting from his injuries, we need to consider several legal principles related to product liability and negligence.\n\n1. **Manufacturer's Liability**: Manufacturers can be held liable for defects in their products that cause harm. This includes both design defects (inherent flaws in the design) and manufacturing defects (errors during production).\n\n2. **Foreseeability and Reasonable Inspection**: The manufacturer is expected to produce goods that are reasonably safe for their intended use. If a defect could have been discovered through a reasonable inspection, the manufacturer may be held responsible.\n\n3. **Chain of Causation**: For the buyer to succeed in a claim, there must be a direct causal link between the defective product and the injury sustained. In this case, the explosion was directly caused by the defective gas tank.\n\n4. **Negligence**: The buyer's actions also play a role. If the buyer's behavior contributed to the harm (e.g., continuing to drive despite noticing a gasoline smell), it might affect the outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A: Yes, if the dealership should have replaced the gas tank** - This option focuses on the dealership's responsibility rather than the manufacturer's. While the dealership's failure to correct the issue might be relevant, it does not directly address the manufacturer's liability.\n\n- **Option B: Yes, because the buyer's injury was caused by the defective gas tank** - This option correctly identifies the core issue: the buyer's injury was directly caused by the defective gas tank. However, it does not fully address whether the defect existed at the time of manufacture or if it was a result of other factors.\n\n- **Option C: No, if the buyer should have realized the gasoline smell presented a hazardous condition and stopped the car before the explosion occurred** - This option introduces the concept of contributory negligence. If the buyer's actions contributed to the harm, it might mitigate the manufacturer's liability but does not negate it entirely.\n\n- **Option D: No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant** - This option correctly points out that the manufacturer is only liable if the defect existed at the time of manufacture. If the defect arose due to misuse or damage after purchase, the manufacturer might not be liable.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. No, unless the gas tank was defective when the car left the manufacturer's plant.**\n\nThis option correctly addresses the manufacturer's liability based on the existence of the defect at the time of manufacture."
