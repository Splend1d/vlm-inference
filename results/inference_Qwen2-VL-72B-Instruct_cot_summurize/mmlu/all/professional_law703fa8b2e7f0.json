The homeowner entered into the contract with the architect because she was pleased with the work he had done on her neighbor's gardens. The architect promised to complete the job before May 30, the date of the homeowner's annual garden party. On March 1, the homeowner left for a month's vacation. Unknown to her, the architect, because of previous commitments, assigned the contract to a gardener. After the gardener had completed 60 percent of the work, the homeowner returned and was displeased with the landscaping already completed. The homeowner contacted the architect, who informed her of the assignment to the gardener and told her that he was no longer obligated under their original contract. Disgruntled, the homeowner fired the gardener. If the homeowner asserts a claim against the architect based on breach of contract, the fact that the architect assigned the contract to the gardener will\n\nA. relieve the architect of liability, because the contract was assignable.\nB. relieve the architect of liability, because the gardener's work was the cause of the homeowner \u0080\u0098s dissatisfaction.\nC. not relieve the architect of liability, because a personal service contract of this nature is non- delegable.\nD. not relieve the architect of liability, unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments.\n"

This indicates that the performance of the contract was dependent on the personal skills and reputation of the architect. Personal service contracts, which involve the unique skills or talents of an individual, are generally considered non-delegable. This means that the architect cannot assign the contract to another person without the homeowner's consent, as the essence of the agreement was the specific services provided by the architect himself.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the architect assigned the contract to a gardener without the homeowner's consent would not relieve the architect of liability. The homeowner has a valid claim against the architect for breach of contract, as the architect failed to fulfill his obligations personally, which was a key term of the agreement."
