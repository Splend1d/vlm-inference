There is no hierarchy among these methods and the choice belongs to the disputing States\n\nIn international law, there is no strict hierarchy or priority among the various methods of peaceful settlement of disputes. The choice of method depends on the preferences and agreement of the disputing states involved. While some methods may be more commonly used in certain situations, ultimately it is up to the states themselves to decide which approach they wish to pursue."
