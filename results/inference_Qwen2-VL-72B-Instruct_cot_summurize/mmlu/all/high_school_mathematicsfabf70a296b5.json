We need to choose 3 out of these 4 suits. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n   So, the number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times 1} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose the cards within each suit**: Once we have chosen the 3 suits, we need to select one card from each of these suits. Each suit has 13 cards. Therefore, for each suit, we have 13 choices.\n\n   Since we need to make this choice for each of the 3 suits independently, the total number of ways to choose one card from each of the 3 chosen suits is:\n   \\[\n   13 \\times 13 \\times 13 = 13^3 = 2197\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Finally, we multiply the number of ways to choose the suits by the number of ways to choose the cards within those suits:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 2197 = 8788\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, with each card being of a different suit, is 8788.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 8788."
