So, the total number of apples is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total apples} = 15 \\times 18 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total apples} = 270 \\]\n\nEach pie requires 7 apples, so the total number of pies they can make is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total pies} = \\frac{\\text{Total apples}}{\\text{Apples per pie}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total pies} = \\frac{270}{7} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total pies} = 38.57 \\]\n\nSince they can't make a fraction of a pie, they can make 38 whole pies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 38."
