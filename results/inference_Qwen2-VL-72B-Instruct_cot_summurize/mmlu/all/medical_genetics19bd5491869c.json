Peroxisomes are organelles involved in various metabolic processes, including the breakdown of fatty acids and the synthesis of certain lipids. Disorders affecting peroxisomes can lead to a wide range of symptoms, depending on the specific functions impaired.\n\n- Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a type of porphyria, a group of disorders affecting the production of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin.\n- Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited disorder that impairs the body's ability to break down certain amino acids.\n- Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a genetic disorder that affects the breakdown of fats for energy.\n\nThese other conditions are not classified as peroxisomal disorders."
