Interpretations of the data and limiting circumstances involving the test administration.\n\nWhen preparing a psychological testing report, it is essential that the psychologist provides an interpretation of the data collected during the assessment process. This includes explaining what the results mean in terms of the individual's functioning, strengths, weaknesses, and any potential areas of concern. Additionally, the report should address any limitations or factors that may have influenced the test results, such as the test environment, the individual's mood or physical state at the time of testing, or any other relevant contextual information. This helps ensure that the report is accurate, fair, and useful for making informed decisions about the individual's needs and treatment options."
