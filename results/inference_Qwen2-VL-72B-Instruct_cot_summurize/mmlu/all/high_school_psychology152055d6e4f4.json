While experimenting with rats, Pavlov discovered that if he repeatedly placed pellets of food in one side of a \"T-maze,\" the rats would automatically run to that side of the maze.\nB. While experimenting with dogs, Pavlov discovered that once his dogs became accustomed to seeing and hearing the attendant who brought them food at mealtime, they would salivate in response to the sight and sound of the attendant.\nC. While experimenting with cats, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a hungry cat inside a box and food outside the box, the cat could \"learn\" to press a lever to open the door of the box.\nD. While experimenting with pigeons, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a pigeon in a box, he could condition it to recognize that if it pecked at a particular key, it would receive a food pellet.\n"

While experimenting with dogs, Pavlov discovered that once his dogs became accustomed to seeing and hearing the attendant who brought them food at mealtime, they would salivate in response to the sight and sound of the attendant.\n\nThis statement best describes Ivan Pavlov's accidental discovery of classical conditioning. Pavlov was originally studying digestion in dogs when he noticed that they began to salivate not only in response to the food itself but also to other stimuli associated with feeding time, such as the sight or sound of the attendant. This led him to investigate further and develop his theory of classical conditioning."
