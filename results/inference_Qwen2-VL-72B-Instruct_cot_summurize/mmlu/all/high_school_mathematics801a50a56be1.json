                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Situation**: John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles with an equal number of pins. Let's denote the total number of pins John originally had as \\(P\\).\n\n2. **Division into Piles**: Since he divided them equally into two piles, each pile would have \\(\\frac{P}{2}\\) pins.\n\n3. **Giving Away Pins**: John then gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{P}{2}\\) pins from one pile.\n\n4. **Calculation of Given Away Pins**: Simplifying the fraction gives us \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{P}{2} = \\frac{P}{12}\\).\n\n5. **Remaining Pins**: After giving away \\(\\frac{P}{12}\\) pins from one pile, he has \\(\\frac{P}{2} - \\frac{P}{12}\\) pins left in that pile. Since he only gave away pins from one pile, the other pile remains unchanged at \\(\\frac{P}{2}\\). Therefore, the total number of pins left is \\(\\frac{P}{2} + \\left(\\frac{P}{2} - \\frac{P}{12}\\right)\\).\n\n6. **Simplification**: Combining like terms, we get \\(\\frac{P}{2} + \\frac{P}{2} - \\frac{P}{12} = P - \\frac{P}{12} = \\frac{12P}{12} - \\frac{P}{12} = \\frac{11P}{12}\\).\n\n7. **Given Information**: We know that after giving away some pins, John had 66 pins left. So, \\(\\frac{11P}{12} = 66\\).\n\n8. **Solving for \\(P\\)**: To find \\(P\\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac{12}{11}\\) to isolate \\(P\\): \n\\[P = 66 \\times \\frac{12}{11} = 6 \\times 12 = 72.\\]\n\nTherefore, John originally had 72 pins.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 72**."
