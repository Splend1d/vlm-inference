She finally got good news when her agent told her that she had landed a part in a big movie. Delighted, the actress went down to the pawnshop to retrieve her mother's pearls. When she arrived, the clerk told her that she needed to have cash in order to retrieve the necklace. As she had not been paid yet for the movie, the actress called her agent and told him her dilemma. The agent told her he would come down to the pawnshop and fix everything. When the agent arrived, the actress was still arguing with the clerk. The agent pulled the actress aside and told her that he would distract the clerk while the actress snatched the necklace. The agent then pretended to be interested in an antique lighter, and the actress snatched her necklace off the counter and left the store. The agent is subsequently prosecuted for larceny. The defendant could most appropriately be found\n\nA. guilty of larceny, but not conspiracy to commit larceny.\nB. guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny, but not larceny.\nC. guilty of both larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny.\nD. not guilty of either larceny or conspiracy to commit larceny.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the appropriate charge for the agent, we need to analyze the legal concepts involved: larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny.\n\n1. **Larceny**: This involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this case, the agent did not physically take the necklace himself; the actress did. Therefore, the agent cannot be directly charged with larceny based on his own actions.\n\n2. **Conspiracy to Commit Larceny**: This involves an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime (in this case, larceny) and at least one overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, the agent and the actress agreed to steal the necklace, and the agent took an overt act by distracting the clerk, which facilitated the actress's theft.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The agent did not personally commit the act of larceny (taking the necklace).\n- However, the agent did conspire with the actress to commit larceny and took an overt act (distracting the clerk) to facilitate the theft.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate charge for the agent would be:\n\n**B. guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny, but not larceny.**\n\nThis option accurately reflects the agent's involvement in planning and facilitating the theft without committing the actual act of stealing the necklace."
