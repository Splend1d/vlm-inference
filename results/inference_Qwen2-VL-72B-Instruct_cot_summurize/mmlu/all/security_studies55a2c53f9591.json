To prevent the erosion of established civil liberties through the removal of special rights and the cessation of extraordinary measures.\n\nDesecuritization is often advocated to reverse the process of securitization, which can lead to the erosion of civil liberties by justifying extraordinary measures and special rights for certain groups or actions. By desecuritizing issues, it aims to restore normal political processes and protect civil liberties."
