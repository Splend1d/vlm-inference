They were also quite diverse, which sometimes made it difficult for them to develop a strong sense of class consciousness (B). Additionally, many members of the middle class were involved in \"white collar\" work, such as clerical jobs, management, and professional occupations (C). Therefore, all of these statements apply to the middle classes of the nineteenth century."
