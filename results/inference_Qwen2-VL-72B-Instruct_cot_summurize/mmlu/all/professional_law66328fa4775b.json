While the defendant did make contact, it was accidental and not intentional.\n  \n- **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This occurs when someone dies as a result of reckless behavior or negligence without intent to kill. The defendant\u2019s actions led to the bartender's death, but it was an accident.\n\n- **Assault with a Deadly Weapon**: This involves threatening or attempting to cause bodily harm with a weapon. The defendant used a penknife, which could be considered a deadly weapon, even though the intent was to frighten rather than harm.\n\n- **Murder**: This typically requires intent to kill or cause serious harm. The defendant did not have this intent.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, the most serious crime that fits the scenario is **involuntary manslaughter** because the defendant's reckless use of the penknife resulted in the bartender's death, even though there was no intent to kill.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nB. Involuntary manslaughter."
