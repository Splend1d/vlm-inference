A solar day is defined as the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky, which is approximately 24 hours.\n\nB. A solar day is 4 minutes longer than a sidereal day.\n- This is true. A sidereal day is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the fixed stars, which is slightly shorter than a solar day by about 4 minutes.\n\nC. A solar day represents more than 360\u00b0 of rotation for the earth.\n- This is true. Because the Earth moves along its orbit around the Sun while it rotates, a solar day involves slightly more than 360\u00b0 of rotation to bring the Sun back to the same position in the sky.\n\nD. The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day.\n- This is not true. The Moon takes about 27.3 days (a sidereal month) to complete one orbit around the Earth relative to the stars, and about 29.5 days (a synodic month) to go through all its phases relative to the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is:\n\nD. The time it takes for the Moon to make one circuit of our sky is one solar day."
