It is not a standard part of either meiosis or mitosis.\n\n2. **G2 Phase**: This phase occurs after DNA replication (S phase) and before cell division (mitosis or meiosis). Cells in this phase prepare for division by synthesizing proteins and organelles necessary for cell division.\n\n3. **S Phase**: This is the synthesis phase where DNA replication occurs. Both meiotic and mitotic cells undergo DNA replication during this phase.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- G0 phase is not a standard part of either meiosis or mitosis.\n- G2 phase is common to both meiosis and mitosis.\n- S phase is also common to both meiosis and mitosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. II and III only"
