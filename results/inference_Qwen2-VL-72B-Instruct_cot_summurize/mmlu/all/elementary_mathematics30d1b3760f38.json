You are greater than 70.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can list the numbers that fit all three criteria:\n- Numbers with 7 in the ones place: 77, 71, 73, 75, 79\n- Numbers less than 80 and greater than 70: 71, 73, 75, 77, 79\n\nCombining both lists, we find that the numbers that satisfy all conditions are:\n- 71\n- 73\n- 77\n- 79\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\nA. 71\nB. 73\nC. 77\nD. 79\n\nAll of these options meet the criteria. However, since the question asks for \"my number,\" it implies there should be one specific answer. Given the context, any of these could be correct based on the information provided. If we assume the question is asking for a single correct answer from the options, then any of A, B, C, or D could be considered correct under the given conditions. \n\nIf the intention was to identify a single number, additional clarification would be needed. Based on the provided options and the conditions, each option (A, B, C, D) fits the description equally well."
