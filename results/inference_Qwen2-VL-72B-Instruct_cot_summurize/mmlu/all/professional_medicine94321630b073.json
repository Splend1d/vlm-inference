Dissection of the aorta\n\nGiven the patient's history of Marfan syndrome, which is associated with a higher risk of aortic dissection, along with the description of the chest pain as tearing and radiating to the neck, these symptoms are highly suggestive of an aortic dissection. The previous episode of milder chest pain that was self-treated with aspirin could have been an initial warning sign or a smaller dissection event. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention."
