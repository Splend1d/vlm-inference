This can lead to increased satisfaction with work schedules as employees can better align their work hours with their personal needs and preferences. While flexitime may also positively impact other areas such as absenteeism, self-rated performance, and productivity, the greatest direct effect is typically seen in employee satisfaction with their work schedule."
