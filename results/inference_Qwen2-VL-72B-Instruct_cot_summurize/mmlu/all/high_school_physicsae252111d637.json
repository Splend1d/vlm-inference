The new power \\( P' \\) dissipated in the circuit with the doubled resistance would be:\n\n\\[ P' = \\frac{V^2}{2R} \\]\n\nComparing the new power \\( P' \\) to the original power \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{P'}{P} = \\frac{\\frac{V^2}{2R}}{\\frac{V^2}{R}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThis shows that when the resistance is doubled, the total power dissipated by the circuit is halved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
