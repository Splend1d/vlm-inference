The defendant purchased a ski mask and then went into the liquor store, put his gun into the face of the clerk, and demanded the money from the register. Terrified, the clerk gave him the money from the register. The defendant pocketed the money, grabbed a bottle of tequila off the shelf for his celebration, and then ran back to the car and drove off. About an hour later, the defendant was slowly approaching his hideout in the outskirts of town when a young child suddenly darted in front of the defendant's car. He applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time. The car struck the child, killing her. For the child's death, the defendant should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Felony murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a defendant who committed a robbery and during their escape, accidentally killed a child due to a traffic accident. To determine the appropriate charge related to the child's death, we need to consider the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Felony Murder**: This is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally liable for any deaths that occur during the commission or attempted commission of certain felonies (such as robbery). The key point here is that the death does not have to be intentional; it only needs to happen during the course of the felony. Since the defendant was committing a robbery at the time of the accident, the doctrine of felony murder could apply.\n\n2. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This typically involves unintentional killings that result from reckless behavior or gross negligence. If the defendant\u2019s actions were merely negligent (e.g., driving too fast or not paying attention), involuntary manslaughter might be applicable. However, given the context of the felony, this charge is less likely than felony murder.\n\n3. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This involves an intentional killing that occurs in the heat of passion or under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control. This does not seem to fit the scenario since the death was accidental and not intentional.\n\n4. **No Crime**: This option is unlikely given the circumstances described. The death occurred during the commission of a felony, which makes it highly relevant to the felony murder rule.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate charge for the child's death, considering the defendant was committing a felony at the time of the accident, is:\n\n**A. Felony murder.**\n\nThis charge aligns with the legal principle that holds individuals responsible for deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the death was intended or not."
