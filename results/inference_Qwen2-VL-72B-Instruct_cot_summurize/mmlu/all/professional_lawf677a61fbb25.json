No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct.\nD. Yes, because, by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue.\n"

Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct.\n\nIn criminal trials, a defendant is generally allowed to introduce evidence of their good character to suggest that they are less likely to have committed the crime they are charged with. This can include testimony about their general reputation or specific instances of conduct that demonstrate honesty or integrity. In this case, the witness's testimony about the defendant turning down opportunities for black marketeering could be seen as relevant to showing the defendant's character and thus potentially admissible under these rules."
