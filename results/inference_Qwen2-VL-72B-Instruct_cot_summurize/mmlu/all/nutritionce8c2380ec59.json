Result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton\n\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, there is an increased demand for calcium to support fetal development and milk production. This can lead to a temporary decrease in bone mineral density as the body mobilizes calcium from the mother's bones to meet these demands. However, it's important to note that proper nutrition and supplementation can help mitigate this effect and support bone health during these critical periods."
