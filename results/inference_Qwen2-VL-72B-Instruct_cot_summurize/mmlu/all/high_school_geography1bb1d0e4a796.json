Being close to the market ensures that these products reach consumers fresh.\n\nB. **Bulk-gaining products**: These products increase in volume or weight during processing. Examples include cement and coal. Proximity to markets is crucial because transporting these products over long distances can be costly due to their bulkiness.\n\nC. **Single-market products**: This term suggests products that are targeted at a specific market. Being close to this single market is essential for efficient distribution and customer satisfaction.\n\nD. **Bulk-reducing products**: These products decrease in volume or weight during processing. Examples include processed foods like flour or sugar. Since these products become more compact after processing, they can be transported over longer distances without significant cost increases.\n\nGiven this analysis, the industry that does not necessarily need to be close to its markets is:\n\n**D. Bulk-reducing products**"
