This theory posits that there are certain moral principles that are inherent in human nature and can be discerned through reason. According to Aquinas, these principles guide individuals toward their ultimate end or purpose, which he identifies with God. While Aquinas's thought also incorporates elements of virtue ethics and has influenced discussions on rights, his primary moral framework is based on the concept of natural law."
