She began looking for a home to purchase in the mountain community. She found one suitable location offered for sale by the owner. The asking price for the home was $100,000. Although the teacher was very interested in purchasing the home, she told the owner that she was not sure it would fit within her budget. The owner the grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the following:\"December 1In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. \" The owner then signed the paper and handed it to the teacher, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, the owner sent the teacher a letter in which the owner stated, \"Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing my offer to sell you my home. \" This letter was received and read by the teacher on December 16. The next day, the teacher tendered a cashier's check to the owner in the amount of $100,001 (which included the $100,000 purchase price plus the $1 consideration) and demanded a deed of conveyance to the property. The owner refused to accept the cashier's check. The teacher has now brought suit against the owner for specific performance. In her pleadings, the teacher admits that the recited $1 was not in fact paid to the owner when their written agreement was executed. Assume the teacher lives in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement of Contracts. As a result, which of the following is the teacher's best argument that such failure of payment does not bar her claim to specific performance?\n\nA. The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\nB. The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\nC. By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\nD. The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n"

The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.**\n\nHere\u2019s why this argument is the strongest:\n\n1. **Timely Cure**: The teacher included the $1 in her tendered check on December 17, which can be seen as a timely attempt to fulfill the terms of the agreement. This action demonstrates her willingness to comply with the terms of the offer.\n\n2. **Immaterial Breach**: The failure to pay the $1 at the time of executing the agreement might be considered an immaterial breach because the primary purpose of the agreement was to secure the option to buy the house, not the immediate payment of the $1. The inclusion of the $1 in the tendered check addresses this minor breach.\n\n3. **Option Contract**: The document provided by the owner is essentially an option contract, where the teacher has the right to purchase the house if she exercises the option within the specified time frame. The nominal consideration ($1) is typical in option contracts to make them binding.\n\nOptions A, C, and D also have merit but do not address the specific issue of the failure to pay the $1 at the time of execution as effectively as option B. \n\n- **A** focuses on the de minimis nature of the consideration, which may not be sufficient to overcome the requirement of actual payment.\n- **C** correctly identifies that the offer cannot be revoked before the expiration date, but it does not directly address the issue of the unpaid consideration.\n- **D** argues that the written instrument is an enforceable option contract, but it does not specifically address the teacher's attempt to rectify the breach by including the $1 in her tendered check.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most compelling argument that the teacher's failure to pay the $1 initially does not bar her claim to specific performance, given her subsequent actions to remedy the situation."
