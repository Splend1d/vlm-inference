So, the number of roses left is:\n\n\\[ 152 - 96 = 56 \\]\n\nNow, he wants to divide these 56 roses equally among 8 vases. To find out how many roses go into each vase, we divide the total number of roses by the number of vases:\n\n\\[ \\frac{56}{8} = 7 \\]\n\nSo, Mr. Kohlberg will put 7 roses in each vase.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 7."
