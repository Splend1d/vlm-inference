Combustion reactions are typically highly exothermic and proceed almost completely to products, making them effectively irreversible under normal conditions.\n\nB. \\( \\text{HCN}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(\\text{l}) \\rightarrow \\text{CN}^-(\\text{aq}) + \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+(\\text{aq}) \\)\n\nThis is the ionization of hydrogen cyanide in water. Weak acids like HCN do not ionize completely and the reaction is reversible.\n\nC. \\( \\text{Al}(\\text{NO}_3)_3(\\text{s}) \\rightarrow \\text{Al}^{3+}(\\text{aq}) + 3\\text{NO}_3^-(\\text{aq}) \\)\n\nThis is the dissolution of aluminum nitrate in water. Dissolution processes are generally reversible as the solid can precipitate back out of solution under certain conditions.\n\nD. \\( 2\\text{Ag}^+(\\text{aq}) + \\text{Ti}(\\text{s}) \\rightarrow 2\\text{Ag}(\\text{s}) + \\text{Ti}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) \\)\n\nThis is a redox reaction where silver ions are reduced to silver metal and titanium is oxidized to titanium(II) ions. Redox reactions involving the formation of a solid metal from its ions are often irreversible due to the strong driving force for the reduction of the metal ions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely irreversible reaction among the options provided is:\n\n**A. \\( \\text{CH}_4(\\text{g}) + \\text{O}_2(\\text{g}) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2(\\text{g}) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(\\text{l}) \\)**"
