Apraxia\n\nApraxia is a disorder that affects an individual's ability to perform purposeful movements or actions, even though they have the desire and physical capability to do so. It is not due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in the action. Apraxia can affect various types of movements, including those involving the hands (limb apraxia), speech (verbal apraxia), or the ability to use tools or objects (ideomotor apraxia). In this case, the difficulty in performing a skilled movement like opening a door with a key suggests apraxia."
