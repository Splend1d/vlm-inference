A negative cross-price elasticity\n\nComplementary goods have a negative cross-price elasticity of demand, meaning that an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in the demand for the other good, and vice versa. This is because these goods are often used together, so a change in the price of one affects the demand for both."
