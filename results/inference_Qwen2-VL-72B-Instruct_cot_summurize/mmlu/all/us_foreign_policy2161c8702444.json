They serve American interests\n\nLiberal Internationalists argue that international institutions are important to US grand strategy because they serve American interests by promoting stability, cooperation, and rules-based order in the international system. These institutions help to manage global challenges, facilitate trade and economic growth, and provide a platform for diplomatic engagement and conflict resolution. By participating in and often leading these institutions, the United States can shape international norms and policies to align with its own strategic goals and values."
