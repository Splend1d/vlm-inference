This is based on his belief in teleology, which holds that everything in the universe has a purpose or end towards which it naturally tends. For Aquinas, the ultimate end of human actions is the attainment of happiness or beatitude, which he identifies with the vision of God in the afterlife. However, even in this life, our actions should be directed towards achieving various goods, such as knowledge, virtue, and friendship, which contribute to our overall well-being and fulfillment."
