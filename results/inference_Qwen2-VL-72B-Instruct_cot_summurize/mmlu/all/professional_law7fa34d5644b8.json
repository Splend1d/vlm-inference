This negligence directly led to the driver's leg injury and the subsequent lawsuit against the furniture store.\n\n2. **Statutes Permitting Contribution and Indemnity**: The jurisdiction allows for claims of contribution and indemnity. This means that if one party (in this case, the furniture store) pays for damages caused by another party (the employee), they can seek recovery from that other party.\n\n3. **Primary Liability**: While the furniture store may have been held primarily liable for the damages due to the employee's actions during work hours, the statutes allowing for indemnity permit the store to recover the full amount from the employee who was at fault.\n\n4. **Full Recovery**: Since the employee's negligence caused the accident, the furniture store can recover the full amount ($25,000) from the employee under the principle of indemnity.\n\nTherefore, the furniture store will recover $25,000 from its employee."
