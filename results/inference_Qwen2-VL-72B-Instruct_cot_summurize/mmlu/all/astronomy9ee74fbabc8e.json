                    "text": "To determine why scientists think Mars was once warmer and wetter, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Mars shows evidence of significant volcanism which implies that the climate was once warmer and therefore wetter**\n   - Volcanism can indicate a warmer climate because it suggests a more active and dynamic planet. However, volcanism alone does not directly imply the presence of water.\n\nB. **Early observations showed what appeared to be changing vegetation patterns and canals indicating the presence of water**\n   - This option refers to historical interpretations of Martian features as vegetation and canals, which were later disproven. Modern scientific consensus does not rely on these early, now-discredited observations.\n\nC. **There are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface**\n   - This is a strong argument. Geologic features such as dried-up riverbeds, lake beds, and sedimentary deposits suggest that liquid water was present in the past. These features are consistent with a warmer and wetter climate.\n\nD. **All planets tend to begin with warm wet climates and gradually become cold and dry with smaller planets cooling faster than larger planets**\n   - While this statement might be generally true for planetary evolution, it is too broad and general to specifically explain why Mars had a warmer and wetter climate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most compelling reason supported by modern scientific evidence is:\n\n**C. There are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the evidence from Martian geology that supports the idea of a warmer and wetter past."
