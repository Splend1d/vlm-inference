                    "text": "After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.\nB. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\nC. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.\nD. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the graduate will prevail in her claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, we need to consider the elements required for such a claim. Generally, for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), the plaintiff must demonstrate:\n\n1. The defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n2. The defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.\n3. The conduct caused the plaintiff severe emotional distress.\n4. The emotional distress was severe.\n\nLet's analyze each option in light of these elements:\n\nA. **Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.**\n   - This statement addresses the graduate's intent but does not directly relate to the elements required for IIED. The graduate's lack of intent to defraud is not relevant to proving the company's liability for IIED.\n\nB. **Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.**\n   - This statement highlights the company's failure to inform the prosecutor about the payment, which could be seen as reckless behavior contributing to the graduate's distress. However, it does not explicitly address whether this conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nC. **No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.**\n   - This statement correctly identifies that the company did not have the specific intent to cause the graduate emotional distress. Intent to cause distress is a key element in IIED claims. Without this intent, the claim may fail.\n\nD. **No, because filing the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.**\n   - This statement addresses the element of extreme and outrageous conduct. Filing a complaint with the prosecutor, even if later proven unjustified, might not be considered extreme and outrageous conduct under the law. It is a legal action taken in response to perceived wrongdoing.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. No, because filing the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.**\n\nThe graduate's claim would likely fail because filing a complaint with the prosecutor, even if later proven unjustified, is not typically considered extreme and outrageous conduct sufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress."
