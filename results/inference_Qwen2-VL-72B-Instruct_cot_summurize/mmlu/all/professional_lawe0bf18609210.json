At a pretrial hearing, the defendant told the judge that he was unhappy with the public defender who had been appointed to represent him and that he wanted the judge to appoint another lawyer. The judge refused to appoint another lawyer, telling the defendant, with no further explanation, that his only other choice was to represent himself. The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial. After hearing overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, the jury convicted him of armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant has requested a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel. Should the appellate court grant the defendant's request?\n\nA. No, because the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\nB. No, because the trial court's error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was not capable of effectively representing himself.\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n"

Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nIn criminal proceedings, the right to counsel is fundamental and protected by the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. For a defendant to waive this right and proceed pro se (representing oneself), the waiver must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. This typically requires the court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant to ensure they understand the consequences of self-representation and the benefits of having legal representation.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant initially expressed dissatisfaction with the appointed public defender but did not explicitly state a desire to represent himself until after the judge refused to appoint another attorney. The judge's response did not include any inquiry into whether the defendant understood the implications of self-representation or whether he was making a voluntary and informed decision to waive his right to counsel. Therefore, the record does not demonstrate that the defendant made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the appellate court should grant the defendant's request for a new trial based on the lack of a valid waiver of the right to counsel."
