While it may be considered impolite or disrespectful, it is not typically viewed as a clear moral wrong in the sense of violating fundamental ethical principles such as honesty, fairness, or causing harm to others.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character steals the show at the talent show.\n\nStealing the show means performing exceptionally well and overshadowing other participants. This is generally seen as a positive outcome for the performer and does not involve any unethical behavior like theft, cheating, or harming others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an act that might be considered rude but not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 involves an act that is generally seen as positive and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
