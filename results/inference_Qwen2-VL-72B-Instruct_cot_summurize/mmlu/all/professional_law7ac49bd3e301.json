She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the landmark case Lawrence v. Texas (2003), where the Supreme Court ruled that laws prohibiting consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex were unconstitutional. The Court held that such laws violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees substantive due process rights, including the right to personal autonomy and privacy in certain intimate decisions. The Court emphasized that individuals have a fundamental right to make personal choices relating to their sexual conduct without government interference, as long as those choices do not harm others."
