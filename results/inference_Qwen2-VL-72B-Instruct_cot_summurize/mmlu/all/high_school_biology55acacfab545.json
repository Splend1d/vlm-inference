The proton gradient across the membrane where the ATP synthase is embedded represents potential energy.\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the energy for ATP synthesis is derived from the proton gradient (also known as the electrochemical gradient) that is established across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is created when protons (H+) are pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space during the electron transport chain process. The flow of these protons back into the matrix through ATP synthase drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)."
