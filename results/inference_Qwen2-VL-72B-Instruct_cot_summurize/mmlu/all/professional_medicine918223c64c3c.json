The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?\n\nA. Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes\nB. Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations\nC. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\nD. Serum prolactin concentration\n"

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\n\nElevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) can indicate primary testicular failure, which could be causing the absence of sperm in the semen analysis. This would suggest a problem with the testes themselves rather than a hormonal issue at the level of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus."
