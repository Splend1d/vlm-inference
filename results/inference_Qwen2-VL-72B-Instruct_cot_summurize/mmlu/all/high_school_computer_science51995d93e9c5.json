In Python, the order of operations is similar but includes modulus (%) before addition (+).\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Modulus operation**: The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.\n   - `3 % 2` means \"3 divided by 2, what's the remainder?\"\n   - `3 / 2 = 1` with a remainder of `1`.\n   - So, `3 % 2 = 1`.\n\n2. **Addition operation**: Now that we have the result of the modulus operation, we add it to 4.\n   - `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression `4 + 3 % 2` is `5`.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 5"
