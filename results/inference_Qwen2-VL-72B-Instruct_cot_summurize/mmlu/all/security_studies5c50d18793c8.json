All of these options.\n\nThe preoccupation with human rights significantly influences the human rights-oriented school of liberalism in several ways:\n\nA. **Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination.** This is because the right to self-determination is often seen as a fundamental human right, allowing people to choose their own political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development freely.\n\nB. **Human rights orientated liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it.** In situations where groups face severe oppression or violence, advocating for separatism can be viewed as a means to protect human rights and prevent further harm.\n\nC. **Human rights orientated liberalism is particularly focused on persons subject to economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution, discrimination, or deprivation.** This focus is central to human rights liberalism, which aims to protect individuals from various forms of injustice and ensure that all people have equal access to basic freedoms and opportunities.\n\nTherefore, all three aspects (self-determination, advocacy for separatism under certain conditions, and protection against various forms of persecution) are integral to the human rights-oriented school of liberalism."
