Incandescent\n\nIncandescent lamps generally have the best Colour Rendering Index (CRI) because they emit light across the entire visible spectrum, similar to natural sunlight. This makes them particularly good at accurately rendering colors. LED and fluorescent lamps can also have high CRI values, but this depends on the specific design and quality of the lamp. High-pressure sodium vapor lamps typically have a very poor CRI, making them unsuitable for applications where accurate color rendering is important."
