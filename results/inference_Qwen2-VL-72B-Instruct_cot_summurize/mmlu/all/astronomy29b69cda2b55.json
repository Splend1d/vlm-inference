Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\nJovian planets, also known as gas giants, bulge at their equators due to their rapid rotation. This rotation causes a centrifugal force that pushes material outward at the equator, resulting in a slightly flattened shape known as an oblate spheroid. The faster the planet rotates, the more pronounced this effect becomes."
