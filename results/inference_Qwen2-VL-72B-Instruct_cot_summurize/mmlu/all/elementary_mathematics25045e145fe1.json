However, without knowing the total number of students in each class, we cannot determine the actual number of students who ate pizza or hamburgers.\n- For example, if Mr. Paulson has 20 students and Ms. Hugo has 40 students, then 0.5 of Mr. Paulson\u2019s class would be 10 students (20 * 0.5), while 0.5 of Ms. Hugo\u2019s class would be 20 students (40 * 0.5). This means that even though the fractions are the same, the actual numbers of students eating pizza and hamburgers are different.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the total number of students in each teacher\u2019s class"
