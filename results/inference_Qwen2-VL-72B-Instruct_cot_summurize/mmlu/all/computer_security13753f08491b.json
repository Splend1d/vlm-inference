Whitebox\n\nWhitebox fuzzing, also known as structural testing or glassbox testing, involves having knowledge of the internal structure and workings of the program being tested. This allows the fuzzer to generate inputs that cover specific paths or branches within the code, including those that may be difficult to reach with other types of fuzzing.\n\nIn contrast, blackbox fuzzing (option B) does not have access to the internal structure of the program and relies on random or semi-random input generation to discover vulnerabilities. Generational fuzzing (option A) creates inputs based on a model of the input format but does not necessarily target specific paths within the program. Mutation-based fuzzing (option D) modifies existing inputs to create new ones but does not necessarily target specific paths either.\n\nTherefore, whitebox fuzzing is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program because it has knowledge of the internal structure and can generate inputs specifically designed to cover those paths."
