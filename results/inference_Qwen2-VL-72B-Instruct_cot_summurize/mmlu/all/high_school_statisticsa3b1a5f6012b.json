Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population.\n\nThis statement captures the essence of the Central Limit Theorem, which asserts that the sampling distribution of the mean will approach normality as the sample size grows, and the mean of this sampling distribution will be approximately equal to the population mean."
