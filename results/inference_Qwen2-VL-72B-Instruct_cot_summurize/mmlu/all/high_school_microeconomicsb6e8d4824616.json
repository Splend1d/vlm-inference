Find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital.\n\nThis principle is based on the concept of marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) being equal to the ratio of input prices. In other words, the firm should allocate its resources such that the last dollar spent on labor yields the same marginal product as the last dollar spent on capital. This ensures that the firm is operating at the lowest possible cost for a given level of output."
