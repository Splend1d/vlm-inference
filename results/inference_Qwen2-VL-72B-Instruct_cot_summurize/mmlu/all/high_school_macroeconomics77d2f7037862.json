However, if we consider the total deposits and assume the bank holds more than the required reserve, we need additional information. Since the question doesn't specify the total reserves held, we'll proceed with the assumption that the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, implying no excess reserves.\n\n3. **Money Multiplier Calculation:**\n   - The money multiplier (M) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     M = \\frac{1}{RR}\n     \\]\n   - Using the reserve ratio of 25% (or 0.25):\n     \\[\n     M = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4\n     \\]\n\nGiven these calculations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 25% $750 M = 4**\n\nNote: There seems to be an inconsistency in the options provided regarding excess reserves. If the bank holds exactly $250 in reserves, it would not have any excess reserves. However, based on the given options and calculations for the reserve ratio and money multiplier, option C aligns correctly with those values."
