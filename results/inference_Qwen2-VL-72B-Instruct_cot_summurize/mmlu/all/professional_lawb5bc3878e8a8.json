                    "text": "A farmer was the owner of a 20-acre tract that was situated just south of a major boulevard, a street that ran east and west. The farmer's tract was located next to an adjacent 300-acre ranch to the east. Immediately to the west of the farmer's parcel was a 100-acre tract. The farmer subdivided his property into two 10-acre parcels:Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the major boulevard; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river to the south. In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel ito a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Then in September 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. In 1965, the farmer constructed a driveway from what is now Parcel 2, extending over Parcel 1, where it connected with the major boulevard. This driveway lies across what is now Parcel 1 and was used continuously by the farmer until 1997 when he conveyed his property in parcels to the man and the woman. When the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she immediately began to use the drive way across Parcel 1. Thereafter, the man requested that the woman cease to use the driveway over Parcel 1. After the woman refused, the man brought an appropriate action to enjoin the woman from using the driveway. In this action, the man will\n\nA. win, because his deed antedated the woman's deed.\nB. win, because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed.\nC. lose, because the woman has an easement by necessity.\nD. lose, because the woman has an express easement.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. lose, because the woman has an easement by necessity.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn easement by necessity arises when there is no reasonable alternative access to a landlocked parcel of land. In this case, the woman's parcel (Parcel 2) is landlocked since it is situated to the south of the farmer's original property and abuts a river, which likely does not provide a practical means of access. The only practical access to Parcel 2 is via the driveway that crosses Parcel 1 and connects to the major boulevard.\n\nSince the driveway was constructed in 1965 and used continuously until the parcels were sold in 1997, it can be inferred that the driveway was necessary for access to Parcel 2. Therefore, the woman has an easement by necessity over Parcel 1 to access her property. This easement would have been implied at the time of the conveyance of Parcel 2 to the woman, even if it was not explicitly mentioned in the deed.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the timing of the deeds and the absence of encumbrances in the man's deed do not affect the existence of an easement by necessity. Option D is incorrect because there is no evidence of an express easement granted by the farmer to either party; the easement in question is by necessity rather than express grant."
