At trial, the alleged cocaine no longer exists, and the only evidence that the substance sold was cocaine is the informant's testimony that it tasted like cocaine and gave her a cocaine-like sensation. The informant has no formal training in identifying controlled substances. Should the court admit the informant's opinion testimony that the substance was cocaine?\n\nA. No, because identification of a controlled substance requires an expert with formal training.\nB. No, because, without a quantity of the controlled substance for testing, opinion testimony is insufficient to make a prima facie case against the defendant.\nC. Yes, if the court determines that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\nD. Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n"

Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n\nIn legal proceedings, the admissibility of lay opinion testimony depends on whether the witness has sufficient personal knowledge or experience to provide reliable information about the subject matter. In this case, the informant's testimony could be admitted if the court finds that she has enough relevant experience or knowledge to identify cocaine based on its taste and effects. However, the ultimate determination of the informant's credibility and the weight given to her testimony would be up to the jury."
