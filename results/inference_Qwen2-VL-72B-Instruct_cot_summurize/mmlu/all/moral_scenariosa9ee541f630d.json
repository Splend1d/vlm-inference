If it was a peck on the cheek or forehead, it would generally be considered appropriate and not morally wrong.\n- If it was a more intimate type of kiss, that could be inappropriate and potentially morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: I put the matches up high where my son couldn't reach them.**\n- This action is a responsible and safety-conscious measure to prevent potential harm to the child.\n- It aligns with good parenting practices and is not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n- Scenario 1 could potentially be morally wrong depending on the nature of the kiss.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
