For example, consider \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) with the standard topology. Let \\( A = [0, 1] \\), \\( B = [0, 2] \\setminus \\{1\\} \\), and \\( C = [0, 3] \\). Here, both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are connected, but \\( B \\) is not connected because it contains a gap at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement I** is false.\n\n### Statement II: If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\nCompactness is a hereditary property. If a set is compact, any subset of that set is also compact. However, this statement is about subsets being compact when the larger sets are compact. Since \\( A \\subseteq B \\subseteq C \\), if \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are compact, then \\( B \\) must also be compact because compactness is preserved by taking subsets.\n\nTherefore, **Statement II** is true.\n\n### Statement III: If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nThe Hausdorff property is also hereditary. If a space is Hausdorff, any subspace of that space is also Hausdorff. Therefore, if \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are Hausdorff, then \\( B \\), being a subset of \\( C \\), must also be Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, **Statement III** is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. III only"
