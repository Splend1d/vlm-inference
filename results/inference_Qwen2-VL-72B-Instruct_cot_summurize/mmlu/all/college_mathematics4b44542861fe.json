In this case, any matrix \\(X \\in M(V)\\) will commute with \\(T\\) if and only if \\(X\\) is also diagonal in the same basis. This means that \\(U\\) would consist of all diagonal matrices in the basis of eigenvectors of \\(T\\). However, not every matrix in \\(M(V)\\) needs to be diagonal; hence, \\(U\\) does not necessarily equal \\(M(V)\\). Therefore, statement I is **false**.\n\n### Statement II: dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\n\nThe dimension of \\(M(V)\\) is \\(n^2\\) since it consists of all \\(n \\times n\\) matrices over the real numbers. The sum of the dimensions of \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) should equal the dimension of \\(M(V)\\) because \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) together span \\(M(V)\\) and their intersection is trivial (i.e., they are complementary subspaces). This is a consequence of the fact that for any linear transformation \\(T\\), the set of matrices that commute with \\(T\\) (which is \\(U\\)) and the set of matrices that anticommute with \\(T\\) (which is \\(W\\)) together cover the entire space of matrices. Hence, statement II is **true**.\n\n### Statement III: dim (U) < n\n\nThe dimension of \\(U\\) depends on the structure of \\(T\\). For example, if \\(T\\) is the identity matrix, then every matrix commutes with \\(T\\), making \\(U = M(V)\\) and thus \\(\\dim(U) = n^2\\), which is greater than \\(n\\). Therefore, statement III is **false**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. II only"
