As they were playing catch outside, the defendant threw the ball over his nephew's head, and it rolled into the street. Instinctively, the nephew ran after the ball but tripped over the gutter and fell in the street. When he tripped, the nephew severely sprained his ankle and couldn't stand up. Moments later, a large garbage truck was backing up and ran over the nephew, killing him. Although the defendant saw his nephew's predicament, he made no effort to rescue him. Subsequently, the defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. At trial, the defendant testified that he was so shocked when he saw his nephew fall near the garbage truck that he froze and was unable to move until it was too late. Following the defendant's testimony, an expert witness testified for the defense that reactions of the sort described by the defendant are not unusual when a truly shocking event occurs. If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense is which of the following?\n\nA. The defendant was suffering from temporary insanity.\nB. The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime.\nC. The defendant's failure to act was not voluntary.\nD. The defendant's criminal liability was superseded by that of the truck driver.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's best defense, given the scenario and the criminal statute provided, would be:\n\nB. The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime.\n\nHere\u2019s why this option is the most appropriate defense based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Temporary Insanity (Option A)**: This defense typically requires evidence of a mental disease or defect that substantially impaired the defendant's ability to understand the wrongfulness of their actions or to control their behavior. While the defendant was shocked and froze, there is no indication that this reaction was due to a pre-existing mental disease or defect.\n\n2. **Lack of Requisite Mental State (Option B)**: Involuntary manslaughter generally requires some level of negligence or recklessness. If the jury believes the defendant's testimony and the expert witness's explanation, it could be argued that the defendant's reaction was involuntary due to shock, and thus he did not possess the necessary mental state (negligence or recklessness) to commit involuntary manslaughter.\n\n3. **Failure to Act Was Not Voluntary (Option C)**: This defense suggests that the defendant's inaction was not a conscious decision but rather an involuntary response to the situation. However, this defense might not fully address the legal requirement of lacking the requisite mental state for the crime.\n\n4. **Criminal Liability Superseded by Truck Driver (Option D)**: This defense implies that the truck driver's actions should be considered more culpable than the defendant's. However, the focus here is on the defendant's actions and mental state, not on attributing blame to another party.\n\nGiven the statute provided, which focuses on the defendant's mental capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, Option B aligns best with the defendant's claim that his reaction was involuntary due to shock, thereby potentially negating the requisite mental state needed for involuntary manslaughter."
