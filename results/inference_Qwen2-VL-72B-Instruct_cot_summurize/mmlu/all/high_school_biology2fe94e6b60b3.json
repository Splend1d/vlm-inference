Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nExplanation: The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the presence of double covalent bonds (unsaturation) in the fatty acid tails of phospholipids. Phospholipids with more double bonds in their tails tend to have increased fluidity because the kinks created by these bonds prevent close packing of the lipid tails. In response to temperature changes, bacteria and yeast cells can adjust the ratio of unsaturated to saturated phospholipids in their membranes. At lower temperatures, increasing the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids helps maintain membrane fluidity, while at higher temperatures, decreasing this proportion can help maintain structural integrity and function of the membrane. This adaptive mechanism allows cells to maintain homeostasis in varying thermal environments."
