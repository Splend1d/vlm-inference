The scale is 1.5 centimeters to 50 meters.\n\nFirst, let's convert the actual distance between the trees from meters to centimeters because our scale is given in centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so:\n\n\\[ 150 \\text{ meters} = 150 \\times 100 \\text{ centimeters} = 15000 \\text{ centimeters} \\]\n\nNow, using the scale factor, we can find the distance on the model:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.5 \\text{ cm}}{50 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{x \\text{ cm}}{15000 \\text{ cm}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ cm} \\times 15000 \\text{ cm}}{50 \\text{ m}} \\]\n\nSince 50 meters is equivalent to 5000 centimeters (because there are 100 centimeters in a meter):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1.5 \\times 15000}{5000} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{22500}{5000} \\]\n\\[ x = 4.5 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two trees on the model is 4.5 centimeters.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4.5 centimeters."
