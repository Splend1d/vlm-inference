This is because the Earth's surface emits infrared radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation that carries energy away from the planet into space. This process is known as thermal radiation and is the primary mechanism by which the Earth cools itself. Conduction, convection, and radioactivity also play roles in heat transfer within the Earth's atmosphere and crust, but they are not the primary means by which the Earth's surface loses energy to outer space."
