This is short run diminishing marginal productivity.\n\nThe scenario described shows that as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital, the increase in output (marginal product) diminishes with each additional unit of labor. This is characteristic of diminishing marginal productivity in the short run, where one factor of production (labor) is variable while another (capital) is fixed."
