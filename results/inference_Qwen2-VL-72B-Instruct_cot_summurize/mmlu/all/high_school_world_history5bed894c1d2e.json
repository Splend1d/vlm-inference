Thirty Years' War\n\nThe song \"Poor Winter King\" refers to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was known as the \"Winter King\" because his reign over Bohemia lasted only one winter during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The lyrics mention the \"kaiser's crown\" and \"Ferdinand,\" referring to Emperor Ferdinand II, who defeated Frederick and reclaimed the throne of Bohemia. Therefore, the event that inspired the composition of this song is the Thirty Years' War."
