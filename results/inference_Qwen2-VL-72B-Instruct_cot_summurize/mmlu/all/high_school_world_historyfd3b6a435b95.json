If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThis speech led to the creation of laws that did which of the following?\n\nA. Limited work hours in factories\nB. Established public health care and pensions\nC. Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the countryside\nD. Forced early retirement for aging workers\n"

Established public health care and pensions\n\nThe passage from Otto von Bismarck's speech highlights concerns about workers' insecurity, particularly regarding their health and financial stability as they age. It mentions the lack of societal obligations toward workers who fall into poverty due to prolonged illness or old age. This context suggests that the laws resulting from this speech would address these specific grievances by establishing measures such as public health care and pensions to provide security for workers throughout their lives."
