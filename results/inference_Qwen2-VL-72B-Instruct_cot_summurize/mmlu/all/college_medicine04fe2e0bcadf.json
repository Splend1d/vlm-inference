After first walking into a crowded room, you no longer are distracted by the buzz of conversation around you.\n\nExplanation: Sensory or neural adaptation refers to the process where our senses become less sensitive to constant stimuli over time. This means that we stop noticing things that don't change. \n\n- Option A describes how you stop feeling the fabric of your shirt after a while, which is an example of sensory adaptation.\n- Option C describes how you get used to bright light and it stops blinding you, which is also an example of sensory adaptation.\n- Option D describes how you stop noticing the smell of formaldehyde in an anatomy lab, which is another example of sensory adaptation.\n\nHowever, option B describes a situation where you stop being distracted by the buzz of conversation in a crowded room. This is more related to habituation or attentional adaptation rather than sensory adaptation. Habituation involves becoming accustomed to a stimulus and paying less attention to it, whereas sensory adaptation specifically refers to the decreased sensitivity of sensory receptors to a constant stimulus."
