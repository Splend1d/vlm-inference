                    "text": "To determine the number of lines that will appear in the EPR spectrum of a solution of a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical, we need to consider the hyperfine splitting due to the interaction between the unpaired electron and the magnetic nuclei.\n\nIn this case, the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. Each nitrogen nucleus has a nuclear spin of \\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\), leading to two possible orientations (spin up or spin down) for each nucleus.\n\nThe total number of lines in the EPR spectrum can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ N = (2I + 1)^n \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the nuclear spin quantum number.\n- \\( n \\) is the number of equivalent nuclei.\n\nFor nitrogen (\\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\)) and two equivalent nuclei (\\( n = 2 \\)):\n\n\\[ N = (2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 1)^2 \\]\n\\[ N = (1 + 1)^2 \\]\n\\[ N = 2^2 \\]\n\\[ N = 4 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that \\( J \\ll a \\), where \\( J \\) is the exchange coupling constant and \\( a \\) is the hyperfine coupling constant, it implies that the two radicals are effectively independent. Therefore, we should consider each radical separately and then combine their spectra.\n\nEach individual radical will give rise to 4 lines due to the hyperfine splitting by two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. Since there are two such radicals, the overall spectrum will show:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ lines} \\times 2 \\text{ radicals} = 8 \\text{ lines} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation does not directly match any of the provided options. Given the context and the typical EPR spectrum analysis, the correct interpretation considering the given conditions and the options provided would be:\n\n**D. 7 lines**\n\nThis might be due to an overlap or simplification in the explanation, but based on the provided options and typical EPR analysis, the closest answer is 7 lines."
