The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?\n\nA. No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\nB. No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.\nC. Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\nD. Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.\n"

Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\n\nIn general, contracts can include provisions that prohibit the assignment of rights or obligations. Such provisions are typically enforceable unless they violate public policy or are otherwise illegal. In this case, since there is no indication that the prohibition on assignment violates any law or public policy, the court would likely enforce the clause that bars the assignment of the contract or any of its terms, including the right to receive the funds."
