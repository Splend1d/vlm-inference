However, assuming the children were adequately supervised and safe, this action might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 clearly involves morally wrong behavior due to the coercive nature of the action.\n- Scenario 2 may not necessarily be morally wrong if the children were properly cared for during the break.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
