They arrested the man and charged him with the separate offenses of (1) possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and (2) contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The girl was also arrested and charged with being an accomplice to the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. At trial, the girl's best defense is that\n\nA. smoking marijuana does not necessarily make her an accomplice to the crime.\nB. the man, the adult principal, must be convicted before any prosecution can be maintained against a minor.\nC. a minor cannot be prosecuted for an adult crime.\nD. since the statute was designed to protect minors, the girl cannot be prosecuted as an accomplice.\n"

Since the statute was designed to protect minors, the girl cannot be prosecuted as an accomplice.\n\nThis defense argues that the law intended to protect minors from engaging in harmful activities, and therefore, it would be contradictory to prosecute the minor as an accomplice for the same behavior that the law aims to prevent. This defense aligns with the principle that laws protecting minors should not be used to penalize them for actions they may have been influenced or coerced into by adults."
