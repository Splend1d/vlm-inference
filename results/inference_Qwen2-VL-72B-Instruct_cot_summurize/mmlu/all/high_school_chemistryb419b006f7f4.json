Since the solution is 50% NaOH by weight, this means there are 50 grams of NaOH and 50 grams of water.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of each component:\n\n- The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol.\n- The molar mass of H2O (water) is approximately 18 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the moles of each:\n\nMoles of NaOH = 50 g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 mol\nMoles of H2O = 50 g / 18 g/mol \u2248 2.78 mol\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of moles in the solution:\n\nTotal moles = Moles of NaOH + Moles of H2O\nTotal moles = 1.25 mol + 2.78 mol \u2248 4.03 mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction of NaOH:\n\nMole fraction of NaOH = Moles of NaOH / Total moles\nMole fraction of NaOH = 1.25 mol / 4.03 mol \u2248 0.310\n\nSo, the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide is approximately 0.310, which corresponds to option C. 0.311."
