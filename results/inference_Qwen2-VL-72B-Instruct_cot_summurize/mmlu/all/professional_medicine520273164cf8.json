She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. CT scan of the chest\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Bone marrow aspiration\n"

The patient's low platelet count suggests a possible bone marrow disorder, such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, which can cause easy bruising. A bone marrow aspiration can help determine the underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia."
