GDP increases and the price level increases.\n\nWhen the government cuts taxes, it increases disposable income for consumers, which can lead to increased consumption and higher aggregate demand. At the same time, increasing spending on the military also boosts government spending, further stimulating aggregate demand. Both of these actions can lead to an increase in real GDP as more goods and services are demanded and produced.\n\nHowever, if the economy is already operating near full capacity, the increased demand may not be met by a corresponding increase in supply, leading to inflationary pressures and an increase in the price level. Therefore, both real GDP and the price level are likely to increase under these policy changes."
