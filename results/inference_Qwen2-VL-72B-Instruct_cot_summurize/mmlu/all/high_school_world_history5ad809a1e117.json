To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n"

The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\nThe tone of the first passage suggests that William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, was concerned with both the moral implications of the sati ritual and the practical considerations of maintaining British authority in India. He acknowledges the horror of allowing the ritual to continue but also recognizes the potential risks to British rule if they were to act too hastily. This indicates that the British motivation was to address the inhumane practice while being mindful of not undermining their own governance."
