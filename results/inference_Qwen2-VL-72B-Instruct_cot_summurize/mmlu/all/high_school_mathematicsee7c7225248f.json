Now, we want to find out how many daps make up 42 baps. We can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{21}{20} \\text{ baps/dap} \\times x \\text{ daps} = 42 \\text{ baps}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) (the number of daps):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{42 \\text{ baps}}{\\frac{21}{20} \\text{ baps/dap}}\\]\n\n\\[x = 42 \\times \\frac{20}{21}\\]\n\n\\[x = 2 \\times 20\\]\n\n\\[x = 40\\]\n\nTherefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps, which corresponds to option C."
