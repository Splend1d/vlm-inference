While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n"

Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\n\nExplanation: In human vision, there are two types of photoreceptor cells in the retina: rods and cones. Cones are responsible for color vision and require higher levels of light to function effectively. Rods, on the other hand, are more sensitive to low light levels and do not detect color; they provide black-and-white vision in dim lighting conditions. As the light level decreases, the visual system shifts from using cones to relying more on rods, which is why colors become less distinguishable or disappear entirely as it gets darker."
