Before receiving an answer, the purchasing agent called the wholesaler to state, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" The seller sent an acceptance form the next day, and shipped the goods with an invoice. When the purchasing company did not pay and shipped the goods back, the seller sued for his lost profit. The seller claimed that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation of the offer. Will the seller prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n"

However, the revocation must be communicated effectively to the offeree.\n\n2. **Communication of Revocation**: The purchasing agent's statement, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase,\" could be interpreted as a revocation of the offer. The key question here is whether these words were clear enough to constitute a revocation.\n\n3. **Effectiveness of Communication**: For a revocation to be effective, it must be clear and unambiguous. The purchasing agent\u2019s statement indicates a financial inability to proceed with the purchase, which could reasonably be understood as a revocation of the offer.\n\n4. **Reliance on the Offer**: The seller shipped the goods based on the original offer, indicating reliance on the expectation that the purchase would go through. However, if the revocation was communicated effectively before the acceptance (the shipment), the seller's reliance might not be legally protected.\n\n5. **Breach of Agreement**: If the revocation was communicated effectively before the acceptance, then there was no valid contract formed, and thus no breach of agreement occurred. The buyer would not be liable for the goods shipped after the revocation.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Option A suggests that revocation requires explicit words of rejection. While this is generally true, the purchasing agent's statement about financial crisis and inability to purchase is quite explicit in its intent to revoke.\n  \n- Option B emphasizes the seller's reliance on a definite order. However, reliance alone does not create a binding contract if the offer has been effectively revoked.\n\n- Option C states that the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off. This aligns with the interpretation that the purchasing agent's statement was a clear indication of revocation.\n\n- Option D asserts that a buyer is never in breach if it rejects goods prior to shipment. This is not entirely accurate; the timing and communication of the rejection are crucial.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\n**C. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.**\n\nThe purchasing agent's statement was sufficiently clear to indicate a revocation of the offer, and therefore, the seller would not prevail in claiming a breach of contract."
