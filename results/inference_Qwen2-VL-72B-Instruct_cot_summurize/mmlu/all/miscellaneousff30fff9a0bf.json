Absorption lines in the solar spectrum are consistent with the presence of sodium.\n\nExplanation: The presence of specific elements in the Sun's atmosphere can be determined by analyzing the absorption lines in the solar spectrum. Sodium, like many other elements, has characteristic spectral lines that can be identified when its atoms absorb or emit light at certain wavelengths. By observing these lines in the solar spectrum, scientists can conclude that sodium is present in the Sun's atmosphere."
