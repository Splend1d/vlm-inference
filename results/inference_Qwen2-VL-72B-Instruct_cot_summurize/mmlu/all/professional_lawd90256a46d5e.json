The parking attendant directed the defendant to leave her keys in the car, and he handed her a receipt as she left. Following dinner, the defendant went back to the parking lot and handed her receipt to the attendant who informed her that the parking charge would be $14. Visibly irate, she told the attendant that $14 was much too high for a two-hour parking fee. The parking attendant responded that unless she paid the $14, he could not return her car. She adamantly refused to pay the $14, and her friend, with whom she was having dinner, drove the defendant home in her car. Later that same night, the defendant decided to regain possession of her car with a spare set of keys. She returned to the lot and drove her car home. If the defendant is subsequently charged with larceny, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.\nB. guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.\nC. not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.\n"

To determine whether the defendant can be charged with larceny, we need to consider the legal principles involved.\n\nLarceny, also known as theft, typically involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this case, the defendant took her own car, which she had lawfully parked earlier.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Option A: Guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.**\n  - This option suggests that failing to pay the parking fee constitutes larceny. However, failing to pay a debt or fee does not equate to theft, especially when the item taken (the car) belongs to the person taking it.\n\n- **Option B: Guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.**\n  - While the defendant may have been under a contractual obligation to pay the parking fee, breaching a contract does not amount to larceny. Contractual disputes are generally handled through civil law rather than criminal law.\n\n- **Option C: Not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.**\n  - The legality of the parking fee is irrelevant to the question of larceny. Even if the fee were deemed excessive, it does not change the fact that the defendant took her own property.\n\n- **Option D: Not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.**\n  - This option correctly identifies that larceny requires the taking of someone else's property. Since the defendant took her own car, she cannot be charged with larceny of her own property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.**"
