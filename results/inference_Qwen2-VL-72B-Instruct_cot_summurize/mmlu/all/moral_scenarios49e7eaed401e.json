However, simply bringing a child to see exotic animals is generally not considered morally wrong unless there is evidence of animal mistreatment or cruelty, which is not specified here.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong because it is part of a regulated sporting event.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong based on the information provided, assuming the animals are treated ethically.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
