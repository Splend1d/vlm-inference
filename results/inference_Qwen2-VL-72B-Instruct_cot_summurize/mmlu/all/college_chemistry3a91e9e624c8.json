This means that if we know the position of a particle very precisely, we cannot know its momentum very precisely, and vice versa.\n\nIn the case of a quantum mechanical particle in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box, the particle is confined within the box, so its position is somewhat known (it must be within the boundaries of the box). However, because the particle is in the lowest energy level, its momentum is not well-defined. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly."
