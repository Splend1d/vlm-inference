The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird\n\nConvergent evolution refers to the independent development of similar features in species of different lineages. In this case, both insects and birds have evolved wings for flight, even though they are not closely related and their wings have different structures and evolutionary origins. This is a classic example of convergent evolution."
