                    "text": "The quote from Hart suggests that while the certification of something as legally valid by the official legal system carries significant weight and authority, it does not automatically resolve the question of whether one should obey such laws. This implies that even if a law is officially recognized as valid within the legal system, individuals still have a responsibility to evaluate these laws through a moral lens.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **That legal positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law.**\n   - This option suggests that legal positivism disregards moral considerations entirely. However, Hart\u2019s quote indicates that while legal positivism acknowledges the validity of laws based on their formal criteria, it also recognizes the need for moral scrutiny. Therefore, this option is not fully accurate.\n\nB. **That validly enacted law should always be obeyed.**\n   - This option implies an absolute obligation to obey any law that has been formally enacted. Hart\u2019s quote, however, suggests that even validly enacted laws require moral evaluation before deciding whether to obey them. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. **That moral issues fall outside the official legal system.**\n   - This option suggests that moral considerations are irrelevant to the legal system. Hart\u2019s quote, however, emphasizes that moral scrutiny is necessary despite the official validation of laws. Hence, this option is not supported by the quote.\n\nD. **That there is no moral duty to obey an unjust law.**\n   - This option aligns well with Hart\u2019s quote. It suggests that even though a law might be legally valid, there is no inherent moral obligation to obey it if it is unjust. The quote explicitly mentions the need for moral scrutiny, implying that obedience to unjust laws cannot be morally justified.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**D. That there is no moral duty to obey an unjust law.**"
