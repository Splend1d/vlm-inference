Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000 per year. Reno Co. wishes to buy 5000 of these units on a special order. There would be no shipping costs on this special order. What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno?\n\nA. $110\nB. $140\nC. $190\nD. 200\n"

The fixed costs will not change regardless of whether Match sells the units to Reno or not.\n\nThe variable costs per unit include:\n- Direct materials: $60\n- Direct labor: $10\n- Variable overhead: $40\n\nAdding these together gives us a total variable cost per unit of $60 + $10 + $40 = $110.\n\nSince there are no shipping costs for this special order, the only additional cost to consider is the fixed licensing fee. However, the fixed licensing fee is an annual cost and does not increase with the production of additional units. Therefore, it does not affect the per-unit cost for this special order.\n\nThus, the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno is the variable cost per unit, which is $110.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $110"
