An eight month old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child.\n\nAttachment theory suggests that children form attachments to primary caregivers who provide them with care and protection. When a child's primary caregiver is neglectful or unavailable, the child may seek out alternative sources of comfort and security. In this case, the eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child is most likely to attach to the male psychologist as an alternative source of comfort and security. The other options do not have the same level of need for alternative attachment figures due to their stable environments or younger age."
