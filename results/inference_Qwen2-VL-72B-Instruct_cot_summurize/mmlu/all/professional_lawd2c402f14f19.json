A sideswipe occurred between the plaintiff's pickup truck and a trailer truck as they passed in opposite directions. The sideswipe caused the plaintiff's truck to careen down the road and into the path of a second trailer truck. The driver of the second trailer truck was immediately killed. Both of the trailer trucks were owned by the same transport company. At trial, the plaintiff called a witness to the collision to testify that he heard an unidentified female witness scream, \"Oh my God, that trailer truck sideswiped that little pickup truck. \"The trial judge should rule the witness's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a declaration of existing state of mind.\nB. admissible as an excited utterance.\nC. inadmissible, because it contains inadmissible opinion evidence.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Excited utterances are statements made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition, and they are considered reliable because the excitement reduces the likelihood of fabrication. In this case, the statement was made immediately after the collision, indicating that it was made under the stress of the event, making it admissible as an excited utterance."
