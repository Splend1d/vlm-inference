The police were looking for evidence of the husband's suspected activities in a major drug trafficking plot. The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. The police found a kilo of cocaine in a dresser drawer and various written notes that contained the names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. After the husband was arrested, he moved for suppression of all of the evidence seized in his bedroom. Will the court likely deny the motion due to the voluntary consent given by the wife?\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n"

Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\nIn this scenario, the wife has joint authority over the bedroom as it is a mutual space shared with her husband. Under the common law principle of \"joint occupancy,\" if one person has the right to give consent to search a shared area, their consent is generally sufficient even if the other occupant is absent or objects. Therefore, the wife's voluntary consent would likely be considered valid, and the court would probably deny the motion to suppress the evidence."
