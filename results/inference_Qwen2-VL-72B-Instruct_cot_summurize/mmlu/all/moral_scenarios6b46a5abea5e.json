If the drugs are prescription medications used as directed by a healthcare provider, it might not be considered morally wrong. If they are illegal substances or used in an unsafe manner, it would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I vandalized her car after our interactions at home.\"\n- Vandalism is generally considered a clear moral wrongdoing because it involves damaging someone else's property without their consent.\n- This action is also illegal and goes against societal norms of respect for others' belongings.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 could be morally wrong depending on the specifics of drug use, but it is less clear-cut compared to Scenario 2.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong as it involves vandalism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
