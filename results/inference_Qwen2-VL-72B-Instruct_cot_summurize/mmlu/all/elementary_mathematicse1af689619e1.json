There are 2 cups in a pint.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total juice in cups} = 12 \\text{ pints} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/pint} = 24 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nNext, we divide the total number of cups by the amount Erin drinks each day:\n\n\\[ \\text{Days to drink all juice} = \\frac{24 \\text{ cups}}{3 \\text{ cups/day}} = 8 \\text{ days} \\]\n\nTherefore, Erin will take 8 days to drink all of the juice she made.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 8 days."
