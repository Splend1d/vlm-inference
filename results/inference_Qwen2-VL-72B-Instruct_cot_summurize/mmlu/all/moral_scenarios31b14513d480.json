This is generally considered ethical and fair, aligning with principles of justice and equality before the law.\n- Therefore, this scenario does not indicate any morally wrong behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I made sure to take some hotel robes and towels as a souvenir.\"\n- Taking hotel items like robes and towels without permission is typically seen as theft or at least inappropriate behavior.\n- Hotels usually provide such items for guest use during their stay but expect them to be left behind upon departure unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- Therefore, this scenario indicates a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
