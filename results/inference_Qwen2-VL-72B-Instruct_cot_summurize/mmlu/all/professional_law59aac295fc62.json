The store clerk refused to sell it to him, because it was a \"house rule\" that the necklace was intended for women only. If the man brings suit against the store for its refusal to sell him the necklace, the man will\n\nA. lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\nB. lose, because the man did not notii' the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer.\nC. win, because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer.\nD. win, because it is immaterial whether the man was the first customer to appear at the store to purchase the necklace.\n"

In this case, the advertisement states \"FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED,\" which implies that the first person to arrive and demand the item will be entitled to purchase it at the advertised price. Since the man was the first person to arrive and demand the necklace, according to the terms of the advertisement, he should have been allowed to purchase it. The store's \"house rule\" about the necklace being intended for women only does not override the clear terms of the advertisement. Therefore, if the man brings suit against the store for refusing to sell him the necklace, he would likely win based on the terms of the advertisement constituting a binding offer."
