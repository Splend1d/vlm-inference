Has a well-developed infrastructure.\n\nDeveloping countries often struggle with inadequate infrastructure, including roads, water supply, sanitation, and electricity. While they may have modern centers of commerce and experience significant rural-to-urban migration, their infrastructure tends to be less developed compared to that in developed countries. Additionally, cities in developing countries can contribute significantly to their country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), not GDI, which stands for Gross Domestic Income and is a different economic measure."
