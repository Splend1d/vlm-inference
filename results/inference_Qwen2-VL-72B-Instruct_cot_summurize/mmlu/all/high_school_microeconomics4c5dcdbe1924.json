However, this cannot be definitively concluded without knowing the specific marginal benefits and costs involved.\n\n2. **Option B: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.**\n   - This statement suggests that the student perceives the benefit of studying for the fourth hour to be equal to or greater than its cost. Given that the student decided to study for another hour, it is reasonable to infer that she believes the marginal benefit justifies the marginal cost.\n\n3. **Option C: Without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.**\n   - This statement highlights the importance of considering the opportunity cost (what the student gives up by choosing to study instead of doing something else). While this is true, it does not directly address the student's decision-making process based on the information provided.\n\n4. **Option D: The marginal cost of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.**\n   - This statement suggests that the cost of studying for the third hour was higher than for the fourth hour. There is no information provided to support this comparison between the third and fourth hours.\n\nGiven the student's decision to study for one more hour, it indicates that she believes the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as its marginal cost. Therefore, the most likely true statement is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.**"
