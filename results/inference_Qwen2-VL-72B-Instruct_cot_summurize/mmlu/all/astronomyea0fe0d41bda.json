The solar wind electromagnetically \"blows\" the ions directly away from the Sun.\n\nExplanation:\nComets have two distinct tails: the ion (plasma) tail and the dust tail. The ion tail, which consists of charged particles, points directly away from the Sun due to the influence of the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun, primarily electrons and protons, which travel at high speeds. These charged particles interact with the magnetic field of the comet, causing the ionized gases in the tail to be pushed away from the Sun. This electromagnetic interaction is what causes the ion tail to always point away from the Sun, regardless of the comet's direction of motion."
