However, this does not align with the typical understanding of aging, where physical changes generally occur gradually over time.\n\nB. **Can be offset by meditation**: While meditation can have positive effects on mental health and stress levels, it is unlikely to directly offset physical changes associated with aging.\n\nC. **Take a long time**: This option aligns well with the general understanding of aging processes. Physical changes associated with aging typically occur over many years, gradually affecting various aspects of the body.\n\nD. **Should not be discussed in public**: This option implies that discussions about physical changes should be avoided in public settings. However, there is no inherent reason why such discussions should be prohibited or discouraged.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate statement regarding physical changes as described by Clifford and Lucia Pauling in \"Senior View\" is:\n\n**C. Take a long time**"
