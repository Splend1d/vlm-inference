However, the question seems to be asking for the amount that would be recognized if it were to be reported in the income statement, which is not the standard accounting treatment but could be considered for educational purposes or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the cost basis of $24,000 and a fair value of $30,000, there is an unrealized gain of $6,000 ($30,000 - $24,000). This gain would typically be reported in OCI, but if we were to hypothetically report it in the income statement, it would be a $6,000 gain before tax. Since the question does not ask for the after-tax amount, the pre-tax gain of $6,000 is the correct response."
