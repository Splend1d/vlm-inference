Constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.\n\nIn E. coli, the lac operon is regulated by a repressor protein that binds to the operator region of the DNA when it is bound to allolactose (a derivative of lactose). When the repressor is bound to the operator, it blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the lac operon genes. However, if there is a mutation in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose, the repressor will not be able to bind to the operator even when lactose is present. As a result, the lac operon genes will be expressed regardless of whether lactose is present or not, leading to constitutive expression. Therefore, option A is correct."
