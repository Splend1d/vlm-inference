The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\n\nEntrapment occurs when law enforcement officers induce or persuade an individual to commit a crime they would not otherwise have committed. In this scenario, the government agent repeatedly pressured the addict to obtain heroin despite the addict's initial refusal. This pressure eventually led the addict to comply, suggesting that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government rather than the addict. Therefore, the trial court is likely to consider this as a case of entrapment."
