At the time he was apprehended, the police found in his possession a book of matches with four matches missing. At trial, the prosecution introduced the book of matches into evidence. Following closing arguments, and before the jury retired for deliberations, the judge gave instructions concerning the law of the case. The judge instructed the jury that it could infer the defendant's intent to set the fire based on the fact that four matches were missing from the matchbook. This instruction was specifically objected to by the defense counsel. The judge's jury instruction concerning the defendant's intent was\n\nA. proper, because it constituted a rebuttable presumption of fact.\nB. proper, because it constituted a permissible inference.\nC. improper, because the prosecution must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. improper, because the instruction shifts the burden of persuasion from the prosecution to the defendant defense.\n"

The instruction given by the judge, allowing the jury to infer the defendant's intent based solely on the fact that four matches were missing from the matchbook, improperly shifts some of the burden onto the defendant. This is because it suggests that the absence of four matches is sufficient evidence of intent without requiring the prosecution to provide additional proof. Such an instruction would not be appropriate as it does not meet the standard required for proving guilt in a criminal case."
