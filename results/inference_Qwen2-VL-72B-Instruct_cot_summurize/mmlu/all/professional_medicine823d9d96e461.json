His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n"

Separation of endothelial junctions\n\nInflammation, such as that caused by an infection or injury, can lead to the release of inflammatory mediators which cause the separation of endothelial cells in blood vessels. This separation increases the permeability of the vessel walls, allowing fluid and proteins to leak into the surrounding tissue, resulting in edema."
