A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nA. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nD. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n"

Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the appliance store's defense hinges on the concept of foreseeability and whether the accident was a result of a superseding act. For the pedestrian's lawsuit to survive a motion to dismiss, it must be shown that the injury was a foreseeable consequence of the store's actions (or lack thereof).\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because assuming the risk typically requires knowledge of the specific danger and voluntary exposure to it. The pedestrian did not enter the actual loading/unloading area and thus did not assume the risk of being struck by a falling box.\n  \n- **Option B** is incorrect because the pedestrian did not become a trespasser; they were walking through the general vicinity, not the specific loading/unloading area.\n\n- **Option C** is partially correct but not entirely. While the pedestrian had a right to be where they were, the key issue is whether the injury was foreseeable.\n\n- **Option D** is correct because the chain of causation leading to the pedestrian's injury can be considered generally foreseeable. The store's negligence in not securing the area properly and the subsequent crash of appliances created a situation where a tremor could cause further accidents. This makes the injury a foreseeable consequence of the store's actions.\n\nTherefore, the pedestrian's lawsuit is likely to survive the store's motion to dismiss based on the foreseeability of the chain of events leading to the injury."
