That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\n\nIn \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" Ronald Dworkin discusses Hume's principle, which is based on David Hume's famous dictum that \"one cannot derive an 'ought' from an 'is.'\" This principle asserts that factual statements (what is) cannot logically lead to normative statements (what ought to be). In other words, it emphasizes that moral or ethical conclusions cannot be derived solely from empirical observations or facts about the world or human nature."
