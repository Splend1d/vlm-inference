A single or a few mutations in key regions of the genome can alter the virus's properties, including its virulence.\n\nB. **Recombining with another enterovirus**: While recombination can introduce new genetic material into the virus, it is generally less common than simple mutations and might not be the most straightforward way for the virus to increase its virulence.\n\nC. **Altering its protein coat**: Changes in the protein coat (capsid) can affect the virus's ability to bind to host cells or evade the immune system, but these changes typically result from underlying mutations in the viral genome rather than direct alteration of the protein coat.\n\nD. **Multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions**: While multiple deletions and substitutions can significantly alter the virus, they are less likely to occur simultaneously and may not necessarily lead to increased virulence as efficiently as specific targeted mutations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most straightforward and common process for poliovirus to become more virulent is through:\n\n**A. Mutation of the RNA genome at only a few positions**\n\nThis option directly addresses the ease and frequency with which RNA viruses can mutate, leading to changes in their virulence."
