This can lead to a decrease in real GDP because the overall production capacity of the economy is reduced. Additionally, if firms are producing less output, they may not need to hire as many workers or may reduce hours, leading to lower incomes for households. This can result in decreased consumer spending, which can further contribute to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nFurthermore, a decline in labor productivity can also lead to higher costs for firms, which can result in higher prices for goods and services. This can cause the price level to increase, even as real GDP decreases. Therefore, a decline in labor productivity can explain both a decrease in real GDP and an increase in the price level."
