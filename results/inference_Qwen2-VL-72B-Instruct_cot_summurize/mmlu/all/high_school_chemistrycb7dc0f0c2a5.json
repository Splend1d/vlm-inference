                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion about the reaction under standard conditions, we need to consider the relationship between enthalpy (\u0394H), entropy (\u0394S), and free energy (\u0394G). The spontaneity of a reaction can be determined by the sign of \u0394G, which is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \u0394G is the change in Gibbs free energy.\n- \u0394H is the change in enthalpy.\n- \u0394S is the change in entropy.\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, we know that:\n\n\\[ \\Delta G > 0 \\]\n\nWe also know that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, implying that:\n\n\\[ \\Delta G < 0 \\quad \\text{at higher temperatures} \\]\n\nFor a reaction to become spontaneous with an increase in temperature, the term \\( T\\Delta S \\) must dominate over \u0394H as temperature increases. This suggests that:\n\n1. If \u0394H is positive (endothermic), then for the reaction to become spontaneous at higher temperatures, \u0394S must be positive (favoring disorder).\n2. If \u0394H is negative (exothermic), then for the reaction to become spontaneous at higher temperatures, \u0394S must be negative (favoring order).\n\nSince the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, we have:\n\n\\[ \\Delta G > 0 \\]\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G = 0\n   - This option states that \u0394G = 0, which contradicts the information that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions (\u0394G > 0).\n\nB. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G > 0\n   - This option has both \u0394H and \u0394S positive, which would make \u0394G positive regardless of temperature, contradicting the condition that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures.\n\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G > 0\n   - This option has \u0394H negative and \u0394S negative. For this combination, \u0394G could be positive under standard conditions if the magnitude of \\( T\\Delta S \\) is not sufficient to overcome the negative \u0394H. However, it does not explain why the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures since both terms would still favor nonspontaneity.\n\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0 and \u0394G > 0\n   - This option has \u0394H positive and \u0394S positive. Under standard conditions, if \u0394H is positive and \u0394S is positive, the reaction could be nonspontaneous (\u0394G > 0) because the positive \u0394H dominates. At higher temperatures, the term \\( T\\Delta S \\) could become large enough to make \u0394G negative, making the reaction spontaneous.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion under standard conditions is:\n\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0 and \u0394G > 0"
