                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement in the context of a private closed economy, where there is no government intervention and no international trade.\n\nA. **Household saving can never be negative.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. In a private closed economy, households can save negatively if they spend more than their disposable income, for example, by borrowing or using savings.\n\nB. **Investment is always greater than savings.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. In a private closed economy, investment (I) must equal savings (S) for the economy to be in equilibrium. If I > S, there would be excess demand for goods and services, leading to inflationary pressures.\n\nC. **The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Economic equilibrium occurs when total spending (consumption plus investment) equals total production (income). Consumption (C) does not need to equal saving (S) for equilibrium; rather, it is the equality between total spending (C + I) and total income that defines equilibrium.\n\nD. **Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income.**\n   - This statement is correct. Disposable income is what households have available after taxes and other deductions. If consumption equals disposable income, then there is nothing left over to save, making saving equal to zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income.**"
