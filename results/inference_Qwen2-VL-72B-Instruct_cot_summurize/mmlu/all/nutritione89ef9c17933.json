In vitamin D deficiency, the body tries to compensate by increasing the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme involved in bone metabolism. This increased activity helps mobilize calcium from bones to maintain serum calcium levels. Therefore, the plasma activity of alkaline phosphatase increases in vitamin D deficiency."
