It supports relatively few species due to harsh conditions.\n2. **Taiga (Boreal Forest)**: This biome has colder climates and supports more species than the tundra but still has limited biodiversity compared to warmer biomes.\n3. **Tropical Rainforest**: Known for its high biodiversity, tropical rainforests support a vast array of plant and animal species due to warm temperatures, abundant rainfall, and diverse habitats.\n4. **Temperate Deciduous Forest**: These forests have moderate climates and support a variety of species, but their biodiversity is generally lower than that of tropical rainforests.\n\nGiven that the researcher found 35 percent more species than in any other biome, it suggests that she is in an area with exceptionally high biodiversity. The tropical rainforest is renowned for having the highest biodiversity on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the researcher is most likely to be in:\n\n**C. Tropical rainforest**"
