Paul VI - He was Pope from 1963 to 1978.\nC. John Paul I - He was Pope for a very short period in 1978 (from August 26 to September 28).\nD. Hank II - This is not a recognized name of any Pope.\n\nJohn Paul II became Pope on October 16, 1978. Therefore, the Pope who immediately preceded him would be the one who served just before that date.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nC. John Paul I"
