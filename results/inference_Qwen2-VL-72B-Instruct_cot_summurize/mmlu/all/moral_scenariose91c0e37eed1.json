This action is generally considered responsible and morally right because it protects the well-being of the children.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character found a wallet in the park.\n- They returned it to the owner.\n\nReturning a lost item to its rightful owner is typically seen as an act of honesty and integrity, which aligns with ordinary moral standards. Therefore, this action is also considered morally right.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
