                    "text": "To determine which statements are true, let's analyze each processor's characteristics:\n\n### Processor M-5:\n- **Pipeline Stages:** 5\n- **Clock Cycle Time:** 10 ns\n\n### Processor M-7:\n- **Pipeline Stages:** 7\n- **Clock Cycle Time:** 7.5 ns\n\n#### I. M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\nMaximum throughput is determined by the number of instructions that can be processed per unit time. It is inversely proportional to the clock cycle time.\n\n- **M-5 Throughput:** \\( \\frac{1}{10 \\text{ ns}} = 0.1 \\text{ instructions per nanosecond} \\)\n- **M-7 Throughput:** \\( \\frac{1}{7.5 \\text{ ns}} \\approx 0.133 \\text{ instructions per nanosecond} \\)\n\nSince 0.133 > 0.1, M-7 indeed has better maximum throughput than M-5.\n\n#### II. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\nLatency refers to the time it takes for one instruction to complete from start to finish.\n\n- **M-5 Latency:** \\( 5 \\times 10 \\text{ ns} = 50 \\text{ ns} \\)\n- **M-7 Latency:** \\( 7 \\times 7.5 \\text{ ns} = 52.5 \\text{ ns} \\)\n\nSince 50 ns < 52.5 ns, the latency of a single instruction is actually longer on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\n#### III. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\nThis statement is not necessarily true because the overall performance depends on various factors such as the specific program being executed, branch prediction accuracy, cache behavior, and other architectural details. While M-7 has a higher throughput, the longer latency could affect performance in certain scenarios.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is A. I only."
