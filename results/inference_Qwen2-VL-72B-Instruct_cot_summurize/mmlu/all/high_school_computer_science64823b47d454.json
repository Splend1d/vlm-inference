Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store**\n\n- This can be determined by checking the \"Quantity available\" field. If the quantity available is 0, then the item is not currently in the store.\n\n**B. Which colors are more popular among men than women**\n\n- The database does not contain any information about gender preferences or sales data broken down by gender. Therefore, it cannot be determined which colors are more popular among men than women.\n\n**C. Which type of footwear is most popular among adults**\n\n- The database does not provide any information about the age group of customers or sales data broken down by age. Therefore, it cannot be determined which type of footwear is most popular among adults.\n\n**D. The total number of shoes sold in a particular month**\n\n- The database does not contain any information about sales transactions or historical sales data. Therefore, it cannot be determined the total number of shoes sold in a particular month.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Which items listed in the database are not currently in the store**"
