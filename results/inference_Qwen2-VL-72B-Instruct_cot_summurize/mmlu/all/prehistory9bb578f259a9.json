Connections made in tool making prepared the brain for the production and use of language.\n\nThis hypothesis is supported by studies that suggest the cognitive skills involved in making and using tools, such as planning, fine motor control, and spatial reasoning, may have laid the groundwork for the neural pathways necessary for language development. The repetitive and intricate nature of tool-making tasks could have stimulated brain regions associated with language, potentially facilitating its evolution."
