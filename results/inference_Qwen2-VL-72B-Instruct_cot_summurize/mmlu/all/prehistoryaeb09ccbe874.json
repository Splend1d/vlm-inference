Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nThe Aurignacian culture, which succeeded the Mousterian culture in Europe, is characterized by significant advancements in tool-making techniques. One of the key differences between Aurignacian and Mousterian technology is that Aurignacian tools often featured longer, thinner blades with more usable cutting edges. This innovation allowed for greater efficiency and versatility in tool use compared to the broader, less refined tools typical of the Mousterian period."
