Diamond: Diamond is a well-known allotrope of carbon, characterized by its crystalline structure and hardness.\n\nB. Soot: Soot is primarily composed of amorphous carbon particles and is not considered an allotrope of carbon because it lacks a specific crystalline structure.\n\nC. Buckminsterfullerene (also known as Buckyballs): This is another allotrope of carbon, consisting of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a spherical structure resembling a soccer ball.\n\nD. Graphite: Graphite is also an allotrope of carbon, known for its layered structure that allows it to be used in pencils and lubricants.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Soot"
