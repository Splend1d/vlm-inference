The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\nB. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\nC. The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.\nD. The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the legal principles related to land support and the responsibilities of landowners regarding drainage systems.\n\n1. **Lateral Support**: This refers to the right of a landowner to have their land supported laterally (from the sides) by adjacent land in its natural state. If the adjacent landowner removes or alters the natural support, they may be liable for damages caused by the resulting subsidence.\n\n2. **Subjacent Support**: This refers to the right of a landowner to have their land supported from below by underlying land in its natural state. Similar to lateral support, if the subjacent support is removed or altered, the responsible party may be liable for damages.\n\n3. **Improved Condition**: This principle applies when the land has been improved (e.g., with buildings or other structures). The landowner may have additional rights or obligations related to these improvements.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The woman constructed a drainage system that extends across all three parcels.\n- The sister's land began to subside due to the drainage system and a pliable soil condition.\n- The deed to the sister did not mention the drainage system.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the woman is liable for the subsidence of the sister's land due to the drainage system. Since the drainage system was constructed by the woman and it led to the subsidence, the woman could potentially be held liable under the principle of lateral or subjacent support, depending on how the subsidence occurred.\n\nHowever, the question does not provide enough information about whether the subsidence was due to a lack of lateral support or subjacent support. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the sister is entitled to either lateral or subjacent support without more specific details.\n\nAdditionally, the question does not specify whether the sister can prove negligence on the part of the woman in constructing the drainage system. If the woman was negligent, she would likely be liable for the damages.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the lack of specific details about the type of support affected and the presence of negligence, the most cautious and legally sound option is:\n\n**D. The woman, unless the sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the potential liability of the woman but also recognizes the need for proof of negligence, which aligns with common legal standards in such cases."
