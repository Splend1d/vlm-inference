That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The conquest provided Spain with vast amounts of gold and silver, as well as access to new resources and territories, significantly boosting European wealth and power.\n\nC. **The reformation of Catholic Christianity**: While the Reformation had profound social, political, and religious impacts in Europe, it primarily affected internal European dynamics rather than directly increasing productivity through external resource exploitation.\n\nD. **The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan**: This policy of seclusion did not contribute to Western Europe's productivity or global hegemony; instead, it isolated Japan from much of the world, including Western Europe.\n\nGiven these analyses, the conquest of the Aztec Empire is the most relevant event that aligns with the author's assertion about Western Europe achieving a \"quantum jump\" in productivity through the exploitation of other regions' resources.\n\n**Final answer: B. The conquest of the Aztec Empire**"
