However, many other perspectives in security studies also consider these entities as valid referents (e.g., realism, liberalism). Therefore, this is not unique to postcolonialism.\n\nB. **Postcolonialism takes account not only of major war, but also of so-called 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts.**\n   - This statement highlights an aspect of postcolonialism that includes a broader range of conflicts beyond major wars. This is indeed a characteristic of postcolonialism, as it often addresses the impacts of colonialism and its aftermath, including smaller and more localized conflicts.\n\nC. **Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics.**\n   - This statement emphasizes the focus on violence, which is a significant concern in postcolonial studies. Postcolonialism often examines how violence has been used in the context of colonialism and its effects on societies.\n\nD. **Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.**\n   - This statement reflects the fact that postcolonialism emerged as a critique of Eurocentric views and seeks to incorporate non-European perspectives and experiences. This is indeed a defining feature of postcolonialism.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is NOT a defining feature distinguishing postcolonialism from other perspectives on security is:\n\n**A. Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies.**\n\nThis is because considering nations or community groups as valid referent objects is not unique to postcolonialism; other perspectives also do this."
