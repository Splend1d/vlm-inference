The woman continued to take powerful pain medication for several weeks after she returned home. During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, \"That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites.\" In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed \"out of it\" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\nB. No, because the woman put nothing in writing.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\nD. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n"

No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\n\nIn legal terms, a contract can be considered voidable if one party lacked the capacity to enter into the agreement at the time it was formed. This could include situations where a person is under the influence of powerful medication or is otherwise incapacitated, which may impair their ability to understand the nature and consequences of the transaction. Given that the woman was taking powerful pain medication and appeared \"out of it,\" there is a strong argument that she lacked the necessary mental capacity to enter into a binding contract. Therefore, the contract would be voidable, and the neighbor would not likely prevail in a lawsuit for breach of contract."
