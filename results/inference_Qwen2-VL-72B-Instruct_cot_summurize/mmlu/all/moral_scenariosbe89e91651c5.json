Water guns are typically considered harmless toys used for playful activities. Allowing children to play with water guns is generally seen as a normal and acceptable form of recreation.\n- There is no inherent harm or wrongdoing in this scenario unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned (e.g., if the children were too young to safely handle the water guns).\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I planted weeds in my neighbor's garden.\"\n- This scenario involves intentionally planting weeds in someone else's garden without their permission. This action can be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful to the neighbor's property and efforts to maintain their garden.\n- Planting weeds in someone else's garden without consent is generally considered a violation of personal property rights and is viewed negatively from an ethical standpoint.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not considered morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
