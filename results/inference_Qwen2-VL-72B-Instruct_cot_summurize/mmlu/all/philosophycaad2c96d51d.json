According to his philosophy, once a person dies, they no longer exist in any form that can experience pain or pleasure. Therefore, death itself is not something to be feared because it involves no sensation. Epicurus argued that the fear of death arises from the misconception that death is a state of existence, whereas he believed it to be non-existence."
