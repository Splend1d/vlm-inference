The following day, the artist conveys the property to a bartender; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the artist executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a caterer. The caterer gives the artist a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of prior conveyance to the bartender. The bartender, however, records her deed on February 6. The caterer then conveys his interest in the farm to a dancer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the caterer. On February 5, the dancer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the bartender and duly records the deed. In conducting a title search, the dancer should pursue his investigation by looking in the\n\nA. Grantor Index under the caterer's name to ascertain if the caterer acquired title.\nB. Grantee Index under the caterer's name only.\nC. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.\nD.

Here\u2019s how the dancer should proceed:\n\n- **Grantor Index under the caterer's name**: This will show if the caterer had received the property from someone else, which is necessary to establish the caterer's right to convey the property.\n- **Grantee Index under the caterer's name**: This will confirm if the caterer indeed conveyed the property to the dancer.\n- **Grantee Index under the artist's name**: This step is crucial because the artist was the one who originally conveyed the property to both the bartender and the caterer. Checking here will reveal if the artist had conveyed the property to anyone else before the caterer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.**\n\nThis approach ensures that the dancer verifies the entire chain of title from the original conveyance by the artist to the final conveyance to himself."
