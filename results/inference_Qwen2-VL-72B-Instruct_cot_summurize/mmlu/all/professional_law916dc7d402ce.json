During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should\n\nA. affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\nC. reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\nD. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the appropriate course of action for the appellate court, we need to analyze the key aspects of the case:\n\n1. **Right to Represent Himself**: The defendant expressed a desire to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge questioned him extensively about this decision and ultimately decided against allowing him to represent himself due to the defendant's lack of legal experience and the unpersuasive nature of his reasons (distrust of lawyers). The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to self-representation if the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives their right to counsel. However, courts often scrutinize such waivers to ensure they are made voluntarily and with full understanding of the consequences.\n\n2. **Right to a Non-Jury Trial**: The defendant also requested a non-jury trial, which is generally a right that can be waived. However, the prosecution requested a jury trial, and the court impaneled one. The defendant's preference for a non-jury trial does not necessarily override the prosecution's right to demand a jury trial.\n\n3. **Reimbursement Order**: The defendant was ordered to reimburse the state for the cost of his attorney. This order was made under a relevant statute in effect at the time of his arrest. Statutory provisions regarding reimbursement typically require the defendant to pay for legal services if they are found guilty and financially able to do so.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The judge's decision to appoint an attorney despite the defendant's wish to represent himself could be seen as a denial of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to self-representation if the waiver was deemed valid and intelligent. However, the judge's extensive questioning suggests an attempt to ensure the defendant understood the implications of self-representation.\n  \n- The defendant\u2019s request for a non-jury trial was overridden by the prosecution's demand for a jury trial, which is within the prosecution's rights.\n\n- The reimbursement order appears to follow statutory guidelines and is generally permissible if the defendant is found guilty and has the financial means to pay.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely outcome would be:\n\n**D. Reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the potential violation of the defendant's constitutional right to self-representation while addressing the other procedural elements of the case."
