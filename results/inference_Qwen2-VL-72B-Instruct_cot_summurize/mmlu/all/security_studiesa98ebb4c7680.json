Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.\n\nThe Washington Consensus refers to a set of economic policy prescriptions that were promoted for less-developed countries by various international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the U.S. Treasury during the late 20th century. These policies were aimed at promoting economic stability and growth through market-oriented reforms. The 10 steps of the Washington Consensus include:\n\n1. Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n2. Tax Reform: broadening the tax base, cut marginal tax rates, improve tax administration.\n3. Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.\n4. Privatization: state enterprises should be sold to private investors.\n5. Deregulation: remove barriers to entry and exit in markets.\n6. Trade Liberalization: remove restrictions on imports and exports.\n7. Exchange Rate Stability: adopt a competitive exchange rate policy.\n8. Foreign Direct Investment: encourage foreign investment.\n9. Wage and Price Liberalization: allow wages and prices to be determined by market forces.\n10. Social Safety Nets: provide social safety nets to protect the vulnerable.\n\nOption D, \"Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected,\" is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus. In fact, it contradicts the principle of privatization, which is one of the key components of the Washington Consensus."
