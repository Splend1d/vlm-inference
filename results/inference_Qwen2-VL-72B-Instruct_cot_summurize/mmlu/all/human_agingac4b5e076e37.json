It might be something Mabel Davis could relate to or agree with.\n\nB. **Exercise keeps your mind sharp**: Exercise is widely recognized for its benefits in maintaining mental health and cognitive function at any age. This is a scientifically supported fact that many seniors, including Mabel Davis, might agree with.\n\nC. **Women are tougher than men**: This is a subjective statement and varies greatly depending on individual experiences and perspectives. It's not necessarily a universal truth that Mabel Davis would definitively agree with.\n\nD. **Glasses and hearing aids should be avoided**: This statement contradicts the general advice given by healthcare professionals. Avoiding glasses and hearing aids can lead to decreased quality of life and health issues. It's unlikely that Mabel Davis, or most seniors, would agree with this.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most likely statement that Mabel Davis would agree with is:\n\n**B. Exercise keeps your mind sharp**"
