He believed in the existence of gods who were involved in human affairs. Therefore, the idea that the gods do not care about human actions would be contrary to his beliefs.\n\nB. **A thing may be expedient without being morally right.**\n   - Cicero was a proponent of virtue ethics, which holds that moral rightness is based on virtues such as justice, wisdom, courage, and moderation. He argued that true expediency must align with moral rightness. Thus, the notion that something can be expedient but not morally right would undermine his ethical framework.\n\nC. **Moral rightness is relative to one\u2019s culture.**\n   - Cicero believed in universal moral principles that transcend cultural differences. He argued for natural law, which posits that there are inherent moral truths that apply to all people regardless of their cultural background. The idea that morality is culturally relative would contradict this belief.\n\nD. **It is sometimes permissible to lie.**\n   - Cicero held that honesty and truthfulness were fundamental virtues. He believed lying was always wrong because it violated the principle of integrity. Therefore, the idea that lying could ever be permissible would be at odds with his ethical stance.\n\nGiven Cicero's emphasis on the alignment between expediency and moral rightness, the doctrine he would likely consider most pernicious is:\n\n**B. A thing may be expedient without being morally right.**\n\nThis option directly contradicts his belief in the necessity of moral rightness guiding all actions, making it the most pernicious according to his philosophy."
