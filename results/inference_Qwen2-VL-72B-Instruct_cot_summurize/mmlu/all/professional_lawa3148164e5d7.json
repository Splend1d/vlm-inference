The farmer gives a mortgage to the friend for $90,000.\n2. The farmer gives a mortgage to the co-worker for $120,000.\n3. The farmer gives a mortgage to the investor for $110,000.\n4. The co-worker records the mortgage.\n5. The investor records the mortgage.\n6. The friend records the mortgage.\n\nThe recording statute states that any unrecorded instrument affecting title to land is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who records first. Therefore, the priority of the mortgages will be determined by the order in which they were recorded.\n\n- The co-worker recorded first, so their mortgage has the highest priority.\n- The investor recorded second, so their mortgage has the next highest priority.\n- The friend recorded last, so their mortgage has the lowest priority.\n\nGiven these priorities, let's calculate the distribution of the $220,000 proceeds:\n\n1. Co-worker's mortgage: $120,000 (highest priority)\n2. Investor's mortgage: $110,000 (next priority)\n3. Friend's mortgage: $90,000 (lowest priority)\n\nFirst, we pay off the co-worker:\n- $220,000 - $120,000 = $100,000 remaining\n\nNext, we pay off the investor:\n- $100,000 - $110,000 = -$10,000\n\nSince there isn't enough money left after paying off the co-worker, the investor would only receive $100,000, and the friend would receive nothing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $100,000.00"
