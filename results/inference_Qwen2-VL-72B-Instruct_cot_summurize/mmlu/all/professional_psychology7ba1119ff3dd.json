Slow to warm up\n\nThe child's behavior of holding on tightly to her mother's hand and watching the other children before gradually engaging with them after some coaxing from her teacher suggests that she has a \"slow to warm up\" temperament style. This type of temperament is characterized by initial shyness or wariness in new situations, but with time and encouragement, the child can become more comfortable and engaged."
