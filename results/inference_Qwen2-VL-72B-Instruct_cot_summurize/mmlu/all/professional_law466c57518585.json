The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination.\n\nIn criminal trials, the general rule is that character evidence is not admissible to prove that a person acted in accordance with their character on a particular occasion. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One such exception allows a defendant to introduce evidence of a pertinent trait of character (such as truthfulness or honesty) if the prosecution has opened the door by attacking the defendant's character first. If the prosecution does not attack the defendant's character, the defendant is generally not permitted to introduce character evidence on direct examination. However, if the prosecution questions the defendant about their truthfulness during cross-examination, then the defendant can introduce evidence of truthfulness in rebuttal."
