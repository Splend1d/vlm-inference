Therefore, a 28-pound bag of dog food contains:\n\n\\[28 \\text{ pounds} \\times 16 \\text{ ounces/pound} = 448 \\text{ ounces}\\]\n\nNow, to find out how many 8-ounce servings are in 448 ounces, we divide the total number of ounces by the size of one serving:\n\n\\[448 \\text{ ounces} \\div 8 \\text{ ounces/serving} = 56 \\text{ servings}\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 56 8-ounce servings in a 28-pound bag of dog food.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 56."
