This will help them identify the specific needs and goals they have for improving students' drafting skills, which will guide their selection of an appropriate software program. Once they have defined their learning objectives, they can then evaluate different software options based on how well they meet those objectives. Conducting a survey or downloading a trial version may also be useful steps, but they should come after defining the learning objectives. Deciding on the user interface is also important, but it should be done after identifying the software that best meets the committee's needs."
