A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations. The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\n\nA. Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\nB. Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\nC. Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\nD. No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\n"

No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\n\nThe key point here is that the rezoning was part of a comprehensive citywide plan, not an isolated or discriminatory action against the developer alone. Comprehensive zoning changes affecting multiple properties are generally considered legitimate exercises of police power for the public welfare, and do not typically constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Therefore, the developer would likely not prevail in a federal constitutional claim based on this scenario."
