Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.\n\nIn federal civil cases, Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that juries shall consist of six persons unless both parties stipulate otherwise. The rule further states that if a party objects before the jury retires to deliberate, a verdict cannot be rendered by less than six jurors. In this scenario, although the parties stipulated to a verdict from a five-person jury, the objection made by the man (through his motion for a new trial) before the jury retired to deliberate means that the verdict rendered by the five-person jury is invalid. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial."
