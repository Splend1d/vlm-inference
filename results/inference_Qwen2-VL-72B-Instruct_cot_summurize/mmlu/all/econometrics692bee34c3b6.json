The DW test statistic ranges from 0 to 4, where:\n\n- Values close to 2 indicate no autocorrelation.\n- Values less than 2 suggest positive autocorrelation.\n- Values greater than 2 suggest negative autocorrelation.\n\nGiven:\n- Number of observations (n) = 50\n- Number of explanatory variables (k) = 2\n\nWe need to find the critical values for the DW test at these parameters. Typically, these values are found in statistical tables or can be calculated using software. For simplicity, let's assume typical critical values for a significance level of 0.05:\n\n- Lower critical value (dL) \u2248 1.5\n- Upper critical value (dU) \u2248 1.7\n\nThe Durbin-Watson test statistic is given as 1.53.\n\nHere\u2019s how we interpret the test statistic:\n\n1. If DW < dL: Positive autocorrelation\n2. If dL \u2264 DW \u2264 dU: Inconclusive\n3. If dU < DW < (4 - dU): No autocorrelation\n4. If (4 - dU) \u2264 DW \u2264 (4 - dL): Negative autocorrelation\n5. If DW > (4 - dL): Negative autocorrelation\n\nGiven DW = 1.53 and assuming typical critical values:\n\n- Since 1.53 is between dL (\u2248 1.5) and dU (\u2248 1.7), it falls into the inconclusive range.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate conclusion is:\n\nD.
