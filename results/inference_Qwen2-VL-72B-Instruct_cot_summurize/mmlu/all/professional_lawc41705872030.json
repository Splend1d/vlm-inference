Hold onto the goods and make the best of them because a business cannot reject goods already approved by a written agreement signed by both parties.\nB. Try the goods out for several months; if they are not going to be satisfactory, then ship them back to the seller who must provide a refund.\nC.

Identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away.**\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), when a buyer receives nonconforming goods, they have certain rights and obligations. The buyer should promptly notify the seller of the nonconformity and may reject the goods if they do not conform to the contract. It is important to identify and document the nonconformity to support any claims or actions taken. Sending the goods back right away helps to ensure that the buyer complies with the requirement to reject the goods within a reasonable time and minimizes any potential disputes over the condition of the goods upon return."
