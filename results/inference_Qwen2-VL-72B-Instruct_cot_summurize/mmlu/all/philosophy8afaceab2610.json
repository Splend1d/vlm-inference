He famously critiques the identification of goodness with natural properties or states of affairs, such as pleasure or desire, through what he calls the \"naturalistic fallacy.\" According to Moore, \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality that cannot be reduced to any natural property. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or C accurately capture Moore's definition of \"good.\""
