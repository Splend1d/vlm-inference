ADF is a single equation approach to unit root testing while PP is a systems approach\nB. PP tests reverse the DF null and alternative hypotheses so that there is stationarity under the null hypothesis of the PP test\nC. The PP test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression\nD. PP tests have good power in small samples whereas DF tests do not.\n"

The PP test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression.\n\nThe Phillips-Perron test adjusts for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in the error term, making it more robust than the Dickey-Fuller test, which assumes that the errors are independent and identically distributed. This adjustment allows the PP test to provide more reliable results when the data exhibit these common issues."
