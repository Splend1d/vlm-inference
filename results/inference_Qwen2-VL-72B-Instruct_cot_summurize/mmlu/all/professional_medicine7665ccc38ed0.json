This makes enteral nutrition (such as feeding through a nasogastric tube or an oral diet) less suitable because it relies on the digestive system to process food.\n\nCentral hyperalimentation, also known as parenteral nutrition, involves delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream via a central venous catheter. This method bypasses the digestive system entirely, making it a suitable option for patients who cannot tolerate oral or enteral feeding due to issues such as nausea, vomiting, or ileus. Peripheral hyperalimentation could also be considered but is generally less preferred for long-term use compared to central hyperalimentation, especially if there is a need for higher caloric intake or if the patient's condition requires more concentrated solutions that can only be administered centrally.\n\nGiven the patient's inability to eat six days after surgery, central hyperalimentation would provide the necessary nutrients without placing additional stress on her compromised gastrointestinal system."
