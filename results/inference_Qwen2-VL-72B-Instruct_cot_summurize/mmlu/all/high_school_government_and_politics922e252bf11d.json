Southerners\n\nThe Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies can often alienate more conservative members of its traditional base, particularly in regions like the South where cultural and social conservatism is more prevalent. While the party has historically had support from various groups, including those with advanced academic degrees, Northeastern city dwellers, and Jewish Americans, these groups tend to be more aligned with liberal social policies. In contrast, Southerners may be more likely to feel alienated by such policies due to differing cultural values and political leanings."
