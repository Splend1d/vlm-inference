Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane\n\nDiffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Therefore, increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the plasma membrane will increase the rate of diffusion.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Decreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells: This does not directly affect the concentration gradient of the specific solute we are interested in, and thus would not necessarily increase its rate of diffusion.\n\nC. Increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane: While changes in membrane composition can affect permeability, simply increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins does not directly increase the rate of diffusion of a specific uncharged solute.\n\nD. Decreasing the membrane potential across the membrane: Membrane potential primarily affects the movement of charged particles (ions) through ion channels. It has less direct impact on the diffusion of uncharged solutes."
