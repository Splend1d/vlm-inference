The number of allowed energy levels (or energy states) in an atom is primarily determined by the number of electrons it has.\n\nManganese (Mn) has an atomic number of 25, which means it has 25 protons and, in a neutral state, 25 electrons. However, the question specifically refers to the \"55Mn nuclide,\" which indicates the mass number (the sum of protons and neutrons). This means there are 30 neutrons (since 55 - 25 = 30).\n\nThe number of allowed energy levels (or shells) for electrons in an atom is determined by the principal quantum number \\( n \\), which can take values from 1 to infinity. However, in practical terms, the number of occupied energy levels is limited by the number of electrons.\n\nFor Mn with 25 electrons:\n- The first shell (\\( n = 1 \\)) can hold up to 2 electrons.\n- The second shell (\\( n = 2 \\)) can hold up to 8 electrons.\n- The third shell (\\( n = 3 \\)) can hold up to 18 electrons.\n- The fourth shell (\\( n = 4 \\)) can hold up to 32 electrons.\n\nSince Mn has 25 electrons, it will fill the first three shells completely and partially fill the fourth shell. Therefore, the number of occupied energy levels (shells) is 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4"
