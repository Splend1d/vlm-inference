In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n"

The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\n\nCross-examination typically focuses on challenging the credibility of the witness or the accuracy of their testimony. Questioning about the severity of the plaintiff's injuries would be more relevant to the plaintiff's case rather than directly challenging the credibility of the witness who testified about the accident and the defendant's character. This line of questioning would likely be considered outside the proper scope of cross-examination because it does not pertain to the witness's testimony or credibility."
