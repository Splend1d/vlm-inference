                    "text": "In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Lease Agreement**: The tenant had a lease agreement with the landowner for a term of seven years. This lease agreement would have continued even after the landowner's death unless otherwise specified in the lease or by law.\n\n2. **Death of Landowner and Estate**: Upon the landowner's death, her entire estate, including the apartment building, passed to the Girl Scouts of America as per her will. Although the apartment building was not specifically mentioned, it became part of the estate by default.\n\n3. **Tenant's Actions**: The tenant stopped paying rent one month after the landowner's death. This action constitutes a breach of the lease agreement, as the tenant was still bound by the terms of the lease, including the obligation to pay rent.\n\n4. **Statutory Period for Adverse Possession**: The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. Since the tenant only stopped paying rent one month after the landowner's death, the tenant has not met the requirements for adverse possession, which typically requires continuous, open, notorious, and exclusive possession for the statutory period.\n\nGiven these points, the Girl Scouts of America can bring an ejection action against the tenant based on the tenant's failure to pay rent, which is a clear breach of the lease agreement. The other options do not provide sufficient grounds for the organization to prevail in an ejection action:\n\n- B. Leasing the apartment building to a teacher for three years does not affect the original lease agreement between the tenant and the landowner.\n- C. Belief that the lease was still in effect does not absolve the tenant from the obligation to pay rent.\n- D. Not paying taxes on the apartment building is irrelevant to the lease agreement and the tenant's obligations under it.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant reason for the Girl Scouts of America to prevail in an ejection action is option A: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death."
