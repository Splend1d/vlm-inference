The head of the department has promulgated the following hiring rule: \"Because the rich are the source of all problems of society and cannot understand the plight of the poor, anyone who has a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with this department.\" Immediately, 25 employees in the department are fired due to their net worth above the designated level. They sue the state. Which of the following is the correct analysis and conclusion?\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n"

However, the hiring rule is based on a specific rationale (wealth inequality), which may not be arbitrary if it aligns with the department's mission. Additionally, the strict scrutiny standard applies to laws that discriminate based on race, national origin, or fundamental rights, which does not seem applicable here.\n\nB. **Not Deemed Done by a State Actor**: This option suggests that the action is not attributable to the state because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function. However, the department is explicitly a state agency tasked with addressing wealth equality, making it a state actor.\n\nC. **Right to Public Employment as a Protected Property Interest**: This option focuses on procedural due process. If the employees had a protected property interest in their jobs, they would have a right to notice and a hearing before being terminated. If these procedures were not followed, the employees might indeed prevail on this ground.\n\nD. **Wealth as a Quasi-Suspect Class**: This option considers whether wealth can be classified as a quasi-suspect class, requiring intermediate scrutiny. While wealth discrimination is not traditionally considered suspect or quasi-suspect, if it were, the rule would need to serve an important governmental objective. Eliminating poverty could be seen as such an objective, but this classification is debatable.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling argument is related to procedural due process. Employees generally have a protected property interest in their public employment, and termination without proper procedures (such as notice and a hearing) would violate their due process rights.\n\nTherefore, the correct analysis and conclusion is:\n\n**C. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.**"
