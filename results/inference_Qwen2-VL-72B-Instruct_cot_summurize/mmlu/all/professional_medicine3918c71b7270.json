The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?\n\nA. Aortic intima\nB. Esophageal sphincter\nC. Myocardium\nD. Pericardium\n"

Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is injury to the pericardium.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Pericardium"
