While this might be true in some contexts, it doesn't directly address the core message of rape as a form of communication.\n\nB. **Expresses contempt for the democratic system of government**: This option implies that rape is a political statement against democracy. However, rape is more commonly understood as a personal act rather than a political one.\n\nC. **Expresses the inferiority of women as a group to the wider community**: This option suggests that rape is used to communicate the perceived inferior status of women. While this could be part of the broader societal implications, it doesn't fully capture the essence of rape as a form of communication about gender roles.\n\nD. **Reinforces gender roles**: This option aligns with the idea that rape is used to assert and maintain traditional gender roles, where men dominate and women are subjugated. This interpretation fits well with the notion that rape is not just a violent act but also a means of communicating power dynamics and reinforcing societal norms regarding gender.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**D. Reinforces gender roles.**"
