She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure. The presence of bilateral ankle swelling, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down, and being awakened from sleep by shortness of breath are all classic signs of heart failure. Additionally, the physical examination findings of jugular venous distension, crackles in the lungs, a soft S3, and pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles further support this diagnosis.\n\nOf the options provided, echocardiography is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure. Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It can provide information about the size and function of the heart chambers, as well as the thickness and movement of the heart walls. In patients with heart failure, echocardiography can show abnormalities such as reduced ejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped out of the heart with each contraction), dilated heart chambers, and abnormal movement of the heart walls.\n\nMeasurement of serum troponin I concentration, ECG, and exercise stress test may be useful in evaluating other conditions, but they are not specific for heart failure and would not be the first-line diagnostic test in this case.\nTherefore, the answer is D. Echocardiography."
