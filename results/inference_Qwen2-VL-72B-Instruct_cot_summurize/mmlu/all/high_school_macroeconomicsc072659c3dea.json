If wages and salaries do not keep up with inflation, then real incomes can effectively decrease. However, this is a consequence of inflation rather than a direct cost. The other options (A, B, and C) are considered major costs of inflation:\n\nA. Resources will be misallocated: Inflation can lead to misallocation of resources as people and businesses make decisions based on distorted price signals.\n\nB. Wealth will be redistributed: Inflation tends to redistribute wealth from creditors to debtors, as the value of debts decreases in real terms.\n\nC. Savings will be discouraged: High inflation can discourage saving because the real value of savings diminishes over time."
