Absolutists typically do not consider the consequences of actions when determining their moral permissibility.\n\nC. **The ends justify the means.**\n   - This is a consequentialist principle, not an absolutist one. Absolutists believe in fixed moral rules that must be followed regardless of the outcomes.\n\nD. **The hostility should be directed at its true object.**\n   - This statement is somewhat ambiguous and does not clearly reflect a core absolutist principle.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting option that captures the essence of the absolutist position according to Nagel is:\n\n**A. Human persons have a right to life.**\n\nThis option aligns well with the idea that absolutists hold certain moral principles to be inviolable, such as the right to life."
