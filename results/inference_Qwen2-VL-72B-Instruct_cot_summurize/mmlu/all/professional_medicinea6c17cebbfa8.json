Optic nerve\n\nThe sudden loss of vision in one eye, along with pallor of the optic disk on funduscopic examination, are characteristic signs of optic neuritis, which is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Optic neuritis involves inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve, leading to visual disturbances such as blurred or decreased vision, often accompanied by pain upon eye movement. The other options listed do not typically present with these specific visual symptoms."
