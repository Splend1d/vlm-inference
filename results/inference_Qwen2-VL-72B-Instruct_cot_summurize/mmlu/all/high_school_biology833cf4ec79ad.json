Calvin cycle\n\nThe Calvin cycle is the part of photosynthesis that takes place in the stroma of chloroplasts and involves the fixation of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. The products of the Calvin cycle include NADP+ (which is reduced to NADPH during the cycle), ADP (which is phosphorylated to ATP), and sugar (specifically, glucose). This process uses the energy stored in ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide into sugars."
