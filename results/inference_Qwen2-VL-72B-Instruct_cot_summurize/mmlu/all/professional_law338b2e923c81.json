As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nIn legal practice, attorneys have an obligation to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry into the facts and law before filing a complaint. This duty is part of the ethical rules governing attorneys' conduct and is also reflected in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which require that pleadings be signed by an attorney who has conducted a reasonable inquiry into the factual basis of the allegations.\n\nIn this scenario, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint without verifying whether the nurse's replacement was older than the nurse. This failure to investigate the facts adequately could be seen as a violation of the attorney's duty to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. Therefore, the court might consider granting the hospital's motion for sanctions based on this failure.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because sanctions can be imposed on attorneys under certain circumstances, and there is no indication that the hospital was required to provide the attorney with a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion. Option D is partially correct but less specific; while the complaint may contain contentions not warranted by existing law, the primary issue here is the lack of a reasonable inquiry into the facts."
