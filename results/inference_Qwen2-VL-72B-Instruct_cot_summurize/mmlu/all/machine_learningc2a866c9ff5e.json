                    "text": "To determine the correctness of each statement, let's analyze them individually:\n\n### Statement 1:\nPCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Spectral Clustering (such as Andrew Ng\u2019s) both involve eigendecomposition but on different matrices. PCA typically performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix or correlation matrix of the data. Spectral clustering, on the other hand, performs eigendecomposition on the Laplacian matrix derived from the similarity graph of the data points.\n\n- **PCA**: The covariance matrix is \\( n \\times n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of features.\n- **Spectral Clustering**: The Laplacian matrix is also \\( n \\times n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n\nTherefore, while the matrices used in PCA and Spectral Clustering are different, they can indeed have the same size if the number of features equals the number of data points. However, this equality is not always the case, so the statement is generally false.\n\n### Statement 2:\nClassification and regression are two distinct types of machine learning problems. Classification involves predicting discrete labels, whereas regression involves predicting continuous values. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that uses a logistic function to model probabilities. Linear regression, on the other hand, models the relationship between variables using a linear equation.\n\n- **Logistic Regression**: Used for classification tasks.\n- **Linear Regression**: Used for regression tasks.\n\nThus, logistic regression is not a special case of linear regression; they serve different purposes and use different mathematical formulations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
