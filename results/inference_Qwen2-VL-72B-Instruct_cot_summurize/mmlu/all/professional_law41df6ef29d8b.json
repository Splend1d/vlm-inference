After four hours of steady driving, the truck driver stopped at a lounge and consumed five bottles of beer. He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery. As he came to the top of a steep incline in the highway and started his descent, an 11-year-old girl suddenly darted out into the road directly in front of him. The truck driver slammed on his powerful air brakes and swerved sharply to the left to avoid hitting her, but the girl was struck by the tractor- trailer and was seriously injured. The girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the lumber company to recover damages for the girl's injuries. At trial, which of the following is LEAST likely to be admissible?\n\nA. Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.\nB. Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.\nC. Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.\nD. Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.\n"

Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.\n\nIn legal proceedings, evidence related to insurance coverage is generally not admissible because it can prejudice the jury or lead them to consider factors unrelated to the case at hand, such as the ability of one party to pay damages. This principle is often referred to as the \"collateral source rule,\" which aims to prevent the introduction of evidence about insurance to avoid influencing the jury's decision based on financial considerations rather than the merits of the case.\n\nTherefore, while the other pieces of evidence might be relevant to establishing negligence or liability, the insurance coverage itself is typically excluded from consideration during the trial."
