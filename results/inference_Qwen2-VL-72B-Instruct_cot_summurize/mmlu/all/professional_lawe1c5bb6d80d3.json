As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute?\n\nA. Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.\nC. Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.\nD. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n"

The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n\nThis argument directly addresses a legitimate concern regarding the integrity of the electoral process, which is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance protected by the Constitution. Ensuring fair and honest elections is crucial to maintaining the legitimacy of the electoral system and upholding the principle of one person, one vote. By highlighting the increased risk of voting fraud associated with preprinted stickers, this argument provides a compelling rationale for the state's requirement that write-in votes must be written in ink, thereby justifying the election official's interpretation of the statute as a reasonable measure to prevent potential abuses and maintain the integrity of the election process."
