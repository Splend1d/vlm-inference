Eighteenth century CE\n\nJainism is an ancient Indian religion that predates Buddhism and Hinduism. The earliest known Jain texts date back to around the 5th century BCE. However, the construction of temples typically follows the establishment of a religious tradition.\n\nGiven this context, it is reasonable to consider that the first Jaina temples would have been constructed after the initial development of Jainism but before the widespread adoption of temple building practices in India.\n\nOption C (Fifth century BCE) seems plausible as it aligns with the early period of Jainism. However, considering the development of temple architecture and the spread of religious practices, it is more likely that the first Jaina temples were constructed later.\n\nOption A (Second century CE) is a more probable time frame for the appearance of the first Jaina temples, as it falls within the period when temple construction became more common in India.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA. Second century CE"
