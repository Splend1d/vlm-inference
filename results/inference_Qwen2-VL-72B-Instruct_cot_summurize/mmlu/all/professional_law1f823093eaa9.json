During jury selection, one potential juror stated that five years earlier he had been an employee of the company and still owned sev-eral hundred shares of its stock. In response to questioning from the judge, the potential juror stated that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case. The wholesaler's attorney has asked the judge to strike the potential juror for cause. Should the judge strike the potential juror for cause?\n\nA. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.\nB. No, because the wholesaler's attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.\nC. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.\nD. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n"

Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n\nIn legal proceedings, a potential juror with a significant connection to one of the parties, such as being a former employee and current shareholder of the defendant company, may be presumed to have a bias that could affect their impartiality. This presumption of bias can justify striking the juror for cause, even if the juror claims they can be fair. The potential for bias is particularly strong given the financial interest (ownership of stock) and past employment relationship with the company."
