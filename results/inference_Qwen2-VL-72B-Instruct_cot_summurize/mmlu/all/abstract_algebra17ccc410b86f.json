For any element \\( r \\in R \\) and any element \\( i \\in I \\), both \\( ri \\) and \\( ir \\) must be in \\( I \\).\n\nA **subring** \\( S \\) of a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that is itself a ring under the same operations of addition and multiplication as those of \\( R \\). This means:\n1. \\( S \\) is closed under addition.\n2. \\( S \\) contains the additive identity (0).\n3. \\( S \\) is closed under additive inverses.\n4. \\( S \\) is closed under multiplication.\n\nWhile every ideal is indeed a subset of the ring and is closed under addition, it does not necessarily contain the multiplicative identity (if the ring has one) or be closed under taking multiplicative inverses. Therefore, an ideal is not always a subring.\n\n### Statement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.\nA subring \\( S \\) of a ring \\( R \\) being an ideal would require that for any \\( s \\in S \\) and any \\( r \\in R \\), both \\( rs \\) and \\( sr \\) must be in \\( S \\). However, this condition is not necessarily satisfied by all subrings. A subring can exist without satisfying the absorption property required for ideals.\n\nTherefore, not every subring is an ideal.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Statement 1 is false because not every ideal is a subring.\n- Statement 2 is false because not every subring is an ideal.\n\nThe correct answer is B. False, False."
