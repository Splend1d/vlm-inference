This involves devotion, prayer, and adherence to ethical principles. While community involvement and living as a householder are important aspects of Sikh life, it is ultimately faith in God that leads to spiritual liberation. Ascetic renunciation is not emphasized in Sikhism; rather, Sikhs are encouraged to engage with the world while maintaining a spiritual focus."
