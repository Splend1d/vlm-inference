It does not distinguish between fat and fat free mass\n\nBMI (Body Mass Index) is a commonly used method to estimate body fat based on an individual's weight and height. However, a major limitation of BMI is that it does not distinguish between fat mass and fat-free mass (which includes muscle, bone, and other non-fat tissues). This means that individuals with high muscle mass, such as athletes, may have a high BMI without being overfat. Conversely, someone with low muscle mass but high body fat might have a normal or even low BMI. Therefore, while BMI can be a useful tool for population-level assessments, it may not accurately reflect an individual's body composition."
