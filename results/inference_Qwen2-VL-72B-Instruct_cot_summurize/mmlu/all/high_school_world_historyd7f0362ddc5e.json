Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa\n"

                    "text": "To determine the development that Walter Rodney's argument is most likely responding to, let's analyze the context and content of the passage.\n\nThe passage discusses the responsibility for African underdevelopment, attributing it primarily to the imperialist system and the actions of Western European capitalists. It specifically mentions the exploitation of Africa by these capitalists, which aligns with historical events during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers**: This did occur but was more prominent after 1850, particularly during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century.\n\nB. **The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World**: This refers to the transatlantic slave trade, which was a significant part of the imperialist system and involved the forced migration of millions of Africans to the Americas. This fits well with the exploitation mentioned in the passage.\n\nC. **The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa**: While this did happen, it was not the primary focus of the passage, which centers on economic exploitation rather than religious conversion.\n\nD. **The importation of New World products into Africa**: This is less directly related to the exploitation and underdevelopment discussed in the passage.\n\nGiven the context and the focus on economic exploitation and the role of Western European capitalists, the most fitting response is:\n\n**B. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World**\n\nThis option best aligns with the historical period and the themes of exploitation and underdevelopment discussed in the passage."
