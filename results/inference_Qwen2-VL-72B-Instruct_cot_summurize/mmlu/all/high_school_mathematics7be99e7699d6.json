This identity is derived from Pascal's Triangle and is useful in simplifying expressions involving binomial coefficients.\n\nGiven the equation $\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{k}$, we can apply the identity with $n=23$ and $r=5$, which gives us:\n\n$$\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}.$$\n\nThis means that one possible value for $k$ is $5$. However, due to the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, there is another value for $k$ that satisfies the equation. Specifically, since $\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{24-5} = \\binom{24}{19}$, $k$ could also be $19$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers $k$ that satisfy the given equation is $5 + 19 = 24$.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 24."
