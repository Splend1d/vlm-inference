By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nD. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\n"

                    "text": "To determine which large-scale question about global history the passage most closely relates to, let's analyze the context and core of the passage:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage discusses the development and use of gunpowder weaponry in Western Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.\n2. **Core**: It highlights how different military needs influenced technological advancements in these regions. In Europe, the need for siege weapons led to the development of more powerful and mobile gunpowder weapons. In China, the threat from mobile steppe nomads led to a focus on improving horse archer units rather than gunpowder technology.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other**:\n   - This option focuses on the sharing of technologies between societies. While the passage mentions the use of gunpowder weaponry, it does not discuss the sharing or exchange of technology between societies.\n\nB. **Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era**:\n   - This option addresses the broader historical trend of European military dominance. The passage provides insight into why early gunpowder technology developed differently in Europe compared to China, which can contribute to understanding why European states later achieved military superiority.\n\nC. **Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.**:\n   - This option concerns the decline of trade along the Silk Road. The passage does not discuss trade routes or commerce, so this is not relevant.\n\nD. **How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion**:\n   - This option deals with the impact of climate change on cultural exchanges. The passage does not mention climate or its effects on cultural diffusion.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage most closely relates to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era (Option B).\n\nFinal answer: B. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era"
