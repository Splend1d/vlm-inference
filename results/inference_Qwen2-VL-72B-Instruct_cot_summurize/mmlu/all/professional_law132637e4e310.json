He assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties, when and if the screenplay was made into either a movie or a stage play, to his friend, who had subsidized him during his early years as a struggling writer. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, the author was killed in an auto accident. A movie studio then purchased the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and filmed the movie Quiet Winter, which was a great success. In an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, the friend will most likely\n\nA. lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\nB. lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\nC. win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\nD. win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n"

This assignment was made in writing, which typically makes it legally binding and enforceable. The fact that the author died before the screenplay was turned into a movie does not invalidate the assignment. The assignment of future rights is generally enforceable, especially when it is documented in writing. Therefore, the friend would most likely win in an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties."
