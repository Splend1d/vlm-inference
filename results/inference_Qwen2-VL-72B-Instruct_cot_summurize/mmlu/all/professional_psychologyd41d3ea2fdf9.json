Schizophrenia\n\nThe symptoms described, such as social withdrawal, quitting a job, spending most of his time in isolation, and reporting receiving messages from aliens through the TV, suggest the presence of psychotic features (delusions or hallucinations) and significant functional impairment, which are characteristic of schizophrenia. The duration of these symptoms (within the past 6 weeks) also aligns with the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, which requires the presence of at least two of the following symptoms for a significant portion of time during a one-month period: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms.\n\nSchizophreniform Disorder (Option A) would be considered if the symptoms have been present for less than six months, but since the exact duration isn't specified beyond \"within the past 6 weeks,\" it's not possible to confirm this diagnosis without more information.\n\nBrief Reactive Psychosis (Option B) typically involves a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms in response to a stressful event, and the symptoms usually resolve within a month. There is no indication of a specific stressor or a resolution of symptoms in the given scenario.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (Option D) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, starting before age 15 years, and continuing into adulthood. While the individual may exhibit some antisocial behaviors (e.g., quitting a job), the primary symptoms described do not fit the diagnostic criteria for this disorder.\n\nTherefore, considering the information provided, Schizophrenia (Option C) is the most appropriate diagnosis."
