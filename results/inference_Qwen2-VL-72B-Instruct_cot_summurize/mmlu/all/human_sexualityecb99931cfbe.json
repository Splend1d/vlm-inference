This practice is considered extremely dangerous due to the risk of accidental death from suffocation or loss of consciousness leading to choking or other fatal outcomes. The other options listed (troilism, zoophilia, and necrophilia) involve different forms of sexual behavior but do not carry the same immediate physical danger associated with asphyxiophilia."
