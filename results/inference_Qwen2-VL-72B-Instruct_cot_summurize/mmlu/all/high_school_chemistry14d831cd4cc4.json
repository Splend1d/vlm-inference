According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (\u0394E) is equal to the heat added to the system (q) plus the work done by the system (w). For an ideal gas at constant temperature, the internal energy does not change (\u0394E = 0).\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\u0394E = q + w\n\nSince \u0394E = 0 for an isothermal process,\n\n0 = q + w\n\nThis implies that:\n\nq = -w\n\nSo, the heat absorbed by the system is equal to the negative of the work done by the system."
