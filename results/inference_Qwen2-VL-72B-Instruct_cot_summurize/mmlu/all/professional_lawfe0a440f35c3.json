Testimony of a surprise witness to the accident when the court is willing to grant the trucking company a continuance to prepare for cross-examination.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n- **Option A** involves subsequent repairs to the truck, which may not be directly relevant to proving negligence or causation in the accident itself. Evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally excluded under the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 407) because it can be misleading and might discourage parties from making safety improvements.\n  \n- **Option B** presents graphic images of surgery, which could be considered overly prejudicial and inflammatory. Courts often exclude such evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury (Federal Rule of Evidence 403).\n\n- **Option C** involves testimony about the plaintiff's missed work, but since payroll records have already been admitted as evidence of lost wages, this testimony would likely be redundant and unnecessary. The court would prefer to rely on the more objective and detailed payroll records rather than potentially subjective testimony.\n\n- **Option D** involves a surprise witness who observed the accident. If the court grants the trucking company a continuance to prepare for cross-examination, this allows both sides to fairly address the new evidence. This testimony could provide crucial eyewitness accounts that help establish what happened during the accident, making it highly relevant and admissible.\n\nTherefore, the most likely piece of evidence to be admitted by the court is the testimony of the surprise witness, assuming the court grants the continuance to ensure fairness in the proceedings."
