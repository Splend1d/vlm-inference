Wages fluctuate quickly: Classical economists generally believe in flexible wages and prices, which adjust quickly to maintain equilibrium in the labor market.\n\nII. Say's law does not hold: Classical economists support Say's law, which states that supply creates its own demand. This implies that overproduction is not possible because production itself generates the income needed to buy the produced goods.\n\nIII. Input and output prices will stay in line with each other: Classical economists believe in the self-regulating nature of markets, where prices adjust to ensure that supply equals demand. This implies that input and output prices will tend to align.\n\nIV. The government should not worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level: Classical economists advocate for minimal government intervention in the economy, believing that the free market can naturally achieve full employment and price stability without government interference.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nB. I, III, and IV only"
