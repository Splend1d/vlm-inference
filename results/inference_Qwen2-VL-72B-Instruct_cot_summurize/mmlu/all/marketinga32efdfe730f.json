Behavioral variables typically refer to actions or behaviors that can be observed and measured, such as product usage, media usage, or purchase occasions. Personality, on the other hand, refers to the unique combination of traits and characteristics that make up an individual's psychological makeup, which is more subjective and less directly observable than behavioral variables."
