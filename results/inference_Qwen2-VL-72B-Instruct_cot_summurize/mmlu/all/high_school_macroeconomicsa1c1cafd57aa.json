Increases in the interest rate\n\nIncreases in the interest rate can act as a deterrent to economic growth because higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. This can lead to reduced investment, decreased consumer spending, and slower overall economic activity. In contrast, spending on education and training (A), increases in capital (B), and expenditures on research and development (D) are generally considered factors that can promote economic growth by enhancing productivity and innovation."
