In this case, Group A is initially uniformly opposed to the death penalty, while Group B has a mix of opinions.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Both groups would moderate their positions.\n- This option suggests that both groups would move towards a more neutral stance. However, group polarization theory predicts that groups will become more extreme in their views rather than moderating them.\n\nB. Group A members would moderate their positions, but Group B members would retain their original positions.\n- This option contradicts the principles of group polarization, as it suggests that Group A would become less extreme, which is unlikely according to the theory.\n\nC. Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions.\n- This option aligns with group polarization theory for Group A, as they would likely become more strongly opposed to the death penalty. However, it incorrectly predicts that Group B would moderate their positions, when in fact, they might also polarize further into their respective views.\n\nD. Group A members would retain their original positions, but Group B members would moderate their positions.\n- This option is partially correct for Group A, as they would likely remain opposed to the death penalty. However, it incorrectly predicts moderation for Group B, which is not consistent with group polarization theory.\n\nBased on the principles of group polarization, the most accurate prediction is:\n\nC. Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nThis option correctly reflects that Group A would likely become more strongly opposed to the death penalty due to their uniform initial stance, while Group B, having mixed opinions, might experience some internal debate leading to a shift in individual positions, though not necessarily moderation."
