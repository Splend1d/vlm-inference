This makes them safer than live vaccines, which use weakened versions of the virus that can potentially revert to a more virulent form and cause disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, the primary rationale for developing a killed vaccine for a new severe respiratory illness would be to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence."
