Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\nWhen an accountant encounters a material departure from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during a review engagement and management refuses to correct it, the accountant should disclose this departure in a separate paragraph of the review report. This disclosure alerts users of the financial statements to the fact that the statements do not conform to GAAP due to the uncorrected material misstatement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because an adverse opinion is typically issued in an audit context when there is a material departure from GAAP, not in a review engagement.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even though the departure from GAAP is material, the accountant still provides some level of assurance in a review engagement, albeit with a qualification or modification to reflect the departure.\n\nOption C is incorrect because emphasizing that the financial statements are for limited use only does not address the specific issue of the material departure from GAAP."
