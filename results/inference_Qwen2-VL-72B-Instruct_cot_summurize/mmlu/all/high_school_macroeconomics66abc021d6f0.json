Depreciation of physical capital\n\nDepreciation of physical capital is not considered an addition to national income because it represents a loss in value of assets over time due to wear and tear or obsolescence. It is subtracted from gross domestic product (GDP) to calculate net domestic product (NDP), which reflects the actual increase in economic output. On the other hand, wages, salaries, and interest are all forms of income earned by individuals and businesses and are included in the calculation of national income."
