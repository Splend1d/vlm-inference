The existence of strong separatist groups\n\nCentripetal forces are those that work to unify and strengthen a state, whereas centrifugal forces tend to divide or weaken it. Strong separatist groups are an example of a centrifugal force because they promote division and separation from the central authority. The other options (high confidence in central government, national transportation networks, and the national anthem) are all examples of centripetal forces that help to bind a state together."
