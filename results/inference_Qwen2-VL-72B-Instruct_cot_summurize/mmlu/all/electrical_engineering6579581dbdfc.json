Resistance is directly proportional to the length of the conductor and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. Therefore, changing the cross-sectional area will affect the resistance of the conductor. Reluctance, on the other hand, is a property related to magnetic circuits and is not affected by the cross-sectional area of a conductor in the same way that resistance is."
