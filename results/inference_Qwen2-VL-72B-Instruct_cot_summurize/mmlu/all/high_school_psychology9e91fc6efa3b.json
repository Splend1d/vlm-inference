Auditory canal\u2192 ossicles\u2192 oval window\u2192 cochlea\u2192 auditory nerve\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. **Auditory Canal**: Sound waves enter the ear through the auditory canal.\n2. **Ossicles**: The sound waves reach the tympanic membrane (eardrum), which vibrates and transmits these vibrations to the three ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes).\n3. **Oval Window**: The stapes, the last ossicle, pushes against the oval window, transmitting vibrations into the fluid-filled cochlea.\n4. **Cochlea**: The vibrations cause the basilar membrane within the cochlea to vibrate, stimulating hair cells that convert mechanical energy into electrical signals.\n5. **Auditory Nerve**: These electrical signals are then transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain for processing.\n\nThis sequence accurately describes the path sound takes from entering the ear to being perceived by the brain."
