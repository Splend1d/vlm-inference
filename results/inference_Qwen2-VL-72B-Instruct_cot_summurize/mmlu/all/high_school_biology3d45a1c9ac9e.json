Batesian mimicry.\n\nBatesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species, thereby gaining protection from predators that avoid the harmful species. In this case, the lizard without a chemical defense mechanism is mimicking the appearance of a lizard that does have such a defense, thus benefiting from the predator's avoidance behavior."
