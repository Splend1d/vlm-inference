                    "text": "To determine the validity of the given argument using indirect truth tables, we need to assume that the conclusion is false and see if this leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nThe argument is:\n1. (T \u2227 \u00acU) \u2283 \u00acW\n2. \u00acW \u2283 X\n3. \u00acZ \u2283 W\n4. \u00ac(X \u2227 Z)\n5. Conclusion: T \u2283 U\n\nWe will assume the negation of the conclusion, i.e., \u00ac(T \u2283 U), which is equivalent to T \u2227 \u00acU.\n\nNow let's analyze each premise under this assumption:\n\n1. (T \u2227 \u00acU) \u2283 \u00acW\n   Since we have assumed T \u2227 \u00acU, \u00acW must be true for this implication to hold.\n\n2. \u00acW \u2283 X\n   Since \u00acW is true, X must also be true for this implication to hold.\n\n3. \u00acZ \u2283 W\n   This premise does not directly affect our current assumptions since it does not involve T or U.\n\n4. \u00ac(X \u2227 Z)\n   Since X is true, Z must be false for this negation to hold.\n\nNow we have:\n- T is true\n- U is false\n- \u00acW is true (so W is false)\n- X is true\n- Z is false\n\nLet's check if these assignments satisfy all premises:\n1. (T \u2227 \u00acU) \u2283 \u00acW: True (since T \u2227 \u00acU is true and \u00acW is true)\n2. \u00acW \u2283 X: True (since \u00acW is true and X is true)\n3. \u00acZ \u2283 W: True (since \u00acZ is true and W is false)\n4. \u00ac(X \u2227 Z): True (since Z is false)\n\nSince all premises are satisfied under the assumption that T \u2227 \u00acU is true, there is no contradiction. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nNow let's check the provided options to find a counterexample:\n\nA. Valid - This is incorrect because we found the argument to be invalid.\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when T, X, and Z are true and U and W are false - This is incorrect because it contradicts our finding that Z must be false.\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when T and X are true and U, W, and Z are false - This matches our findings.\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when T, W, and Z are true and U and X are false - This is incorrect because it contradicts our finding that W must be false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when T and X are true and U, W, and Z are false"
