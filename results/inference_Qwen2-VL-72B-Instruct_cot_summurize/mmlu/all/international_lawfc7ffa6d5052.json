The State which persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset\n\nA persistent objector is a state that consistently and publicly expresses its opposition to the development or acceptance of a particular rule of customary international law from the very beginning, thereby not being bound by that rule even if it becomes widely accepted by other states. This principle allows a state to avoid being bound by a customary international law norm if it has consistently and clearly expressed its dissent throughout the process of the norm's formation."
