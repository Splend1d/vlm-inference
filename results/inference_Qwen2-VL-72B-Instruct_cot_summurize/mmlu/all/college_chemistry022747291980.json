The number of distinct chemical shifts corresponds to the number of different types of carbon atoms present in the molecule.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Hexane (n-hexane)**:\n- Structure: CH3(CH2)4CH3\n- Carbon environments: 3 (terminal methyl groups, middle methylene groups, and the central methylene group)\n- Number of distinct chemical shifts: 3\n\nB. **2-Methylpentane**:\n- Structure: CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3\n- Carbon environments: 5 (two terminal methyl groups, one methyl group on the second carbon, two methylene groups, and one methine group)\n- Number of distinct chemical shifts: 5\n\nC. **3-Methylpentane**:\n- Structure: CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3\n- Carbon environments: 5 (two terminal methyl groups, one methyl group on the third carbon, three methylene groups)\n- Number of distinct chemical shifts: 5\n\nD. **2,3-Dimethylbutane**:\n- Structure: CH3C(CH3)CH(CH3)CH3\n- Carbon environments: 3 (three methyl groups, one methine group)\n- Number of distinct chemical shifts: 3\n\nBased on this analysis, both 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane have five distinct chemical shifts in their 13C NMR spectra.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nB. 2-methylpentane\nC. 3-methylpentane"
