The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels. The investor, ignoring these restrictions, was able to use his political influence to persuade the county zoning board to rezone the said parcel for commercial use. The residents of phase I seek to enjoin the construction of the shopping center. The residents will have\n\nA. little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\nB. no standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center.\nC. no chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\nD. success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n"

                    "text": "D. success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n\nThe residents of Phase 1 have a strong case based on the common development scheme principle. The original deed restrictions, which bind all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, stipulate that any further subdivisions must be restricted to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only. These restrictions were clearly enumerated in the special warranty deeds provided to the purchasers of Phase 1 homes.\n\nSince the restrictions were part of the original deed and were intended to run with the land, they would generally be enforceable against subsequent owners, including the investor who purchased the remaining 250-acre parcel. The fact that the investor was able to obtain a zoning change does not necessarily override the private deed restrictions, especially if those restrictions were properly recorded and are legally enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the residents of Phase 1 can argue that the construction of a two-level shopping center violates the original deed restrictions and seek an injunction to prevent the commercial development. The court may uphold the deed restrictions over the zoning change if it finds that the restrictions are valid and enforceable covenants running with the land."
