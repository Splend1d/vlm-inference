However, Wellman's actual position is more nuanced.\n\nB. **He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.**\n   - This option implies that Wellman would deny the existence of any right to freedom of movement altogether. This is unlikely given that Wellman acknowledges various rights but argues about their scope and limitations.\n\nC. **He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).**\n   - This option aligns with Wellman's broader philosophical stance. He often discusses how certain rights can be limited or constrained by other considerations, such as the rights of others or societal interests. The example given (marriage) illustrates how rights can be conditional and not absolute.\n\nD. **He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.**\n   - While Wellman does engage in moral reasoning, this option seems less specific to his response regarding the right to freedom of movement. It focuses on a general approach to evaluating public policies rather than directly addressing the nature of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting response from Wellman would be:\n\n**C. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).**\n\nThis option best captures Wellman's nuanced view on rights and their limitations."
