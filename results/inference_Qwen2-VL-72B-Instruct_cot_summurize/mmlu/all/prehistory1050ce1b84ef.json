                    "text": "To determine when Mohenjo-daro developed into a complex urban center, we need to understand the timeline of the Indus Valley Civilization, which includes Mohenjo-daro.\n\nMohenjo-daro is one of the major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The Indus Valley Civilization is divided into several periods:\n\n1. **Early Harappan Period (c. 3300\u20132600 BCE)**: This period marks the beginning of the civilization with small farming villages gradually developing into larger settlements.\n\n2. **Mature Harappan Period (c. 2600\u20131900 BCE)**: During this period, the civilization reached its peak, with the development of large urban centers like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.\n\nGiven these periods, let's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. **during the Early Shang Dynasty, from 1,000 to 400 B.P.**:\n   - The Early Shang Dynasty dates back to around 1600-1046 BCE, which does not align with the timeline of the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nB. **during the Qin Dynasty, from 3,500 to 3,000 B.P.**:\n   - The Qin Dynasty existed from 221 to 206 BCE, which is also too recent for the development of Mohenjo-daro.\n\nC. **during the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P.**:\n   - This period corresponds to approximately 2600-1900 BCE, which is when Mohenjo-daro developed into a complex urban center.\n\nD. **during the Early Harappan period, from 8,500 to 6,000 B.P.**:\n   - This period is much earlier than the development of Mohenjo-daro as an urban center.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. during the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P."
