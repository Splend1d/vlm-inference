The pathogens that cause the diseases are primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nZika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria are all vector-borne diseases, meaning they are spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. This is a common property among these diseases. \n\n- Zika fever is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.\n- West Nile fever is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes.\n- Malaria is primarily transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The pathogens that cause the diseases are primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito."
