Rock material carried deep below Earth's surface results in material melting and rising to the surface.\n\nThis option best explains why volcanoes tend to form along subduction zones because it describes the process of subduction, where one tectonic plate moves beneath another into the mantle. As the subducting plate descends, it heats up and melts, generating magma that rises towards the surface, leading to volcanic activity."
