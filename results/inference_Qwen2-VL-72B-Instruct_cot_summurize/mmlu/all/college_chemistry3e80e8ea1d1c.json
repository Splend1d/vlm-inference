Nuclear binding energies are significantly larger than chemical bond energies. While chemical bonds involve the interaction between electrons and nuclei, nuclear binding energies arise from the strong force that holds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus. The energy involved in nuclear processes is typically on the order of millions of electron volts (MeV), whereas chemical bond energies are generally measured in electron volts (eV). Therefore, nuclear binding energies are much greater in magnitude compared to chemical bond energies."
