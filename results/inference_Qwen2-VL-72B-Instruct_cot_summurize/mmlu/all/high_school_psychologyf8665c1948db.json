In Parkinson's disease, there is a deficiency of dopamine in certain areas of the brain, leading to motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity. In schizophrenia, there is thought to be an excess of dopamine activity in some parts of the brain, contributing to the positive symptoms of the disorder, such as hallucinations and delusions."
