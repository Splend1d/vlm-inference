It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the player's parents will prevail in their wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, we need to consider several legal principles and facts:\n\n1. **Governmental Immunity**: The jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, meaning that the school board can be sued like any other private entity.\n\n2. **Negligence**: For the parents to succeed in a wrongful death claim, they must prove that the coach or the school board acted negligently. Negligence requires showing that there was a duty of care owed to the player, that this duty was breached, and that the breach caused the player's injury or death.\n\n3. **Duty of Care**: Coaches have a duty to ensure the safety of their players during practices and games. This includes taking reasonable precautions to protect them from foreseeable dangers.\n\n4. **Foreseeability**: Lightning strikes during a storm are generally considered foreseeable hazards, especially when the skies darken and heavy rain begins.\n\n5. **Reasonableness**: The coach's decision to continue practice despite the storm needs to be evaluated based on what a reasonable person would do under similar circumstances. If continuing the practice was unreasonable given the known risks, the coach could be found negligent.\n\n6. **Strict Liability**: Strict liability applies to certain activities that are inherently dangerous, regardless of negligence. However, football practice does not typically fall into this category unless there were specific conditions that made it extraordinarily risky.\n\n7. **Act of God**: An \"act of God\" refers to natural events that are unforeseeable and unavoidable. While lightning is a natural event, it is often foreseeable during a storm, so it might not qualify as an \"act of God\" in this context.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.**\n   - Being injured during a school activity does not automatically mean the school or coach is liable. Liability depends on whether there was negligence.\n\nB. **Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.**\n   - Football practice is not typically considered an inherently dangerous activity subject to strict liability.\n\nC. **No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.**\n   - This option hinges on whether continuing the practice was reasonable. Given the storm and the foreseeable risk of lightning, continuing the practice might be deemed unreasonable and thus negligent.\n\nD. **No, because lightning is an act of God.**\n   - As discussed, lightning during a storm is generally foreseeable and does not qualify as an \"act of God.\"\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely scenario is that the coach's decision to continue practice despite the storm could be seen as unreasonable and therefore negligent. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.**\n\nHowever, if the coach's actions are deemed unreasonable and negligent, the parents might prevail. Thus, the final answer considering all factors is:\n\n**C. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.**"
