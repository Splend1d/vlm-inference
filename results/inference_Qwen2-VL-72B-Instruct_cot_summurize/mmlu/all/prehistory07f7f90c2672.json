A landfill where refuse from an entire community has accumulated - This is typically considered a secondary context because the refuse has been transported and deposited in a new location, rather than remaining in its original place.\n\nB. Artifacts, ecofacts, and bone exposed on the ground surface by erosion - This is also a secondary context because erosion has disturbed the original deposition and moved these items to the surface.\n\nC. The existence of a cache or collection of artifacts found where they were left - This is a primary context because the artifacts have remained in the same location where they were originally placed, without being disturbed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The existence of a cache or collection of artifacts found where they were left"
