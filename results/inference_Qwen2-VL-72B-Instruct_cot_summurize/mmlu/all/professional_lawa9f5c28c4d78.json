The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\nB. A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.\nC. The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.\nD. The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n"

It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of felony murder, which holds that participants in a felony can be held responsible for any deaths that occur during the commission of that felony, regardless of whether they directly caused the death or intended it. This doctrine has been upheld by the Supreme Court in various cases, including Tison v. Arizona (1987), where the Court ruled that a defendant could be sentenced to death if they were a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life.\n\nTherefore, the getaway driver's argument that he did not intend to kill and was not present at the scene does not necessarily absolve him of responsibility under the felony murder rule."
