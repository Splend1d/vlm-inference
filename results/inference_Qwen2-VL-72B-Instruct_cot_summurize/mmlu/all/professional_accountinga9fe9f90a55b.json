Since the taxpayer is both the owner of the policy and the person paying the premiums, no gift of property has occurred for gift tax purposes. The designation of beneficiaries does not constitute a taxable gift unless the taxpayer surrenders control over the policy or transfers ownership to the beneficiaries during their lifetime. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Zero."
