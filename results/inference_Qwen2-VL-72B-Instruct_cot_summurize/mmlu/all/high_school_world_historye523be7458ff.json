Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nDuring the time period in which this text was written, who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process during the time period in which Thucydides' text was written, let's analyze the historical context and the passage provided.\n\nThe passage describes the Athenian democracy, emphasizing its principles of equality before the law and the opportunity for advancement based on merit rather than social status or wealth. However, it is important to note that ancient Greek democracies, including Athens, had specific restrictions on who could participate in the political process.\n\nIn ancient Athens:\n- Only male citizens were allowed to participate in the democratic process.\n- Citizenship was typically restricted to adult males who were born to citizen parents (both father and mother).\n- Women, foreigners (metics), and slaves were excluded from citizenship and thus from participation in the democratic process.\n\nGiven these historical facts, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. All adult men born within the geographic boundaries of the state - This option is incorrect because citizenship was not based solely on birthplace but required both parents to be citizens.\n\nB. All adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state - This option is incorrect because women were not allowed to participate in the democratic process.\n\nC. All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth - This option correctly reflects the historical reality that only adult male citizens, typically those born to citizen parents, could participate in the democratic process.\n\nD. All adult men and women who were citizens of the state by birth - This option is incorrect because women were excluded from citizenship and participation in the democratic process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth"
