Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\n\nThe passage from Brown v. Board of Education (1954) indicates that the court ruled against the doctrine of \"separate but equal,\" declaring that segregated educational facilities were inherently unequal and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision had significant implications for civil rights and desegregation efforts. However, it also faced considerable resistance, particularly in the South, where many whites opposed desegregation, leading to social conflicts and delays in implementing the ruling."
