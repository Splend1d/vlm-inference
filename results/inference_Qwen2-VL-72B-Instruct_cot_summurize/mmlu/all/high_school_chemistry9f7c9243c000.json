In this case, we are comparing acids with different numbers of oxygen atoms bonded to the bromine atom.\n\n- HBrO has one oxygen atom.\n- HBrO3 has three oxygen atoms.\n- HBrO2 has two oxygen atoms.\n- HBrO4 has four oxygen atoms.\n\nThe stability of the conjugate base increases with the number of oxygen atoms because oxygen is an electronegative element and can stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base. Therefore, the acid with the most oxygen atoms will have the most stable conjugate base and thus be the strongest acid.\n\nTherefore, the strongest Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid among the given options is:\n\nD. HBrO4"
