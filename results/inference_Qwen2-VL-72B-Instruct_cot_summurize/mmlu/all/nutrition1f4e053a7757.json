                    "text": "To determine which statement about intestinal \"brakes\" and \"accelerators\" is false, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas**\n   - This statement is generally true. Dietary starch can stimulate insulin release, which in turn can affect gastrointestinal motility.\n\nB. **Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion**\n   - This statement is also true. Gastrin is released in response to food in the stomach and stimulates acid secretion by the parietal cells.\n\nC. **Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility**\n   - This statement is true. Short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation in the colon can influence motility patterns in the ileo-caecal region.\n\nD. **The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.**\n   - This statement is not entirely accurate. While the arrival of lipids in the duodenum can slow down gastric emptying and reduce motility as part of the ileal brake mechanism, it does not necessarily cause an immediate switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern. The feeding pattern typically involves increased motility to facilitate digestion and absorption, whereas the ileal brake mechanism slows down motility to allow more time for digestion and absorption.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is:\n\n**D. The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.**"
