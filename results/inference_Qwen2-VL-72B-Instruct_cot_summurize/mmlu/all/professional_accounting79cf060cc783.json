Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nWhen an auditor is testing internal controls, they are looking for evidence that the controls are operating effectively. A voided purchase order that has been properly voided in the normal course of business indicates that the control activity (proper approval before ordering) was likely followed correctly up until the point where the order was voided. Therefore, it would not be necessary to inspect this particular purchase order further as part of the test of controls.\n\nOptions A, C, and D suggest situations where there may be issues with the internal controls or the process itself, such as orders that were never received, orders that were canceled before processing, or orders that were electronically deleted. These situations might indicate problems with the control environment or the effectiveness of the controls, so they would typically not be replaced but rather investigated further."
