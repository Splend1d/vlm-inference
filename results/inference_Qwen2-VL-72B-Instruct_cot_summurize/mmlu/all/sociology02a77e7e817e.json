Income can influence access to resources, lifestyle, and opportunities, which in turn affect an individual's perceived social standing. While factors like occupation and education also play significant roles, income is frequently used as a primary indicator of social status. Age and verbal fluency may contribute to social perceptions but are not typically the primary measures of social status."
