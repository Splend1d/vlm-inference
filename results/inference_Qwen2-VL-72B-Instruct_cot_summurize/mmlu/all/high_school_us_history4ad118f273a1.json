They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

Truman's speech to Congress on March 12, 1947, where he outlined what would become known as the Truman Doctrine. This doctrine was a key component of the United States' foreign policy during the Cold War, emphasizing the need to support free peoples who were resisting subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures. The specific context of the speech was to request financial aid for Greece and Turkey to help them resist communist influence and maintain democratic governments."
