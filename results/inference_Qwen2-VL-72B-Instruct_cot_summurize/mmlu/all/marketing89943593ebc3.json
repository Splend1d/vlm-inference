Question marks.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group (BCG) developed the Growth-Share Matrix, which is a portfolio performance framework used to evaluate an organization's Strategic Business Units (SBUs). In this matrix, SBUs are categorized into four types based on their market growth rate and relative market share:\n\n1. **Stars**: High market growth and high relative market share. These units are positioned for future dominance but require significant investment to maintain their position.\n2. **Cash Cows**: Low market growth but high relative market share. These units generate substantial cash flows due to their dominant market position.\n3. **Question Marks**: High market growth but low relative market share. These units have potential but require careful evaluation to determine if they should be invested in or divested.\n4. **Dogs**: Low market growth and low relative market share. These units typically generate little cash and may not be worth investing in further.\n\nTherefore, the term \"Question marks\" refers to SBUs with high market growth but low relative market share, which aligns with option A. The other terms provided (Quick winners, Charging bulls, Cash outs) do not correspond to the categories in the BCG Growth-Share Matrix."
