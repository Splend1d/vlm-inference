                    "text": "To determine which molecule has the highest normal boiling point, we need to consider the types of intermolecular forces present in each compound. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **CH3CH2CH2CH3 (Butane)**:\n   - Butane is a nonpolar molecule with only London dispersion forces. These forces are relatively weak.\n\nB. **CH3CH2CH2CH2OH (1-Butanol)**:\n   - 1-Butanol contains an alcohol functional group (-OH). Alcohol molecules can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of the hydroxyl group. Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular force.\n\nC. **CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl (1-Chlorobutane)**:\n   - 1-Chlorobutane is a polar molecule due to the presence of the chlorine atom. It will have dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are stronger than London dispersion forces but weaker than hydrogen bonding.\n\nD. **CH3CH2CH2CH2Br (1-Bromobutane)**:\n   - 1-Bromobutane is also a polar molecule due to the presence of the bromine atom. Similar to 1-chlorobutane, it will have dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces. However, bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, so the London dispersion forces in 1-bromobutane might be slightly stronger than those in 1-chlorobutane.\n\nGiven this analysis, the molecule that exhibits the strongest intermolecular forces is 1-Butanol (B), due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore, 1-Butanol is expected to have the highest normal boiling point among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer: B. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH**"
