The \\( p \\) orbital can hold up to six electrons, with each electron having a spin quantum number \\( m_s \\) of either \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nFor the \\( 2p^3 \\) configuration, the three electrons will occupy different orbitals due to Hund's rule, which states that electrons will first fill available orbitals singly and with parallel spins before pairing up. Therefore, the three electrons in the \\( 2p \\) orbitals will have their spins aligned:\n\n- One electron in the \\( 2p_x \\) orbital with \\( m_s = +\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- One electron in the \\( 2p_y \\) orbital with \\( m_s = +\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- One electron in the \\( 2p_z \\) orbital with \\( m_s = +\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nSince all three electrons have the same spin quantum number \\( +\\frac{1}{2} \\), the total spin quantum number \\( S \\) is the sum of these individual spin quantum numbers:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total spin quantum number of the electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 3/2"
