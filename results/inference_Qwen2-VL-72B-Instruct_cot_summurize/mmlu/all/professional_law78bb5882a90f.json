The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750.

The fact that the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control means that the classmate is responsible for the damages, regardless of whether they were directly negligent or not. Since the damage occurred while the car was being used by the classmate, they are liable for the cost of repairs, which is $750. Therefore, the plaintiff (the student) will recover the cost of repairing the car."
