We disturb forests where they quietly exist as a zoonosis\n\nEmerging viruses like Zika and Ebola often arise due to human activities that disrupt natural ecosystems, particularly in forests where these viruses may have been circulating among animals without causing significant harm. When humans encroach on these areas, they come into contact with animals carrying the viruses, which can then spill over into human populations. This is known as a zoonotic transmission. While other factors such as mutation (A) and mosquito vectors (C) play roles in the spread of some viruses, the root cause of many emerging viral outbreaks is the disturbance of habitats where these viruses were previously contained. Vaccines (D) can help control the spread once a virus has emerged, but they do not prevent the initial emergence of the virus."
