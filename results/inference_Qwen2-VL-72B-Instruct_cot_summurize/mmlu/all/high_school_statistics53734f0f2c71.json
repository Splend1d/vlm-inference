We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\n\nThis statement is the most appropriate because it provides a confidence interval based on the sample mean and standard deviation. The confidence interval can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \\pm (t_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean ($155),\n- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation ($32),\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size (100),\n- \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence level and with 99 degrees of freedom, \\(t_{\\alpha/2}\\) is approximately 1.984).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = 1.984 \\times \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} \\approx 1.984 \\times 3.2 \\approx 6.35 \\]\n\nSo the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[ 155 - 6.35 \\text{ to } 155 + 6.35 \\]\n\\[ 148.65 \\text{ to } 161.35 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, this gives us an approximate range of $149 to $161. Therefore, we are 95% confident that the true average donation in November lies within this interval."
