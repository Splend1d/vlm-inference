A rule that causes harm cannot be considered beneficial.\n\nB. **It does not impose unnecessary restrictions.**\n   - This implies that a rule should not place undue limitations on people's actions or freedoms without a justifiable reason. Unnecessary restrictions could hinder well-being and personal autonomy.\n\nC. **It promotes the good of some people.**\n   - This indicates that a rule should contribute positively to the welfare of at least some individuals. If a rule benefits no one, it cannot be deemed good.\n\nGiven these points, a rule that is for the good of human beings would ideally meet all three criteria: it should not be harmful, it should not impose unnecessary restrictions, and it should promote the good of some people.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above.**"
