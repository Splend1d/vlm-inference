Connecticut (1965) established the right to marital privacy, particularly in the context of contraception, while Roe v. Wade (1973) extended the right to privacy to include a woman's decision to have an abortion. Both cases are landmark decisions that expanded the interpretation of the right to privacy under the U.S. Constitution."
