Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nThis statement is correct because replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates, especially refined or simple carbohydrates, can lead to an increase in plasma triglyceride levels while potentially decreasing LDL cholesterol. However, it's important to note that the type and quality of carbohydrates matter significantly. Replacing saturated fats with complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, may have different effects on blood lipids compared to replacing them with simple sugars or refined carbohydrates."
