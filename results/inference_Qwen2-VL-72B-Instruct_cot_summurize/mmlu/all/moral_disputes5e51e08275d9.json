                    "text": "The killing/letting die distinction refers to the ethical debate over whether there is a moral difference between actively causing someone's death and allowing them to die by withholding or withdrawing treatment. If this distinction is considered morally relevant, it suggests that the manner in which death occurs can have ethical implications.\n\nLet's analyze each option to see which one aligns with the idea of a morally relevant distinction similar to killing/letting die:\n\nA. **killing/murder** - This distinction is primarily legal rather than purely ethical. Murder typically involves unlawful killing, whereas killing could be lawful (e.g., self-defense, capital punishment). This distinction does not directly relate to the active/passive nature of causing harm.\n\nB. **physician/patient** - This distinction describes roles within a medical context but does not inherently involve an ethical judgment about the nature of actions taken regarding life and death.\n\nC. **active/passive euthanasia** - This distinction directly relates to the manner in which life is ended. Active euthanasia involves taking deliberate action to end a person's life, while passive euthanasia involves withholding or withdrawing treatment that would otherwise sustain life. This closely mirrors the killing/letting die distinction, as both involve considerations of whether to take an active role in ending life or to allow natural processes to take their course.\n\nD. **involuntary/nonvoluntary euthanasia** - This distinction pertains to whether the person whose life is being ended has consented to the action. Involuntary euthanasia occurs without the person's consent, while nonvoluntary euthanasia occurs when the person cannot give consent (e.g., due to incapacity). This distinction is more about consent and autonomy rather than the active versus passive nature of the act itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, the distinction that most closely aligns with the killing/letting die distinction in terms of its ethical relevance is:\n\n**C. active/passive euthanasia**\n\nThis choice reflects the same ethical consideration of whether an action is taken to cause death or whether death is allowed to occur naturally, paralleling the killing/letting die distinction."
