Higher doses of stimulants are often used to manage hyperactivity and impulsivity in ADHD patients.\n\nC. **Improvements may only be short-lived following treatment.**\n   - This statement is also correct. The effects of stimulants typically last for several hours after administration, and consistent dosing is necessary to maintain therapeutic effects.\n\nD. **A lower dose of the treatment has the effect of improving social behaviors.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Typically, the improvement in social behaviors with stimulant therapy is seen at appropriate therapeutic doses rather than specifically at lower doses. Lower doses might not provide sufficient therapeutic benefit.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\n**D. A lower dose of the treatment has the effect of improving social behaviors.**"
