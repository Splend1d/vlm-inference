He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\n\nDuring fasting periods such as overnight sleep, the body maintains blood glucose levels primarily through glycogenolysis in the liver. The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen, which can be broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream to maintain normal blood sugar levels when dietary intake is not available.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal: While some nutrients may still be absorbed during the early part of the postprandial period, by 12 hours after a meal, most of the nutrients would have been absorbed. Therefore, continued gut absorption is unlikely to be the primary mechanism maintaining blood glucose levels at this time.\n\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle: Skeletal muscle does store glycogen but does not typically release significant amounts of glucose into the bloodstream. Muscle glycogen is primarily used for local energy needs during exercise.\n\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues: Leptin is a hormone that plays a role in appetite regulation and energy balance, but it does not directly contribute to maintaining blood glucose levels. Its primary function is to signal satiety and regulate long-term energy balance rather than immediate glucose homeostasis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration during the 12-hour fast is glycogenolysis in the liver."
