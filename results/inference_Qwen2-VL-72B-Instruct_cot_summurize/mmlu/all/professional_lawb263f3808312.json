To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.\nB. recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.\nC. not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.\nD. not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.\n"

Possessing wild animals, especially dangerous ones like sharks, falls under this category. Therefore, if the neighbor sues based on strict liability, she is likely to recover damages because the resident is responsible for any injuries caused by the shark, even if it was an accidental splash."
