Read a map.\n\nDamage to the left (dominant) hemisphere, which is typically associated with language and logical reasoning functions, would most likely impair abilities related to language processing, such as memorizing vocabulary words (A), constructing a daily schedule (B), and using the process of elimination to answer multiple-choice questions (D). However, reading a map is more closely associated with spatial awareness and navigation skills, which are generally managed by the right hemisphere of the brain. Therefore, unilateral damage to the left hemisphere is least likely to result in an inability to read a map."
