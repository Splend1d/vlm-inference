The local remedies rule aims on the one hand to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts**\n\nThis option captures the essence of the principle of exhaustion of local remedies. It acknowledges that the rule serves multiple purposes: it helps manage the workload of international tribunals by ensuring that they only handle cases that have been adequately addressed or ignored by domestic legal systems (thus restricting the volume of petitions). Additionally, it supports the development and strengthening of local judicial systems by encouraging individuals to seek redress within their own countries first.\n\nWhile options A and B also touch upon important aspects of the rationale\u2014freeing up international tribunals for more serious cases and discouraging abuse of the system\u2014they do not fully encapsulate the comprehensive intent behind the rule as comprehensively as option C does.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights is:\n\n**C.
