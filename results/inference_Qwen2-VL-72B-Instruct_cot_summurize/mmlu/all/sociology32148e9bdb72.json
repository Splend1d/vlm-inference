This approach raises significant ethical concerns because it involves deception, which can violate the trust and autonomy of the individuals being studied. Ethical research typically requires informed consent from participants, meaning they should be aware of the research and agree to participate willingly. Covert observation undermines this principle by keeping the true nature of the interaction hidden from the respondents."
