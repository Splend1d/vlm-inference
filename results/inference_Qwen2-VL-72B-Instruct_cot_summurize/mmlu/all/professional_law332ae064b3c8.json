After a few days of picketing, the school board seeks a temporary injunction in the state court to restrain further picketing of the school board. The school board insists that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. Section 101 reads as follows:\"Section 101. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. \"The court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, because the teachers unionfailed to follow the procedure outlined in theordinance.\nB. grant relief, because the ordinance isconstitutional.\nC. deny relief, because the picketing ordinancewas unconstitutional on its face.\nD. deny relief, because the ordinance does notprovide procedural due process.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Ordinance**: \n   - Section 101 requires that no picketing can occur near public elementary and secondary schools without the express permission of the mayor.\n   - This permission must be sought at least three days before the picketing begins and must include details about the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing.\n\n2. **Teachers Union's Actions**:\n   - The teachers union did not seek permission from the mayor before starting their picketing activities.\n\n3. **Legal Considerations**:\n   - The school board is seeking a temporary injunction based on the violation of this ordinance.\n   - The court will need to evaluate whether the ordinance itself is constitutional and if it was properly followed.\n\n4. **Constitutionality of the Ordinance**:\n   - The ordinance restricts picketing near schools, which could potentially infringe upon free speech rights protected under the First Amendment.\n   - However, courts often allow reasonable restrictions on time, place, and manner of speech if they serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.\n\n5. **Procedural Due Process**:\n   - The ordinance requires prior permission, which is a common requirement for ensuring public safety and order.\n   - The requirement of filing an application three days in advance is a reasonable time frame for the city to review and respond.\n\nGiven these considerations, the court will likely focus on whether the ordinance is constitutional and if the teachers union followed the required procedures. Since the teachers union failed to obtain the necessary permission, the court may find that the picketing violates the ordinance.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**A. grant relief, because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the procedural violation by the teachers union, which is the primary basis for the school board's request for a temporary injunction."
