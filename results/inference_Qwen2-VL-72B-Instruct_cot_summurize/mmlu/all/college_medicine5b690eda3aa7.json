Higher than the pOH.\n\nFor a very weak base, its concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in solution will be very low because it does not dissociate much. The pOH is defined as -log[OH-], so a very low concentration of OH- means a high pOH value.\n\nThe pKb of a base is related to its strength; a weaker base has a higher pKb value. For a very weak base, the pKb will be significantly greater than 7 (since pKw = pKa + pKb and for water at 25\u00b0C, pKw = 14), which means the pKb will be higher than the pOH.\n\nTherefore, for a very weak base, the pKb would likely be higher than the pOH."
