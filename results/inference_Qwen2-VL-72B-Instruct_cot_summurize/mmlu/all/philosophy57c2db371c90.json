According to Moore, when he says \"pleasure is good,\" he is making a claim about the intrinsic value of pleasure, not about its desirability or pleasantness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Pleasure is desired.\"\nThis option suggests that pleasure is something people want or crave. However, Moore's statement is about the intrinsic goodness of pleasure, not about whether it is desired by individuals.\n\nB. \"Pleasure is pleasant.\"\nThis option implies that pleasure feels good or is enjoyable. While this might be true, it does not capture the essence of Moore's claim about the intrinsic value of pleasure.\n\nC. \"We desire to desire pleasure.\"\nThis option suggests a recursive desire for pleasure, which is more complex than Moore's straightforward assertion about the intrinsic goodness of pleasure.\n\nD. None of the above.\nGiven that none of the options accurately captures Moore's idea that \"pleasure is good\" refers to the intrinsic value of pleasure, this seems to be the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nD. None of the above."
