Providing a thin sheet can help the mother-in-law stay cool and comfortable.\n- There is no indication that this action harms anyone or violates any moral principles.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- During an exam, the main character asks for permission to go to the bathroom, goes to the bathroom, and then returns to finish the exam.\n- This action appears to follow proper protocol by asking for permission before leaving the exam room.\n- There is no indication that this action compromises the integrity of the exam or violates any academic honesty rules.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
