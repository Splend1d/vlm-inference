The defendant, who only had $8. 00 in his possession, saw that the game he wanted was selling for $10. 00 Realizing that he did not have enough money to pay for the game, he ripped the $10. 00 price tag off the box. While no one was looking, the defendant then took the $7. 00 sticker from another game and placed it on the box. He then purchased the game for $7. 00 and walked out of the store. Which one of the following crimes may the defendant be convicted of?\n\nA. False pretenses.\nB. Larceny.\nC. Deceit.\nD. Conversion.\n"

This scenario best fits the crime of **false pretenses**.\n\nFalse pretenses is a crime where an individual obtains property or services by making false statements or representations with the intent to defraud. In this case, the defendant intentionally altered the price tag to mislead the store about the true cost of the game, thereby obtaining the game for less than its actual price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. False pretenses."
