Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.\n\nWhen performing substantive tests related to the granting of stock options to senior management, an auditor would typically trace the authorization for these options back to the board of directors' approval. This is because the board of directors is responsible for approving such significant transactions, and ensuring that this approval has been obtained is a key part of verifying the legitimacy and appropriateness of the stock option grants.\n\nOption A (confirming with management) and Option B (verifying the existence of option holders in payroll and HR records) may be part of the audit process but are not the primary focus of substantive testing for the authorization of stock options. Option D (reviewing public records of the SEC) might be relevant for compliance with reporting requirements but does not directly address the internal authorization process."
