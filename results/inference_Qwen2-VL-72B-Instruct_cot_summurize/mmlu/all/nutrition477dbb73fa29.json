Unlike water-soluble vitamins (such as Vitamin C), which are excreted in urine when consumed in large amounts, fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamin A can build up to toxic levels over time. Excessive intake of Vitamin A can lead to hypervitaminosis A, which can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, blurred vision, bone pain, and even liver damage. Therefore, it is important to consume Vitamin A within the recommended daily allowance to avoid potential health risks."
