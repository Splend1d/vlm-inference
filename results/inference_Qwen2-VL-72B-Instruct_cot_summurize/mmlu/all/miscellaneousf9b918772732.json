Five feet - This is closer to the correct length but still not accurate.\nC. Twelve feet - This is a reasonable estimate and aligns with typical anatomical measurements.\nD. Twenty feet - This is too long for the large intestine.\n\nThe large intestine, also known as the colon, typically measures around 12 feet (3.6 meters) in length in an adult human.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
