The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty.\nB. not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.\nC. not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.\nD. not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the appropriate response to this scenario, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identification of the Passenger**: The cab driver recognizes the passenger as a former girlfriend.\n2. **Invitation Inside**: The passenger invites the cab driver into her house.\n3. **Sexual Advances**: The cab driver makes sexual advances towards the passenger.\n4. **Passenger's Response**: The passenger responds by kissing him and holding his hand.\n5. **Phone Call Interruption**: The passenger gets up to answer the phone in the kitchen.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider the legal implications:\n\n- **Entrapment**: Entrapment occurs when law enforcement officers induce someone to commit a crime that they would not have otherwise committed. In this case, the passenger (an undercover police officer) did respond to the cab driver's advances by kissing him and holding his hand, which could suggest inducement.\n  \n- **Predisposition**: For entrapment to be a valid defense, the defendant must demonstrate that they were not predisposed to commit the crime. If the cab driver had a history or inclination towards committing such acts, it might weaken the entrapment defense.\n\n- **Alibi Defense**: An alibi defense would involve proving that the cab driver was somewhere else at the time of the alleged crime. However, the scenario does not provide any information suggesting that the cab driver has an alibi.\n\nBased on the provided details, the most relevant consideration here is whether the cab driver can argue that he was entrapped by the undercover officer. Since the passenger reciprocated his advances initially, it could be argued that the officer induced the behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.**"
