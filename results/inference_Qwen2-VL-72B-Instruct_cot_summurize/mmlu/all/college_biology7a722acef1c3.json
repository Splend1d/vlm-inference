C (Cytosine) pairs with G (Guanine)\n2. G (Guanine) pairs with C (Cytosine)\n3. A (Adenine) pairs with T (Thymine)\n4. T (Thymine) pairs with A (Adenine)\n5. T (Thymine) pairs with A (Adenine)\n6. G (Guanine) pairs with C (Cytosine)\n\nSo, the complementary sequence is: 3\u2032 GCT AAC 5\u2032\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the complementary sequence in the same orientation as the original sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032), we need to reverse the order:\n\nThe final complementary sequence is: 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032"
