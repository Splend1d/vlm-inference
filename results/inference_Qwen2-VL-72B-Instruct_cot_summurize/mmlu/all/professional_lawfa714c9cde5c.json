Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine whether the surviving wife can enforce the automatic reverter clause, we need to analyze the nature of the clause and its enforceability under common law principles.\n\n1. **Automatic Reverter Clause**: The clause states that if the property is mortgaged or encumbered during the lifetime of either grantor, the property will automatically revert to the grantors, their heirs, or assigns.\n\n2. **Restraint on Alienation**: A restraint on alienation is a restriction placed on the ability to transfer property. Generally, such restraints are disfavored by courts because they limit the free transfer of property.\n\n3. **Reasonableness of Restraint**: Courts often evaluate the reasonableness of such restraints. If the restraint is deemed unreasonable, it may be unenforceable.\n\n4. **Blood Relation and Mutual Agreement**: The fact that the grantors and the grantee are blood relatives does not necessarily make the restraint more enforceable. The key issue is whether the restraint is reasonable.\n\n5. **Surviving Wife's Rights**: Since the husband has passed away, the surviving wife is the only remaining grantor. If the clause is enforceable, she would have the right to enforce it.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A (No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation)**: This option suggests that the clause is unenforceable due to being an unreasonable restraint on alienation. However, without specific details about the reasonableness, this cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n- **Option B (No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable)**: This option categorically states that automatic reverters are unenforceable. This is not universally true; the enforceability depends on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.\n\n- **Option C (Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual)**: While blood relation might be a factor in some jurisdictions, it is not a sufficient condition alone to enforce the restraint.\n\n- **Option D (Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation)**: This option implies that the restraint is reasonable and thus enforceable. Given that the clause is triggered by a specific event (mortgage or encumbrance) and is limited to the lifetime of the grantors, it could be seen as a reasonable restraint.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the specific conditions outlined in the clause and the general principle that such clauses can be enforceable if they are reasonable."
