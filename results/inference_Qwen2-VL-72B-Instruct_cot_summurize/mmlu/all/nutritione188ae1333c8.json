Palmitic acid.\n\nGluconeogenesis is the metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as amino acids, lactate, and glycerol. Palmitic acid, being a fatty acid, cannot serve as a direct substrate for gluconeogenesis because it is not converted into glucose in the body. Instead, fatty acids like palmitic acid are primarily used for energy production through beta-oxidation."
