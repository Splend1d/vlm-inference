The larger and denser particles will sediment at the bottom of the tube, while smaller and less dense particles will remain suspended in the supernatant.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **DNA and mRNA**: DNA is much larger than mRNA. However, both are not typically separated using low-speed centrifugation because they are not particulate structures that would sediment under these conditions.\n\nB. **Nuclei and secretory vesicles**: Nuclei are large and dense compared to secretory vesicles. Low-speed centrifugation can effectively separate nuclei from smaller organelles like secretory vesicles.\n\nC. **Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**: Both the Golgi apparatus and ER are membranous structures with similar densities and sizes. They would not be easily separable by low-speed centrifugation.\n\nD. **Lysosomes and endosomes**: Lysosomes and endosomes are both small vesicular structures with similar densities. They would not be easily separable by low-speed centrifugation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Nuclei and secretory vesicles**"
