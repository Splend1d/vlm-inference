In his political philosophy, particularly in \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" without some form of social contract. Individuals agree to surrender some of their freedoms to a sovereign authority in exchange for protection and order. Thus, breaking this contract or failing to abide by its terms constitutes injustice."
