However, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.1 to 1.8 suggests that the true RR could be anywhere between 1.1 and 1.8. Since the CI does not include 1 (which would indicate no difference), we can conclude that the observed increase in risk is statistically significant.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate conclusion is:\n\nD. Statistically significant overall increase in risk"
