However, if the trees were on your own property and you had the right to use them as you see fit, this action might not be considered morally wrong.\n- Without additional context about ownership and permissions, it is difficult to definitively label this action as morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: While visiting the Louvre, I touched many of the paintings.**\n- Touching artwork in museums, especially famous ones like the Louvre, is generally prohibited due to the risk of damage to the art. This action is typically seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful.\n- According to ordinary moral standards, touching artworks in a museum without permission is considered wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**\n\nThis choice reflects that Scenario 1 may not necessarily be wrong without further context, while Scenario 2 is clearly considered wrong."
