                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of Mulholland's argument about how privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers.\n\nA. **flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets**\n   - This option suggests that privatization led to increased bureaucracy and less flexibility due to detailed daily worksheets. However, this does not directly address the core change in the relationship between companies and managers.\n\nB. **the state had greater control than managers over production processes**\n   - This option implies that after privatization, the state maintained or increased its control over production processes. This contradicts the general idea of privatization, which typically involves reducing state control and increasing managerial autonomy.\n\nC. **ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers**\n   - This option suggests a shift in ownership structure where senior managers gained more ownership at the expense of small shareholders. While this could be a consequence of some privatization efforts, it doesn't directly describe the change in the relationship between companies and managers regarding their roles and responsibilities.\n\nD. **employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment**\n   - This option indicates that after privatization, employment became more performance-based rather than relying on traditional factors like trust and commitment. This aligns with the idea that privatization often introduces market-oriented practices, making performance metrics more critical for employment stability.\n\nGiven Mulholland's focus on how privatization altered the dynamics within companies, particularly emphasizing performance metrics and accountability, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**D. employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment**"
