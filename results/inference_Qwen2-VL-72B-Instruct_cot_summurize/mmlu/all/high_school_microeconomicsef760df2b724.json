This concept is central to understanding the downward-sloping demand curve in economics, which reflects the law of demand: as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is influenced by consumers' willingness to pay less for additional units of a good because each subsequent unit provides less additional satisfaction."
