Altman's perspective suggests that certain types of harm are more relevant when justifying speech codes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **causal harm** - This refers to direct harm caused by actions or words, such as physical violence or tangible damage.\n\nB. **expressive harm** - This involves harm caused by the expression of ideas or opinions, often related to psychological or emotional distress.\n\nC. **both causal and expressive harm** - This option combines both types of harm, suggesting a comprehensive approach.\n\nD. **auxiliary harm** - This term is not commonly used in discussions about speech codes and seems less likely to be the focus of Altman's justification.\n\nGiven that speech codes are typically concerned with regulating speech to prevent harm, it makes sense that justifications would consider both the direct (causal) and indirect (expressive) impacts of speech on individuals and communities.\n\nTherefore, the best prospects for success in justifying speech codes according to Altman would involve considering both causal and expressive harm.\n\nThe final answer is:\nC. both causal and expressive harm"
