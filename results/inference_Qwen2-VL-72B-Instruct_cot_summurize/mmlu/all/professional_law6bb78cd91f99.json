Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\nC. No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable.\nD. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.\n"

                    "text": "The driver's statement can be analyzed within the context of legal rules regarding evidence admissibility, particularly focusing on hearsay exceptions.\n\n1. **Hearsay Rule**: Generally, out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted are considered hearsay and are inadmissible unless they fall under one of the recognized exceptions.\n\n2. **Admission by a Party Opponent**: Under this exception, statements made by a party opponent (the driver in this case) are admissible against that party. However, the driver\u2019s statement is not being used against him but rather against the first and second guys.\n\n3. **Statement Against Interest**: This exception allows for the admission of statements that are against the declarant's own interest. The driver's statement could potentially be seen as against his interest if it implicates him in the theft, but it primarily serves to exonerate himself by shifting blame to others.\n\n4. **Conspiracy Exception**: Statements made by co-conspirators during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy are admissible against all conspirators. However, the driver's statement was made after he was caught for another crime, which may not be considered part of the conspiracy or in furtherance of it.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A** (\"Yes, as an admission by a party opponent\") does not apply since the statement is not being used against the declarant (the driver).\n- **Option B** (\"Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants\") is not accurate because the statement is not inherently against the interest of the other defendants; it shifts blame onto them.\n- **Option C** (\"No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable\") is incorrect because the reliability of a statement is not solely determined by whether it was made in custody.\n- **Option D** (\"No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay\") is the most accurate. The statement was made after the driver was caught for another crime, which likely means it was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the original conspiracy involving the theft of the painting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.**"
