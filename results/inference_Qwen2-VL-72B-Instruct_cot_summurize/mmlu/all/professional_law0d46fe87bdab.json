                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a child was injured by a motorcyclist, and the child's mother is testifying about a conversation she had with the motorcyclist at the hospital. The motorcyclist reportedly said, \"Don't worry, my insurance company will pay for all of your son's medical expenses.\"\n\nTo determine the admissibility of this statement, we need to consider the rules of evidence, particularly regarding hearsay and its exceptions.\n\n1. **Hearsay Rule**: Generally, out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted are considered hearsay and are inadmissible unless they fall under an exception.\n\n2. **Exception for Admissions by Party Opponent**: One such exception is the admission by a party opponent. Statements made by a party to the litigation (in this case, the motorcyclist) can be admitted against them if they are offered by the opposing party (the child's mother).\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A: Admissible, on the issue of the defendant's negligence** - This option suggests that the statement could be used to prove the defendant's negligence. However, the statement about insurance coverage does not directly relate to the issue of negligence (i.e., whether the motorcyclist was at fault for the accident). Therefore, it would not be admissible for this purpose.\n\n- **Option B: Admissible, to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses** - This option implies that the statement could be used to demonstrate the defendant's financial ability to cover the medical expenses. While this might be relevant in some contexts, it is generally not a proper use of evidence in a negligence lawsuit.\n\n- **Option C: Inadmissible, because the testimony was highly prejudicial** - This option suggests that the statement should be excluded because it is prejudicial. However, the statement itself does not appear to be unduly prejudicial; it simply indicates the motorcyclist's intention to have their insurance cover the expenses.\n\n- **Option D: Admissible, only to prove ownership or control of the motorcycle** - This option implies that the statement could be used to establish ownership or control of the motorcycle. However, the statement about insurance coverage does not directly relate to proving ownership or control of the motorcycle.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Option B: Admissible, to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the statement about insurance coverage is relevant to the defendant's ability to pay for the medical expenses, which could be a pertinent issue in the context of the lawsuit."
