They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . .\n\"It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of the excerpt from Ronald Reagan's First Inaugural Address:\n\n1. **Context**: The excerpt is from Reagan's inaugural address, where he discusses the economic challenges facing the country and his views on the role of government.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - Reagan mentions that the economic problems have been building for decades and will take time to resolve.\n   - He emphasizes that \"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,\" indicating a belief in reducing the size and influence of the federal government.\n   - He also stresses the importance of recognizing the distinction between federal powers and those reserved to the states or the people, suggesting a desire to limit federal overreach.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo.**\n   - This option suggests a critique of political leaders' efforts regarding social and economic issues. While Reagan does mention economic challenges, there is no explicit criticism of racial issues or a call for more action against the status quo in this excerpt.\n\nB. **The United States had relied too heavily on military solutions and needed to pursue a more isolationist foreign policy.**\n   - This option focuses on foreign policy and military reliance. There is no mention of foreign policy or military solutions in the excerpt provided.\n\nC. **Religious leaders had become too assertive in governmental policy and had blurred the separation of church and state.**\n   - This option addresses the role of religion in government. There is no discussion about religious leaders or the separation of church and state in the excerpt.\n\nD. **Liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.**\n   - This option aligns with the conservative view that liberal policies and moral decline were detrimental to the country. Although the excerpt does not explicitly mention liberal laws or moral decline, it does express a critical stance towards government intervention, which could be seen as a broader critique of liberal policies.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most fitting option is:\n\n**D. Liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.**\n\nThus, the final answer is D."
