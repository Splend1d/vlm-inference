As exercise continues, the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose levels. This process helps to prevent a significant drop in blood glucose concentration, even during prolonged exercise. Therefore, the blood glucose concentration typically remains relatively unchanged during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise."
