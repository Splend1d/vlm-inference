Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 24%\nB. 44%\nC. 64%\nD. 84%\n\nWithout specific data or context provided, it's challenging to definitively choose an answer. However, based on general trends and typical perceptions of corruption in many countries, higher percentages might be more plausible.\n\nGiven that corruption is often perceived as widespread in many developing nations, options C (64%) and D (84%) seem more likely than A (24%) or B (44%).\n\nSince there isn't enough information to make a precise determination, let's assume that a significant portion of the population perceives political parties as corrupt. Therefore, the most reasonable choice would be:\n\nC. 64%"
