                    "text": "To determine the correctness of each statement, let's analyze them individually:\n\n### Statement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\nThis statement is related to the concept of the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) in statistics. According to the Gauss-Markov theorem, under certain conditions (linearity, no perfect multicollinearity, zero conditional mean, homoscedasticity, and independence of errors), the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for linear regression is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). This means that among all linear unbiased estimators, OLS has the smallest variance.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\nAdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier. In AdaBoost, each weak classifier is assigned a weight (\u03b1) based on its performance. The weights are adjusted iteratively so that classifiers that perform well receive higher weights, while those that perform poorly receive lower weights.\n\nThe \u03b1 values in AdaBoost are indeed calculated as logarithms of the ratio of the error rate to one minus the error rate, which inherently results in non-negative values. Specifically, the formula for calculating \u03b1 is:\n\\[ \\alpha_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_t}{\\epsilon_t} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( \\epsilon_t \\) is the weighted error rate of the t-th weak classifier. Since the natural logarithm of a fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator is positive, and the factor of 1/2 does not change the sign, \u03b1 will always be non-negative.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is True**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe final answer is:\nA. True, True"
