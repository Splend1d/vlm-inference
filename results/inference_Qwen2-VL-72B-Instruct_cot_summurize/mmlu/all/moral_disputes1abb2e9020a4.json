Mill argues that some pleasures are inherently superior to others, even if they provide less quantity of pleasure. For example, he suggests that intellectual pleasures are generally more valuable than mere physical pleasures. Therefore, the value of a pleasure depends on both how much pleasure it provides and the type of pleasure it is."
