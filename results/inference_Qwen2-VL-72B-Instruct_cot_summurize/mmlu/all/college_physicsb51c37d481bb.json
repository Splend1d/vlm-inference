This means that at temperatures much lower than the Fermi temperature (which is typically very high), the electrons occupy quantum states up to the Fermi level, and their distribution is governed by the Fermi-Dirac statistics. As a result, even at room temperature, the average kinetic energy of the conduction electrons is much higher than kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. This is because the electrons' energies are determined by quantum mechanical effects rather than by thermal agitation."
