Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet.\nB. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\nC. Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily.\nD. Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes.\n"

Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\n\nWhile haemoglobin levels are an important indicator of iron status, they can be influenced by numerous factors beyond just iron deficiency. Conditions like chronic diseases, infections, inflammation, and certain medications can affect haemoglobin levels independently of iron status. In contrast, specific indices like serum ferritin and transferrin receptors are more directly related to iron stores and transport, making them more reliable indicators of iron status when used appropriately."
