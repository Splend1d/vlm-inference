It is to be set by the hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.\"\nIbn Sina (Avicenna), On Medicine, ca. 1020 C.E.\nThe two passages on medicine illustrate which of the following cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600\u20131450 C.E.?\n\nA. The influence of Mesoamerican science on Europeans through systems of trade and navigation\nB. The influence of Chinese science on Islamic civilizations through European immigration to Islamic lands\nC. The influence of Egyptian science on the Byzantines through European scholars\nD. The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars\n"

The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars\n\nBoth sources provided in the question are from the medieval period and reflect the transmission of medical knowledge. Paul of Aegina was a Byzantine physician who lived in the late seventh century C.E., and his work reflects the continuation of Greek medical traditions. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) was a Persian polymath who lived in the eleventh century C.E. and was influenced by Greek philosophy and medicine, particularly the works of Hippocrates and Galen.\n\nDuring the period of 600\u20131450 C.E., there was significant cultural exchange between the Byzantine Empire, Islamic civilizations, and Europe. Byzantine scholars preserved and translated many ancient Greek texts, including medical treatises, which were then further disseminated and built upon by Islamic scholars like Avicenna. These works were later transmitted back to Europe during the Middle Ages, influencing European medicine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it accurately describes the historical context and the flow of scientific knowledge from Greek origins, through Byzantine and Islamic scholars, and ultimately to Europe."
