If patient has an artificial heart valve.\n\nAntibiotics may be used prophylactically before certain procedures, including catheterization, in patients with certain conditions that put them at higher risk of developing infections, such as those with prosthetic heart valves. This is because the procedure can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, which could potentially lead to an infection in the heart valve. However, it's important to note that antibiotic prophylaxis should be carefully considered and prescribed by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's needs and risks. It is not standard practice to use antibiotics prophylactically for all catheterizations or based solely on patient request."
