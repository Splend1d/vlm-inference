However, the environments are very similar except that some ponds contain predatory fish, while others do not. In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation ponds, another body type is favored\u2014one that is well-suited to swim for long periods of time.\n\nA. Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolation.\nB.

Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation.\n\nExplanation: The scenario describes how populations of mosquito fish became isolated due to the separation of ponds, which is a form of allopatric speciation. Over time, different selective pressures (predation levels) led to divergent evolutionary changes in body shape, which could potentially lead to reproductive isolation if these differences prevent interbreeding between populations from high and low predation ponds."
