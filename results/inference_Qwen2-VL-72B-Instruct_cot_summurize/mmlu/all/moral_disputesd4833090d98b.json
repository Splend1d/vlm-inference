Soufan has been vocal about the effectiveness of non-torture methods in obtaining valuable intelligence.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting option based on Soufan's likely testimony would be:\n\n**C. Successful interrogation may not require torture.**\n\nThis aligns with Soufan's known advocacy for non-coercive interrogation methods and his criticism of torture practices."
