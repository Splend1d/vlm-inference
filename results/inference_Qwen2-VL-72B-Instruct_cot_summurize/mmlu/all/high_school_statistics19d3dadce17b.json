                    "text": "To determine which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour (60 minutes), we need to calculate the probability for each company using their respective means and standard deviations. We'll use the Z-score formula to standardize the values and then find the corresponding probabilities from the standard normal distribution table.\n\n### Company I:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 50 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 10 minutes\n\nWe want to find \\( P(X \\geq 60) \\).\n\nFirst, calculate the Z-score for 60 minutes:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table, the probability of a Z-score being less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability of a fuse lasting longer than 60 minutes is:\n\\[ P(X \\geq 60) = 1 - P(Z < 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\n### Company II:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 55 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 5 minutes\n\nAgain, we want to find \\( P(X \\geq 60) \\).\n\nCalculate the Z-score for 60 minutes:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 55}{5} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1 \\]\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table again, the probability of a Z-score being less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability of a fuse lasting longer than 60 minutes is:\n\\[ P(X \\geq 60) = 1 - P(Z < 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \\]\n\nBoth companies have the same probability of 0.1587 (or approximately 0.159) that a fuse will last at least 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159"
