The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

This decision aligns with their resolution criteria.\n\n2. **Removal of Religious Symbols**: The church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms used by the students, ensuring that the educational environment is secular.\n\n3. **Exemption of Main Chapel**: The main chapel remains untouched and is not used for educational purposes, thus maintaining a clear separation between religious activities and public education.\n\n4. **Compelling State Interest**: The city faced an urgent need to find an alternative facility due to the destruction of the high school. This necessity can be considered a compelling state interest.\n\n5. **Entanglement with Religion**: The key issue here is whether the arrangement constitutes excessive entanglement with religion. The removal of religious symbols and the exclusion of the main chapel from educational use suggest efforts to minimize such entanglement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these points, the arrangement appears to be designed to avoid advancing or inhibiting religion while addressing the city's urgent need for a suitable facility. The church's agreement to remove religious symbols and the exclusion of the main chapel from educational use indicate a reasonable effort to maintain a secular environment.\n\nTherefore, the judgment would likely favor:\n\n**A. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.**\n\nThis option best reflects the city's actions in ensuring that the use of the church for educational purposes complies with constitutional requirements by minimizing religious influence in the educational setting."
