By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nMax Weber, in his sociological analysis, addresses the \"England problem\" by highlighting specific aspects of the English legal system that were conducive to the rise of modern capitalism. He emphasizes the role of rational-legal authority and the bureaucratic organization of the state in England, which provided a stable framework for economic activities. Additionally, he notes the importance of the English common law tradition, which allowed for greater flexibility and adaptability in legal practices compared to the more rigid civil law systems found on the continent. This adaptability was crucial in supporting the growth of capitalist enterprises."
