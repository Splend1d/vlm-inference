Menopause typically occurs around the same age range for most women, regardless of their birth cohort.\n\nB. **A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex**\n   - This could potentially be influenced by cohort differences. For example, older cohorts might have different cultural attitudes towards sexuality and discussing sexual dreams compared to younger cohorts.\n\nC. **A higher proportion of older men are bald**\n   - Balding is generally an age-related condition that affects men as they get older. While there may be some genetic or environmental influences, it is predominantly an age-related change.\n\nD. **A higher proportion of older men and women are victims of cancer**\n   - Cancer incidence increases with age due to cumulative exposure to carcinogens and other risk factors over time. This is primarily an age-related phenomenon.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is more likely to be influenced by cohort differences rather than just age is:\n\n**B. A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex**\n\nThis choice suggests that cultural or generational factors might play a role in how people from different cohorts perceive and report on their dreams related to sex."
