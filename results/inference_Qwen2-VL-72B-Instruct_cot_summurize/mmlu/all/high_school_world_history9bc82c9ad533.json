The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following statements about ancient cities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph?\n\nA. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.\nB. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.\nC. Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.\nD. Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.\n"

                    "text": "Let's analyze the passage step by step to determine which statement is most supported by the discussion of Uruk.\n\n1. **Identify the key points in the passage:**\n   - The passage describes Uruk as having a \"great rampart\" and a \"wall of the sacred Eanna temple.\"\n   - It mentions that the \"outer walls\" of Uruk gleam with brilliance and that the \"inner wall\" is unparalleled.\n   - There is a specific reference to the Eanna temple, described as the \"dwelling place of Ishtar,\" indicating it is a place of worship.\n   - The passage also notes that Uruk has sections designated for the city, garden, field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar.\n\n2. **Analyze each option:**\n\n   **A. Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack.**\n   - This option contradicts the passage, which emphasizes the strength and grandeur of Uruk\u2019s walls and ramparts, suggesting effective fortifications.\n\n   **B. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.**\n   - The passage specifically mentions the Eanna temple, the dwelling place of Ishtar, indicating an area dedicated to worship. This supports the idea that ancient cities had places for religious activities.\n\n   **C. Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways.**\n   - The passage describes the Eanna temple as having a brilliance that no subsequent king or living man could equal, implying elaborate decoration rather than modesty.\n\n   **D. Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies.**\n   - While the passage does describe various sections of Uruk, there is no mention of areas designated for military training.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The passage provides strong evidence for the existence of areas dedicated to worship within ancient cities, particularly through the detailed description of the Eanna temple.\n\nTherefore, the statement most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph is:\n\n**B. Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.**"
