The situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required\n\nIncorporating customary international law, including customary crimes, into domestic law such as English law, typically requires some form of legislative action. While there might be debates and varying interpretations, it is generally understood that for customary international law to have effect within a country's legal system, it often needs to be codified through legislation or other formal legal processes. This ensures clarity and consistency within the domestic legal framework."
