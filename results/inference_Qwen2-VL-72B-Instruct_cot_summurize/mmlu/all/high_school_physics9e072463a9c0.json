Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong. If a myopic person has a prescription of -5 diopters, what image do her corrective lenses create for distant objects?\n\nA. An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes\nB. An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes\nC. An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes\nD. An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand how corrective lenses work for myopia and how they affect the image formation.\n\n1. **Understanding Myopia**: In myopia (nearsightedness), the eye focuses light in front of the retina instead of on it, making distant objects appear blurry. This is due to the eye being too long or the cornea being too curved.\n\n2. **Corrective Lenses for Myopia**: A negative diopter value indicates a concave lens, which diverges light rays. For a myopic person with a prescription of -5 diopters, the corrective lenses will help by spreading out the light rays so that they focus correctly on the retina.\n\n3. **Image Formation by Concave Lenses**: Concave lenses produce virtual images that are upright and smaller than the object. The image is formed on the same side of the lens as the object, which means it appears to be behind the lens.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- A concave lens (negative diopter) produces an upright, virtual image.\n- The image is formed on the same side of the lens as the object, meaning it appears to be behind the lens.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes**\n\nThis option correctly describes the nature of the image produced by the corrective lenses for a myopic person."
