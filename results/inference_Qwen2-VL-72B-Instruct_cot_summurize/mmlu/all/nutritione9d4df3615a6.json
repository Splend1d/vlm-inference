One of its key roles is in the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate, which is an important step in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). This process is crucial for the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. The other options listed involve different vitamins or cofactors and do not describe functions of biotin."
