These standards provide a framework for evaluating the quality of educational and psychological tests and their accompanying materials. They outline the principles that should guide the development, use, and interpretation of these assessments. The standards do not provide specific lists of approved tests or detailed legal requirements but rather offer a set of criteria to assess the appropriateness and fairness of testing practices."
