He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n"

We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis is because the confidence interval for the difference between the proportions (male minus female) is given as (\u20130.23, \u20130.18), which indicates that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays is higher than the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays. The negative values in the interval suggest that the proportion of men is greater when you subtract the proportion of women from it."
