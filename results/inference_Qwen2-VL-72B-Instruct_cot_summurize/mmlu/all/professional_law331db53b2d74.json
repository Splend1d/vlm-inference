A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.\n- This is correct. In a wholly executory contract, neither party has started to perform their obligations.\n\nB. A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n- This is also correct. In a partially executed contract, one party has fulfilled their obligations, while the other party still owes performance.\n\nC. An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.\n- This is correct. An executed contract means all obligations have been met by both parties.\n\nD. A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.\n- This is not entirely accurate. A partially executed contract typically implies that one party has fully performed while the other has not, rather than just beginning performance.\n\nTherefore, the least correct statement is:\n\nD. A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance."
