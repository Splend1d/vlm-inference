For attempted murder, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had the specific intent to kill.\n- Given the reckless nature of the defendant's actions, it is plausible that he did not have the specific intent to kill the woman.\n\n**Option D: Not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle.**\n- Losing control of the vehicle does not negate the possibility of intent. It merely describes the mechanism of the accident.\n- The key issue remains whether the defendant had the specific intent to kill.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.**\n\nThis answer focuses on the critical element of intent required for a conviction of attempted murder, which appears lacking based on the provided information."
