You can never prove your theory to be correct only \u201cyet to be proven wrong\u201d.\n\nIn science, a theory is considered valid if it has not been disproven through rigorous testing and experimentation. Even after numerous experiments and observations support a theory, it remains open to further testing and potential falsification. This approach is based on the principle of falsifiability, which was introduced by philosopher Karl Popper. According to this principle, for a theory to be scientific, it must be possible to devise an experiment or observation that could potentially disprove it.\n\nSo, even if you and many others have tested the hypothesis and found evidence supporting it, your theory can never be definitively proven correct; it can only remain \"yet to be proven wrong\" as more evidence accumulates and further tests are conducted."
