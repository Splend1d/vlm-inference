The question states that the charge of each ball remains unchanged, and only the mass of one of the balls is doubled. However, it is important to note that the electric force depends only on the charges and the distance between the charges, not on their masses.\n\nSince neither the charges nor the distance between the balls changes, doubling the mass of one ball does not affect the electric force between them. Therefore, the new electric force remains the same as the initial force.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 50 \u03bcN"
