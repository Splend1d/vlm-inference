In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?\n\nA. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nB. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nC. Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\nD. Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine how the assets are distributed upon Bill's death, we need to consider several key points:\n\n1. **Prenuptial Agreement**: Kathy executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill.\n\n2. **Deed Conveying the Condominium**: After the honeymoon, Bill signed and delivered a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety.\n\n3. **Bill's Will**: The will devises the pasture land to Tommy and the condominium to Julie, with all other assets passing equally to Tommy and Julie.\n\n4. **Surviving Lineal Descendants**: Tommy and Julie are Bill's surviving lineal descendants.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.**\n- This option suggests that Kathy retains the condominium despite the prenuptial agreement. However, the prenuptial agreement explicitly states that Kathy relinquishes all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. Therefore, this option does not fully account for the prenuptial agreement.\n\n**Option B: Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.**\n- This option correctly acknowledges the prenuptial agreement and the will's provisions. It states that Tommy receives the pasture land (as per the will), Julie gets the condominium (also per the will), and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate (as per the will).\n\n**Option C: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.**\n- This option incorrectly assumes that Kathy retains the condominium despite the prenuptial agreement. Additionally, it misinterprets Bill's original intent regarding the distribution of assets.\n\n**Option D: Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.**\n- This option incorrectly applies the concept of a pretermitted spouse. A pretermitted spouse is one who marries the testator after the execution of the will and is not provided for in the will. Kathy is not a pretermitted spouse because she was married before the will was executed and had a prenuptial agreement. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.**"
