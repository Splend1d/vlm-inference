At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n"

The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Fixed-Ratio Schedule**: This refers to the schedule where a reward is given after a specific number of desired behaviors (in this case, getting above a 90% on three quizzes in a row). This type of schedule tends to produce high and steady rates of behavior because the reward is predictable and consistent.\n- **Variable-Interval Schedule**: This refers to the schedule where a reward is given after an unpredictable amount of time has passed since the last reward (in this case, giving stickers at the end of each day for showing up on time). This type of schedule can maintain behavior over long periods but may not be as effective in increasing the frequency of the desired behavior as quickly or consistently as a fixed-ratio schedule.\n\nIn the context of the teacher's observation, the students' performance on quizzes improved significantly because the reward system for quizzes followed a fixed-ratio schedule, which is known to be very effective in increasing the frequency of the desired behavior. On the other hand, tardiness only decreased slightly because the reward system for punctuality followed a variable-interval schedule, which is less effective in quickly increasing the frequency of the desired behavior."
