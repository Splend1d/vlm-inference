This nonlinearity is due to the complex behavior of magnetic domains within the material. As the applied field increases, the magnetization initially rises rapidly as domains align with the field, but then it levels off as more and more domains become saturated. This behavior can be described by a hysteresis loop, which shows that the magnetization depends not only on the current value of the applied field but also on its history. Therefore, the correct answer is B. non linearly."
