Just after A.D. 1000 - This places the florescence in the late 11th century, which aligns well with the known timeline of the Ancestral Puebloan culture.\n\nC. Before A.D. 1000 - This would be too early for the peak of the Ancestral Puebloan culture.\n\nD. 2,000 years ago - This would place the florescence around 100 CE, which is also too early.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
