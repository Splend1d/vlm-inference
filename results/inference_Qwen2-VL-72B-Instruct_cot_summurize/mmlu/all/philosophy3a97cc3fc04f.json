He acknowledges that this position might be true in the sense that we cannot definitively prove anything with absolute certainty. However, he also argues against Academic Skepticism by suggesting that some beliefs are so foundational and self-evident (like the existence of one's own mind) that they cannot reasonably be doubted. Thus, while Augustine recognizes the potential truth of Academic Skepticism, he ultimately rejects it as a viable philosophical stance."
