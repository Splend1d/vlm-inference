We mean to be a part of it\u2014we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon, and the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.\u2026 We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.\n\u2014John F. Kennedy, September 12, 1962\nKennedy's speech can best be compared to which of the following?\n\nA. Dwight Eisenhower's speech on the \"military-industrial complex\"\nB. George Washington's Farewell Address\nC. Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\nD. Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Arsenal of Democracy\" speech\n"

Kennedy's speech aimed to inspire the American people to commit to the ambitious project of landing a man on the moon, while Roosevelt's \"Arsenal of Democracy\" speech called for the United States to become a major producer of war materials to support the Allied forces during World War II. Both speeches emphasized the importance of unity, determination, and national effort to achieve a common objective."
