A buyer recently purchased an undeveloped beachfront lot in the jurisdiction. He hired a building contractor to construct a new house on the property. Thereafter, the contractor employed a subcontractor to provide on-site maintenance. The contractor contracted with a cement company to supply concrete for the foundation of the structure. After excavation started, an employee of the cement company delivered a load of concrete to the construction site. To facilitate delivery, the contractor and the subcontractor had built an access ramp extending from the street to the lot. As the employee was driving over the ramp, it suddenly collapsed and caused the truck to overturn, seriously injuring the employee. A subsequent investigation determined that the contractor and the subcontractor negligently used substandard materials in constructing the ramp. In addition, the employee was partially at fault for driving while intoxicated. The employee brought suit against the contractor and the subcontractor to recover damages for his injuries. A special trial was held on the issue of negligence, and it was adjudged that each party was contributorily negligent as follows:PARTY DEGREE OF NEGLIGENCEPlaintiff: (the EE) 40%Defendant: (the contractor) 35%Defendant: (the subcontractor) 25%The employee, who suffered damages in the amount of $100,000, brings a personal injury action against the contractor individually. He will most likely\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\nB. recover $100,000.\nC. recover $55,000.\nD. recover $35,000.\n"

Since the employee was found to be 40% at fault, his total damages of $100,000 would be reduced by 40%, leaving him eligible to recover 60% of the damages.\n\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\text{Total Damages} \\times (1 - \\text{Employee's Degree of Negligence}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$100,000 \\times (1 - 0.40) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$100,000 \\times 0.60 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Recovery} = \\$60,000 \\]\n\nHowever, since the employee is suing only the contractor, who was adjudged to be 35% at fault, the contractor's share of the liability must also be considered. The contractor's share of the total damages is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Contractor's Share} = \\text{Total Damages} \\times \\text{Contractor's Degree of Negligence} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Contractor's Share} = \\$100,000 \\times 0.35 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Contractor's Share} = \\$35,000 \\]\n\nGiven that the employee can only recover up to the contractor's share of the liability, the maximum amount the employee can recover from the contractor is $35,000. However, considering the employee's own negligence reduces his total recoverable amount to $60,000, the actual amount he can recover from the contractor is limited to $35,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. recover $35,000."
