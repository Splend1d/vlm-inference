I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our Alms-Houses. . . .\n\"If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.\n\"I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!\"\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature\" (1843)\nDorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of which of the following?\n\nA. Social Darwinism.\nB. The Second Great Awakening.\nC. Second-wave feminism.\nD. The Christian Science movement.\n"

The Second Great Awakening.\n\nDorothea Dix's advocacy for the humane treatment of the mentally ill and her efforts to reform the conditions in which they were kept reflect the influence of the Second Great Awakening. This religious revival emphasized personal salvation, moral reform, and social activism, inspiring many to work for social causes such as the abolition of slavery, temperance, and the improvement of mental health care. Dix's passionate plea for the rights and dignity of the mentally ill is consistent with the spirit of the Second Great Awakening."
