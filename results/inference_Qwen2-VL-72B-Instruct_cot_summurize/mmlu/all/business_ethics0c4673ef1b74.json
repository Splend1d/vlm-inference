By granting them options to buy shares at a predetermined price in the future, senior managers have an incentive to increase the share price, which benefits both themselves (through the potential gain on the options) and the shareholders (through increased share value). This approach helps to ensure that senior management's decisions are geared towards improving the company's financial performance and shareholder returns."
