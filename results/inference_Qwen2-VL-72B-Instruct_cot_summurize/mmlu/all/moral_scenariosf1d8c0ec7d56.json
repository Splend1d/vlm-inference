There is no indication that this action causes harm or violates any moral standards. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character uses online forums to find women to date.\n  \nUsing online forums to find potential romantic partners is a common practice and does not inherently involve any morally wrong actions. It is a socially accepted way of meeting people and forming relationships. Therefore, this action is also not considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios do not involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
