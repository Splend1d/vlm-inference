Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion\n\nIncreasing the total surface area available for diffusion would enhance the rate at which a gas diffuses between the alveoli of the lung and the blood within a pulmonary capillary. This is because diffusion occurs more efficiently across a larger surface area, allowing more gas molecules to move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas: A smaller partial pressure gradient would actually decrease the rate of diffusion, as diffusion is driven by the difference in concentration (partial pressure) between two regions.\n\nB. Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water: Lower solubility means that fewer gas molecules can dissolve into the liquid medium (in this case, blood), thereby reducing the rate of diffusion.\n\nD. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary: Slower blood flow would reduce the efficiency with which gases are transported away from the alveoli, thus decreasing the overall rate of diffusion.\n\nTherefore, increasing the total surface area available for diffusion is the best option to increase the rate of gas diffusion between the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillary."
