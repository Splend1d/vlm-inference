Most organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms.\n\nWhile it is true that most organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms, this fact does not directly relate to why TMS is chosen as a reference for 1H NMR spectroscopy. The primary reasons for using TMS as a reference include its 1H spectrum being a singlet (A), its protons being quite strongly shielded (B), and its ability to dissolve in most organic solvents (C). These properties make TMS an ideal internal standard for measuring chemical shifts in proton NMR spectra."
