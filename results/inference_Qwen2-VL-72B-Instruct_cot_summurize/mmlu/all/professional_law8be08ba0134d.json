The title search revealed an open mortgage from a previous owner to a local bank. It was recorded 25 years ago. The mortgagor could not be found and the bank lost its records. The purchase agreement gave the seller 90 days extra in such a situation to clear title by bringing a quiet title action. The seller did not follow that provision and went to settlement with the bad title and demanded more extra time to file a quiet title action. The buyer decided not to wait and demanded her down payment be returned and that the deal be rescinded. Will litigation most likely favor the buyer's position?\n\nA. Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\nB. No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\nC. Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\nD. No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n"

Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\n\nThe key point here is that the seller had a specific obligation under the purchase agreement to convey good and marketable title and was given an additional 90 days to clear any title issues through a quiet title action if necessary. By failing to follow this procedure and instead demanding more extra time at the settlement, the seller breached the terms of the agreement. This breach provides grounds for the buyer to demand the return of their down payment and rescission of the deal."
