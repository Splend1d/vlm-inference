It could be considered a harmless prank within a family context.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character pours sand on the campfire before leaving.\n- Pouring sand on a campfire can be dangerous because it may not fully extinguish the fire, leading to potential wildfires or other hazards. This action is generally considered irresponsible and potentially harmful to the environment and public safety.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
