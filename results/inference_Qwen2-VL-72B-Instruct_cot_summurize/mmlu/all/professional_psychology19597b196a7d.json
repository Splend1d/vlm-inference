This phenomenon is often referred to as the \"mean world syndrome,\" where viewers come to believe that the world is more dangerous than it actually is based on what they see in media portrayals. Therefore, people who frequently watch TV shows with violent content may overestimate the likelihood that they will become victims of violence."
