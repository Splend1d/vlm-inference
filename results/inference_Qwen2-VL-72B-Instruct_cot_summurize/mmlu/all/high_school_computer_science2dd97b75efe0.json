However, it does not involve multiple factors for authentication, so it is not an example of multifactor authentication (MFA). Multifactor authentication typically involves at least two of the following categories: something you know (like a password), something you have (like a token or a smartphone), and something you are (like a biometric characteristic such as a fingerprint)."
