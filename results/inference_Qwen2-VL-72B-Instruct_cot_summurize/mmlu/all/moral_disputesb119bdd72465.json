                    "text": "To determine which option Sarah Fine's \"internal critique\" of Wellman's argument targets, let's analyze each option in the context of Wellman's views on immigration and freedom of association.\n\n1. **Option A: We have an absolute right to freedom of association (i.e., one that cannot be outweighed by anything else).**\n   - This option suggests an absolute right to freedom of association, which is a strong claim. However, Wellman's arguments typically involve balancing rights and interests rather than asserting absolute rights.\n\n2. **Option B: Freedom of association implies that a legitimate state has a presumptive right to exclude anyone from its territory.**\n   - This aligns closely with Wellman's views. He argues that states have a presumptive right to control their borders based on the principle of freedom of association. This is a central part of his argument.\n\n3. **Option C: Immigration is harmful to low-income Americans.**\n   - While this might be a concern discussed in broader debates about immigration, it is not a direct claim made by Wellman regarding the legitimacy of state exclusion.\n\n4. **Option D: Egalitarianism is a Marxist doctrine.**\n   - This statement is not directly related to Wellman's arguments about immigration or freedom of association.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant target for Sarah Fine's internal critique would be Wellman's claim that freedom of association implies that a legitimate state has a presumptive right to exclude anyone from its territory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Freedom of association implies that a legitimate state has a presumptive right to exclude anyone from its territory.**"
