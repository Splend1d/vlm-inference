The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n"

Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nIn this scenario, the owner has demonstrated that the neighbor's planned construction would significantly interfere with her ability to enjoy her solar-heated residence by blocking her access to daily sunlight. This interference can be considered a private nuisance if it unreasonably affects the owner's use and enjoyment of her property. The fact that the neighbor's plans conform to local building ordinances and land use regulations does not necessarily preclude a finding of nuisance, especially if an alternative placement of the house would avoid such interference. Therefore, the appellate court may consider reversing the trial court's decision based on the principle of private nuisance."
