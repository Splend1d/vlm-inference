Moore's claim suggests that for the statement \"pleasure is good\" to have meaning, there must be a specific relationship between pleasure and goodness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Goodness and pleasure are the same thing.**\n   - This implies that if something is good, it is also pleasurable, and vice versa. This would mean that pleasure and goodness are identical concepts.\n\nB. **Good is something different than pleasure.**\n   - This suggests that goodness and pleasure are distinct concepts. If they are different, then saying \"pleasure is good\" might not make sense because they are separate entities.\n\nC. **All good things are pleasant.**\n   - This means that every instance of something being good also involves it being pleasurable. However, this does not necessarily imply that pleasure itself is good.\n\nD. **All pleasant things are good.**\n   - This means that every instance of something being pleasant also involves it being good. This aligns with the idea that pleasure inherently possesses goodness.\n\nGiven Moore's claim, the correct interpretation should be one where pleasure inherently possesses goodness, making the statement \"pleasure is good\" meaningful.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All pleasant things are good.**"
