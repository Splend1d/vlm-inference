The loaves were to be delivered on the first day of each week, with payment to be made within four days of delivery. For the first four weeks, the bakery delivered loaves to the supermarket and the supermarket made the appropriate payments. When the fifth delivery arrived, the supermarket discovered that the shipment contained 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves. The manager of the supermarket immediately called the bakery to complain about the shipment. The operator of the bakery apologized and offered to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours. What is the probable legal effect of the operator's conversation with the manager with regard to the fifth shipment?\n\nA. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and cancel their contract.\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\nC. The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure. \"\nD. The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n"

The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure.\"\n\nIn commercial transactions, particularly those governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States, there is a concept known as \"cure.\" If a seller delivers non-conforming goods, they may have an opportunity to cure the defect by delivering conforming goods within a reasonable time. In this case, the bakery operator has offered to send the missing 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours, which is a reasonable attempt to cure the defective delivery.\n\nTherefore, the supermarket would not be entitled to reject the entire shipment outright or cancel the contract based solely on this incident, provided the bakery fulfills its promise to deliver the correct loaves within the agreed timeframe."
