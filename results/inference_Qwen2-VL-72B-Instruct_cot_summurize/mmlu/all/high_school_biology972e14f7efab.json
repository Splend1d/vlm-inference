This is a significant difference between the two.\n\nD. **secretes a matrix**:\n   - Both cartilage and bone secrete a matrix, so this is not a distinguishing feature.\n\nGiven this analysis, the major difference between cartilage and bone is that cartilage lacks blood vessels and nerves.\n\nThe final answer is C."
