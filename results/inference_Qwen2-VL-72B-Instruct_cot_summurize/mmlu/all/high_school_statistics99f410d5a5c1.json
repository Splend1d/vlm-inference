About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.\n\nThis means that if you were to repeat the poll many times, each time selecting a new random sample of Americans, about 95% of those polls would have results that fall within 3.2 percentage points above or below the true approval rating of the president. In other words, the true approval rating has a 95% probability of being somewhere between 39.8% and 46.2%."
