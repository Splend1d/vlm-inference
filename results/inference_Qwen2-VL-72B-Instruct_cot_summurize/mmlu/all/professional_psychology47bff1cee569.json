Ecological assessment\n\nAn ecological assessment is an evaluation method that focuses on understanding how various factors within an individual's environment (both physical and social) influence their behavior and development. This approach typically involves direct observation of the person in their natural settings, such as at home, school, or work, to gather comprehensive information about the context in which their behaviors occur.\n\nHere\u2019s why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA): While FBA also involves observing behavior, its primary focus is on identifying the specific functions or purposes behind particular behaviors rather than examining the broader environmental influences.\n\nB. Work Sample: This refers to a type of assessment where individuals are asked to complete tasks similar to those they would perform in a job setting. It is more task-oriented and less focused on the environmental context.\n\nC. Norm-referenced Test: This type of assessment compares an individual's performance to a standardized normative group. It does not involve direct observation of behavior in natural settings but rather relies on standardized testing procedures."
