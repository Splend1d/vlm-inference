The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is commonly used for such adjustments.\n\n   Using the CPI, the inflation adjustment factor from 1950 to 2011 can be calculated as follows:\n   - CPI in 1950: Approximately 24.1\n   - CPI in 2011: Approximately 224.9\n\n   The adjustment factor is calculated by dividing the later year's CPI by the earlier year's CPI:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{\\text{CPI in 2011}}{\\text{CPI in 1950}} = \\frac{224.9}{24.1} \\approx 9.33\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the real GDP per capita in 2011 prices:**\n   Multiply the nominal GDP per capita in 1950 by the adjustment factor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Real GDP per capita in 2011 prices} = 1600 \\times 9.33 \\approx 14928\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider PPP adjustment:**\n   Adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP) involves comparing the cost of living across different countries. Since we are focusing on the U.S. and adjusting within the same country, the PPP adjustment would not significantly alter the result because it primarily compares costs between different countries.\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950, adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, is approximately $14,928.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. About $3k\nB. About $8k\nC. About $15k\nD. About $30k\n\nThe closest option is:\n\nC. About $15k"
