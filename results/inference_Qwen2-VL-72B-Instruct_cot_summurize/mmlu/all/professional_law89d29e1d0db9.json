The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?\n\nA. The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\nB. The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.\nC. The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.\nD. The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.\n"

The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\n\nThis option highlights the principle of promissory estoppel, where the carpenter took action (incurred time and expense in preparing the bid) based on the general contractor's promise, and it would be unfair not to honor that promise now that the conditions have been met (the carpenter submitted the lowest bid and the general contractor won the main contract). This reliance by the carpenter can serve as a basis for enforcing the agreement between them."
