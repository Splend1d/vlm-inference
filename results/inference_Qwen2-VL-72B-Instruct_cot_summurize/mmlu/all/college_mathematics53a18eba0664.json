Let's compute:\n\\[ B - 2I = P^{-1}AP - 2I \\]\nUsing the property of similarity, we can rewrite this as:\n\\[ B - 2I = P^{-1}(A - 2I)P \\]\nThus, \\( A - 2I \\) and \\( B - 2I \\) are indeed similar matrices. So, Statement I is true.\n\n### Statement II: \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have the same trace.\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. For similar matrices, the trace is preserved. That is:\n\\[ \\text{tr}(B) = \\text{tr}(P^{-1}AP) = \\text{tr}(AP) = \\text{tr}(A) \\]\nTherefore, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have the same trace. So, Statement II is true.\n\n### Statement III: \\( A^{-1} \\) and \\( B^{-1} \\) are similar matrices.\nIf \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are similar, then:\n\\[ B = P^{-1}AP \\]\nTaking the inverse on both sides:\n\\[ B^{-1} = (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P \\]\nThis shows that \\( A^{-1} \\) and \\( B^{-1} \\) are also similar matrices. So, Statement III is true.\n\nSince all three statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I, II, and III"
