African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA\n\nThe Nation of Islam, founded by Wallace Fard Muhammad in 1930, primarily appealed to African-Americans who felt marginalized and excluded from mainstream American society. The organization emphasized black nationalism, self-sufficiency, and the belief that African-Americans should establish their own communities and businesses. It also promoted a distinct interpretation of Islam that resonated with many African-Americans seeking empowerment and identity in the face of racial discrimination."
