Compare AVC to MR.\n\nIn the short run, a competitive firm should compare its average variable cost (AVC) to the market price (which is also the marginal revenue, MR, for a perfectly competitive firm). If the price is below the AVC, the firm should shut down immediately because it cannot even cover its variable costs and would incur additional losses by continuing to operate. If the price is above or equal to AVC, the firm should continue operating in the short run, as it can at least cover its variable costs and contribute to covering some of its fixed costs."
