Let's analyze each option to determine why an unexamined life cannot be a virtuous life according to Socrates:\n\nA. **Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.**\n   - This option suggests that ignorance about virtue can lead to others perceiving someone as virtuous. However, this does not address the core idea that self-examination is necessary for true virtue.\n\nB. **Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.**\n   - While this option acknowledges Socrates' philosophical perspective, it doesn't explain why an unexamined life cannot be virtuous. It merely states a preference without providing a reason.\n\nC. **Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.**\n   - This option directly addresses the necessity of understanding the reasons behind one's actions. Without examining these reasons, one cannot determine if their actions are justified or if they should be repeated, which is crucial for leading a virtuous life.\n\nD. **Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.**\n   - This option suggests that societal norms dictate virtue, but it does not fully capture the essence of Socratic philosophy, which emphasizes personal reflection and examination rather than mere conformity to external standards.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most compelling explanation for why an unexamined life cannot be a virtuous life according to Socrates is:\n\n**C. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.**\n\nThis option aligns with Socrates' emphasis on the importance of self-examination and understanding the justifications for one's actions, which are fundamental to leading a virtuous life."
