She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?\n\nA. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR\nB. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier\nC. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype\nD. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained\n"

The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained.\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is typically caused by mutations in both alleles of the CFTR gene. While the presence of a single detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele suggests that the patient may be a carrier or have a form of CF, it does not fully explain her clinical phenotype without knowing the status of the second allele. Genetic testing for only the 36 most common mutations might miss other less common or rare mutations that could be present on the second allele, contributing to her symptoms."
