On one hand, it enhanced the idea of American exceptionalism by positioning the United States as the \"leader of the free world\" against communism. This role reinforced the belief in America's unique mission to spread democracy and freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, the global extension of American power during the Cold War also challenged some core assumptions of exceptionalism. The pursuit of containment policies sometimes led to interventions that contradicted American ideals of democracy and self-determination, such as supporting authoritarian regimes or engaging in covert operations. This tension between ideals and actions complicated the narrative of American exceptionalism."
