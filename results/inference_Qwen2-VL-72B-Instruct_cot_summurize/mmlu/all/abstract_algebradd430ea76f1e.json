                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, let's analyze each one individually:\n\n### Statement 1: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (1) in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. The characteristic of an integral domain is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot 1 = 0 \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists, the characteristic is said to be 0.\n\n- **Example**: The ring of integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) has characteristic 0 because there is no positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\cdot 1 = 0 \\).\n- **General Property**: An integral domain with characteristic 0 cannot have a finite number of elements. This is because if it were finite, then by the pigeonhole principle, some multiple of 1 would have to repeat, implying a non-zero element multiplied by itself gives zero, contradicting the definition of an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\nThe characteristic of an integral domain being prime means that the smallest positive integer \\( p \\) such that \\( p \\cdot 1 = 0 \\) is a prime number.\n\n- **Example**: The field \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\) (integers modulo \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is prime) is an integral domain with characteristic \\( p \\).\n- **General Property**: An integral domain with prime characteristic \\( p \\) must be finite. This is because the structure of such a domain is essentially \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\), which consists of exactly \\( p \\) elements.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **True**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
