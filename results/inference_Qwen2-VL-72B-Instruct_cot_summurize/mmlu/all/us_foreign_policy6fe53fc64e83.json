However, this is not accurate because the US continued to expand its influence through both territorial acquisitions and market expansion.\n\nB. **US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865**\n   - This statement implies that after 1865, the emphasis shifted from acquiring new territories to expanding economic markets. This aligns with historical trends where the US began to focus more on economic influence and trade, especially in Asia and Latin America.\n\nC. **US expansion was limited to Latin America post-1865**\n   - This statement is incorrect because US expansion post-1865 was not limited to Latin America. The US expanded its influence globally, including in Asia (e.g., the Philippines), the Pacific (e.g., Hawaii), and other regions.\n\nD. **US expansion ended after 1865**\n   - This statement is false because the US continued to expand territorially and economically well beyond 1865.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**B. US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865**\n\nThis reflects the shift in focus from territorial expansion to economic and market expansion following the Civil War."
