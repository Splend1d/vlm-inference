However, taking personal photos for private use is generally not considered morally wrong unless explicitly prohibited by the terms of borrowing the book. In most everyday situations, this would not be seen as a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character copied answers from a book during a closed book test at school.\n\nThis action is a clear case of academic dishonesty. Cheating on a test is widely regarded as morally wrong because it violates principles of fairness, honesty, and integrity. It undermines the educational process and can have serious consequences for both the individual and others involved.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
