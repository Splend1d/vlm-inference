There were indeed two or more related but geographically separate hominid species during this period that evolved from earlier African hominids. This is supported by the presence of multiple lineages such as Homo ergaster/erectus in Africa and Asia, and possibly other species like Homo heidelbergensis in Europe.\n\nB. Hominids dating from this time can be grouped into different species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. This is also true, as different regions had their own distinct hominid populations that evolved independently to some extent.\n\nC. All of the hominids that evolved from Homo habilis and predate Homo sapiens belong in a single, geographically widespread but morphologically diverse species known as Homo erectus. This view is held by some researchers who propose a broad definition of Homo erectus that includes various regional variants.\n\nTherefore, all three statements reflect different perspectives and interpretations based on the fossil record and morphological analysis of hominids from this period."
