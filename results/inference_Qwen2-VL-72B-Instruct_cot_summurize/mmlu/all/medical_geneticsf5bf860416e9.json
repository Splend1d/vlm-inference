Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nFemale pseudohermaphroditism refers to a condition where an individual with XX chromosomes (genotypically female) has external genitalia that appear more masculine than typical for females. This can be caused by various conditions, but one common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In CAH, there is an enzyme deficiency in the adrenal glands that leads to increased production of androgens, which can masculinize the external genitalia of a female fetus during development.\n\n- A. Androgen insensitivity: This condition affects males who have XY chromosomes but are resistant to androgens, leading to undermasculinization rather than pseudohermaphroditism.\n- B. Campomelic dysplasia: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities and can affect sexual differentiation, but it is not specifically associated with female pseudohermaphroditism.\n- D. Klinefelter syndrome: This is a condition affecting males who have at least two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome, leading to undermasculinization but not pseudohermaphroditism."
