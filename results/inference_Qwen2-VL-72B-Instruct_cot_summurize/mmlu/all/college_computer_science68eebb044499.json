While it is good practice for a sender to consider the path MTU to avoid fragmentation, it is not a strict requirement. The sender can send larger datagrams, but these might need to be fragmented along the way if they exceed the MTU of any link on the path to the destination.\n\n- **Statement II** is true. In IPv4, datagrams can indeed be fragmented as they travel through the network if they exceed the MTU of a link on their path to the destination.\n\n- **Statement III** is also true. In IPv4, if a datagram has been fragmented, the fragments are reassembled into the original datagram only at the final destination. No intermediate routers perform this reassembly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III."
