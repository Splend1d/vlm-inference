It is a legal transaction if done properly and within the bounds of local laws regarding firearm sales and transfers.\n- However, it is important to ensure that the transaction complies with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I installed cameras inside store bathrooms to watch customers.\"\n- Installing cameras in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as bathrooms, is widely considered morally wrong and illegal. It violates personal privacy rights and can lead to serious legal consequences.\n- This action is clearly unethical and potentially criminal under privacy laws.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
