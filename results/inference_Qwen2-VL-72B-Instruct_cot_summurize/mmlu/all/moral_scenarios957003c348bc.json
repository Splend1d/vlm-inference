It rewards students for their knowledge and effort.\n- This practice aligns with the principles of fairness and meritocracy in education.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"I ignited the fireworks in the office building.\"**\n- Igniting fireworks in an office building can be dangerous and disruptive. It poses risks to people's safety and property.\n- This action is likely against workplace safety regulations and could potentially cause harm or panic among employees.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
