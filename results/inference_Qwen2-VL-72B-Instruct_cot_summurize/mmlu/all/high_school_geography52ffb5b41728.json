However, many African cities struggle with urban planning and infrastructure, leading to overcrowding and poor living conditions in some areas.\n\nB. **There are jobs for most rural-to-urban migrants.**\n   - This statement implies that African cities can absorb the influx of people moving from rural areas by providing sufficient employment opportunities. In reality, many African cities face high unemployment rates and struggle to create enough jobs for their growing populations.\n\nC. **They have three separate business districts.**\n   - This statement suggests a level of urban planning and development that might not be typical across most African cities. While some larger cities may have multiple business districts, it is not a common characteristic of most African cities.\n\nD. **They have a well-developed infrastructure.**\n   - This statement indicates that African cities generally have robust infrastructure, including roads, utilities, and public services. However, many African cities suffer from inadequate infrastructure, which affects daily life and economic development.\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the statements perfectly fit as a characteristic of most African cities. However, if we consider the relative accuracy and commonality, the closest would be:\n\n**D. They have a well-developed infrastructure.**\n\nWhile this is not entirely accurate for all African cities, it is more likely to be true compared to the other options, which describe scenarios that are less common or often inaccurate. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n**D. They have a well-developed infrastructure.**"
