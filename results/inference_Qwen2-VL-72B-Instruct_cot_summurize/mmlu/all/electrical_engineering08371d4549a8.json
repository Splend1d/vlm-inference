Since the conductor is positively charged and the ground is negatively charged, the electric field lines will be directed from the conductor towards the ground. The electric field strength is inversely proportional to the distance from the conductor, so it will be strongest at the surface of the conductor that is closest to the ground. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Lower surface of the conductor."
