A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD. The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n"

The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n\nIn constitutional law, when a plaintiff challenges an ordinance as unconstitutional on its face, the burden typically falls on the plaintiff to show that there is no rational basis for the regulation. This is especially true when the regulation pertains to economic activities, which are generally subject to broad state regulatory powers under the police power doctrine. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance lacks any rational relationship to a legitimate state interest, such as public health, safety, or welfare. In this case, the plaintiff would need to argue that the ordinance does not reasonably relate to improving the quality of rental housing, which is a legitimate state interest."
