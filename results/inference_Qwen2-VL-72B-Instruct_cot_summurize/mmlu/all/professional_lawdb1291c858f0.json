As part of their agreement, a courier was hired to pick up the card from the dealer and transport it to the collector. The courier was then to get the purchase money from the collector and bring it back to the dealer. But rather than entrusting the genuine card to the courier, the dealer gave him a counterfeit replica that was valueless. After picking up the envelope containing the replica, the courier left the dealer's home and embarked on his trip. The police, however, received a tip concerning the scheme and intercepted the courier's car before he left the city limits. Thereafter, the dealer was arrested and charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.

This could suggest a more organized and deliberate attempt to defraud, which might not help the dealer's argument that the scheme did not progress far enough.\n\n2. **Option B: The courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery.**\n   - If the courier is an innocent agent hired by the dealer, it suggests that the dealer alone was responsible for the scheme. This could potentially support the dealer's argument that the scheme was not sufficiently advanced because the courier, who was supposed to deliver the counterfeit card, was unaware of the deception.\n\n3. **Option C: The courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery.**\n   - This option is less plausible since the collector was the intended victim and would have no reason to hire a courier for such a purpose. It also does not align well with the facts presented.\n\n4. **Option D: It makes no difference whether the courier was the dealer's accomplice or was an innocent agent.**\n   - This option disregards the potential impact of the courier's role and knowledge on the dealer's defense strategy.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Option B** is the most advantageous for the dealer. By claiming that the courier was an innocent agent hired by the dealer, the dealer can argue that the scheme did not progress far enough because the key intermediary (the courier) was unaware of the fraudulent intent.\n\nFinal answer: **B. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery.**"
