At first, she had decided to use a random sample of 15 observations. But her teacher asked her to take 35 observations. The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations?\n\nA. There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations.\nB. There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\nC. There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations.\nD. There is some advantage.

Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be narrower than that using 15 observations.\n\nExplanation: When estimating a population parameter such as the mean, increasing the sample size generally leads to a more precise estimate. This precision is reflected in the width of the confidence interval. A larger sample size reduces the standard error of the estimate, which in turn results in a narrower confidence interval. Therefore, even though the means and standard deviations were approximately the same for both sample sizes, the confidence interval for the larger sample (35 observations) would be narrower than that for the smaller sample (15 observations), providing a more precise estimate of the population mean."
