He believed that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve happiness through the fulfillment of our natural inclinations and duties, which ultimately leads to the contemplation of God. Pleasure, therefore, is seen as a secondary benefit that arises from engaging in these activities rather than something to be pursued for its own sake."
