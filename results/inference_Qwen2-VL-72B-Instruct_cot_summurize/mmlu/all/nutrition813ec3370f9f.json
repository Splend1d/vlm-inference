Negative calcium balance and bone mineral loss\n\nHigher dietary sodium intake can lead to increased urinary calcium excretion, which may result in a negative calcium balance and potentially contribute to bone mineral loss over time. This is because the kidneys work to maintain a balance between sodium and calcium, and when sodium intake is high, more calcium is excreted in the urine to help maintain this balance. This increased calcium excretion can lead to a decrease in bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures if not compensated for by adequate calcium intake or other factors that promote bone health."
