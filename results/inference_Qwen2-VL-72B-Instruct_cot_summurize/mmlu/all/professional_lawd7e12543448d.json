The owner, as his First Amendment rights were indeed breached.\nB. The city, because they have a right to regulate offensive activities.\nC.

The city, because it does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\n\nCourts generally uphold zoning regulations that restrict the location of adult businesses if such regulations leave open reasonable alternative avenues for communication. In this case, the city ordinance requires that adult establishments be located in industrial zones, which suggests that there are still opportunities for the owner to operate their business elsewhere within the city. Therefore, the court is likely to find that the ordinance does not violate the owner's First Amendment rights because it does not completely prevent the owner from communicating or conducting their business."
