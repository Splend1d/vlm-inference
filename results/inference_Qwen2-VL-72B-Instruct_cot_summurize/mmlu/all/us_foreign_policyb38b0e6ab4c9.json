An opportunity to use to collapse of the Soviet Union to extend US power\n\nCharles Krauthammer, an American syndicated columnist, political commentator, and author, coined the term \"unipolar moment\" in 1990 to describe the period following the end of the Cold War. He argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union had left the United States as the sole superpower, creating a unique opportunity for the U.S. to exert its influence and shape the international order. This concept emphasized the temporary nature of this unipolar situation, suggesting that it was not guaranteed to last indefinitely due to the potential rise of new powers or shifting global dynamics."
