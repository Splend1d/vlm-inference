Genetic transformation will actually strengthen the bond between parent and child.\n- This option suggests a positive outcome of genetic enhancement on parent-child relationships, which is not directly addressed by Sandel's argument.\n\nB. Children are too young to understand the implications of genetic enhancement.\n- This option focuses on the understanding of children regarding genetic enhancement, which is not the central theme of Sandel's argument.\n\nC. Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\n- This option implies that Sandel's argument allows for certain types of genetic enhancement, which could be a valid point if Kamm is arguing against an absolute prohibition.\n\nD. The use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts is not, as Sandel argues, morally permissible.\n- This option seems to address a different aspect of Sandel's argument, focusing on non-genetic methods of enhancement rather than genetic enhancement itself.\n\nGiven the context and the focus on genetic enhancement, the most relevant option is:\n\nC. Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\n\nThis option directly addresses the relationship between Sandel's argument and the possibility of genetic enhancement, suggesting that Kamm might argue that Sandel's concerns do not necessarily preclude all forms of genetic enhancement."
