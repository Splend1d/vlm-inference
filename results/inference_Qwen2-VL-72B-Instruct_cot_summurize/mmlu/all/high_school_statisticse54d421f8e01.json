                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution and the given information about the percentages of trucks weighing more than certain amounts.\n\nGiven:\n- 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds.\n- 80% of the trucks weigh more than 10,000 pounds.\n\nLet's denote the mean weight by \u03bc and the standard deviation by \u03c3.\n\nFirst, we convert the percentages into z-scores using the standard normal distribution table (or a calculator). The z-score is the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nFor 70% of the trucks weighing more than 12,000 pounds, it means 30% weigh less than or equal to 12,000 pounds. Looking up 0.30 in the standard normal distribution table gives us a z-score of approximately -0.524.\n\nFor 80% of the trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds, it means 20% weigh less than or equal to 10,000 pounds. Looking up 0.20 in the standard normal distribution table gives us a z-score of approximately -0.842.\n\nNow, we have two equations based on the definition of z-scores:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nFor the first condition (70% > 12,000 pounds):\n\\[ -0.524 = \\frac{12000 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 12000 - \\mu = -0.524 \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.524 \\cdot \\sigma \\] ... (1)\n\nFor the second condition (80% > 10,000 pounds):\n\\[ -0.842 = \\frac{10000 - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\\[ 10000 - \\mu = -0.842 \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 10000 + 0.842 \\cdot \\sigma \\] ... (2)\n\nWe now have a system of linear equations:\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.524 \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\\[ \\mu = 10000 + 0.842 \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nSetting these two expressions for \u03bc equal to each other:\n\\[ 12000 + 0.524 \\cdot \\sigma = 10000 + 0.842 \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nSolving for \u03c3:\n\\[ 0.524 \\cdot \\sigma - 0.842 \\cdot \\sigma = 10000 - 12000 \\]\n\\[ -0.318 \\cdot \\sigma = -2000 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{-2000}{-0.318} \\approx 6289.31 \\]\n\nSubstituting \u03c3 back into one of the original equations to find \u03bc:\n\\[ \\mu = 12000 + 0.524 \\cdot 6289.31 \\]\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 12000 + 3297.6 \\]\n\\[ \\mu \\approx 15297.6 \\]\n\nThe closest match to our calculated values is:\nC. \u03bc = 15,300; \u03c3 = 6300"
