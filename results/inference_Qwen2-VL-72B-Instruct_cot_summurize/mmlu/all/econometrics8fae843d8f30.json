(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nHere's why:\n\n(i) The standard error of the slope coefficient in an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is indeed positively related to the residual variance. This is because the residual variance is part of the formula for calculating the standard error, and as the residual variance increases, so does the standard error.\n\n(ii) The standard error is also negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value. This is because greater dispersion (or variability) in the explanatory variable leads to more precise estimates of the slope coefficient, which in turn results in a smaller standard error.\n\n(iii) The standard error is negatively related to the sample size. As the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, indicating that larger samples provide more precise estimates of the slope coefficient.\n\n(iv) The standard error does give a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. A smaller standard error indicates that the estimated coefficient is more precise, while a larger standard error suggests less precision.\n\nTherefore, all statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are true."
