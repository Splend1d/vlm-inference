                    "text": "To determine the truth of these statements, let's analyze each one individually.\n\n### Statement 1: If \\(R\\) is an integral domain, then \\(R[x]\\) is an integral domain.\n\nAn **integral domain** is a commutative ring with unity (1 \u2260 0) that has no zero divisors. This means if \\(a, b \\in R\\) and \\(ab = 0\\), then either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(b = 0\\).\n\n- **Proof**: Let \\(R\\) be an integral domain, and consider \\(R[x]\\), the polynomial ring over \\(R\\). Suppose \\(f(x), g(x) \\in R[x]\\) such that \\(f(x)g(x) = 0\\). We need to show that either \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(g(x) = 0\\).\n  \n  - Since \\(R\\) is an integral domain, it has no zero divisors.\n  - The product of two polynomials \\(f(x)g(x)\\) being zero implies that for every coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in \\(f(x)g(x)\\), the corresponding coefficients from \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) must multiply to zero.\n  - Because \\(R\\) has no zero divisors, this means for any term in \\(f(x)g(x)\\), at least one of the coefficients from \\(f(x)\\) or \\(g(x)\\) must be zero.\n  - This implies that either all coefficients of \\(f(x)\\) are zero or all coefficients of \\(g(x)\\) are zero, meaning either \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(g(x) = 0\\).\n  \nTherefore, \\(R[x]\\) also has no zero divisors, making it an integral domain.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are in \\(R[x]\\), then \\(\\deg(f(x)g(x)) = \\deg f(x) + \\deg g(x)\\).\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \\(x\\) with a non-zero coefficient. For polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) in \\(R[x]\\), the degree of their product \\(f(x)g(x)\\) is indeed the sum of their individual degrees under certain conditions.\n\n- **Counterexample**: Consider \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}\\), which is not an integral domain because \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 0\\) in this ring.\n  - Let \\(f(x) = 2x + 2\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x + 2\\).\n  - Then, \\(f(x)g(x) = (2x + 2)(2x + 2) = 4x^2 + 8x + 4\\).\n  - In \\(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(4x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0\\), since \\(4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\).\n  - Thus, \\(\\deg(f(x)g(x)) = 0\\), while \\(\\deg f(x) = 1\\) and \\(\\deg g(x) = 1\\), so \\(\\deg f(x) + \\deg g(x) = 2\\).\n\nThis counterexample shows that the statement is false when \\(R\\) is not an integral domain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
