A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nMoreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations?\n\nA. Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire.\nB. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.\nC. Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.\nD. The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.\n"

It focuses on the relationship between zamindars and the Mughal authorities based on revenue payments.\n\n2. **Option B: Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.**\n   - The passage mentions different regions (Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur) where the situation regarding revenue payment varied. This suggests that geographical differences could influence tax payment practices.\n\n3. **Option C: Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.**\n   - The passage does not provide enough information to conclude that revenue collection was the sole source of funds for the Mughal Empire. It only discusses the role of revenue in establishing claims to sovereignty.\n\n4. **Option D: The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire.**\n   - While the passage does discuss Rajputana, it also mentions Central India and Chota Nagpur, indicating that Rajputana\u2019s situation was not necessarily typical but rather part of a broader pattern of varied revenue payment practices.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate generalization supported by the passage is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes.**"
