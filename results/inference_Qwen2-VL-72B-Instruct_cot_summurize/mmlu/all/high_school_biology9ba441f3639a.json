Sympatric\n\nSympatric speciation occurs when a new species arises from an existing species while inhabiting the same geographic region. In this case, the new variant of ferns emerged within the same laboratory environment (the same habitat) and became reproductively isolated from the original population, leading to the formation of a new species. The fact that the original phenotype and the new variant cannot produce offspring together indicates reproductive isolation, a key characteristic of sympatric speciation."
