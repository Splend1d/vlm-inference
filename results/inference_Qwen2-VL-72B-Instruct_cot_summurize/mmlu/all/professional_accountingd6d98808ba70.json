Was reduced to $2.\n\nWhen a company performs a stock split, such as a 5-for-1 split, it increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the par value per share. The total par value of all shares combined remains unchanged.\n\nBefore the split:\n- Number of shares: 10,000\n- Par value per share: $10\n- Total par value: 10,000 shares * $10/share = $100,000\n\nAfter the 5-for-1 split:\n- Number of shares becomes 5 times more: 10,000 shares * 5 = 50,000 shares\n- To keep the total par value the same ($100,000), the par value per share must be reduced by a factor of 5.\n\nSo, the new par value per share is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{New par value per share} = \\frac{\\text{Total par value}}{\\text{New number of shares}} = \\frac{$100,000}{50,000 \\text{ shares}} = \\$2 \\text{ per share} \\]\n\nTherefore, after the split, the par value of the stock was reduced to $2."
