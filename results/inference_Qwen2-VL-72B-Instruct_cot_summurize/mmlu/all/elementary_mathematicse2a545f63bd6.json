Then, half of the remaining students go to the computer lab, leaving \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{4}\\) students.\n\nWe're told that after these two events, 8 students remain in the class. Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{4} = 8\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 8 \\times 4 = 32\n\\]\n\nSo, the original number of students was 32.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 32 students."
