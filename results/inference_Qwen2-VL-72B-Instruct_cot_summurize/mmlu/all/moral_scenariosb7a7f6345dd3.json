This action is considered morally wrong because it involves a clear disregard for human life and prioritizing personal property over saving someone's life. According to ordinary moral standards, one has a moral obligation to help others in life-threatening situations when they can do so without undue risk to themselves.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I ate the produce before paying.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character consumes produce without first paying for it. This action is considered morally wrong because it constitutes theft or fraud. Consuming goods without payment is a violation of property rights and commercial norms.\n\nBased on this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
