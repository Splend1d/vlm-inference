Defendant was standing in front of the passenger and holding on to the hand rail. Seeing the pocketbook unattended, he suddenly grabbed it and tried to run away. As he did so, the passenger became very frightened and fell backward. She struck her head against the window and was knocked unconscious. In the commotion, Defendant dropped the pocketbook and hurriedly exited the subway car empty-handed. Defendant should be found guilty of\n\nA. larceny.\nB. attempted larceny.\nC. assault.\nD. robbery.\n"

The defendant did attempt to take the pocketbook but was unsuccessful due to being caught.\n\n2. **Attempted Larceny**: Attempted larceny occurs when an individual tries to commit larceny but fails to complete the act. The defendant clearly intended to steal the pocketbook and made a substantial step towards completing the theft (grabbing the pocketbook), but was interrupted before he could escape with it.\n\n3. **Assault**: Assault is typically defined as intentionally causing fear or apprehension of imminent harm without actually causing physical injury. While the passenger was frightened, the defendant's primary action was to steal the pocketbook, not to cause fear or harm directly through assault.\n\n4. **Robbery**: Robbery involves the use of force or intimidation to take property from another person. Although the passenger was frightened and fell, the defendant did not use force or intimidation to take the pocketbook; rather, he simply seized an opportunity to grab it.\n\nGiven these definitions, the most fitting charge for the defendant's actions is:\n\n**B. attempted larceny.**\n\nThe defendant intended to steal the pocketbook and took a substantial step toward that goal by grabbing it, but was interrupted before he could complete the theft."
