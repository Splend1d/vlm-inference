Acetylcholine.\n\nAcetylcholine is primarily an extracellular messenger, functioning as a neurotransmitter that transmits signals across synapses between neurons or between neurons and muscles. It is not typically involved in intracellular signaling pathways within a single cell.\n\nIn contrast, calcium ions (A), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (B), and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) (D) all play roles as second messengers in intracellular signaling pathways. Calcium ions can regulate various cellular processes, cAMP is involved in many cellular responses to hormones, and IP3 is involved in the release of calcium from intracellular stores."
