All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of Austral-Melanesians into the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\nC. All Native Americans, both ancient and modern, are derived from a single migration of the Inuit, who arrived in the Americas by about 13,000 years ago.\nD.

The separation between native Siberians and the earliest Native Americans occurred sometime between 20,000 and 23,000 years ago.\n\nThis conclusion is based on genetic studies that have compared the genomes of modern people with those of ancient skeletal remains found in North and South America. These studies suggest that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated from Asia to the Americas via the Bering land bridge, which connected Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age. The separation between these populations likely occurred around 20,000 to 23,000 years ago, before the major diversification of Native American populations."
