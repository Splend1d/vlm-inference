The market segment must have measurable purchasing power and size.\n\nMarket segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. For market segmentation to be effective, it must meet several basic requirements, including:\n\n1. **Measurability**: The size and purchasing power of the segments should be quantifiable. This allows the company to estimate the potential sales in each segment and allocate resources accordingly.\n\n2. **Accessibility**: The segments should be reachable through marketing and distribution channels. If a segment cannot be effectively reached, then targeting that segment would not be practical.\n\n3. **Substantiality**: The segments should be large enough to be profitable. A segment that is too small may not justify the cost of developing specific marketing programs for it.\n\n4. **Differentiability**: The segments should respond differently to different marketing mixes. This means that the needs and preferences of one segment should be distinct from those of another.\n\n5. **Stability**: The segments should remain relatively stable over time. Rapid changes in the composition of the segments could make it difficult to develop long-term marketing strategies.\n\nAmong the options provided, option B directly addresses the requirement of measurability, which is crucial for effective market segmentation. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The market segment must have measurable purchasing power and size."
