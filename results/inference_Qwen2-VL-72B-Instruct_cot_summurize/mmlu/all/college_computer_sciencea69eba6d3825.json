A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. Which of the following is (are) correct?\nI. true means the word was in the dictionary.\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\nIII.

True means the word was in the dictionary: This statement is correct because if the hash function maps a word from the dictionary to a specific index in the hash table and that index is set to true, it indicates that the word was indeed part of the dictionary.\n\nII. False means the word was not in the dictionary: This statement is also correct because if the hash function maps a word to an index in the hash table and that index is false, it suggests that the word was not found in the dictionary.\n\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size: This statement is incorrect. The size of the hash table is typically determined based on the expected number of unique words in the dictionary, not the size of the document being checked. The hash table size is usually chosen to balance between space efficiency and collision resolution, and it does not need to scale with the size of the document being spell-checked.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and II only."
