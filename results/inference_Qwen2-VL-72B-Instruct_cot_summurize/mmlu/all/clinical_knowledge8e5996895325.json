Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet.\n\nThis answer highlights a significant barrier to providing internet-based information sources to older adults: limited access to the internet. While the other options (A, C, and D) may also present challenges for some older individuals, the primary issue here is the lack of internet access itself. Without access, it doesn't matter how easy or difficult it is to read the screen, whether the content is targeted at younger people, or if they can type; they simply cannot use the internet as an information source. Therefore, ensuring that older adults have access to the internet is crucial before considering other potential difficulties."
