An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nWhen a client accepts the services of an attorney without an explicit agreement on the amount of the fee, it is generally understood that there is an implied-in-fact contract. This type of contract arises from the conduct and circumstances of the parties involved, even though there may not be a formal written or verbal agreement specifying the terms. The attorney provides legal services with the expectation of being compensated, and the client accepts those services with the understanding that they will pay for them."
