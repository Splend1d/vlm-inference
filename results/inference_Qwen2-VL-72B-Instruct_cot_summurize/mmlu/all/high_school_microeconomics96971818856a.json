The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nWhen the county government provides coupons to subsidize the cost of daycare, it effectively reduces the out-of-pocket expense for parents. This makes daycare more affordable and attractive to a larger number of families, thereby increasing the demand for daycare services. As demand increases, if the supply remains constant or does not increase proportionally, the market price for daycare is likely to rise due to higher competition among parents seeking daycare spots."
