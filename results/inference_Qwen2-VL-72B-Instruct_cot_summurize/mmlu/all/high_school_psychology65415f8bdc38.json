This often leads to an overestimation of the frequency or likelihood of events that are more memorable or vivid, such as air travel disasters, nuclear power accidents, and terrorist violence. These events tend to receive extensive media coverage, making them more accessible in our minds and thus leading to exaggerated perceptions of their likelihood."
