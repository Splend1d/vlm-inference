Core countries often have strong central governments to maintain their dominant position in the global economy.\n\nB. **An economy centralized around one natural resource**: This is more characteristic of periphery countries, which typically rely heavily on the export of raw materials or agricultural products.\n\nC. **A diversified and developed economy**: This is more typical of core countries, which have advanced economies that are diversified across various sectors.\n\nD. **Small percentage of very high class individuals**: Semi-periphery countries often exhibit a mix of characteristics from both core and periphery countries. They may have some industrialization and economic development but also significant inequality. The presence of a small percentage of very high-class individuals suggests a stratified society, which aligns well with the semi-periphery category.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer that best correlates with semi-periphery countries is:\n\n**D. Small percentage of very high class individuals.**"
