The purpose of these rules is to assist the agency in attaining the clean water standards required by the statute. After the agency issued such rules, several states filed an action challenging the rules on the sole ground that they are unconstitutional. Should the court uphold the constitutionality of the agency's rules?\n\nA. No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\nB. No, because the Tenth Amendment grants states immunity from all direct federal states immunity from all direct federal regulation.\nC. Yes, because the rules serve an important purpose, and the requirements they impose on the states are only temporary and do not excessively interfere with the functioning of the state governments.\nD. Yes, because the supremacy clause of Article VI requires states to enforce federal law.\n"

No, because the federal government may not compel a state legislature to enact into state law a federally mandated regulatory program.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle of federalism and the limitations placed on federal power by the Constitution. Specifically, the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine, which has been established through Supreme Court decisions such as Printz v. United States (1997) and New York v. United States (1992), holds that Congress cannot commandeer state legislative bodies to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. This doctrine is rooted in the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people.\n\nTherefore, while the federal government can set standards and regulate directly, it cannot require state legislatures to pass specific laws to implement those standards. The court would likely find the agency's rules unconstitutional on this basis."
