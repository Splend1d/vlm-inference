However, in a group, each element has a unique inverse. Since \\(i\\) and \\(-i\\) are distinct elements, they cannot both be inverses of \\(-i\\). The correct interpretation here is that the inverse of \\(-i\\) is indeed \\(i\\), as shown in option C. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that \\(-i\\) is its own inverse, which would imply \\((-i)^2 = 1\\), but we know \\((-i)^2 = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(i\\)"
