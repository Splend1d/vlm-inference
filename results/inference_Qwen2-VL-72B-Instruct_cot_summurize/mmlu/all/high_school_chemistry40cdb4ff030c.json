Therefore, the acid strength generally increases with increasing electronegativity of the central atom.\n\nLet's arrange them based on their electronegativities:\n- Se (2.55)\n- S (2.58)\n- Br (2.96)\n- Cl (3.16)\n\nSo, the order from weakest to strongest acid should be:\n\nH2SeO3 < H2SO3 < HBrO < HClO\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. H2SO3 < H2SeO3 < HClO < HBrO**"
