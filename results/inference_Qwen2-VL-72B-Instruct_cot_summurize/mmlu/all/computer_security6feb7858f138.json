What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\nA. The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\nB. When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\nC. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\nD. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n"

When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n\nIn Kerberos authentication, when a client presents a ticket to a service, the service checks the expiration time of the ticket against its own clock. If the ticket's expiration time is in the past relative to the service's clock, the service will refuse to authenticate the user because the ticket is considered invalid. This mechanism ensures that expired tickets cannot be used to gain access to services."
