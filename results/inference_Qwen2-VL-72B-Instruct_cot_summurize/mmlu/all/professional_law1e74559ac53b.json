Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. The man's nephew agreed to live on the farm and take care of it during his uncle's absence. When the man returned from his mother's home in 1999, he continued in possession until 2010 when the womanbrought an ejectment action. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. The court would most likely hold that\n\nA. the woman was the rightful owner and thus entitled to possess the farm.\nB. the woman was entitled to possession, because the man's intermittent possession was insufficient to make him an adverse possessor.\nC. the man was entitled to possession, because his possession was open, notorious, continuous, and hostile as required for the statutory period.\nD. the man was entitled to possession, because of the privity between the man and his nephew, which aided him in fulfilling the required statutory period.\n"

This accounts for 10 years of possession.\n- **Interruption**: He left the property for one year (1998) to care for his sick mother.\n- **Nephew's Possession**: During his absence, his nephew lived on the farm and took care of it, maintaining continuous possession.\n- **Return and Further Possession**: The man returned in 1999 and continued in possession until 2010, adding another 11 years to his possession.\n\nAdding these periods together:\n- 1987 to 1997: 10 years\n- Nephew's possession in 1998: 1 year\n- 1999 to 2010: 11 years\n\nThis totals 22 years of possession, which exceeds the statutory period of 20 years required for adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the man's possession meets the requirements of being open, notorious, continuous, and hostile for more than the statutory period, making him entitled to possession under the doctrine of adverse possession."
