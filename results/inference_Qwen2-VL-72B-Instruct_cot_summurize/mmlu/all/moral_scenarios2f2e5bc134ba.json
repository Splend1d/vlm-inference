Without additional context, guarding a friend's secrets is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing (shoplifting).\n- Scenario 2 does not involve a clear moral wrongdoing (guarding secrets).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
