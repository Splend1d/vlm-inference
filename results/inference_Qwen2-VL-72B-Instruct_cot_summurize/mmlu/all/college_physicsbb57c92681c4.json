The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nIn a reversible thermodynamic process, the system can be returned to its initial state along the same path without any net change in the surroundings. This implies that the total entropy of the system and its environment does not change. Reversible processes are idealized processes where there is no dissipation or loss of energy as heat, and they occur infinitely slowly to maintain equilibrium at every step. Therefore, the entropy of the universe (the system plus its surroundings) remains constant for a reversible process."
