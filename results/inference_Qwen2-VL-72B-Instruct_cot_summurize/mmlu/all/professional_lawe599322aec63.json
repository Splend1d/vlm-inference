During a fraternity party, the defendant pulled out a gun, pointed it at the other student and said, \"Beg for your life, sucker. \" The student, who knew that the defendant had a reputation as a practical joker, said, \"Get lost, you jerk. \" The defendant then pulled the trigger and shot the student to death. A statute in this jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing with malice aforethought is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is any killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a serious or inherently dangerous felony. Manslaughter includes all other types of unlawftil homicide and unjustifiable killings. \"The defendant was subsequently prosecuted for killing the student. At trial, the defendant testified that a fellow fraternity member gave him the gun before the shooting and told him that it was unloaded. If the jury believes the defendant, it should find him\n\nA. guilty of assault, but not murder or manslaughter.\nB. guilty of manslaughter.\nC. guilty of second-degree murder.\nD. guilty of first-degree murder.\n"

Premeditation implies planning or deliberation before the act.\n\n2. **Second-Degree Murder**: This involves a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a serious or inherently dangerous felony.\n\n3. **Manslaughter**: This covers all other types of unlawful homicide and unjustifiable killings, typically involving less intent than murder.\n\nGiven the defendant's testimony:\n- He claims he was given an unloaded gun by a fellow fraternity member.\n- He did not intend to kill the victim, believing the gun was unloaded.\n- The act was part of a practical joke, which suggests no premeditation or malice aforethought.\n\nBased on these points:\n\n- **First-Degree Murder** does not apply because there is no evidence of premeditation or malice aforethought.\n- **Second-Degree Murder** also does not apply since there is no indication that the killing occurred during the commission of a felony.\n- **Manslaughter** seems most fitting here, as it covers unlawful homicides without the specific intent required for murder.\n\nTherefore, if the jury believes the defendant\u2019s testimony, they should find him:\n\n**B. Guilty of manslaughter.**"
