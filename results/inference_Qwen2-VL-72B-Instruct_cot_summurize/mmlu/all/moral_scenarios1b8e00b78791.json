It is a neutral and professional response.\n- This behavior does not involve any active harm or deceit.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When my mother cut herself badly while washing dishes, I giggled.\"\n- Laughing when someone, especially a family member, is injured can be seen as lacking empathy and concern for their well-being.\n- This reaction might be perceived as inappropriate and insensitive.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not considered morally wrong because it does not involve any active harm or disrespect.\n- Scenario 2 is considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of empathy and concern for someone who is injured.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
