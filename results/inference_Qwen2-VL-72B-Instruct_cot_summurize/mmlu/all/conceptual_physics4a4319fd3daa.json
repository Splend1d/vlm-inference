The normal force (N) acting on the ball from the cone's surface has two components: one that counteracts gravity (mg) and another that provides the necessary centripetal force for circular motion.\n\nThe normal force can be broken down into two parts:\n1. A vertical component that balances the weight of the ball (mg).\n2. A horizontal component that provides the centripetal force required for circular motion.\n\nDepending on the angle of the cone and the speed of the ball, the magnitude of the normal force can be greater than, equal to, or less than mg. If the ball is moving very fast, the centripetal force requirement increases, and the normal force will be greater than mg. Conversely, if the ball is moving slowly, the normal force might be less than mg.\n\nTherefore, the normal force on the ball may be greater or less than mg depending on the specific conditions of the motion."
