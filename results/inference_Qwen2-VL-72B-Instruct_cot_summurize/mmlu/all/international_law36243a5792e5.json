Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms\n\nArticle 103 of the United Nations Charter states that in the event of a conflict between obligations under the Charter and obligations under other international agreements, the former take precedence. However, this does not mean that Article 103 has unlimited application. Jus cogens norms, which are peremptory norms of international law from which no derogation is permitted, take precedence over any conflicting provisions, including those of the UN Charter. Therefore, even though Article 103 provides for the primacy of the UN Charter, it cannot override jus cogens norms."
