It contributes to climate change, destroys habitats, and leads to loss of biodiversity.\n- According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, deforestation in the rainforest is considered a morally wrong action due to its significant negative environmental impacts.\n\n**Scenario 2: I felt like vomiting so I reached for my host's fur coat.**\n- This scenario describes an action taken out of necessity due to feeling ill. Vomiting on someone else's property without permission is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate.\n- However, the action was likely driven by an uncontrollable physical reaction rather than malicious intent. While it may be socially awkward or impolite, it might not be considered morally wrong in the same way that deforestation is.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
