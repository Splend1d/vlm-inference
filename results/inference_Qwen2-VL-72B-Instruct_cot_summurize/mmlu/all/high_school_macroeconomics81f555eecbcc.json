                    "text": "To determine the effect on the equilibrium price and quantity, we need to analyze how changes in consumer expectations and input costs affect supply and demand.\n\n1. **Consumer Expectations:**\n   - If consumers expect the price of corn to be lower in the near future, they might delay their purchases, leading to a decrease in current demand. This shift in demand would move the demand curve to the left.\n\n2. **Input Costs (Seed Corn and Fertilizer):**\n   - When the prices of seed corn and fertilizer fall, the cost of production decreases. This reduction in production costs typically leads to an increase in supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.\n\nNow, let's combine these effects:\n\n- **Decrease in Demand:** The demand curve shifts to the left, which generally leads to a lower equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity.\n- **Increase in Supply:** The supply curve shifts to the right, which generally leads to a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.\n\nWhen both curves shift, the direction of the change in equilibrium price becomes ambiguous because the two effects counteract each other. However, the equilibrium quantity is more likely to increase due to the larger supply shift.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise."
