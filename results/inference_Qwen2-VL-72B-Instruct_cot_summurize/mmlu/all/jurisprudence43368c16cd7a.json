Wade decision is highly controversial. The Supreme Court ruled that a state law banning abortions except when necessary to save the mother's life violated a woman's constitutional right to privacy, which is protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision effectively legalized abortion nationwide and has been a subject of intense debate and legal challenges ever since."
