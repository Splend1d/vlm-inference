In this scenario, the student was placed in the back seat of a police car against his will. For the student to succeed in a claim of false imprisonment, it must be shown that the confinement was unlawful. If the police did not have a valid reason or legal authority to detain the student (such as a warrant or probable cause for an arrest), the student would likely prevail in a claim of false imprisonment. However, if the police had a valid reason or legal authority to detain the student, such as a lawful arrest, the student's claim would likely fail."
