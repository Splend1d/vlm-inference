After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?\n\nA. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\nC. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer.\nD. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer.\n"

The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nIn this scenario, the manufacturer's argument that the hotel's negligence and the arsonist's criminal act were superseding causes is being considered. Generally, for an intervening cause to relieve a defendant of liability, it must be unforeseeable and independent of the original negligent act. However, if the manufacturer knew that the product was highly flammable and could be used in buildings without adequate safety measures, they should have anticipated the potential for such incidents. Therefore, the trial court would likely rule that the intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability because the risk was foreseeable."
