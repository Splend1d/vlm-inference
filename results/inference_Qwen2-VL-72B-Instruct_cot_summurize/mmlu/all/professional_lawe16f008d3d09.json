This right extends to cases involving misdemeanors where there is a possibility of incarceration upon conviction. Since the defendant has been charged with petit theft, which is a second-degree misdemeanor, and there is a potential for imprisonment (even if it is less than six months), the court must provide legal representation if the defendant is indigent."
