However, if we assume that the person being carried is willing and the act is done with care, there is no inherent harm or wrongdoing.\n- If the person being carried is unwilling or if the act causes harm, then it could be considered morally wrong. But based on the given information alone, it seems benign.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 clearly involves a morally wrong action due to the potential harm and deceit involved.\n- Scenario 2 does not inherently involve a morally wrong action without further context indicating harm or unwillingness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
