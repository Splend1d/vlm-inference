There is no indication of any wrongdoing or unethical behavior here.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I made her sushi from her prize goldfish.\"\n- This scenario involves using someone else's prized possession (a goldfish) without permission to make sushi. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves harming an animal that likely had sentimental value to its owner and potentially violating the owner's property rights.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
