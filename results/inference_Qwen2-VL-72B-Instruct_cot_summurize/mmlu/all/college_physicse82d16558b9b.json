                    "text": "To determine how far apart galaxies were when the temperature of the universe was 12 K compared to their current distance at 3 K, we need to understand the relationship between the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the scale factor of the universe.\n\nThe temperature of the CMB is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe. This means that as the universe expands, the temperature decreases. The scale factor represents how much the universe has expanded since the Big Bang.\n\nGiven:\n- Current temperature \\( T_0 = 3 \\text{ K} \\)\n- Temperature at some earlier time \\( T_{\\text{past}} = 12 \\text{ K} \\)\n\nWe can use the relation between the temperature and the scale factor:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\frac{1}{a} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the scale factor of the universe. Therefore,\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{past}}}{T_0} = \\frac{a_0}{a_{\\text{past}}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given temperatures:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12 \\text{ K}}{3 \\text{ K}} = \\frac{a_0}{a_{\\text{past}}} \\]\n\\[ 4 = \\frac{a_0}{a_{\\text{past}}} \\]\n\nThis implies that the scale factor \\( a_{\\text{past}} \\) is one-fourth of the current scale factor \\( a_0 \\). Since the scale factor directly relates to the distances between objects in the universe, this means that when the temperature was 12 K, galaxies were one-fourth as distant from each other as they are today.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. one-quarter as distant as they are today"
