This theory suggests that emotions have two components: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. According to this theory, a person first experiences a physiological response to a stimulus, and then interprets that response based on the context or situation, leading to the experience of a specific emotion. This perspective aligns well with cognitive psychology's focus on mental processes and how they influence behavior and emotional experiences."
