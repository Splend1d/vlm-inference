Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?\n\nA. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n"

The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nWhen the chromosome number in a hybrid plant doubles, it results in a polyploid condition. This doubling can resolve the issue of chromosome mispairing that occurs in hybrids with mismatched chromosome numbers from their parents. With the doubled chromosome number, each set of chromosomes now has a matching counterpart, allowing for normal meiosis and thus sexual reproduction. This means the descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because their chromosomes could pair normally during meiosis."
