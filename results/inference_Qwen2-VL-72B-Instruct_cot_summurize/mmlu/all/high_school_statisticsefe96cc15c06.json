The z-score for the 10th percentile can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28 (since it's the bottom 10%, we're looking at the left tail of the distribution).\n\nUsing the formula for converting a value from a normal distribution to a standard normal distribution:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWe solve for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[ -1.28 = \\frac{X - 6}{1.6} \\]\n\n\\[ X - 6 = -1.28 \\times 1.6 \\]\n\n\\[ X - 6 = -2.048 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 6 - 2.048 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 3.952 \\]\n\nTherefore, the highest amount of rainfall, in inches, this city could have this month for the month to be among the 10 percent driest months the city has seen is approximately 3.95 inches.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3.95."
