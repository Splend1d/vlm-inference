                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. granted, because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the grantor conveyed the property to the nephew \"for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs,\" it created a life estate for the nephew with a vested remainder in his heirs. This means that upon the nephew's death, his heirs will automatically inherit the property without any further action required.\n\nThe abolition of the Rule in Shelley's Case by statute in this jurisdiction means that the remainder interest does not automatically revert to the grantor or any other party. Instead, it remains vested in the nephew's heirs as intended by the original conveyance.\n\nTherefore, when the nephew entered into a real estate agreement to sell the property to his brother, he was conveying his life estate interest. Since the remainder interest is vested in his heirs, the brother's claim that the nephew cannot convey a fee simple is incorrect. The nephew can convey his life estate, and the remainder interest will pass to his heirs as per the original conveyance.\n\nThus, the nephew's prayer for specific performance would likely be granted, as he has the right to convey his life estate interest, and the remainder interest remains vested in his heirs."
