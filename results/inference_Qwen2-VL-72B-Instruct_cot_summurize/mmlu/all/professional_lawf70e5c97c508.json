During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:\"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\nB. improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\nC. proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\nD. proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n"

The defendant's attorney's line of questioning aims to reveal potential biases or motives that might affect the informer's testimony. By asking about the informer's hope that his cooperation with law enforcement could lead to overlooking his past convictions, the defense is attempting to show that the informer may have a motive to lie or exaggerate his story to gain favor with the police department. This type of questioning is generally considered proper because it pertains to the witness's possible bias, which is a relevant factor in assessing the reliability of their testimony."
