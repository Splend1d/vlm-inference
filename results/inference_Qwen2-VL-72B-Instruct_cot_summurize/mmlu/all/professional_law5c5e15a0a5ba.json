His friend had often cautioned him that he should not leave so much of his merchandise out in the open. One day, as the friend entered the store to pay a visit, he decided he'd put his unheeded warnings into action by playing a joke on the owner. The friend took a hatchet that was lying on a display case and swung it over his head as if he were going to strike the owner, who was standing at the register with his back turned. The friend then said, \"All right buddy, one false move and it's over. \" The owner was very frightened at almost being hit with the hatchet but suffered no actual physical or other harm. If the owner asserts a claim against the friend, the most likely result is that he will\n\nA. recover, because the friend was negligent.\nB. recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.\nC. not recover, because he suffered no physical harm.\nD. not recover, because the friend was only joking.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves an incident where the owner of a sporting goods store was frightened by his friend's actions, which involved swinging a hatchet in a threatening manner. To determine the most likely outcome if the owner asserts a claim against the friend, we need to consider the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Negligence**: Negligence typically requires proof of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. In this case, while the friend may have acted recklessly, the owner did not suffer any physical harm, which makes it difficult to establish negligence resulting in compensable damages.\n\n2. **Intentional Tort (Assault)**: Assault is defined as intentionally creating a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact without consent. The key elements here are the intention to cause fear and the reasonable apprehension of harm. The friend's actions created a reasonable fear in the owner, even though there was no physical contact or harm.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A** (\"recover, because the friend was negligent\") is unlikely since negligence typically requires actual harm, which the owner did not suffer.\n- **Option B** (\"recover, because he feared the friend would hit him\") aligns with the concept of assault, where the reasonable fear of imminent harm is sufficient for a claim.\n- **Option C** (\"not recover, because he suffered no physical harm\") overlooks the possibility of recovering for emotional distress or other non-physical harms.\n- **Option D** (\"not recover, because the friend was only joking\") does not hold up legally, as intent and reasonable fear are central to the tort of assault, regardless of the friend's subjective state of mind.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is that the owner will recover based on the reasonable fear of imminent harm caused by the friend's actions.\n\n**Final Answer: B. recover, because he feared the friend would hit him.**"
