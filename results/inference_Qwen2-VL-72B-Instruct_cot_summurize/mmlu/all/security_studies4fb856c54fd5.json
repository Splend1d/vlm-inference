All of these options.\n\nRealist theory in international relations posits several key characteristics:\n\n1. **Anarchy**: The international system is considered anarchic, meaning there is no central authority above states to enforce rules or resolve disputes. This lack of a higher authority leads to a self-help system where states must rely on their own capabilities for security and survival.\n\n2. **Power and Capabilities**: States primarily assess each other based on their power and capabilities rather than their internal political systems, ideologies, or cultural differences. This focus on material power is crucial for understanding state behavior according to realists.\n\n3. **Unitary and Rational Actors**: Realist theory assumes that states act as unitary and rational actors. This means that states have coherent interests and act rationally to achieve those interests. Sovereign states are seen as the primary actors in the international system, and they pursue policies that enhance their security and power.\n\nTherefore, all the options listed are characteristics of realist theory."
