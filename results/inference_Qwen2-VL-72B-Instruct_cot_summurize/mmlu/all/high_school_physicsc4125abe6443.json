                    "text": "The correct statement is:\n\nC. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen a positron (the antiparticle of an electron) interacts with an electron, they can undergo annihilation, where both particles are converted into pure energy in the form of gamma rays. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n- **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before the annihilation (rest mass energy of the electron and positron plus any kinetic energy) must equal the total energy after the annihilation (energy of the gamma rays).\n  \n- **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the initial system has zero net momentum (assuming the positron is moving very slowly and the electron is stationary), the final state must also have zero net momentum. Two gamma rays moving in opposite directions would ensure that their momenta cancel each other out, satisfying conservation of momentum.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of a possible outcome is that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created, which satisfies both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum."
