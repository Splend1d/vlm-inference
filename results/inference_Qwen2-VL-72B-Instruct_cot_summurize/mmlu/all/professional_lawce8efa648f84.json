While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nThe building owner's statement is hearsay because it involves repeating out-of-court statements made by the janitor. Additionally, the building owner's statement includes another layer of hearsay, as the janitor's warning to the dance student is also an out-of-court statement. For the building owner's statement to be admissible, there would need to be applicable hearsay exceptions for both layers of hearsay, which do not appear to exist in this scenario. Therefore, the statement is likely to be excluded as hearsay within hearsay without applicable exceptions."
