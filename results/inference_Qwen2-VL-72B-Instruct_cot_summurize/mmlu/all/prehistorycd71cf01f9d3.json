An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\nThe death of Qin Dynasty emperor Ying Zheng (also known as Qin Shi Huang) was indeed marked by an elaborate memorial, which includes the famous terra cotta army. This vast collection of terracotta sculptures represents the emperor's guards and soldiers and is part of a larger complex that also includes the emperor's mausoleum. The terra cotta army is one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in history and provides insight into the military formations and weaponry of the time."
