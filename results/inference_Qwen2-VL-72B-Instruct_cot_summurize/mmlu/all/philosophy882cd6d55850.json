The term \"hare\" here seems to be used metaphorically or idiomatically to describe a certain type of person.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Fanatics**: Fanatics are people who have extreme enthusiasm or zeal, particularly for a particular activity or cause. They often endorse ideals with great passion but might not always consider practical outcomes or others' interests.\n\nB. **Amoralists**: Amoralists are individuals who do not believe in moral principles or do not apply them in their behavior. They may endorse ideals without considering the moral implications or the impact on others' interests.\n\nC. **Immoralists**: Immoralists are people who deliberately act against accepted moral principles. They would endorse ideals that could harm others' interests intentionally.\n\nD. **Maniacs**: Maniacs are individuals who exhibit extreme or irrational behavior, often characterized by obsession or compulsion. They might endorse ideals with intense fervor without regard for practical considerations or others' interests.\n\nGiven the context of endorsing ideals without regard for whether people's interests are pursued, the most fitting description is someone who acts with extreme enthusiasm or zeal without considering practical outcomes or others' interests. This aligns closely with the definition of a fanatic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**A. fanatics.**"
