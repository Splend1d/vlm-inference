This means each party is entitled to 50% of the estate.\n\n2. **Legal Considerations**:\n   - **Timely Petition**: If there is a provision in the law allowing Joan to file a timely petition to avoid the devise to the Salvation Army, this could potentially change the distribution.\n   - **Default Distribution**: In the absence of any legal action by Joan, the will's provisions would stand as written.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Option A (100% to Joan) does not align with the will's provisions unless Joan successfully petitions to avoid the devise to the Salvation Army.\n- Option B (100% to Joan if she files a timely petition) suggests that Joan can avoid the devise to the Salvation Army through a legal process, which is possible but not guaranteed without further information.\n- Option C (50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army) directly reflects the will's provisions and assumes no successful legal action by Joan.\n- Option D (50% to Joan and the income from the remaining 50% to Joan for life, remainder to the Salvation Army) introduces a complex trust arrangement that is not mentioned in the will's simple division.\n\nBased on the information provided and assuming no additional legal actions by Joan, the most straightforward interpretation is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.**"
