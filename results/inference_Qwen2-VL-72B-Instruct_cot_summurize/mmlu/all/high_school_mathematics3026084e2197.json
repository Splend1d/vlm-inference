                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what makes a fraction $\\frac{1}{n}$ a terminating decimal. A fraction in simplest form will terminate if and only if its denominator (after reducing) has no prime factors other than 2 or 5. This is because the decimal system is based on powers of 10, and 10 = 2 * 5.\n\nGiven that $n$ must contain the digit 9, let's examine each option:\n\nA. 32: The prime factorization of 32 is $2^5$. Since it only contains the prime factor 2, $\\frac{1}{32}$ is a terminating decimal. However, 32 does not contain the digit 9.\n\nB. 64: The prime factorization of 64 is $2^6$. Similar to 32, $\\frac{1}{64}$ is a terminating decimal, but 64 also does not contain the digit 9.\n\nC. 4096: The prime factorization of 4096 is $2^{12}$. $\\frac{1}{4096}$ is a terminating decimal, and 4096 contains the digit 9.\n\nD. 256: The prime factorization of 256 is $2^8$. $\\frac{1}{256}$ is a terminating decimal, but 256 does not contain the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9 is **C. 4096**."
