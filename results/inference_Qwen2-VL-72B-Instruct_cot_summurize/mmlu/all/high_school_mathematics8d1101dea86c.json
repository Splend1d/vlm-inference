                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the growth rates of the two species of ants.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(A_0\\) as the initial number of ants of Species A on Day 0.\n- \\(B_0\\) as the initial number of ants of Species B on Day 0.\n- \\(A_5\\) as the number of ants of Species A on Day 5.\n- \\(B_5\\) as the number of ants of Species B on Day 5.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n1. \\(A_0 + B_0 = 30\\)\n2. Every day, the number of ants of Species A doubles, so after 5 days, \\(A_5 = A_0 \\times 2^5\\).\n3. Every day, the number of ants of Species B triples, so after 5 days, \\(B_5 = B_0 \\times 3^5\\).\n\nWe also know that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281, which means:\n\\[A_5 + B_5 = 3281\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(A_5\\) and \\(B_5\\) into the equation gives us:\n\\[A_0 \\times 2^5 + B_0 \\times 3^5 = 3281\\]\n\nSince \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(3^5 = 243\\), we have:\n\\[32A_0 + 243B_0 = 3281\\]\n\nWe also know from the first piece of information that \\(A_0 + B_0 = 30\\). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \\(A_0\\) and \\(B_0\\).\n\nFirst, let's express \\(B_0\\) in terms of \\(A_0\\) using the first equation:\n\\[B_0 = 30 - A_0\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(B_0\\) into the second equation:\n\\[32A_0 + 243(30 - A_0) = 3281\\]\n\\[32A_0 + 7290 - 243A_0 = 3281\\]\n\\[-211A_0 = -309\\]\n\\[A_0 = \\frac{309}{211}\\]\n\\[A_0 = 1.464454976\\]\n\nHowever, since the number of ants must be an integer, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach or the interpretation of the problem. Let's correct the approach:\n\nGiven the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, and knowing the growth rates, we should directly calculate the number of ants of each species on Day 5 without assuming the initial conditions incorrectly.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the total number of ants on Day 5 is the sum of the ants of both species grown over 5 days. Given the growth rates, we can set up the following system of equations based on the initial condition (total 30 ants) and the final count (3281 ants):\n\n1. \\(A_0 + B_0 = 30\\)\n2. \\(A_0 \\times 2^5 + B_0 \\times 3^5 = 3281\\)\n\nSolving the first equation for one variable, say \\(B_0\\):\n\\[B_0 = 30 - A_0\\]\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\\[A_0 \\times 32 + (30 - A_0) \\times 243 = 3281\\]\n\\[32A_0 + 7290 - 243A_0 = 3281\\]\n\\[-211A_0 = -309\\]\n\\[A_0 = \\frac{309}{211}\\]\n\nThis calculation was incorrect due to a mistake in the setup. Let's correct it:\n\nGiven the correct setup:\n\\[A_0 \\times 2^5 + B_0 \\times 3^5 = 3281\\]\nAnd knowing \\(A_0 + B_0 = 30\\), we substitute \\(B_0 = 30 - A_0\\) into the equation:\n\\[A_0 \\times 32 + (30 - A_0) \\times 243 = 3281\\]\n\\[32A_0 + 7290 - 243A_0 = 3281\\]\n\\[7290 - 211A_0 = 3281"
