Retained earnings is debited for $300.**\n\n(Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct adjustment involves debiting Retained Earnings for $3,000, not $300. However, given the options, the closest match would be C, assuming there was a typo in the question.)"
