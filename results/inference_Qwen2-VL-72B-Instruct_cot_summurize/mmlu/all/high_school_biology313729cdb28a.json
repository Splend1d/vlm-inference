This means they rely on nonspecific mechanisms to defend against pathogens. Among the options provided, phagocytes are a key component of the invertebrate immune system. Phagocytes engulf and destroy foreign particles and pathogens through a process called phagocytosis. The other options (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, B-cells, and helper T-cells) are components of the adaptive immune system found in vertebrates."
