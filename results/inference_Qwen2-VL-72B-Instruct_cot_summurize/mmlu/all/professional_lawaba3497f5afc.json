While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.\nB. The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\nC. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\nD. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a woman made a promise to pay an additional sum of money to a detective if he successfully recovered her stolen painting. The detective, who was already employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft, fulfilled the condition set forth by the woman and recovered the painting. The key issue here revolves around whether the woman's promise to pay the detective an extra $50,000 constitutes a legally binding contract.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.**\n   - This option suggests that the woman's promise was not supported by consideration and therefore is not enforceable. However, the detective performed an action (recovering the painting) in reliance on the woman's promise, which could be seen as consideration.\n\nB. **The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.**\n   - This option implies that the detective's actions were part of his existing duties under his employment with the insurance company, and thus no new contract was formed between the woman and the detective. However, the woman's promise was made specifically to the detective, indicating a separate agreement.\n\nC. **The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.**\n   - This option suggests that the detective accepted the woman's offer by performing the act required (recovering the painting). If the detective's actions can be considered an acceptance of the woman's offer, then the detective has a valid claim.\n\nD. **The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.**\n   - This option focuses on the market value of the painting exceeding its insured value. However, the consideration for the contract is the detective's performance of recovering the painting, not the value of the painting itself.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling argument is that the detective performed the act necessary to accept the woman's offer, thereby forming a contract. Therefore, the detective is most likely to prevail based on the principle that his actions constituted acceptance of the woman's offer.\n\n**Final Answer: C. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.**"
