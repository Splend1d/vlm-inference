The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\n\nIn this scenario, the restaurant is likely to face strict liability for selling an unreasonably dangerous product. Strict liability applies when a product is inherently unsafe or defective, regardless of whether the manufacturer or seller exercised due care in producing or distributing the product. The presence of a metal fish hook in a fish sandwich would generally be considered an unreasonably dangerous defect, making the restaurant liable for any resulting injuries."
