The perimeter \\(P\\) of a square is given by:\n\\[ P = 4 \\times \\text{side length} \\]\n\nLet \\(s\\) be the side length of the square. Then:\n\\[ 24 = 4s \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\]\n\nNow that we know the side length of the square is 6, we can find its area \\(A\\):\n\\[ A = s^2 = 6^2 = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36, which corresponds to option C."
