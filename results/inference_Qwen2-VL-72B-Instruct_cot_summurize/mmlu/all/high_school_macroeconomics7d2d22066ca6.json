Your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. When your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China, it contributes to the GDP because it represents production and economic activity within the country.\n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options do not affect GDP:\n\nA. Losing $50 betting with a friend does not contribute to GDP because it is a transfer of money rather than the production of goods or services.\n\nB. Fixing your brother's car without buying any new parts does not add to GDP because no new goods or services were purchased or produced in the market.\n\nD. Buying 1000 shares of stock in a corporation is a financial transaction that does not directly contribute to the production of goods or services, hence it does not affect GDP."
