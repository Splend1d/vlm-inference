The rest can be loaned out. The fraction that needs to be kept as reserves is called the reserve ratio. In this case, when $1000 is deposited, the excess reserves increase by $700. This means that the required reserves increased by $300 (since $1000 - $700 = $300). Therefore, the reserve ratio is 30%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
