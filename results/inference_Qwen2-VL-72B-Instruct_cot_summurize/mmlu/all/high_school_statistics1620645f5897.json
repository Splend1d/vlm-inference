This method can offer several advantages over simple random sampling:\n\n- **Less Bias**: Stratified sampling can reduce bias by ensuring that all important subgroups of the population are represented in the sample (Option A).\n- **Reduced Variability**: By sampling from within homogeneous subgroups, stratified sampling can lead to less variability in the results compared to simple random sampling (Option B).\n- **Smaller Sample Size for Same Reliability**: Because stratified sampling can target specific subgroups, it may allow for achieving the same level of reliability with a smaller overall sample size compared to simple random sampling (Option C).\n\nHowever, regarding Option D, both stratified random sampling and simple random sampling can provide information about the population as a whole. Simple random sampling does not inherently lack the ability to provide estimates for the population; it simply does not guarantee representation of specific subgroups unless those subgroups are large enough to be captured by chance. Therefore, the statement that \"a simple random sample does not\" provide information about the population as a whole is incorrect. Both methods can provide such information, though stratified sampling might do so more efficiently or with greater precision under certain conditions."
