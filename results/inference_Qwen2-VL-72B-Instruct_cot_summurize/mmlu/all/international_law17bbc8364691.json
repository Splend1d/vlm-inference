A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nAccording to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a reservation is considered invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This means that if a reservation would fundamentally alter or undermine the core objectives and intentions of the treaty, it cannot be accepted as valid."
