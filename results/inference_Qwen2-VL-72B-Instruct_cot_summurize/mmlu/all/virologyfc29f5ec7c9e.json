They produce a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs that share a common 3' end.\n\nB. **They take advantage of recombination with the long RNA genome**:\n   - Coronaviruses do indeed have a high rate of recombination due to their large RNA genomes, which is a notable feature but not necessarily unusual compared to other RNA viruses.\n\nC. **They are not highly mutable**:\n   - Coronaviruses are known for their relatively low mutation rates compared to other RNA viruses, which is unusual given that RNA viruses typically have high mutation rates due to lack of proofreading during replication.\n\nD. **They use capped cellular mRNA's**:\n   - Coronaviruses synthesize their own capped mRNAs rather than using cellular mRNAs. This is a standard feature of many RNA viruses and not specific to coronaviruses.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most unusual feature described here is:\n\n**C. They are not highly mutable**\n\nThis is because it contrasts with the typical high mutability seen in RNA viruses."
