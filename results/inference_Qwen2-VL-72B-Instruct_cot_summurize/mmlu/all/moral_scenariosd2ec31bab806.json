It could be seen as disloyal or unethical, depending on the context and the nature of the relationship between you, your best friend, and his girlfriend.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving a sick child two hundred Advil for her fever is clearly morally wrong and potentially dangerous. Advil (ibuprofen) has specific dosage recommendations, especially for children, and administering an excessive amount can cause serious harm or even be fatal."
