Unlike females, who have two X chromosomes (one of which is usually inactivated), males do not have an inactivated X chromosome.\n\nC. **Forty-four autosomes**: Human males have 44 autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) in their somatic cells, which is correct.\n\nD. **A diploid nucleus**: Somatic cells are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. An inactivated X chromosome**"
