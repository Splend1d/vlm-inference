However, it does not directly address whether Wellman accepts or rejects the implication of freedom of association justifying such exclusion.\n\nB. **This is an implication of the freedom of association that we must accept.**\n   - This option implies that Wellman acknowledges and accepts that the freedom of association can justify immigration policies that exclude certain races. If Wellman were to argue against such exclusions, this option would not align with his stance.\n\nC. **This is an unavoidable implication of all philosophical positions on immigration policy.**\n   - This option suggests that Wellman believes that every philosophical position on immigration policy inevitably leads to the justification of excluding certain races. This is a strong statement and may not accurately reflect Wellman's nuanced view.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option indicates that none of the provided statements correctly capture Wellman's claim.\n\nGiven the context and the options, the most plausible interpretation is that Wellman might argue against the justification of excluding individuals based on race under the guise of freedom of association. Therefore, the best fit seems to be:\n\n**A. Such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that Wellman would likely oppose such exclusionary policies as disrespectful to existing citizens of the same race."
