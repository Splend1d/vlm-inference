An absolute date refers to a year or a range of years, while a relative date indicates a chronological order.\n\nAn absolute date provides a specific point in time, often expressed as a year or a range of years. This type of dating is precise and can be determined using various scientific methods such as radiometric dating or historical records.\n\nOn the other hand, a relative date indicates the position of an event in a sequence without providing a specific year or range of years. It tells us whether one event occurred before or after another but does not give an exact calendar date. Relative dating is often used in archaeology and geology to establish the chronological order of events or layers."
