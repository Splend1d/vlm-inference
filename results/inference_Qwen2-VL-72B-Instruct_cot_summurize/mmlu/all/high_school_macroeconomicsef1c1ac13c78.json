This can be achieved by running a budget deficit, which means the government spends more than it collects in taxes. This can include increasing government spending on infrastructure, social programs, or other initiatives, as well as potentially reducing taxes to increase disposable income and encourage consumer spending. These actions aim to boost economic activity and help pull the economy out of recession."
