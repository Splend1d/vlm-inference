In this case, the observer (the student) is stationary while the source (the alarm) is moving towards the observer.\n\nWhen the alarm is falling, its speed increases due to gravity, causing it to move faster towards the observer as time goes on. This results in a higher frequency being detected by the observer because the distance between the observer and the source decreases more rapidly over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increase as it falls"
