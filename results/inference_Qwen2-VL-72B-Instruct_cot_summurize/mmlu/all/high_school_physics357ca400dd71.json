An increase in voltage tends to increase current, while an increase in resistance tends to decrease current. Without specific values, it's not guaranteed that the current will always increase.\n\nB. **Decreased voltage and decreased resistance**:\n   - A decrease in voltage tends to decrease current, while a decrease in resistance tends to increase current. Again, without specific values, it's not guaranteed that the current will always increase.\n\nC. **Increased voltage and decreased resistance**:\n   - An increase in voltage directly increases current, and a decrease in resistance also increases current. Both factors work together to ensure that the current will always increase.\n\nD. **Decreased voltage and increased resistance**:\n   - A decrease in voltage decreases current, and an increase in resistance further decreases current. This combination will always result in a decrease in current.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Increased voltage and decreased resistance"
