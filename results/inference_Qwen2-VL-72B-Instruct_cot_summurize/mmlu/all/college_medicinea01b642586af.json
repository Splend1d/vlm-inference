A VSD does not directly affect the oxygen content in the left atrium.\n\nB. **The percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle would be higher.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because the right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs. A VSD allows some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to mix with the deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle, but it doesn't necessarily increase the CO2 concentration.\n\nC. **The percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would be lower.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the vena cava. A VSD does not directly impact the oxygen content in the right atrium.\n\nD. **The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.**\n   - This statement is correct. In a VSD, some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle mixes with the deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle, increasing the overall oxygen content in the right ventricle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.**"
