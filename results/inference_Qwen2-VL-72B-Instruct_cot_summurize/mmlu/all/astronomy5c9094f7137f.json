A total solar eclipse occurs when an observer is in the umbra, not the penumbra.\n\nB. **The Moon's penumbra must touch the area where you are located.**\n   - This is incorrect for the same reason as option A. Observing a total solar eclipse requires being in the umbra, not the penumbra.\n\nC. **The Earth must be near aphelion in its orbit of the Sun.**\n   - Aphelion is the point in Earth's orbit that is farthest from the Sun. While the Earth's position in its orbit can affect the visibility of eclipses, it is not a requirement for observing a total solar eclipse. The primary requirement is related to the alignment and shadows.\n\nD. **The Moon's umbra must touch the area where you are located.**\n   - This is correct. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's umbra (the darkest part of the shadow) touches the Earth's surface, allowing an observer in that specific location to see the Sun completely obscured by the Moon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The Moon's umbra must touch the area where you are located.**"
