Both teams were staying at the same hotel. The assistant coach of one of the teams learned that the team captain of the other team was staying in the next room. In order to obtain information about the other team's strategy for the championship game, the assistant coach used electronic devices placed against the wall to listen to and record conversations between the team captain and his teammates. The assistant coach later bragged to others about having eavesdropped on the team captain, and the team captain eventually heard about what the assistant coach had done. If the team captain asserts a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy, will the team captain prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the assistant coach was recording the conversation for the use and advantage of his team.\nB. Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\nC. No, because the assistant coach's electronic devices did not physically intrude into the team captain's room.\nD. No, because there was publication of the recorded conversations.\n"

Yes, because the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\n\nExplanation:\nInvasion of privacy typically involves the violation of an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy. In this scenario, the team captain had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room, which is generally considered a private space. The assistant coach's actions of using electronic devices to listen to and record conversations without consent constitute an invasion of that privacy. Therefore, the team captain would likely have grounds to assert a claim against the assistant coach for invasion of privacy based on the reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room."
