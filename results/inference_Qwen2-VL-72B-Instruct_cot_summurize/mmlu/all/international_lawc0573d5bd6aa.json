Armed force was not regulated under international law prior to 1945\n\nBefore the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, there were no comprehensive international laws or treaties that specifically regulated the use of armed force between states. The concept of \"jus ad bellum\" (the right to wage war) was largely based on customary international law and the balance of power among nations. The League of Nations, established after World War I, aimed to prevent conflicts through diplomacy and collective security but lacked the authority and enforcement mechanisms to effectively regulate the use of armed force. Thus, the use of armed force was not systematically regulated by international law until the adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945."
