Honda separating its potential customers into economy car buyers and luxury car buyers.\n\nSegmentation in marketing refers to dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally divisible into subgroups (market segments), into smaller groups. These smaller groups within a market have common needs and will respond similarly to a marketing action. Market segmentation allows companies to target different groups with products that suit their individual needs better.\n\nIn option D, Honda is using market segmentation by dividing its potential customers into two distinct groups: economy car buyers and luxury car buyers. This allows Honda to tailor its marketing strategies and product offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment."
