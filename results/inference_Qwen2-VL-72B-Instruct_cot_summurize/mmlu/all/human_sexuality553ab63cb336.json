An anxious-ambivalent lover (also known as preoccupied attachment) tends to be overly concerned about the relationship and seeks constant reassurance from their partner. They may appear clingy or desperate because they fear abandonment and have difficulty trusting their partners. This description fits Joe's behavior towards Helen."
