However, it is likely that the number has increased over the past 25 years due to the growth of the consulting industry and the increasing demand for consulting services. Consulting firms provide a wide range of services, including strategic planning, organizational development, and technology implementation, and they often work with clients in various industries to help them improve their operations and achieve their goals. As a result, there may be more opportunities for individuals to work as consultants today than there were 25 years ago."
