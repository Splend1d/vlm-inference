The mode will increase.**\n- The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a data set. Adding a score of 100 does not necessarily change the frequency of any existing scores, so it doesn't directly affect the mode. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\n**B. The mean will increase.**\n- The mean (average) is calculated by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Since 100 is greater than any of her previous scores (which were between 75 and 89), adding it to the total sum will increase the overall sum without proportionally increasing the count as much. Thus, the mean will indeed increase. This statement is true.\n\n**C. The mean will decrease.**\n- As explained in B, the mean will actually increase with the addition of a score higher than any previous ones. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**D. The median will decrease.**\n- The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there is an odd number of scores, the median is the middle number; if even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. With the addition of a score of 100, which is higher than all previous scores, the median will shift towards this new high score, either directly becoming 100 or moving closer to it. Therefore, the median will not decrease; it will either stay the same or increase. This statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. The mean will increase.**"
