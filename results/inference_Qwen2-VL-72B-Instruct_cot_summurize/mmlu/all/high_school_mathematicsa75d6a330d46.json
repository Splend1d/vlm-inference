                    "text": "To determine how many terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ are odd, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(m+n)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k}n^k\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\binom{6}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $6$ items.\n\nFor each term in the expansion, the sign of the term (odd or even) depends on the values of $m$ and $n$, as well as the powers to which they are raised. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd integers, any power of $m$ or $n$ will also be odd. Therefore, the parity of each term in the expansion depends solely on the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{k}$.\n\nThe binomial coefficients for the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ are:\n\n- $\\binom{6}{0} = 1$\n- $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$\n- $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$\n- $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$\n- $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$\n- $\\binom{6}{5} = 6$\n- $\\binom{6}{6} = 1$\n\nAmong these, only $\\binom{6}{0}$ and $\\binom{6}{6}$ are odd numbers. This means that only two terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ will be odd, because all other terms will have an even coefficient multiplied by odd numbers ($m$ and $n$), resulting in even terms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2."
