For each meal, Joe has a \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) chance of choosing any specific fruit since he chooses with equal probabilities.\n\nThe probability of eating only one kind of fruit for all three meals is:\n- Eating only apples: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n- Eating only oranges: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n- Eating only bananas: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n\nAdding these probabilities gives us the total probability of eating only one kind of fruit:\n\\[P(\\text{only one kind}) = \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{3}{27} = \\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of eating at least two different kinds of fruit is:\n\\[P(\\text{at least two kinds}) = 1 - P(\\text{only one kind}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\)."
