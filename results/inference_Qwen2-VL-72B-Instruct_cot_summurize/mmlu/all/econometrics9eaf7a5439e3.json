Uncorrelated\n\nWhen standard tools for time-series analysis such as the autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and spectral analysis do not find any evidence of structure in the data, it suggests that there is no significant correlation between different points in time within the series. This means the data points are uncorrelated.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Normally distributed: The absence of structure does not imply normal distribution; it only indicates lack of correlation.\n\nC. Independent: While uncorrelated data can be independent, the converse is not necessarily true. Independence implies both uncorrelatedness and the absence of any other form of dependence, which cannot be concluded solely from the absence of correlation.\n\nD. Fat-tailed: The absence of structure does not provide information about the tail behavior of the distribution."
