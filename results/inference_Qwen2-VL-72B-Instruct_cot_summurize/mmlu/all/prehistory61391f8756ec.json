                    "text": "The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was enacted to address the ethical issues surrounding the excavation and handling of Native American human remains and cultural items. The act requires federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funding to return Native American cultural items, including human remains, to lineal descendants, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Both non-indigenous archaeologists and Native Americans are allowed onto the site at the same time.\n- This scenario does not inherently pose an ethical problem under NAGPRA. In fact, it could be beneficial for collaboration and mutual respect between different stakeholders.\n\nB. There are no Native Americans who have been trained as archaeologists and no archaeologists who are Native American.\n- While this situation might limit the involvement of Native Americans in the research process, it doesn't directly address the core ethical concerns of NAGPRA regarding the treatment of human remains and cultural items.\n\nC. Neither archaeologists nor Native Americans can agree on the exact location of burials at the site.\n- Disagreement over the location of burials could lead to delays and conflicts, but it doesn't directly relate to the ethical issues of repatriation and respectful handling of remains.\n\nD. Burials are so ancient that establishing historical or genealogical connections with modern, living groups of people is impossible.\n- This scenario presents a significant challenge because NAGPRA requires the return of human remains to culturally affiliated tribes. If such connections cannot be established due to the age of the remains, it complicates the process of repatriation and raises ethical questions about how to proceed respectfully and in accordance with the law.\n\nTherefore, the most problematic scenario in terms of adhering to the ethical guidelines set forth by NAGPRA is:\n\n**D. Burials are so ancient that establishing historical or genealogical connections with modern, living groups of people is impossible.**"
