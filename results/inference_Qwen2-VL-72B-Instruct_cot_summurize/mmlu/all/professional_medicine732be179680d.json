Urticaria, also known as hives, is a common skin condition characterized by itchy, red, raised bumps on the skin. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies, infections, and medications. In this case, since the patient's urticaria has occurred and resolved several times in the past week and there are no other abnormalities found on history and physical examination, it is likely that the cause is benign and self-limiting. Treatment with antihistamines or other symptomatic treatments may be sufficient to manage the patient's symptoms. Determining the serum IgE concentration or total eosinophil count may not be necessary at this time, and referral to an allergist may only be indicated if the urticaria persists or worsens despite treatment."
