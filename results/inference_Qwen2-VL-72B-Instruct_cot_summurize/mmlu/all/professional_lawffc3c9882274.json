In situation C, the defendants entered the doctor's office through an open window, broke into the medicine cabinet, and stole drugs. This scenario fits the definition of burglary because there was unlawful entry (even though the window was open, the entry was unauthorized) and the intent to commit theft.\n\nHere's why the other scenarios do not fit the definition of burglary:\n\nA. The defendant broke into the house to seek shelter from a severe snowstorm, which does not involve the intent to commit a felony or theft initially. The theft of the transistor radio occurred after the unlawful entry, but the primary intent was not theft.\n\nB. The defendant threw a brick through the window with the intent to harm the homeowner, but there was no unlawful entry into the building itself. Burglary requires both unlawful entry and the intent to commit a crime inside.\n\nD. The defendant broke into the hotel room to confront the guest about money owed from a bet. While this is illegal entry, the intent was not to commit theft or a felony inside the room; rather, it was to settle a debt through confrontation.\n\nTherefore, only situation C clearly meets the criteria for burglary."
