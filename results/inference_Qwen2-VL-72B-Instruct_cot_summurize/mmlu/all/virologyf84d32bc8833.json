The superficial appearance of a 'star' on negative straining electron microscopy\n\nAstroviruses are named for their characteristic star-like appearance when viewed under an electron microscope after negative staining. This appearance is due to the presence of five or six spikes radiating from the viral capsid, giving it a star-like shape."
