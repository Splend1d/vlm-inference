On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?\n\nA. Begin oral methyldopa\nB. Institute fundal massage\nC. Order daily sitz baths\nD. Provide education for well-baby care\n"

This includes teaching the mother about proper feeding techniques, how to recognize signs of illness or distress in the newborn, and when to seek medical attention. It is also important to ensure that the mother is aware of the importance of follow-up appointments for both herself and the baby. Additionally, it may be beneficial to discuss contraception options with the mother to prevent future unintended pregnancies."
