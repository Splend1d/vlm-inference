Since the electric field is given as a function of the radius, we can assume that the path is radial.\n\nThe electric field is given by:\n\nEr = -6r^2 + 4r + 3\n\nThe potential difference is given by:\n\nV = -\u222bEr dr\n\nwhere the limits of integration are from 0 to \u221a(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.\n\nSubstituting the expression for Er into the integral, we get:\n\nV = -\u222b(-6r^2 + 4r + 3) dr\n\n= -[-2r^3/3 + 2r^2 + 3r] evaluated from 0 to 5\n\n= -[(-2(5)^3/3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5)) - (-2(0)^3/3 + 2(0)^2 + 3(0))]\n\n= -[-2(125)/3 + 50 + 15]\n\n= -[-250/3 + 65]\n\n= -[-250/3 + 195/3]\n\n= -[-55/3]\n\n= 55/3\n\nTherefore, the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4) is 55/3 V, which is closest to option C, 64 V."
