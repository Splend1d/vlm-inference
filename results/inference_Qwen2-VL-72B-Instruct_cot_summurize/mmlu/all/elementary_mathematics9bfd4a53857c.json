First, calculate the number of shirts in one box: \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\).\n2. Then, multiply that by the number of boxes: \\( 3 \\times 28 = 84 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of shirts is 84.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( 12 \\times 3 \\)\n- This equals \\( 36 \\), which is not equal to 84.\n\nB. \\( 12 \\times 7 \\)\n- This equals \\( 84 \\), which matches our total number of shirts.\n\nC. \\( 28 \\times 4 \\)\n- This equals \\( 112 \\), which is not equal to 84.\n\nD. \\( 28 \\times 7 \\)\n- This equals \\( 196 \\), which is not equal to 84.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \\( 12 \\times 7 \\)."
