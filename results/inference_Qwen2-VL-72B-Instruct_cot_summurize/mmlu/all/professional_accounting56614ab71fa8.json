These limitations can include human error, management override, and the cost-benefit considerations of implementing controls.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee**:\n   - This is more about governance and oversight rather than an inherent limitation of the internal control system itself. It reflects a failure in the monitoring component of internal control but not an inherent limitation.\n\nB. **Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls**:\n   - While collusion can certainly undermine internal controls, it is not an inherent limitation. It is a risk that can be mitigated through proper design and implementation of controls.\n\nC. **The lack of resources to monitor internal controls**:\n   - This is a limitation related to the implementation and maintenance of controls rather than an inherent limitation of the control system itself. It is more about resource allocation and management decisions.\n\nD. **The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system**:\n   - Complexity in systems can inherently limit the effectiveness of internal controls because it increases the difficulty of designing, implementing, and maintaining effective controls. Complex systems may have more points of potential failure or require more sophisticated controls that might still not cover all risks.\n\nGiven these analyses, the factor that most likely would be considered an inherent limitation to an entity's internal control is:\n\n**D. The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system.**"
