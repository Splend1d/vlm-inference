RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\n\nRNA viruses are more prone to mutations during replication because their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (the enzymes responsible for copying RNA) do not have proofreading capabilities that are present in the DNA replication machinery. Proofreading mechanisms help to correct errors during DNA replication, reducing the mutation rate. In contrast, RNA viruses rely on error-prone replication processes, leading to a higher mutation rate."
