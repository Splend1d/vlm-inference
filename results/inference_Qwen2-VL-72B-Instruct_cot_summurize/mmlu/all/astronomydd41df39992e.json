The combination of a molten metallic core and rapid rotation helps create the necessary conditions for a strong magnetic field.\n\nD. **It rotates much faster than any other terrestrial world.**\n   - Rotation speed is important, but it alone is not sufficient to explain the strength of the magnetic field without considering the state of the core.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.**"
