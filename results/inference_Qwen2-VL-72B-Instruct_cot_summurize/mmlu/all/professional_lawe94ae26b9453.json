The petroleum derivatives were sold in ordinary glass gallon jugs. Shortly after putting the jugs in the back of his car, the scientist was driving along a city street. He was thinking about a difficult scientific question and not paying attention to his driving. As a result, he lost control of the car and drove up onto the sidewalk. The car flipped over. The glass jugs in the back of the car were broken, and the chemicals in them spilled out onto the sidewalk. Moments later, a doctor who witnessed the accident came running over to render medical assistance. As he approached the overturned car, however, the doctor slipped on the petroleum derivatives that had spilled onto the sidewalk. The doctor fell and fractured his ankle. If the doctor asserts a claim against the scientist based on strict liability, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.\nB. Yes, because the transportation of flammable petroleum derivatives in glass jugs necessarily involves a high degree of risk of serious harm.\nC. No, because the doctor assumed the risk by voluntarily acting as a Good Samaritan.\nD. No, because it was unforeseeable that the doctor's injury would result from the type of harm threatened.\n"

Yes, because the scientist was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity by transporting highly flammable petroleum derivatives in his car.\n\nStrict liability applies when an individual engages in an activity that is inherently dangerous, regardless of how carefully they perform it. Transporting highly flammable substances in a vehicle can be considered an abnormally dangerous activity due to the significant risk of harm it poses. Therefore, the scientist could be held strictly liable for any resulting injuries or damages, including the doctor's fractured ankle caused by slipping on the spilled petroleum derivatives."
