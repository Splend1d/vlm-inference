In this scenario, the photon must have enough energy to create both particles from its own energy. \n\nThe energy required to create one electron-positron pair is twice the rest mass energy of an electron (since both the electron and the positron have the same mass), which is \\(2mc^2\\).\n\nHowever, since the initial electron is also present and gains kinetic energy in the process, we need to account for its energy as well. Therefore, the total energy of the photon must be sufficient to create the electron-positron pair and provide kinetic energy to all three particles (the original electron and the newly created electron and positron).\n\nThus, the minimum energy of the photon must be \\(4mc^2\\) to ensure that it can create the pair and still leave enough energy for the kinetic motion of all three particles."
