Review that service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operation.\n\nWhen an audit client uses a service organization for several processes, the most efficient approach for a user auditor is to review the service auditor's report on controls placed in operation. This allows the user auditor to rely on the work performed by the service auditor, thereby reducing duplication of effort and enhancing audit efficiency. The service auditor's report typically provides assurance about the effectiveness of controls at the service organization, which can be relied upon by the user auditor in planning and performing their audit work."
