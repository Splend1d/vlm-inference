The trial court instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he had acted in self-defense. The defendant objected, arguing that this instruction violated the constitutional requirement that the prosecution prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Did the trial court's instruction violate the defendant's federal constitutional rights?\n\nA. No, because due process does not preclude requiring a defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, because due process does not regulate the burdens of proof in criminal cases.\nC. Yes, because due process precludes placing any evidentiary burden on a criminal defendant.\nD. Yes, because due process precludes requiring a criminal defendant to bear the burden on an issue that would make an act lawful.\n"

Yes, because due process precludes requiring a criminal defendant to bear the burden on an issue that would make an act lawful.\n\nIn criminal law, the prosecution bears the burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This includes disproving any affirmative defenses raised by the defendant, such as self-defense. Requiring the defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence shifts the burden onto the defendant, which is contrary to the principle that the prosecution must establish all elements of the crime, including negating any defenses, beyond a reasonable doubt. This shift in burden can be seen as violating the defendant's due process rights under the Constitution."
