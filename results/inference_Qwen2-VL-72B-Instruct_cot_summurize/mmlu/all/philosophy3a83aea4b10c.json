Hare, a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments would not be able to coherently use morality as a basis for protecting their own interests. This is because making moral judgments involves recognizing certain actions or behaviors as right or wrong, and using this recognition to guide one's behavior in a way that aligns with one's values and interests. Without the ability to make such judgments, it would be difficult to justify invoking morality to protect one's own interests."
