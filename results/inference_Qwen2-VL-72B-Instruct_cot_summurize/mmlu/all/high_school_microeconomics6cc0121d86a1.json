When a firm can practice price discrimination effectively, it captures more of the consumer surplus by charging higher prices to those who are willing and able to pay more (usually those with less elastic demand). As a result, overall consumer surplus decreases because consumers are paying closer to their maximum willingness to pay rather than a uniform market price that might have been lower."
