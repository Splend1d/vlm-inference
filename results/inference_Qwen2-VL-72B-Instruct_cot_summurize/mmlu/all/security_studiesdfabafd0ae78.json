They help us understand the workings of political subjecthoods that have been marginalized or ignored by traditional security discourses. This includes examining how identities and subjectivities are constructed within security narratives and policies.\n\nB. They allow for a deeper examination of the bases of power and its construction, revealing how power relations are embedded within seemingly neutral or objective security practices and discourses.\n\nC. They challenge the notion that technological advancements, such as smart weapons and advanced technologies, are the primary determinants of security. Instead, they highlight the social, political, and discursive dimensions that shape our understanding and experience of security.\n\nTherefore, all of these options reflect important aspects of a post-structuralist critique in security studies."
