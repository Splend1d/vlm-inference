Higher interest rates that decrease private investment.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes to stimulate economic growth. However, if higher interest rates resulting from this policy lead to decreased private investment, it can offset some of the intended stimulative effects of the fiscal policy. This phenomenon is known as \"crowding out,\" where increased government borrowing to fund its spending leads to higher interest rates, which in turn discourages private sector investment."
