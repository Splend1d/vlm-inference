Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services\n\nBeing stealthy in a penetration test means conducting the test in a way that minimizes detection by the target system's security controls and personnel. This involves avoiding actions that could trigger alarms or alerts, such as those generated by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or other monitoring tools. The goal is to simulate real-world attacks as closely as possible while minimizing disruption and ensuring that the test remains undetected until it is completed."
