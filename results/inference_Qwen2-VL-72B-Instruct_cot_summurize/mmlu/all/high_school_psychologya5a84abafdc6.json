They believe that psychological disorders can arise when individuals are unable to fulfill their basic human needs or when they face obstacles in their path to self-actualization. This perspective contrasts with other approaches that might focus on biological factors (neurochemical imbalances), cognitive processes (unhealthy attributional styles), or learning experiences (learned associations)."
