Psychoanalysts: Psychoanalysis focuses on unconscious processes and the resolution of internal conflicts. Structuralism, however, is more concerned with the structure of mental processes rather than their underlying causes.\n\nB. Behaviorists: Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and how they are shaped by external stimuli. Structuralism, in contrast, is more interested in the internal mental structures that underlie these behaviors.\n\nC. Cognitivists: Cognitive psychology focuses on mental processes such as perception, memory, problem-solving, and language. Structuralism also examines the structure of mental processes, making this a strong match.\n\nD. Humanists: Humanistic psychology emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and subjective experience. Structuralism does not focus on these aspects but rather on the structure of mental processes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the focus of structuralists most closely matches the current perspective of:\n\nC. Cognitivists"
