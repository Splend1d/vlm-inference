Under some circumstances, the death penalty may not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty does not inherently violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. However, it has also established certain restrictions and guidelines regarding its application to ensure it is not applied in a cruel or unusual manner. For example, the Court has held that executing individuals with intellectual disabilities or those who were under 18 at the time of their crime would violate the Eighth Amendment."
