Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\n- An equivalence relation on a set is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial-ordering relation, on the other hand, is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Since an equivalence relation requires symmetry while a partial-ordering relation requires antisymmetry, not every equivalence relation can be a partial-ordering relation. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nB. Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2}, is 64.\n- The number of relations from set A to set B is given by \\(2^{(n_A \\times n_B)}\\), where \\(n_A\\) is the number of elements in set A and \\(n_B\\) is the number of elements in set B. Here, \\(n_A = 3\\) and \\(n_B = 2\\). So, the number of relations is \\(2^{(3 \\times 2)} = 2^6 = 64\\). This statement is true.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\n- A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. The empty relation, which contains no elements, trivially satisfies this condition because there are no elements for which it could fail to be reflexive. Thus, the empty relation is considered reflexive. This statement is true.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n- A relation is symmetric if whenever (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation. A relation is asymmetric if whenever (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is not in the relation. These properties are indeed mutually exclusive; a relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric at the same time. However, the term \"negative\" might be misleading here, as it suggests a mathematical negation rather than mutual exclusivity. Despite this semantic issue, the core idea that they cannot both hold simultaneously is correct. This statement is true with the clarification provided.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are B, C, and D."
