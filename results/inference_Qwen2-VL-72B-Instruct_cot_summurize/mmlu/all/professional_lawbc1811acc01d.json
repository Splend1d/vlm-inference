The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\n\nIn legal terms, standing refers to a party's ability to demonstrate sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case. For the Sheriff to have standing, he must show that he has suffered or will imminently suffer a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.\n\nIn this scenario, the Sheriff's claim is based on a speculative possibility of future harm, such as increased crime and resource drain due to the implementation of DACA. Courts generally require a more direct and immediate impact rather than a hypothetical or conjectural one to establish standing. Therefore, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is likely to affirm the dismissal of the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing."
