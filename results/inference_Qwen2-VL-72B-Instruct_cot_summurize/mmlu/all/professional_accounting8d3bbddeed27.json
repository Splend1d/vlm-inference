Let's re-examine the given values and ensure they are correctly applied.\n\nGiven:\n- Covariance between Stock A and the market: \\(88\\)\n- Standard deviation of Stock A: \\(19\\%\\)\n- Standard deviation of the market: \\(14\\%\\)\n\nThe correct formula for beta should be:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Covariance (Stock A, Market)}}{\\text{Standard Deviation (Stock A)} \\times \\text{Standard Deviation (Market)}}\n\\]\n\nUsing the correct formula:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{88}{0.19 \\times 0.14} \\approx \\frac{88}{0.0266} \\approx 3299.25\n\\]\n\nAgain, none of the provided options match this result. It appears there was an error in the interpretation of the covariance value or the units used. Given the context and typical values for covariance and standard deviations in finance, it seems likely that the covariance value provided might not be in the correct unit or scale.\n\nGiven the options and the typical range for beta values, let's reconsider the calculation with the correct understanding that covariance should be in the same unit as the product of the standard deviations squared (variances). If the covariance was intended to be in percentage terms or another unit compatible with the standard deviations, the calculation would need to reflect that properly.\n\nAssuming the covariance value was meant to be in a compatible unit for direct calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{88}{0.19 \\times 0.14} \\approx \\frac{88}{0.0266} \\approx 3299.25\n\\]\n\nThis still does not align with the provided options. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question's setup or the provided data. Given the standard approach and typical values, the correct calculation should yield a beta within a reasonable range for financial analysis, which none of the provided options seem to fit based on the initial interpretation.\n\nGiven the discrepancy and the nature of the question, it's important to ensure all values are correctly interpreted and aligned with standard financial calculations. The provided options do not match the calculated results under typical assumptions, suggesting a potential error in the question's setup or the interpretation of the provided data."
