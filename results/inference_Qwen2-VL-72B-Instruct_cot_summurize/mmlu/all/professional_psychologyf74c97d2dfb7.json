This procedure, known as a split-brain surgery, is typically done to treat severe cases of epilepsy. In such patients, the left hemisphere (which controls the right side of the body and is usually dominant for language in right-handed individuals) cannot communicate with the right hemisphere (which controls the left side of the body).\n\nAs a result, if an object is placed in the left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere), and the patient cannot see it, they may not be able to name it because the information about the object does not reach the language centers in the left hemisphere. This phenomenon is known as \"left-hand agnosia\" or \"left-hand blindness.\"\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. **cannot carry out well-learned motor tasks with the left hand** - While there might be some disruption in coordination due to the lack of interhemispheric communication, well-learned motor tasks are generally less affected than more complex cognitive functions.\n\nB. **Cannot name objects placed in the right hand if the patient can see them** - If the patient can see the object, the visual information goes directly to the left hemisphere, which can process and name the object without needing input from the right hemisphere.\n\nD. **shows a decline in verbal intelligence** - There might be some decline in certain aspects of verbal intelligence due to the disruption of interhemispheric communication, but this is not a direct consequence of the specific task described in option C."
