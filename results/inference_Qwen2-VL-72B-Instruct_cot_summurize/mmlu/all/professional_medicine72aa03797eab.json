He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?\n\nA. Decreasing myocardial contractility\nB. Dilating the coronary arteries\nC. Peripheral vasodilation\nD. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs\n"

Decreasing myocardial contractility\n\n\u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents, also known as beta blockers, work by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the body. This results in a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. By decreasing myocardial contractility, these medications reduce the workload on the heart and the amount of oxygen it needs, which can help alleviate symptoms of angina (chest pain) in patients with coronary artery disease. In this case, the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing chest pain on exertion suggest that he may benefit from treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent to reduce his symptoms through this mechanism."
