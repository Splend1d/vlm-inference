People are generally more attracted to others who share similar attitudes, values, and interests. This concept is often referred to as the \"similarity-attraction hypothesis.\" While there may be exceptions or specific contexts where some level of complementarity can play a role in attraction, the overall evidence supports the idea that similarity is a stronger predictor of attraction than dissimilarity."
