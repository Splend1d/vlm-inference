Heritable variation means that traits can be passed from parents to offspring, allowing for differences within a population.\n\nB. **Poorly adapted individuals never produce offspring.**\n   - This statement is too absolute and does not align with observations of natural selection. While poorly adapted individuals may have lower reproductive success, it is not accurate to say they \"never\" produce offspring.\n\nC. **Species produce more offspring than the environment can support.**\n   - This is a key observation in natural selection. Overproduction of offspring leads to competition for limited resources, which drives natural selection.\n\nD. **Individuals whose characteristics are best suited to the environment generally leave more offspring than those whose characteristics are less suited.**\n   - This is a direct inference of natural selection. It describes differential reproductive success based on adaptation to the environment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is not an observation or inference on which natural selection is based is:\n\n**B. Poorly adapted individuals never produce offspring.**"
