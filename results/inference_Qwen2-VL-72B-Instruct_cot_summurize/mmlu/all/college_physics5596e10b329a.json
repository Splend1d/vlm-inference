This is described by Malus's Law, which states that the intensity \\( I \\) of the transmitted light is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer:\n\n\\[ I = I_0 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\( I_0 \\) is the initial intensity.\n\nFor the first polarizer, since the incident light is unpolarized, it can be considered as having equal components in all directions. After passing through the first polarizer, the intensity is reduced to half (since \\( \\cos^2(90^\\circ/2) = \\cos^2(45^\\circ) = (\\sqrt{2}/2)^2 = 1/2 \\)).\n\nAfter the first polarizer, the light is now linearly polarized along the axis of the first polarizer. When this polarized light passes through the second polarizer, which is oriented at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the first polarizer, we again apply Malus's Law:\n\n\\[ I_{\\text{final}} = I_{\\text{after first polarizer}} \\cos^2(45^\\circ) \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ I_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{I_0}{4} \\]\n\nThus, the final transmitted intensity is one-fourth of the original intensity, which corresponds to 25%. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 25%."
