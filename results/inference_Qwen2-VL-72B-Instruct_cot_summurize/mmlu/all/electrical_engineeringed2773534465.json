Shunt Capacitor: A shunt capacitor is connected in parallel with the load to provide reactive power and improve the power factor.\n\nB. Series Capacitor: A series capacitor is connected in series with the transmission line to compensate for the inductive reactance of the line and improve the voltage profile.\n\nC. Generation Excitation Control: Generation excitation control involves adjusting the excitation current of generators to regulate the reactive power output and maintain the desired voltage level.\n\nTherefore, all of the above methods (A, B, and C) can be used for reactive or voltage compensation."
