                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is true regarding money and financial markets:\n\nA. **As the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. When the demand for bonds increases, bond prices go up because more people want to buy them. As bond prices increase, the yield (interest rate) on those bonds decreases. Therefore, an increase in demand for bonds typically leads to a decrease in interest rates.\n\nB. **For a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The velocity of money (V) is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP (P \u00d7 Q) to the money supply (M). If nominal GDP increases while the money supply remains constant, the velocity of money would actually increase, not decrease, because V = Nominal GDP / Money Supply.\n\nC. **When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.**\n   - This statement is correct. When investors shift their preferences towards stocks and bonds, they are likely to sell some of their liquid assets (like cash or money market instruments) to purchase these securities. This reduces the amount of money held as an asset, thus decreasing the asset demand for money.\n\nD. **A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. During a recession, businesses and consumers tend to reduce borrowing due to lower confidence and reduced economic activity. Therefore, the demand for loanable funds usually decreases during a recession.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.**"
