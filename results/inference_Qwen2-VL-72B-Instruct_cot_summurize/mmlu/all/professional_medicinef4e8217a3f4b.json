Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n"

CMV is a common opportunistic infection in transplant recipients, particularly those who are immunosuppressed.\n\nGiven this context, the most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n\nGanciclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against CMV infections. It is commonly used to treat CMV in transplant patients. Increasing the dosage of corticosteroids or cyclosporine could exacerbate the infection due to further immunosuppression. Amphotericin is an antifungal agent and would not be appropriate for a viral infection."
