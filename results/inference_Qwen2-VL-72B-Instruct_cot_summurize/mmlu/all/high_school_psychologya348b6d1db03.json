Increase the speed with which messages can be transmitted\n\nThe myelin sheath is a layer of fatty tissue that surrounds the axons of many neurons, acting as an insulator. This insulation allows for faster transmission of electrical signals along the neuron's axon by enabling a process called saltatory conduction. In this process, the electrical signal jumps from one node of Ranvier (unmyelinated gaps) to the next, rather than traveling continuously along the entire length of the axon. This significantly increases the speed at which neural impulses are conducted."
