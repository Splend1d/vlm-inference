Detecting the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet by looking for the Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum.\n\nThis technique, known as the radial velocity method, involves measuring the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The Doppler effect causes the star's light to shift slightly in wavelength as it moves towards and away from us, which can be detected and analyzed to infer the presence and properties of the planet. This method has been particularly effective in discovering exoplanets, especially those that are massive and orbit close to their stars, such as hot Jupiters."
