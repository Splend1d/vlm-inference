Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources. Between 20 - 30 million have lost their lives in more than one hundred intra-state wars and there are 20 - 40 wars ongoing in any given year.\nB. Conceptually there is a need to find appropriate theories and concepts that accommodate the unique character of the security situation in the developing world; intra-state war, communal violence, poverty, famine, weapons proliferation, crime, political instability, socio-economic breakdown and state collapse.\nC. From a normative perspective there are clear humanitarian imperatives to resolve the lack of security; 90 per cent of victims of intra-state violence are civilians, half a million are killed by light weapons, 40,000 a year die from hunger and poverty whilst tens of millions die from disease, chronic poverty, and inadequate health, education, employment, and environmental causes.\nD. All of these options. There is a profound disjuncture between security in developed nations and the kind of security in the world's \"zones of instability\". From a global perspective insecurity is more of a norm than security is. However, globalization essentially means that these forms of insecurity cannot be contained within increasingly porous national borders.\n"

All of these options.\n\nThe need to establish the nature and consequences of insecurity in the developing world is multifaceted and encompasses empirical, conceptual, and normative dimensions, as well as the broader implications of globalization. Each option highlights a critical aspect of this complex issue:\n\nA. The empirical need underscores the statistical reality of ongoing conflict and violence primarily occurring within developing countries, with significant human costs.\n\nB. The conceptual need points to the requirement for tailored theoretical frameworks that can effectively address the specific challenges and dynamics present in the developing world.\n\nC. The normative perspective emphasizes the moral obligation to alleviate suffering and improve conditions for the vast numbers of people affected by insecurity.\n\nD. The global perspective recognizes that the interconnectedness of the modern world means that issues of insecurity in the developing world cannot be isolated and have far-reaching implications for international stability and security.\n\nTogether, these perspectives provide a comprehensive rationale for understanding and addressing the nature and consequences of insecurity in the developing world."
