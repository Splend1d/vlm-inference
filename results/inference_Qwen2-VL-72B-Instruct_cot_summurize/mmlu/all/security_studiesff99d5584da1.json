Global strategic environment; type of provocation; image of war.\nB. Unilateral or coalitional coercive diplomacy; isolation of the adversary; clarity of objective; strength of motivation and asymmetry of motivation.\nC. Sense of urgency; strong leadership; domestic support; international support; opponents fear of unacceptable escalation; clarity concerning the precise terms of settlement.\nD. All of these options. George and Simons distinguish between contextual variables and conditions favouring success, and the idea that they should be used by decisionmakers at different stages in the policymaking process.\n"

George and Simons distinguish between contextual variables and conditions favoring success, and the idea that they should be used by decision-makers at different stages in the policymaking process.\n\nIn their analysis of coercive diplomacy, George and Simons identify various factors that can influence the outcomes of such acts. These factors include:\n\n1. **Global Strategic Environment**: The broader geopolitical context in which the coercive action takes place can significantly impact its effectiveness.\n2. **Type of Provocation**: The nature of the provocation that leads to the use of coercive diplomacy can affect how it is perceived and responded to.\n3. **Image of War**: Perceptions about the likelihood and consequences of war can shape the willingness of states to engage in or respond to coercive diplomacy.\n4. **Unilateral or Coalitional Coercive Diplomacy**: Whether the coercive action is taken by one state alone or as part of a coalition can influence its credibility and effectiveness.\n5. **Isolation of the Adversary**: The degree to which the target state feels isolated or supported by other states can affect its response to coercive measures.\n6. **Clarity of Objective**: Clear and well-defined objectives can enhance the effectiveness of coercive diplomacy.\n7. **Strength of Motivation**: The level of commitment and determination of the coercing party can influence the outcome.\n8. **Asymmetry of Motivation**: Differences in motivation between the coercing and target states can affect the balance of power and the likelihood of success.\n9. **Sense of Urgency**: The perception of time pressure can drive decisions and responses.\n10. **Strong Leadership**: Effective leadership within the coercing state can improve the chances of success.\n11. **Domestic Support**: Support from the domestic population can bolster the coercing state's resolve.\n12. **International Support**: Backing from the international community can add legitimacy and leverage.\n13. **Opponents Fear of Unacceptable Escalation**: If the target state fears that escalation could lead to unacceptable costs, it may be more inclined to comply with demands.\n14. **Clarity Concerning the Precise Terms of Settlement**: Clear and specific terms for resolution can facilitate agreement.\n\nGeorge and Simons suggest that policymakers should consider these factors at different stages of the policymaking process to increase the likelihood of successful coercive diplomacy."
