Convergent validity refers to how well a measure correlates with other measures that are supposed to assess the same construct, while discriminant validity refers to how well a measure does not correlate with measures that are supposed to assess different constructs. This matrix helps researchers understand whether their measures are distinct from one another and whether they accurately capture the intended constructs."
