                    "text": "To determine which option is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive for this goose species, we need to consider what \"adaptive\" means in an evolutionary context. Adaptation refers to traits or behaviors that increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.**\n   - This statement provides information about the relative number of nests but does not directly address whether cliff nesting is adaptive. It could be due to various factors unrelated to adaptation, such as resource availability or predation pressure.\n\nB. **Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.**\n   - This statement directly addresses the concept of adaptation. If cliff-side nesting results in higher fitness (i.e., greater survival and reproductive success), it would support the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive.\n\nC. **Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.**\n   - While this might suggest some level of adaptation, it doesn't provide evidence that cliff nesting itself is adaptive compared to beach nesting. It only indicates that chicks have developed a behavior to cope with the cliff environment.\n\nD. **More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.**\n   - This statement implies that there is a net positive survival rate for chicks falling from cliffs, but it doesn't compare cliff nesting to beach nesting in terms of overall fitness.\n\nGiven these analyses, the option that most directly supports the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive is:\n\n**B. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.**\n\nThis option explicitly states that cliff nesting leads to higher fitness, which is the core definition of an adaptive trait."
