                    "text": "To determine which statements must be true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law, let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. **The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.**\n   - This is a direct statement of Raoult's law. According to Raoult's law, the partial vapor pressure of each component in a solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nII. **The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.**\n   - This statement pertains to ideal behavior in terms of volume additivity. While it might hold true for some mixtures, it is not a requirement for a mixture to obey Raoult's law. Raoult's law deals with vapor pressures and mole fractions, not necessarily with volume additivity. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. **Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components.**\n   - For a mixture to obey Raoult's law, the intermolecular interactions between different molecules (i.e., solute-solvent interactions) must be similar to those within the pure components (i.e., solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions). This condition ensures that the vapor pressures behave ideally. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. I and III only**"
