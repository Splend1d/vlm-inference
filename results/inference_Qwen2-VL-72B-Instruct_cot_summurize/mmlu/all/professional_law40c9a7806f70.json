At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n"

In this scenario, the tenant installed appliances and an air-conditioning system for their commercial enterprise, and these items can be considered trade fixtures. Since the removal did not cause any damage to the building, the tenant was within their rights to remove these fixtures upon vacating the premises."
