Upon entering the apartment, he violently assaulted her. Although she tried to resist, he overpowered and raped her. The man testified that during dinner, he and the victim drank two bottles of Champagne. When they returned to his apartment, he was so intoxicated that he honestly believed that she consented to the intercourse. The jury determined that the victim did not consent to the intercourse. The jury also found that the man, as a result of his intoxication, honestly but unreasonably believed that she was consenting. As a consequence, the defendant should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he honestly believed that the victim consented.\nB. not guilty, because his intoxication negated his criminal intent.\nC. guilty, because rape is a general intent crime.\nD. guilty, because she did not consent, and his belief that she was consenting was unreasonable.\n"

Rape is generally considered a general intent crime, meaning that the prosecution must prove that the defendant intentionally engaged in sexual intercourse without the victim's consent. The defendant's intoxication does not negate his criminal intent if he acted with the intention to have sex without the victim's consent.\n\nThe fact that the jury found the man's belief in the victim's consent to be honest but unreasonable means that while he genuinely thought she consented, this belief was not based on reasonable grounds. Therefore, even though he may have honestly believed she consented, his belief was unreasonable, and thus he cannot use it as a defense against the charge of rape."
