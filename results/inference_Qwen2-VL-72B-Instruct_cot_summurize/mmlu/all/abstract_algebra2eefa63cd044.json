Therefore, \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Hence, Statement 1 is false.\n\n### Statement 2: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nA polynomial is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nThe polynomial \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored as:\n\\[ 4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1) \\]\n\nBoth factors, \\(2\\) and \\(2x - 1\\), have rational coefficients. Therefore, \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Hence, Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are false. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
