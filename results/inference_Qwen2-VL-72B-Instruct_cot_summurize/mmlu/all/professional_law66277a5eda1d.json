By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

When the tenant assigned the lease to the student, the student became responsible for fulfilling the obligations under the lease, including the payment of taxes, even though the assignment was silent on this point. The fact that the landlord did not object to the assignment suggests acceptance of the new arrangement.\n\nWhen the landlord conveyed the property to the new owner, the new owner inherited all rights and responsibilities associated with the property, including the right to enforce the lease agreement against the tenant (now the student). Since the student failed to pay the taxes, the new owner, having paid them, has the right to seek reimbursement from the student for the amount paid. Therefore, judgment should be for the new owner."
