The other options listed have specific meanings related to ethics and warfare:\n\n- Jus ad bellum refers to the justification for going to war, focusing on when it is morally acceptable to initiate a war.\n- Antiwar pacifism is an opposition to war based on principles of nonviolence.\n- Just war theory is a framework that attempts to justify morally acceptable reasons for engaging in war."
