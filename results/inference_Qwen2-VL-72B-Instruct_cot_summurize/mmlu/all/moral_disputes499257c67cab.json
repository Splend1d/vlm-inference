However, this doesn't directly address the impact on the criminals themselves or the broader societal implications of the death penalty.\n\nB. **That the death penalty is a better deterrent than life imprisonment.**\n   - This option suggests that the refusal to execute criminals leads to the conclusion that the death penalty is more effective in preventing crime compared to life imprisonment. However, Reiman's argument would likely focus on the effectiveness of deterrence rather than comparing it to another form of punishment.\n\nC. **That criminals already face the risk of death.**\n   - This option implies that criminals are aware of the possibility of facing death as a consequence of their actions. While this might be true, it doesn't directly relate to the specific lesson taught by refusing to execute them.\n\nD. **That criminals are usually undeterred by the chance of receiving the death penalty.**\n   - This option suggests that the refusal to execute criminals teaches that the threat of the death penalty does not effectively deter criminals from committing crimes. This aligns with the idea that the death penalty may not serve as an effective deterrent, which could be a point Reiman makes.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**D. That criminals are usually undeterred by the chance of receiving the death penalty.**"
