There are only two distinct (non-isomorphic) groups of order 4:\n\n1. The cyclic group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), which has elements {0, 1, 2, 3} under addition modulo 4.\n2. The Klein four-group \\( V_4 \\), which can be represented as {e, a, b, c} where \\( e \\) is the identity element and each non-identity element squared gives the identity (i.e., \\( a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e \\)).\n\nGiven three groups G, H, and K of order 4, they must each belong to one of these two types. Since there are only two types, it follows that at least two of these groups must be of the same type, and hence isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) is isomorphic to a subgroup \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), then \\( r \\) divides \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) divides \\( n \\).\n\nLet's examine the structure of direct sums of cyclic groups. The direct sum \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) consists of pairs of elements from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_s \\). For such a direct sum to be isomorphic to a subgroup of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), the orders of the components must align in a way that respects divisibility.\n\nFor \\( \\mathbb{Z}_r + \\mathbb{Z}_s \\) to be isomorphic to a subgroup of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m + \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), each component of the direct sum must fit into the corresponding component of the larger group. This means that the order of each component in the smaller group must divide the order of the corresponding component in the larger group. Hence, \\( r \\) must divide \\( m \\) and \\( s \\) must divide \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **True**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
