The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Azathioprine\nB. Infliximab\nC. Lubiprostone\nD. Mesalamine\n"

Lubiprostone.\n\nLubiprostone is a medication used to treat chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). It works by increasing fluid secretion into the intestines, which helps to soften stools and make them easier to pass. This can help alleviate symptoms such as abdominal bloating, discomfort, and constipation, which are common in IBS-C.\n\nAzathioprine and infliximab are immunosuppressive medications typically used to treat inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine is also used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. However, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the diagnostic tests, there is no evidence of an inflammatory condition. Therefore, these medications would not be appropriate for this patient."
