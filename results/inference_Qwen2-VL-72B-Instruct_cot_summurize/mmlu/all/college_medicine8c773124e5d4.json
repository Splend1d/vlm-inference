Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.\nB. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.\nC. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\nD. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.\n"

The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\n\nNeurotransmitters are typically secreted from the axon terminal (or presynaptic terminal) of the transmitting neuron, not from its dendrites. Dendrites are primarily responsible for receiving signals from other neurons."
