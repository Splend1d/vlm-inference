The starting player wins on the first toss with probability \\( P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n2. The starting player wins on the second toss (both players get tails, then the starting player gets heads):\n   \\[ P(T) \\times P(T) \\times P(H) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\]\n3. The starting player wins on the third toss (both players get tails twice, then the starting player gets heads):\n   \\[ P(T) \\times P(T) \\times P(T) \\times P(T) \\times P(H) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 \\]\n4. And so on...\n\nThis forms a geometric series where each term is half the previous term:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3, \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5, \\ldots \\]\n\nThe sum of this infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\]\nwhere \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( r = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nThus,\n\\[ S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}} \\]"
