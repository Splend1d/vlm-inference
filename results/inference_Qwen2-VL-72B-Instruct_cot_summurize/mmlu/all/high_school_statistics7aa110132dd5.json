It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.\nB. It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\nC.

It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\n\nThis option highlights that the discrepancy arises because the newspaper poll may have sampled respondents who were more likely to respond (and potentially more likely to hold certain opinions), whereas the actual vote included all those who chose to participate, which might have been a different subset of the population. This nonrandom selection can lead to a systematic bias in the results."
