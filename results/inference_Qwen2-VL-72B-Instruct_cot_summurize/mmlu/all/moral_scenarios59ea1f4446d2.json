This inaction can be considered morally wrong because it neglects the duty to help someone in danger.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character did not know the answers to an exam.\n- A friend helped them study for the exam.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character sought assistance to prepare for an exam. While there might be concerns about academic integrity if the help involved cheating during the exam itself, simply studying together with a friend is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrong due to the failure to act in a situation where help is urgently needed.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve a clear moral wrong, assuming the help provided was legitimate and did not involve cheating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
