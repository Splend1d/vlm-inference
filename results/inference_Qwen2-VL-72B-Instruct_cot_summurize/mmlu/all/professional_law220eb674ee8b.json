However, it does not directly address the specific context or the relevance of the evidence in question.\n\nB. **One incident doesn't prove character.**\n   - This argument points out that a single instance of honesty (refusing to lie about a psychiatric problem) does not necessarily establish a pattern of honesty or overall character. It challenges the reliability of using one isolated event to infer broader traits.\n\nC. **This is an impermissible way to prove character.**\n   - This statement implies that the method of proving character through a single incident is not allowed by legal standards. While it touches on the admissibility issue, it is less specific than Option B.\n\nD. **The evidence is irrelevant.**\n   - This argument claims that the evidence from the mayoral campaign is not relevant to the tax fraud case. It directly addresses the core issue of whether the evidence pertains to the current charges.\n\nGiven these options, the most compelling argument is:\n\n**B. One incident doesn't prove character.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the issue of using a single incident to infer broader character traits, which is a critical consideration when evaluating the admissibility and relevance of character evidence in legal proceedings."
