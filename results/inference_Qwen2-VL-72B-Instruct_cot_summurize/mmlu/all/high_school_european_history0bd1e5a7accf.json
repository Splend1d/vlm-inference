In fact it is now absolutely clear that to delay the uprising would be fatal.\nWith all my might I urge comrades to realize that everything now hangs by a thread; that we are confronted by problems which are not to be solved by conferences or congresses (even congresses of Soviets), but exclusively by peoples, by the masses, by the struggle of the armed people. \u2026\nWho must take power? That is not important at present. Let the Revolutionary Military Committee do it, or \"some other institution\" which will declare that it will relinquish power only to the true representatives of the interests of the people, the interests of the army, the interests of the peasants, the interests of the starving.\nAll districts, all regiments, all forces must be mobilized at once and must immediately send their delegations to the Revolutionary Military Committee and to the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks with the insistent demand that under no circumstances should power be left in the hands of Kerensky [and his colleagues], \u2026 not under any circumstances; the matter must be decided without fail this very evening, or this very night.\nVladmir Illyich Lenin, \"Call to Power,\" 1917\nFrom the passage, one may infer that the immediate context for Lenin's \"Call to Power\" was\n\nA.

The onset of the October Revolution**"
