All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nTo modern historians, the publication of this pamphlet is remembered for coinciding with which of the following events?\n\nA. A series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year\nB. The Ottoman Empire's increasing pressure upon the Greek Peninsula\nC. A new system of underground pamphlet distribution\nD. The re-emergence of anti-Semitism as a potent European force\n"
