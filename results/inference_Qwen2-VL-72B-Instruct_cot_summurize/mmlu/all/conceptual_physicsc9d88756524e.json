The amount of bending (or refraction) that each color undergoes depends on its wavelength. Light with shorter wavelengths is bent more than light with longer wavelengths. Green light has a shorter wavelength than red light but a longer wavelength than blue and violet light. Therefore, green light is bent more than red light but less than blue and violet light."
