At trial, the court has allowed the plaintiff to introduce the deposition testimony of a witness, now deceased, that he was with the plaintiff at the time of the incident. The defendant now seeks to impeach the testimony of the witness with his 13-year-old conviction for burglary (for which he served 18 months in prison) for breaking into the home of a neighbor while she was away and taking some of her valuable jewelry. Should the court allow evidence of the conviction?\n\nA. No, because the witness did not testify at trial.\nB. No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\nC. Yes, because prior convictions are probative to impeach the witness's character for truthfulness.\nD. Yes, because the crime involved an act of dishonesty.\n"

No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nIn this scenario, the witness is no longer available to testify at trial, but their deposition testimony has been admitted as evidence. Under Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 609 governs the admissibility of evidence of a witness's criminal conviction to attack the witness's character for truthfulness. However, Rule 609 also includes provisions that limit the use of such evidence when the witness is unavailable or when the conviction is more than ten years old.\n\nGiven that the witness is deceased and cannot be cross-examined, the court must consider whether allowing evidence of the conviction would serve the interests of justice and whether the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it might have on the jury. Since the conviction is 13 years old, it falls outside the general 10-year limit for admissibility under Rule 609(b), which requires the court to make a specific finding regarding the balance between probative value and prejudicial effect before admitting such evidence."
