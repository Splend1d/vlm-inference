                    "text": "C. Energy flow between trophic levels is inefficient.\n\nThis statement is true because as energy flows through an ecosystem from one trophic level to the next (e.g., from producers to primary consumers, then to secondary consumers, etc.), there is a significant loss of energy at each step. This inefficiency is primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that some energy is always lost as heat during energy transformations. Typically, only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next, with the rest being lost as heat or used for metabolic processes by the organisms at the current trophic level."
