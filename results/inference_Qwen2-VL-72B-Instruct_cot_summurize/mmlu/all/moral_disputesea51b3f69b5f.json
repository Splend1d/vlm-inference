While it aligns with democratic values, it doesn't directly address Dershowitz's specific arguments on torture.\n\nC. **\"Torture warrants\" should be part of a legal system regulating the practice of torture.**\n   - Dershowitz has proposed the idea of \"torture warrants,\" suggesting that if torture is deemed necessary in certain extreme cases, it should be regulated through a legal process involving judicial oversight.\n\nGiven these analyses, options A and C accurately reflect views that Dershowitz has argued for. Option B, while important, does not specifically capture his stance on torture.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. all of the above**"
