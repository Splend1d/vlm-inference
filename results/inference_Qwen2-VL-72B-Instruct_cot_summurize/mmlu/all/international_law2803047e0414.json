The flag State\n\nAccording to international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the flag State (the country under whose flag the vessel is registered) generally has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board its vessels. This principle is based on the concept of \"flag State jurisdiction,\" which allows the flag State to exercise control and jurisdiction over its ships and their crews while they are at sea. However, there can be exceptions or specific circumstances where other States may also have jurisdiction, such as when a crime affects the interests of another State or occurs within the territorial waters of another State."
