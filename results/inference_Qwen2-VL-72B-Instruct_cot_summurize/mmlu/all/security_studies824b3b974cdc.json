Governments have indeed increased efforts to prevent the spread of weapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), through various international agreements and export control regimes.\n\nB. The volume of the arms trade has grown, driven by factors such as regional conflicts, modernization programs of armed forces, and the increasing demand for advanced military technologies.\n\nC. The nature of the defense trade has changed, reflecting shifts in the types of conflicts being fought. This includes a greater emphasis on counter-insurgency equipment, cyber defense capabilities, and unmanned systems, among others.\n\nTherefore, all of the listed trends have emerged in the global defense trade since the end of the Cold War."
