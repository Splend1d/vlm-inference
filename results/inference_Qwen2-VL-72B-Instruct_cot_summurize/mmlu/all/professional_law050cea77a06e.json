He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: \"I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. \"The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\nC. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\nD. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n"

However, due to unforeseen circumstances (the supplier's inability to provide the burglar alarms), the alarm company incurred additional costs of $10,000.\n\nGiven these details, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **$100,000, because that was the contract price.**\n   - This option suggests that the alarm company should receive the original contract price of $100,000. However, this does not account for the additional costs incurred by the alarm company due to the supplier's failure.\n\nB. **$110,000 because of an unanticipated change of circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.**\n   - This option acknowledges the additional costs incurred by the alarm company and proposes that they should be compensated for the full amount of $110,000. However, the builder did not agree to this increase, so this option may not be enforceable under the terms of the original contract.\n\nC. **only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.**\n   - Quantum meruit is a legal principle that allows recovery of reasonable value for services rendered when there is no valid contract or when the contract is frustrated. Commercial frustration occurs when an unforeseen event makes performance of the contract impossible or radically different from what was anticipated. In this case, the supplier's inability to provide the burglar alarms could be considered a frustrating event. Therefore, the alarm company might be entitled to recover the reasonable value of the services provided under quantum meruit.\n\nD. **only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.**\n   - Repudiation occurs when one party refuses to perform their contractual obligations. If the alarm company demanded $110,000, it could be seen as repudiating the original contract. In such a case, the alarm company might only be able to recover the reasonable value of the services provided under quantum meruit.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.**\n\nThis option best reflects the situation where the alarm company can seek compensation for the reasonable value of the services rendered due to the unforeseen circumstances that led to the supplier's inability to fulfill its part of the agreement."
