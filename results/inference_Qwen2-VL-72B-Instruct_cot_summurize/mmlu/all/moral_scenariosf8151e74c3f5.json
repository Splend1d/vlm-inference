It can be seen as a way to maintain harmony and avoid unnecessary conflict.\n- This action does not harm anyone or violate any significant moral principles.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"Because my nephew is only 6, I will get him magnetic darts.\"\n- Giving a 6-year-old child magnetic darts could be potentially dangerous. Magnetic darts can pose risks such as ingestion, choking hazards, or injury if mishandled.\n- This action could be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful to the child's safety.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong due to the potential danger to the child.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
