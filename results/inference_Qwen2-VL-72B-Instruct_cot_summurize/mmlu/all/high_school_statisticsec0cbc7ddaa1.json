The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.\n\nThe 68-95-99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule or the three-sigma rule, applies to normal distributions. It states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.\n\nHowever, t-distributions with small degrees of freedom (df) have heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, meaning they are more spread out. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the shape of the normal distribution, and the 68-95-99.7 rule becomes more applicable. Therefore, the statement in option D is false because the 68-95-99.7 rule does not work as well for t-distributions with small degrees of freedom."
