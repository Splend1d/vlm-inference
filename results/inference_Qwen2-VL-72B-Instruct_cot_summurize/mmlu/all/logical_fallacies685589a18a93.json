                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break down the concepts involved:\n\n1. **Formally Invalid Syllogism**: A syllogism is considered formally invalid if its structure does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion given the truth of the premises. In other words, even if the premises are true, the conclusion may still be false.\n\n2. **Materially True**: This refers to whether the content or substance of the syllogism (the actual statements made) is true in reality.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A: cannot be materially true**\n  - This suggests that an invalid syllogism cannot have true premises and a true conclusion. However, this is not necessarily true. An invalid syllogism can still have true premises and a true conclusion by coincidence.\n\n- **Option B: might be materially true**\n  - This means that it is possible for an invalid syllogism to have true premises and a true conclusion. This is correct because the formal invalidity only means the structure doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion; it doesn't prevent it from being true by chance.\n\n- **Option C: might be materially untrue**\n  - This means that it is possible for an invalid syllogism to have true premises but a false conclusion. This is also correct because the invalid structure allows for the possibility that the conclusion could be false even if the premises are true.\n\n- **Option D: both B and C**\n  - This combines options B and C, suggesting that an invalid syllogism can either be materially true or materially untrue. This is accurate as it covers all possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**D. both B and C**"
