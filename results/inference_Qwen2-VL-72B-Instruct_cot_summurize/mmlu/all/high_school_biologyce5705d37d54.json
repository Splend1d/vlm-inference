South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.\n\nThis observation supports the idea that species have evolved over time from common ancestors, adapting to their local environments. The similarity between plants in different climates within the same continent suggests a shared evolutionary history and gradual adaptation to varying environmental conditions, which is a key principle of descent with modification."
