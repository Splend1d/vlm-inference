This time difference, known as the S-P interval, helps in calculating the distance to the earthquake's epicenter.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Single Station (Option A)**:\n   - With data from only one station, you can determine the distance to the epicenter but not its exact location because a circle of possible locations exists around that station.\n\n2. **Two Stations (Option B)**:\n   - Data from two stations allows you to draw two circles based on the distances calculated from each station. The intersection of these two circles gives a line along which the epicenter could be located.\n   \n3. **Three Stations (Option C)**:\n   - When data from three stations is used, you can draw three circles based on the distances calculated from each station. The point where all three circles intersect uniquely determines the epicenter of the earthquake.\n\n4. **Four or More Stations (Option D)**:\n   - While more than three stations provide additional data points for redundancy and accuracy, the minimum requirement to uniquely locate the epicenter is three stations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 3**"
