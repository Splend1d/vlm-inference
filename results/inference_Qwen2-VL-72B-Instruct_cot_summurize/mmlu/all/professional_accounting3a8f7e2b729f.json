When a gift of appreciated property (property that has increased in value) is given, the recipient takes a carryover basis in the property. This means the child's basis in the stock is the same as Simmons' basis, which is $40,000.\n\nThe child sold the stock for $36,000. To calculate the recognized gain or loss:\n\nSelling Price: $36,000\nAdjusted Basis: $40,000\n\nRecognized Loss = Selling Price - Adjusted Basis\nRecognized Loss = $36,000 - $40,000\nRecognized Loss = -$4,000\n\nTherefore, the child recognizes a loss of $4,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. $4,000 loss."
