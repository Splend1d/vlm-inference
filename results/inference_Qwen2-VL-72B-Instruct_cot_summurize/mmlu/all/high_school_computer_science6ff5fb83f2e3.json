Compare the experimental results to the results provided by the simulation.\n\nValidation of a simulation model typically involves comparing its output against real-world data or observations to ensure that the model accurately represents the system it is intended to simulate. By conducting real-world experiments and comparing their outcomes with the simulation results, you can assess the accuracy and reliability of the model. This approach helps to confirm whether the simulation is a valid representation of the actual plant growth under various conditions."
