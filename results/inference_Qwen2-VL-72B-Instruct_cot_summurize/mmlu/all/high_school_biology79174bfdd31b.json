                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.\n\nExplanation:\nSmall populations are particularly vulnerable to inbreeding, which occurs when closely related individuals mate. This can lead to a loss of genetic variation, making the population less adaptable to environmental changes and more susceptible to diseases. Reduced genetic diversity can also increase the likelihood of deleterious recessive traits being expressed, further weakening the population's health and survival prospects. Therefore, inbreeding and loss of genetic variation are significant threats to small populations."
