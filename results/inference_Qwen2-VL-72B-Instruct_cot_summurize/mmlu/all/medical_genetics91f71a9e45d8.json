In this case, the primary defect is renal agenesis (the absence of one or both kidneys), which leads to oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid). The oligohydramnios then causes pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs) due to the reduced space in the uterus for lung development. This chain of events fits the definition of a sequence."
