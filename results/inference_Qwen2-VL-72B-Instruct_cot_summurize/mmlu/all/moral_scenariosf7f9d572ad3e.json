It demonstrates a lack of empathy and disregard for the well-being of another person.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- There is not enough food for everyone at the dinner table.\n- The main character ensures that their children get something to eat.\n\nThis action can be seen as morally acceptable because it prioritizes the well-being of one's own children, who are dependent on the parent for care and sustenance. Ensuring that children are fed is generally considered a parental responsibility and a morally justifiable action.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
