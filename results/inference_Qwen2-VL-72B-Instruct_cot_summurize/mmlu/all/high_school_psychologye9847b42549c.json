The PNS is further divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves** - The brain and spinal cord are part of the central nervous system (CNS), not the PNS. Cranial nerves are part of the PNS, but this option is incorrect because it includes CNS components.\n\nB. **cranial nerves, spinal nerves, autonomic ganglia** - This option correctly identifies parts of the PNS. Cranial nerves and spinal nerves are part of the somatic nervous system, while autonomic ganglia are part of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nC. **spinal cord, spinal nerves, sense organs** - The spinal cord is part of the CNS, not the PNS. Spinal nerves are part of the PNS, but this option is incorrect because it includes a CNS component.\n\nD. **medulla, pons, thalamus** - All these structures are parts of the brain and thus belong to the CNS, not the PNS.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. cranial nerves, spinal nerves, autonomic ganglia"
