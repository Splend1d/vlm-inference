Before trial, the defendant entered into plea bargain negotiations with the prosecution. During the course of these negotiations, the defendant sent a letter to the prosecuting attorney in which she stated: \"I don't want to go to jail, so if you recommend a suspended sentence, I'll plead guilty and admit that I forged my ex-husband's signature on the check. \" Subsequently, the plea bargain negotiations fell through. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with forging her ex-husband's signature on his next pay check. She has denied culpability regarding the second forgery charge. At trial for the alleged second forgery, the prosecution seeks to introduce the letter the defendant sent to the prosecution during her earlier plea bargain negotiations. The defendant's attorney objects to the admissibility of the letter. The trial court judge should rule the letter is\n\nA. admissible as evidence of the defendant's propensity for committing the crime.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible, because it was written during the course of plea bargain negotiations.\nD. inadmissible, because specific instances of misconduct are not admissible in a criminal case.\n"

This privilege ensures that defendants can engage in candid discussions about potential resolutions without fear that their statements will be used against them in court. The rationale behind this protection is to encourage open and honest communication between the parties involved in plea negotiations, thereby facilitating the resolution of cases without the need for a full trial.\n\nTherefore, the letter written by the defendant during plea bargain negotiations would typically be considered inadmissible evidence in the subsequent trial for the second forgery charge."
