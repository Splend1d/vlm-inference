The sum of $x$ and $y$ is 42: $x + y = 42$\n2. $x$ is twice $y$: $x = 2y$\n\nLet's use these conditions to find the values of $x$ and $y$ when they satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\nFrom the second condition, we have $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the first condition gives us:\n\n\\[2y + y = 42\\]\n\\[3y = 42\\]\n\\[y = 14\\]\n\nSubstituting $y = 14$ back into $x = 2y$ gives us:\n\n\\[x = 2(14) = 28\\]\n\nSo, when $x + y = 42$, $x = 28$ and $y = 14$. Now, let's find the constant $k$ using the inverse proportionality relationship $xy = k$:\n\n\\[k = xy = 28 \\times 14 = 392\\]\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $y$ when $x = -8$. Using the inverse proportionality relationship again:\n\n\\[xy = k\\]\n\\[-8y = 392\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{392}{-8} = -49\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ when $x = -8$ is $-49$, which corresponds to option A."
