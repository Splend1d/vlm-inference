This process releases energy (latent heat) into the surrounding environment.\n\n2. **Energy Transfer**: The energy released during condensation is transferred to the remaining air molecules. This transfer of energy increases the kinetic energy of the remaining air molecules.\n\n3. **Temperature Increase**: An increase in the kinetic energy of the air molecules results in an increase in the temperature of the air.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. increase"
