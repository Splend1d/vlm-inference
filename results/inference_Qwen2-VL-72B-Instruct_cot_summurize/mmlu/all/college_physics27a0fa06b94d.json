According to special relativity, when two objects move relative to each other at high speeds, the length of one object as measured by an observer in the other object's frame of reference will appear contracted.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is given by:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the contracted length,\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length (the length measured in the object's rest frame),\n- \\( v \\) is the relative velocity between the two frames,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- The proper length \\( L_0 \\) of the meterstick is 1 meter.\n- The observed length \\( L \\) is 60 cm or 0.6 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the length contraction formula and solving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ 0.6 = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.36 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.36 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{0.64} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 0.8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0.8 times the speed of light.\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match exactly 0.8c. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or answer choices. Given the calculations, the closest option would be:\n\nC. 0.6c\n\nBut strictly based on the calculation, it should be noted that the precise result is 0.8c, which isn't listed among the options."
