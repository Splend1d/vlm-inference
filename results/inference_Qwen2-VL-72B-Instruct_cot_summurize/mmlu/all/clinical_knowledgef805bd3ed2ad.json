This statement is true.\n\nB. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve. This statement is false.\n\nC. Carpal tunnel syndrome typically causes symptoms such as pain and tingling in the lateral (not medial) three and a half digits, which include the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the radial half of the ring finger. This statement is false.\n\nD. Paraesthesia (numbness or tingling) associated with carpal tunnel syndrome is often worse at night rather than during the day.
