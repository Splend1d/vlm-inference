An increase in F indicates more inbreeding, which leads to a higher frequency of homozygous individuals and a lower frequency of heterozygous individuals in the population. This is because inbreeding increases the chances that two related individuals will carry the same alleles, reducing genetic diversity and increasing the likelihood of homozygosity."
