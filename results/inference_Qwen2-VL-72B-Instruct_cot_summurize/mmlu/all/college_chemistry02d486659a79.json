Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ c = k \\cdot P \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the concentration of the dissolved gas,\n- \\( k \\) is the Henry's Law constant, and\n- \\( P \\) is the partial pressure of the gas.\n\nGiven:\n- Henry's Law constant (\\( k \\)) for CO2 in water at 25\u00b0C = 30.0 atm M^\u22121\n- Partial pressure of CO2 (\\( P \\)) = 2.0 atm\n\nWe need to calculate the concentration (\\( c \\)) of dissolved CO2:\n\n\\[ c = k \\cdot P \\]\n\\[ c = 30.0 \\text{ atm M}^{-1} \\cdot 2.0 \\text{ atm} \\]\n\\[ c = 60.0 \\text{ M} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this result. It seems there might be an error in the question or the options.
