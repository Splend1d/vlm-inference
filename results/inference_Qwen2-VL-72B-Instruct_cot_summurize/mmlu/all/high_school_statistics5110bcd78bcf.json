Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nB.

Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\n\nIn this scenario, it is important to account for the potential differences in opinions across the five different countries due to varying local social structures. A stratified sampling technique would be most appropriate as it ensures that each country (stratum) is represented in the sample. This approach helps maintain the diversity of opinions within the sample and provides a more accurate estimate of the overall proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking.\n\nStratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on some characteristic (in this case, country), and then drawing a random sample from each subgroup. This method increases the precision of the estimate by reducing sampling error and ensuring that all segments of the population are adequately represented.\n\nCluster sampling, on the other hand, involves selecting entire groups or clusters (e.g., offices) at random and then surveying all members within those selected clusters. While cluster sampling can be useful when it's impractical to create a complete list of individuals, it may not be as effective in this case since we want to ensure representation from each country rather than just from randomly selected offices.\n\nSimple random sampling does not take into account the differences between the countries and could result in a biased sample if certain countries are over- or under-represented. Therefore, stratified sampling is the most suitable technique for this situation."
