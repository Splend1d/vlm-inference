                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. An increase in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\n\nHere's why: \n\n1. **Unemployment Rate Falls**: When the unemployment rate falls, it typically indicates an expansion in economic activity. This can be due to increased aggregate demand (more spending by consumers, businesses, or government), which leads firms to hire more workers to meet the higher demand for goods and services.\n\n2. **Inflation Rate Falls**: A fall in the inflation rate suggests that prices are rising at a slower pace. This could occur if there is an increase in aggregate supply, meaning that producers are able to produce more goods and services without significantly increasing their costs. This increased supply helps keep prices down despite the rise in demand.\n\nTherefore, the combination of falling unemployment and falling inflation rates suggests that both aggregate demand and aggregate supply have increased. This scenario is often referred to as a \"sweet spot\" in macroeconomics where the economy is growing without overheating (which would lead to higher inflation).\n\nOption C accurately captures this explanation."
