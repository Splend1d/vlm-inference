Genetic reassortment amongst 8 genes\n\nThe influenza virus is known for its complex genetic makeup, primarily characterized by genetic reassortment among its eight segments of single-stranded RNA. This process allows for the exchange of genetic material between different strains of the virus when they co-infect the same host cell, leading to the emergence of new viral strains. This is one of the key factors contributing to the high mutation rate and antigenic drift observed in influenza viruses."
