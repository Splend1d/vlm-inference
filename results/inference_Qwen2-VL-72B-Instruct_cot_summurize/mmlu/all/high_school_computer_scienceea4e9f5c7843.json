Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe current implementation initializes the `count` variable inside the loop (line 5), which means that `count` is reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop. This causes the procedure to only count the occurrences of `val` in the last element of `myList`. To fix this, we need to initialize `count` outside the loop, before the loop starts. Therefore, moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3 will make the procedure work as intended."
