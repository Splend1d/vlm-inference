This adaptation would likely attract bees rather than discourage them.\n\nB. **Modified petals to provide a landing space**: Bees need a place to land while they collect nectar or pollen. Providing a landing space would make it easier for bees to access the flower, thus promoting bee pollination.\n\nC. **Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers**: Hummingbirds are attracted to red flowers and can easily access pendant flowers by hovering. This adaptation would discourage bees because they typically do not hover and prefer stable surfaces to land on.\n\nD. **Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts**: While high sugar concentration might be attractive to both bees and hummingbirds, producing limited amounts of nectar could potentially limit the number of visits from bees, which generally have a higher nectar intake rate compared to hummingbirds.\n\nGiven these considerations, the adaptation that would most effectively limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination is:\n\n**C. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers**"
