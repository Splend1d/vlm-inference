                    "text": "To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals, we can use the principles of Mendelian genetics and the Punnett square method.\n\nEach parent has the genotype AaBbCc, which means they are heterozygous for all three traits (A/a, B/b, C/c). When these parents mate, each offspring receives one allele from each parent for each trait.\n\nThe probability of an offspring inheriting a specific allele from each parent is as follows:\n- Probability of inheriting A from one parent: 1/2\n- Probability of inheriting B from one parent: 1/2\n- Probability of inheriting C from one parent: 1/2\n\nSince the inheritance of each allele is independent, we multiply the probabilities together to find the combined probability of an offspring inheriting AABBCC:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^6 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{64} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals is \\( \\frac{1}{64} \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.0/64"
