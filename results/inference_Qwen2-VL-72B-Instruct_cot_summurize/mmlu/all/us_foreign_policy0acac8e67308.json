The concept was popularized by President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s as a way to describe the new international landscape that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn this context, the New World Order referred to a new era of international cooperation and collective security, with the United States playing a leading role in promoting democracy, human rights, and free markets around the world. It also implied a shift away from the traditional balance of power between the superpowers and towards a more multipolar world, with emerging powers like China and India playing a greater role in global affairs.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nA. A new democratic internationalism led by the United States"
