This means that $x = 0.7777...$\n\nTo convert this repeating decimal into a fraction, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Multiply $x$ by 10 to shift the decimal point one place to the right:\n\\[10x = 7.777...\\]\n\n2. Subtract the original equation ($x = 0.7777...$) from this new equation:\n\\[10x - x = 7.777... - 0.7777...\\]\n\\[9x = 7\\]\n\n3. Solve for $x$:\n\\[x = \\frac{7}{9}\\]\n\nSo, $0.\\overline7$ is equivalent to $\\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nThe reciprocal of a number is found by inverting the fraction. Therefore, the reciprocal of $\\frac{7}{9}$ is $\\frac{9}{7}$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. $\\frac{9}{7}$."
