At this rate, any unemployment present is considered to be frictional (people transitioning between jobs) or structural (due to long-term changes in the economy), but not cyclical (unemployment due to fluctuations in the business cycle). Therefore, when a nation is operating at the natural rate of unemployment, there is no cyclical unemployment."
