Billy thought Jack was a weakling, but Jack had been working out with weights and knew karate. Ike Intervenor, a large 25-year-old who knew neither party, strolled around the corner of the block in time to see Jack strike Billy twice. Billy fell back and Jack stepped forward to strike him again. Ike thought Jack was the aggressor and to protect Billy, Ike threw Jack into the bushes, accidentally breaking Jack's arm. Jack brought suit against Ike for his damages. Ike's best defense is\n\nA. He thought Jack was the initial aggressor.\nB. Billy had a valid defense if Jack sued him.\nC. The force Ike used was not excessive.\nD. He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n"

He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n\nThis defense highlights that Ike's actions were motivated by a desire to prevent further harm to Billy, whom he believed was being attacked by Jack. This aligns with the principle of self-defense or defense of others, which allows for reasonable use of force to protect oneself or another person from imminent harm. By emphasizing his intention to intervene and prevent violence rather than to cause injury, Ike can argue that his actions were justified under the circumstances."
