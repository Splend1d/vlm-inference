This does not violate the argument.\n- In the second row, the premise (~C \u2283 D) is true, but the premise (D \u2283 C) is false, and the conclusion (C) is true. This violates the argument because one of the premises is false while the conclusion is true.\n- In the third row, both premises (~C \u2283 D) and (D \u2283 C) are true, but the conclusion (C) is false. This violates the argument because both premises are true while the conclusion is false.\n- In the fourth row, the premise (~C \u2283 D) is false, but the premise (D \u2283 C) is true, and the conclusion (C) is false. This does not violate the argument because one of the premises is false.\n\nSince there are rows where both premises are true but the conclusion is false (row 3), the argument is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false"
