                    "text": "To determine who owns the farm, we need to analyze each transaction step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Deed**: The retiree devises the property to his daughter and his friend as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\n2. **Daughter's Deed to Co-Worker**: The daughter conveys her interest in the northeast quarter of the farm to the co-worker. This means the northeast quarter is now owned by the co-worker.\n\n3. **Lender's Execution Sale**: The daughter defaults on a loan, and the lender sells the daughter's interest in the south half of the farm to his nephew. This means the nephew now owns the south half of the farm.\n\n4. **Daughter's Death**: The daughter dies intestate, leaving her husband as her sole surviving heir. Since she had conveyed her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker and her interest in the south half was sold to the nephew, the only remaining interest she had was in the northwest quarter. Therefore, her husband inherits this portion.\n\n5. **Joint Tenancy Analysis**: Initially, the daughter and the friend were joint tenants with right of survivorship. However, since the daughter conveyed her interest in the northeast quarter to the co-worker and her interest in the south half to the nephew, these portions are no longer part of the joint tenancy. The northwest quarter remains under joint tenancy between the daughter and the friend until her death, at which point it passes to her husband.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**: Incorrect because it incorrectly states that the friend and the nephew are tenants in common of the south half of the farm. The nephew is actually the owner in fee of the south half.\n\n**Option B**: Incorrect because it incorrectly states that the friend is the owner in fee of the northwest quarter of the farm. The northwest quarter should be owned by the friend and the husband as tenants in common.\n\n**Option C**: Correct because it accurately reflects the ownership: the friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter, the friend and the husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter, and the nephew is the owner in fee of the south half.\n\n**Option D**: Incorrect because it incorrectly states that the friend is the owner in fee of the remaining three-quarters of the farm. The northwest quarter is owned by the friend and the husband as tenants in common, and the south half is owned by the nephew.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend and the husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the nephew is the owner in fee of the south half of the farm.**"
