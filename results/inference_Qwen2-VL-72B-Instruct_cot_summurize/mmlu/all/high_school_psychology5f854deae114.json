Inter-rater reliability\n\nInter-rater reliability is crucial in this context because it assesses the consistency or agreement among the different raters who are evaluating the same footage. Since the study involves multiple raters (three) viewing the same footage and rating the children's behavior independently, ensuring that these raters provide similar ratings is essential for the validity of the study's findings. This type of reliability helps to confirm that the ratings are not influenced by individual biases or interpretations but reflect a consistent understanding of the children's behavior across all raters."
