It might be less ideal due to potential skin irritation or lack of washability, but it is generally not seen as a moral issue.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I like Bill, and he doesn't know me; I'm planted one on him to see if sparks would fly.\"\n- Kissing someone without their consent is a clear violation of personal boundaries and is considered morally wrong. Consent is crucial in any physical interaction, and initiating a kiss without prior agreement is inappropriate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
