Utilitarianism can be divided into two main types: act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism.\n\n- **Act-utilitarianism** evaluates each individual action based on its consequences.\n- **Rule-utilitarianism** evaluates actions based on whether they conform to general rules that maximize overall happiness.\n\nR.B. Brandt, another philosopher, is known for his work on rule-utilitarianism. He argued that moral rules should be based on their overall consequences rather than evaluating each action individually.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Act-utilitarianism**: This would mean evaluating each action separately based on its consequences. While Mill was a utilitarian, he leaned more towards rule-utilitarianism.\n\nB. **A rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society**: This implies following existing societal norms without necessarily considering whether these norms lead to the greatest good. Mill's utilitarianism is more about promoting the greatest good, not just adhering to current societal rules.\n\nC. **A rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules**: This aligns with Mill's approach, as he believed in following rules that generally promote the greatest happiness. Mill's utilitarianism is about creating and following rules that lead to the best outcomes for the greatest number of people.\n\nD. **Kant\u2019s ethics**: Kantian ethics is deontological, focusing on duty and adherence to moral laws regardless of consequences. This does not align with Mill's utilitarian perspective.\n\nBased on this analysis, the view that most closely resembles John Stuart Mill\u2019s according to Brandt is:\n\n**C. A rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.**"
