                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Recording Statute**: The recording statute states that unrecorded deeds are void against subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice of the prior deed. This means that for a deed to be valid against subsequent purchasers, it must either be recorded or the subsequent purchaser must have actual notice of the prior deed.\n\n2. **Brother's Deed**: The brother's deed was not recorded until after the grantor's sons had recorded their deed. However, the grantor's sons did not pay value for their deed; they received it as a gift. Therefore, they do not qualify as \"subsequent purchasers who paid value.\"\n\n3. **Grantor's Sons' Deed**: Since the grantor's sons did not pay value for their deed, they do not fall under the protection of the recording statute. Their recording of the deed does not make it valid against the brother's deed, which was executed first.\n\n4. **Brother's Notice**: The brother recorded his deed after learning that the grantor's sons were about to take possession. This indicates that he was aware of the potential conflict and took action to protect his interest.\n\nTherefore, the brother prevails because the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute since they did not pay value for their deed."
