The Yang-shao culture is generally dated from around 5000 BCE to 3000 BCE.\n2. The Lung-Shan culture followed the Yang-shao and is typically dated from around 3000 BCE to 2000 BCE.\n\nGiven this information, the transition from the Yang-shao culture to the Lung-Shan culture occurred around 3000 BCE.\n\nNow, let's convert this date into years before present (B.P.):\n\n- 3000 BCE is equivalent to 3000 years before the year 1950 (since 1950 is often used as a reference point for B.P. calculations).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3,000 B.P."
