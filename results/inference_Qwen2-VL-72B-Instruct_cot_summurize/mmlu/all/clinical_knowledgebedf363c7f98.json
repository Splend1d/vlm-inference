A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\n\nIn diplopia, or double vision, covering one eye will typically eliminate the double vision because the brain only receives input from the uncovered eye. However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean diplopia can \"never\" occur with one eye covered; it simply means that covering one eye will resolve the double vision.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n- B. The outer image is not always the false image. The false image can be either inside or outside depending on the nature of the diplopia.\n- C. A fourth nerve palsy (trochlear nerve palsy) affects the superior oblique muscle and typically causes problems with downward and inward eye movements, not just upward gaze.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint, as the sixth cranial nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye. When this nerve is palsied, the affected eye cannot move outward properly, leading to a divergent squint (esotropia)."
