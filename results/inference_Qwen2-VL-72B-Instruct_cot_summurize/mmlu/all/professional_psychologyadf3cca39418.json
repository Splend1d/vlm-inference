They might not directly address the needs of educationally or socially disadvantaged individuals as they focus on relative performance rather than absolute skill assessment.\n\nC. **Multiple aptitude batteries**: These tests assess various skills and abilities but do not specifically target the needs of disadvantaged groups unless designed to do so.\n\nD. **Work-sample types of tests**: These tests involve practical tasks related to the job, which can provide a more direct measure of job-related skills and reduce reliance on formal education or social background.\n\nGiven the context of improving employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged, the most appropriate choice would be one that minimizes barriers related to time pressure and focuses on practical skills relevant to the job.\n\nTherefore, the principal effect of the current concern is likely to encourage the use of:\n\n**D. work-sample types of tests**\n\nThese tests are designed to assess practical skills directly related to job performance, thereby providing a fairer evaluation for individuals who may have faced educational or social disadvantages."
