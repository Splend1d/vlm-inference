At the hospital she refused the transfusion because of religious beliefs. She died shortly thereafter. The physician verified that the patient would have fully recovered if she had agreed to treatment. What damages can the pedestrian's estate collect from the driver of the car?\n\nA. All damages for wrongful death because it is foreseeable that this kind of negligence could injure someone who will not accept treatment for religious reasons.\nB. No damages, because the pedestrian's wrongdoing in not accepting treatment was the sole cause for her death.\nC. Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\nD. No damages, because the pedestrian's refusal of treatment constitutes contributory negligence.\n"

Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\n\nIn legal terms, the driver of the car is responsible for the injuries caused by their negligence up until the point where the pedestrian's own actions (refusing treatment due to religious beliefs) became the proximate cause of her death. This means the driver is liable for the initial injury and any resulting pain and suffering before the refusal of treatment. However, the driver is not liable for the death itself since it was caused by the pedestrian's refusal of necessary medical treatment."
