X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nB. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nC. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nD. Osmotic diuretic\n"

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can reduce urinary calcium excretion by decreasing the reabsorption of bicarbonate and thus reducing the delivery of calcium to the distal tubule where it is reabsorbed. This can help prevent the formation of new calcium-based kidney stones."
