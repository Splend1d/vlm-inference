This follows from the fact that subgroups of free abelian groups are direct summands and hence free.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(G / K\\) is free abelian.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The quotient group \\(G / K\\) is formed by taking the cosets of \\(K\\) in \\(G\\).\n- While \\(G\\) and \\(K\\) are both free abelian, it does not necessarily follow that \\(G / K\\) is free abelian. \n- For example, consider \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}\\) (which is a free abelian group) and \\(K = 2\\mathbb{Z}\\) (a nonzero subgroup). Then \\(G / K \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2\\), which is not free abelian since it is finite and cyclic of order 2.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
