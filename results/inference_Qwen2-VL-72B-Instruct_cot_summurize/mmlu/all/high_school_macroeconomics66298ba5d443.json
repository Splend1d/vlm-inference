This is typically measured by an increase in the real gross domestic product (GDP) of a country. Economic growth is often associated with improvements in technology, increases in labor productivity, and expansion of capital stock.\n\nThe production possibility curve (PPC) represents the various combinations of goods and services that an economy can produce given its available resources and technology. An outward shift of the PPC indicates economic growth because it shows that the economy can now produce more of both goods and services than before.\n\nLong-run aggregate supply (LRAS) is a concept in macroeconomics that describes the total supply of goods and services that an economy can produce when all productive resources are fully employed. A rightward shift in LRAS also indicates economic growth, as it means the economy can produce more output at each price level without experiencing inflationary pressures.\n\nTherefore, economic growth is best described by an increase in the production possibility curve and a rightward shift in long-run aggregate supply."
