                    "text": "To determine the correct description of the proton's motion within the solenoid, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by the solenoid and how it affects charged particles.\n\n1. **Magnetic Field Inside a Solenoid**: A solenoid produces a uniform magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) along its axis when current flows through it. This magnetic field is directed parallel to the axis of the solenoid.\n\n2. **Force on a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field**: The force exerted on a charged particle (like a proton) moving in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force:\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{F} = q (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n   \\]\n   where \\( q \\) is the charge of the particle, \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the velocity of the particle, and \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is the magnetic field.\n\n3. **Direction of Force**: Since the proton is moving along the axis of the solenoid (parallel to the magnetic field), the cross product \\( \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\) results in zero because the angle between \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is 0 degrees. Therefore, the force \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) is zero.\n\n4. **Motion of the Proton**: With no net force acting on the proton due to the magnetic field, Newton's first law of motion tells us that the proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The proton will continue in its straight path at constant velocity.**"
