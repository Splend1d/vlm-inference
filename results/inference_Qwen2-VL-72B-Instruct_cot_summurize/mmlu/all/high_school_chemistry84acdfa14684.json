Since the acid is weak, we can assume that \\( x \\) is much smaller than the initial concentration of the acid (0.01 M). Therefore, the concentration of undissociated acid at equilibrium is approximately 0.01 M.\n\nThe expression for the acid dissociation constant (Ka) is:\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+] [\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} \\]\n\nAt equilibrium, the concentrations are:\n- [H\u207a] = [A\u207b] = \\( x \\)\n- [HA] \u2248 0.01 M\n\nSo,\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{x^2}{0.01} \\]\n\nWe know the pH, which is related to the concentration of H\u207a ions by:\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}[\\text{H}^+] \\]\n\\[ 4.26 = -\\log_{10}(x) \\]\n\\[ x = 10^{-4.26} \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 10^{-4.26} \\approx 5.47 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x \\) back into the Ka expression:\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{(5.47 \\times 10^{-5})^2}{0.01} \\]\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{3.01 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.01} \\]\n\\[ K_a = 3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the pKa:\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a) \\]\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(3.01 \\times 10^{-7}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{p}K_a \\approx 6.52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is approximately 6.52.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 6.52"
