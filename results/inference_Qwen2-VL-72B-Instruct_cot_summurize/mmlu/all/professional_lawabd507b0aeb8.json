The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, \"How did you get hurt?\" The pedestrian replied, \"The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. \"Upon objection, this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a statement made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the pedestrian's statement to the nurse is being used to prove that the motorist ran a red light, which is the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nFor the statement to be admissible, it would need to fall under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. However, the statement does not fit the criteria for the statements made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis (which requires the statement to be relevant to the diagnosis or treatment) or a present sense impression (which requires the statement to be made contemporaneously with the event). Additionally, there is no indication that the statement was made in confidence to a hospital representative, so it does not qualify as a confidential communication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."
