He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?\n\nA. The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\nB. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.\nC. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\nD. The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.\n"

The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the priority of liens on real property is determined by the order in which they were recorded. Since the credit union's mortgage was recorded after the bank's mortgage, it would be considered a junior lien. However, when there is a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are typically distributed according to the priority of the liens. \n\nGiven that the bank's mortgage was senior to the credit union's mortgage, the bank would be paid first from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. Any remaining funds would then go towards satisfying the junior lien held by the credit union. In this case, since the credit union's lien is still outstanding and the remaining $5,000 is insufficient to cover the full amount of the credit union's loan, the credit union would be entitled to the $5,000 as part of its claim against the property.\n\nThe fact that the man is personally liable on the debt does not affect the distribution of the proceeds from the foreclosure sale, which is governed by the priority of the liens on the property itself. The man's personal liability would be a separate matter to be addressed outside of the foreclosure proceedings."
