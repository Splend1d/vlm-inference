There is a sale on ovens.\n\nThis is because a sale on ovens could potentially lower the cost of production for your aunt, allowing her to produce more apple pies at a lower cost per unit. This might enable her to expand her business and sell more pies, thereby increasing her need for more labor to meet the higher production demands. \n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. The price of apple peelers/corers rises: This would likely increase the cost of production, which could decrease the profitability of each pie and thus reduce the demand for labor.\n\nB. Your aunt\u2019s friends gossip all day, slowing their dough-making process: This would decrease productivity, meaning that the current workforce is less efficient. It might lead to a need for more labor to maintain the same level of output, but it doesn't inherently increase the demand for labor due to external factors.\n\nD. A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer: This would likely decrease the demand for apple pies as consumers become wary of consuming apples, leading to a decrease in sales and thus a reduced need for labor."
