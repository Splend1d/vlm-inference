Semilunar valves are found at the exits of the ventricles.\n\nB. **is prevented from everting by papillary muscles** - This is correct. The tricuspid valve has chordae tendineae that attach to papillary muscles, which prevent the valve from evertng and ensure it closes properly during ventricular contraction.\n\nC. **is open during systole** - This is incorrect. The tricuspid valve is closed during systole when the ventricle contracts to push blood into the pulmonary artery.\n\nD. **prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes** - This is incorrect. The tricuspid valve does not prevent blood from returning from the pulmonary trunk; it regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. is prevented from everting by papillary muscles."
