The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the stadium was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. Assume that three years after the stadium had been in operation, a subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill entirely prohibiting baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps.

The bond agreement stipulated that a portion of the admission charges would be used to repay the bond debt. By prohibiting baseball, the state would prevent the collection of admission charges, thereby making it impossible to fulfill the contractual obligations to the bondholders. This action would violate the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from passing any law that impairs the obligation of contracts. Therefore, the statute is probably unconstitutional."
