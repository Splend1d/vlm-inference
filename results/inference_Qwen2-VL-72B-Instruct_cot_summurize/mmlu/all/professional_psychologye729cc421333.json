Secular trends.\n\nSecular trends refer to long-term changes in various characteristics, such as height, weight, and developmental milestones, observed across generations or cohorts. These trends can be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, including improvements in nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions. Differences in the timing of physical changes among children from different cohorts are often attributed to secular trends."
