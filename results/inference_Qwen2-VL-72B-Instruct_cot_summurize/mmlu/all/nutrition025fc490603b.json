The RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\n\nThis statement is correct because during the process of gene expression, the initial RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) produced from DNA requires processing before it becomes mature mRNA. This processing includes splicing, where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined together, as well as other modifications such as the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. These steps are crucial for the proper functioning of mRNA in protein synthesis."
