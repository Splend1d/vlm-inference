If the court awards $100,000:\n   - The retainer is $20,000.\n   - The additional 40% of the award over $20,000 is calculated on ($100,000 - $20,000) = $80,000.\n   - 40% of $80,000 is $32,000.\n   - Total earnings from this outcome would be $20,000 (retainer) + $32,000 (40% of excess) = $52,000.\n   - Subtracting the out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000, the net earnings would be $52,000 - $15,000 = $37,000.\n\n2. If the court awards $0:\n   - The retainer is $20,000.\n   - There is no additional 40% since there is no award over $20,000.\n   - Total earnings from this outcome would be $20,000.\n   - Subtracting the out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000, the net earnings would be $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected value by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of $100,000 award * Net Earnings if $100,000 awarded) + (Probability of $0 award * Net Earnings if $0 awarded)\n\nExpected Value = (0.7 * $37,000) + (0.3 * $5,000)\nExpected Value = $25,900 + $1,500\nExpected Value = $27,400\n\nTherefore, the expected value to Smith Legal Services of the lawsuit is $27,400.\n\nThe correct answer is B. $27,400."
