Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, while quotas limit the quantity of a particular good that can be imported. Both measures tend to increase the price of imported goods, making them less competitive compared to domestically produced goods. As a result, consumers may shift their purchases towards domestic products, leading to an increase in the amount of the domestic product sold."
