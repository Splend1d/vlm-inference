It increases the risk of fire spreading uncontrollably, which could lead to property damage, injury, or even loss of life.\n- This action is generally considered irresponsible and potentially harmful to others and the environment.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I put water in the gas tank to make more money.\"\n- Adding water to a gas tank is fraudulent and deceitful behavior. It dilutes the fuel, reducing its effectiveness and potentially causing damage to vehicles.\n- This action is clearly unethical and illegal, as it involves deception for financial gain at the expense of others.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
