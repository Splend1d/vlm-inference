All reach the base at the same time.\n\nSince the surface of the incline is extremely slick and there is negligible friction, all three objects will slide down the incline without rotating. This means that their motion can be treated as purely translational, and their acceleration down the incline will depend only on the force of gravity and the angle of the incline, not on their shape or moment of inertia.\n\nThe equation for the acceleration (a) of an object sliding down an incline in the absence of friction is given by:\n\n\\[ a = g \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of the incline. Since this equation does not depend on the shape or mass of the object, all three objects (the sphere, the cube, and the cylinder) will have the same acceleration down the incline.\n\nGiven that they start from rest and have the same acceleration, they will cover the same distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, all three objects will reach the base of the incline simultaneously."
