When an electric current passes through the gas inside the tube (usually neon or other gases), it excites the atoms of the gas. As these atoms return to their ground state, they release energy in the form of light. The specific color of the light depends on the type of gas used and any phosphors that may be present on the inner surface of the tube. In the case of a red glow, this is typically due to the emission spectrum of neon gas."
