Arriving on time for work\n\nThis is because punctuality can vary significantly across different cultures, where some may place a high value on being on time while others may have more flexible attitudes towards time. The other options (caring for one's children, having the desire to reproduce, and seeking food and water) are more universally driven by psychological or biological needs that are common across all human societies."
