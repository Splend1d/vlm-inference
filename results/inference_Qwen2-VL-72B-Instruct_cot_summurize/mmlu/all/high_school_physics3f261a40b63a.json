Additionally, we need to consider Newton's third law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nGiven:\n- The toy truck's mass (\\( m_{\\text{truck}} \\)) is double the toy car's mass (\\( m_{\\text{car}} \\)).\n- \\( m_{\\text{truck}} = 2m_{\\text{car}} \\)\n\nWhen the toy car and the toy truck collide, they exert forces on each other. According to Newton's third law, these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Let's denote the force exerted by the car on the truck as \\( F_{\\text{car-on-truck}} \\) and the force exerted by the truck on the car as \\( F_{\\text{truck-on-car}} \\).\n\nSince the forces are equal and opposite:\n\\[ F_{\\text{car-on-truck}} = -F_{\\text{truck-on-car}} \\]\n\nNow, applying Newton's second law for both objects:\n\nFor the toy car:\n\\[ F_{\\text{truck-on-car}} = m_{\\text{car}} \\cdot a_{\\text{car}} \\]\n\nFor the toy truck:\n\\[ F_{\\text{car-on-truck}} = m_{\\text{truck}} \\cdot a_{\\text{truck}} \\]\n\\[ -F_{\\text{truck-on-car}} = (2m_{\\text{car}}) \\cdot a_{\\text{truck}} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( F_{\\text{truck-on-car}} \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[ -m_{\\text{car}} \\cdot a_{\\text{car}} = (2m_{\\text{car}}) \\cdot a_{\\text{truck}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( a_{\\text{car}} \\) in terms of \\( a_{\\text{truck}} \\):\n\\[ -a_{\\text{car}} = 2a_{\\text{truck}} \\]\n\\[ a_{\\text{car}} = -2a_{\\text{truck}} \\]\n\nThis means the acceleration of the car is double the magnitude and in the opposite direction compared to the acceleration of the truck.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. double the magnitude and in the opposite direction"
