The shape of the coastline and the ocean floor can significantly influence tidal ranges. For example, funnel-shaped bays or estuaries can amplify tidal flows, leading to larger tidal ranges.\n\nD. **Trade winds push the water into large tidal bulges near rocky shorelines.**\n   - While wind can influence water levels, it is not the primary cause of varying tidal ranges between different localities.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate explanation for the difference in tidal ranges between localities is:\n\n**C. Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.**"
