A reliable test will produce similar results under consistent conditions. Validity, on the other hand, concerns whether the test measures what it is intended to measure. A test can be reliable (consistent in its results) without being valid (measuring the correct construct). For example, a test designed to measure mathematical ability might consistently produce the same scores for each student (reliable), but if it actually measures reading comprehension instead (not valid), it would still be considered reliable but not valid."
