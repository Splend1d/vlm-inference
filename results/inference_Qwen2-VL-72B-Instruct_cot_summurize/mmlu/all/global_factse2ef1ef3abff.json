Public perception of corruption can vary widely based on recent events, media coverage, and government actions.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: In 2013, India had experienced several high-profile corruption scandals, such as the 2G spectrum scam and the Commonwealth Games corruption allegations. These events likely influenced public opinion significantly.\n\n3. **Typical Range for Corruption Perception**: Generally, when asked about corruption in political parties, a substantial portion of the population tends to express concern or dissatisfaction. However, the exact percentage can vary greatly depending on the specific survey and the time period.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. 26%**: This seems relatively low given the context of widespread corruption concerns.\n- **B. 46%**: This is a moderate percentage but still might be considered low given the heightened awareness of corruption issues at that time.\n- **C. 66%**: This is a higher percentage and more plausible considering the significant corruption scandals that were prominent in the news around 2013.\n- **D. 86%**: This is very high and might be considered extreme unless there was an exceptionally high level of public distrust at that time.\n\nConsidering the historical context and typical public perception trends, the most reasonable estimate would be:\n\n**Final Answer: C. 66%**"
