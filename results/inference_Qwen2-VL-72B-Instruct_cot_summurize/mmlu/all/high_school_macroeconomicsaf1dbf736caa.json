This increased demand leads to an increase in the demand for your currency (in this case, the dollar) as foreign buyers need to convert their own currencies into dollars to make these purchases. \n\nConversely, if your tastes for foreign goods fall off, you are demanding fewer imports from other countries. This reduces the demand for foreign currencies, as you need less of those currencies to buy foreign goods.\n\nThe combination of increased demand for your currency (due to higher exports) and decreased demand for foreign currencies (due to lower imports) typically results in an appreciation of your currency's value relative to other currencies. Therefore, the value of the dollar would tend to appreciate."
