She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?\n\nA. Accept the girl's consent as sufficient\nB. Obtain a court order permitting evaluation\nC. Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians\nD. Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents\n"

Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents\n\nSince the patient is a minor (15 years old), parental consent is typically required for medical treatment unless there are specific circumstances that allow for an exception, such as emancipation or a court order. The patient's statement about moving away from home and receiving no support from her parents does not necessarily mean she is legally emancipated. Therefore, it is important to obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian before proceeding with the examination and treatment."
