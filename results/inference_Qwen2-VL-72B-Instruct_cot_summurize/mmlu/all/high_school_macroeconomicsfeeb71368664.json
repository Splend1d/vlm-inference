Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nWhen the equilibrium real GDP is far below full employment, it indicates that there is significant unused capacity in the economy. If the government lowers household taxes, it increases disposable income for households, which can lead to increased consumer spending. This increase in demand can stimulate economic activity and encourage businesses to hire more workers, thereby reducing unemployment.\n\nHowever, because there is substantial unused capacity (i.e., unemployed resources), the initial increase in demand is more likely to be met by an increase in production rather than by higher prices. Thus, the inflationary pressure would be relatively low. As the economy approaches full employment, inflation might start to rise, but initially, the effect on inflation should be minimal."
