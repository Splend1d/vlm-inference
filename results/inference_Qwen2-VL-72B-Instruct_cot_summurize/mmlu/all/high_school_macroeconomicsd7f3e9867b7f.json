An increase in the price of imported forklifts would affect the CPI because it is part of the consumption basket that consumers purchase.\n\nOn the other hand, the GDP deflator measures the overall level of prices for all new, domestically produced final goods and services in an economy. Since forklifts imported from Belgium are not domestically produced, they do not directly impact the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator focuses on domestic production, so changes in the prices of imported goods do not affect it."
