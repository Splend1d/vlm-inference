It involves actions such as lowering interest rates, which makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This encourages more spending and investment, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. As demand rises, businesses may produce more goods and services, potentially increasing domestic output and creating jobs, which can help reduce the unemployment rate. Therefore, option A accurately describes the intended effects of expansionary monetary policy."
