Bias increase ; Variance decrease\n\nAdding $\\ell_2$ regularization (also known as Ridge Regression) to a linear regression model increases the bias because it constrains the magnitude of the coefficients, making them smaller. This constraint helps to reduce the complexity of the model, which in turn decreases the variance. The trade-off is that while the variance decreases, the bias increases. This is a common effect of regularization techniques, which aim to balance the trade-off between bias and variance to improve generalization performance on unseen data."
