He decided to dig out the lawn in his back yard and turn the space into a swampy marsh. Eventually, his back yard was filled with tall grasses, reeds, and other marsh plants. A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes. The investor rented the house to a family under a long-term lease. The tenant family complained frequently to the investor about being annoyed by the environmentalist's yard. If the investor asserts a nuisance claim against the environmentalist, the environmentalist's best defense would be\n\nA. that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard.\nB. that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance.\nC. that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land.\nD. that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property.\n"

If the investor was aware of the environmentalist's swampy yard at the time of purchase, he cannot reasonably claim that the condition constitutes a nuisance. This defense shifts the responsibility onto the investor for conducting due diligence before making the purchase."
