It focuses on the yoga group's rights and restrictions.\n\n   **Option B:** \"there is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.\"\n   - This option directly addresses the core of the example. The yoga group can control who becomes a member (rules of membership), but they cannot control who enters or uses Central Park (settlement within a physical territory).\n\n   **Option C:** \"territorial rights only belong to individuals.\"\n   - This option is not supported by the example. The example discusses the yoga group's rights, which implies collective rather than individual territorial rights.\n\n   **Option D:** \"Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership.\"\n   - This option is speculative and not directly related to the example given. The example does not provide enough information to conclude that Wellman's theory is absurd.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The most fitting answer is Option B, as it accurately reflects the distinction highlighted by the example between controlling membership and controlling access to a shared physical space.\n\n**Final Answer: B. there is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.**"
