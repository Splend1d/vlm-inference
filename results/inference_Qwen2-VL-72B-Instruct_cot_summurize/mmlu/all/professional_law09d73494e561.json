At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?\n\nA. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.\nB. No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.\nC. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n"

Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nExplanation:\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence (specifically Rule 803(18)), certain statements made in a treatise, manual, or similar publication are admissible if they meet specific criteria. These criteria include that the publication is reliable and that it is generally accepted in the field to which it pertains. The excerpts from the medical treatise can be admitted as evidence if they are relevant to the case and meet these standards, even though they are considered hearsay. This exception allows for the introduction of such materials to establish facts that are beyond common knowledge or experience, provided they are properly authenticated and their reliability is established."
