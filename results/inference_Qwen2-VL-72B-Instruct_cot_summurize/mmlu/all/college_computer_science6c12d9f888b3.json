The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is\n\nA. 1/(n^2)\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\nC. 1/n\nD. (n-1)/n\n"

Therefore, the total number of links is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, 2) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of links} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: Since every node is directly connected to every other node, the worst-case path length is always 1.\n\n3. **Figure of Merit**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Figure of Merit}_{\\text{fully interconnected}} = \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Ring Network:\n1. **Number of Links**: In a ring network with \\( n \\) processors, each processor is connected to exactly two others, forming a closed loop. Therefore, the total number of links is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of links} = n\n   \\]\n\n2. **Worst-Case Path Length**: The worst-case path length occurs when the two nodes are diametrically opposite on the ring. In this case, the shortest path goes through half the ring, so the worst-case path length is \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Figure of Merit**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Figure of Merit}_{\\text{ring}} = n \\times \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{n^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Ratio of Figures of Merit:\nThe ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Figure of Merit}_{\\text{fully interconnected}}}{\\text{Figure of Merit}_{\\text{ring}}} = \\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{\\frac{n^2}{2}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{\\frac{n^2}{2}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{n^2} = \\frac{n-1}{n}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\( \\frac{n-1}{n} \\)"
