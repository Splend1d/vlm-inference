Higher job satisfaction is often associated with better job performance, as satisfied employees tend to be more engaged, motivated, and productive. Additionally, job satisfaction can also have positive effects on mental and physical health, reducing stress and improving overall well-being. However, it's important to note that the relationship between job satisfaction and these outcomes can be complex and influenced by various factors."
