Incomplete dominance describes the interaction of two alleles on one gene; epistasis describes the interaction of two genes and their respective alleles.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Incomplete Dominance**: This occurs when neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in an intermediate phenotype. For example, in pea plants, the flower color can be red (dominant), white (recessive), or pink (intermediate) if both alleles are present.\n- **Epistasis**: This refers to the interaction between two or more genes where the expression of one gene masks or modifies the expression of another gene. For instance, in coat color genetics in rabbits, the presence of a dominant gene for black fur can mask the expression of genes responsible for other colors.\n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes the fundamental difference between incomplete dominance and epistasis in terms of genetic interactions."
