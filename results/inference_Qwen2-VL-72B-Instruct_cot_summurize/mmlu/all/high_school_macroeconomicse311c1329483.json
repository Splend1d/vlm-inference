For a given level of government spending they produce a deficit during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\n\nAutomatic fiscal policy stabilizers, such as progressive income taxes and unemployment benefits, work to stabilize the economy by automatically adjusting the budget balance in response to economic conditions without the need for new legislation. During a recession, when incomes fall, tax revenues decrease and more people become eligible for unemployment benefits, leading to a budget deficit. Conversely, during an expansion, when incomes rise, tax revenues increase and fewer people claim unemployment benefits, resulting in a budget surplus. This automatic adjustment helps to moderate the severity of economic fluctuations."
