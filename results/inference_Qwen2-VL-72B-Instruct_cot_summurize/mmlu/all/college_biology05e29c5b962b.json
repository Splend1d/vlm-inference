Let's analyze each option to determine which one is NOT required for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to hold:\n\nA. **Genes are exchanged with other populations**:\n   - This condition describes gene flow, which is a mechanism of evolutionary change. For Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, there should be no gene flow between populations.\n\nB. **Population size is large**:\n   - A large population size helps minimize the effects of genetic drift, which can alter allele frequencies. Therefore, this condition is necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nC. **Natural selection does not take place**:\n   - Natural selection changes allele frequencies by favoring certain traits over others. For Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, natural selection should not occur.\n\nD. **Matings are random**:\n   - Random mating ensures that alleles combine freely without any preference, maintaining allele and genotype frequencies. Thus, this condition is also necessary.\n\nGiven these analyses, the condition that is NOT required for the Hardy-Weinberg law to operate is:\n\n**A. Genes are exchanged with other populations.**\n\nThis condition would actually disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium rather than maintain it."
