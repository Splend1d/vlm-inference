Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nWith which of the following threats does the speaker in the passage above seem most concerned?\n\nA.

The passage is attributed to Maximilien Robespierre, a prominent figure during the French Revolution.\n2. The text discusses the \"great purity\" of the revolution and its impact on both the strength and weakness of the revolutionary cause.\n3. It mentions rallying \"all vicious men against us,\" indicating a concern about internal opposition.\n4. The passage emphasizes the need to \"smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic.\"\n5. It advocates for leading the people by reason and their enemies by terror, suggesting a focus on suppressing opposition.\n\nGiven these points, the primary concern appears to be internal threats\u2014those who oppose the revolutionary ideals and seek to undermine the Republic from within.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Counterrevolutionary opponents**: This aligns well with the passage's emphasis on internal enemies and the need to suppress them through terror.\n\nB. **Foreign invaders**: While the passage does mention external enemies, the primary focus seems to be on internal threats.\n\nC. **Communist agitators**: This term is anachronistic for the time period of the French Revolution (late 18th century), as communism as a political ideology emerged later.\n\nD. **Transnational corporations**: This concept also postdates the French Revolution and would not have been relevant at that time.\n\nBased on the analysis, the speaker in the passage is most concerned about:\n\n**A. Counterrevolutionary opponents**"
