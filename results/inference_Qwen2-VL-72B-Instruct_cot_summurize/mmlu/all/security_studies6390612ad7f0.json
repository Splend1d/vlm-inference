Human security is a multidimensional concept that encompasses various aspects such as freedom from fear (e.g., protection from violence), freedom from want (e.g., access to basic needs like food, water, and healthcare), and freedom from wanton environmental degradation. It also includes the protection of individuals from political oppression and threats posed by state actors.\n\nOption D describes a scenario where individuals are completely independent of state support, suggesting a self-sufficient existence without any reliance on state apparatus for security. While self-sufficiency can be an aspect of personal resilience, it does not necessarily address all the dimensions of human security, particularly those related to protection from violence, oppression, and threats posed by state actors. Human security involves not just individual resilience but also collective measures and state responsibilities to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens."
