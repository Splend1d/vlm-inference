The brain can use the slight differences in the arrival time and intensity of sound at each ear to determine the direction from which the sound is coming. This is known as the binaural cue or the interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD), which are crucial for spatial hearing and identifying the origin of a sound."
