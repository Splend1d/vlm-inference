However, without specific details about each model, we need to make an educated guess based on general knowledge of planning frameworks.\n\n**Strategy and implementation** (Option C) are fundamental components of most planning models as they involve defining the approach (strategy) and putting it into action (implementation).\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC.
