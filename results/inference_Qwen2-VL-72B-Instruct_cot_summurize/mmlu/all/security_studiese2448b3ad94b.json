Historical Materialism emphasizes the importance of social classes and their role in societal development.\n\nB. **Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.**\n   - This statement is somewhat misleading. While social class is central to HM, it does not mean that other forms of class distinctions are completely ignored. However, the primary focus is indeed on social class.\n\nC. **The focus of HM lies predominantly on class and class in relation to capital.**\n   - This statement is accurate. HM focuses heavily on the relationship between different classes and the means of production, particularly capital.\n\nD. **HM regards class as being far more complex than a simple division between a capitalist ruling class and working class.**\n   - This statement is also correct. HM acknowledges various layers and complexities within class structures beyond just capitalists and workers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most incorrect statement is:\n\n**B. Within the HM paradigm, the only form of class that matters is social class.**\n\nThis statement is too absolute and does not accurately reflect the nuanced view of class within HM."
