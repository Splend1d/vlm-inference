They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\nAccording to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets are remnants of the early solar system that did not coalesce into larger bodies like planets. These objects are believed to have formed at the same time as the planets but remained as smaller bodies due to various factors such as gravitational interactions with the growing planets or their own mutual gravitational perturbations."
