The toxicologist testified that the defendant's blood alcohol level, registered after his arrest, was 0. 14%. At the close of the toxicologist's testimony, the trial judge, over defense objections, instructed the jury that, in accordance with state law, a person with a blood alcohol level greater than 0. 10% is presumed to be intoxicated. No other instruction relating to that presumption was given. A relevant statute in this jurisdiction makes driving while intoxicated a felony and defines intoxication \"as a state of severely impaired mental and physical capacity caused by the ingestion of drugs or alcohol. \"The defendant was subsequently convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, his conviction should be\n\nA. affirmed, because the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption.\nB. affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.\nC. reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. reversed, because such an instruction may be considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the defendant's conviction should be affirmed or reversed, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in the case, particularly focusing on the presumption of intoxication based on blood alcohol content (BAC) and the burden of proof in criminal cases.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Presumption of Intoxication:**\n   - The state law presumes that a person with a BAC greater than 0.10% is intoxicated.\n   - This presumption is a legal tool that shifts the burden of proof to some extent but does not relieve the prosecution entirely from proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2. **Burden of Proof:**\n   - In criminal cases, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   - The use of presumptions can sometimes be problematic if they improperly shift the burden of proof or create a risk that the jury will convict based solely on the presumption rather than on the evidence presented.\n\n3. **Jury Instructions:**\n   - The trial judge instructed the jury about the presumption but did not provide any further guidance on how to handle it.\n   - This lack of additional instructions could lead to confusion or misinterpretation by the jury regarding their role in evaluating the evidence.\n\n### Application to Options:\n\n**Option A:** Affirmed, because the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption.\n- While the defendant had an opportunity to rebut the presumption, this alone does not address the potential issue of the jury relying too heavily on the presumption without considering all the evidence.\n\n**Option B:** Affirmed, because the judge's instruction merely permitted the jury to reach a conclusion that they could have decided upon without the presumption.\n- This option suggests that the instruction was merely permissive and did not affect the jury's ability to make an independent decision. However, it overlooks the potential impact of the presumption on the jury's deliberations.\n\n**Option C:** Reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n- This option correctly identifies a critical concern: the instruction might have led the jury to rely on the presumption rather than requiring the prosecution to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n**Option D:** Reversed, because such an instruction may be considered an indication of guilt and, therefore, violative of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n- This option is less relevant here. The instruction pertains to the presumption of intoxication based on BAC, which is a factual matter, not an indication of guilt or a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, the most compelling reason to reverse the conviction is the potential that the jury instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof or led the jury to convict based on the presumption alone, without fully considering the evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. reversed, because the jury might determine that the instruction in effect relieves the prosecutor of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.**"
