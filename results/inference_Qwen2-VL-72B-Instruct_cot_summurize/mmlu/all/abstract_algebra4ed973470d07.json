For \\(n \\geq 3\\), we can show that \\(S_n\\) is non-Abelian by finding at least two elements that do not commute (i.e., their product is not commutative). \n\nConsider two permutations in \\(S_3\\):\n- The transposition \\((1 2)\\)\n- The cycle \\((1 2 3)\\)\n\nTheir products are:\n- \\((1 2)(1 2 3) = (1 3)\\)\n- \\((1 2 3)(1 2) = (2 3)\\)\n\nSince \\((1 2)(1 2 3) \\neq (1 2 3)(1 2)\\), it follows that \\(S_3\\) is non-Abelian. This argument extends to any \\(S_n\\) for \\(n > 3\\), as \\(S_n\\) contains \\(S_3\\) as a subgroup, and subgroups inherit the non-Abelian property from the larger group. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\(a\\) is a permutation that is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is a permutation that is an \\(n\\)-cycle, then \\(|ab| = \\text{lcm}(m,n)\\)\n\nThis statement suggests that the order of the product of two disjoint cycles is equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of their lengths. However, this is not always true. Consider the following counterexample:\n\nLet \\(a = (1 2 3)\\) be a 3-cycle and \\(b = (4 5)\\) be a 2-cycle. These cycles are disjoint because they act on different sets of elements. The product \\(ab = (1 2 3)(4 5)\\) is also a permutation that acts on two disjoint sets, so its order is the least common multiple of 3 and 2, which is 6. However, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) were not disjoint, the situation would be different.\n\nFor instance, consider \\(a = (1 2 3)\\) and \\(b = (2 3 4)\\). Here, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not disjoint, and their product \\(ab = (1 2 3)(2 3 4) = (1 2 4)\\) has order 3, which is not equal to \\(\\text{lcm}(3,3) = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**."
