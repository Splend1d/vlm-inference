It is a fee simple determinable, and title ends automatically if drugs are used.\n\nThis is because the estate described in the question is actually a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, not a fee simple determinable. In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor retains the right to reenter and retake the property if the condition is violated, but the title does not automatically revert to the grantor upon violation of the condition. Instead, the grantor must take affirmative action (reentry) to reclaim the property. Therefore, options B, C, and D are true statements about this type of estate."
