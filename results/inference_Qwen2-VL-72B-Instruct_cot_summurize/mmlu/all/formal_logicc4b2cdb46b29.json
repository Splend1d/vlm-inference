The proposition only asserts that there is at least one house that is bigger than every apartment, not that every house is bigger than every apartment.\n\nC. **Some apartment is smaller than every house.**\n   - This does not directly match the proposition. The proposition focuses on the relationship between a specific house and all apartments, not about apartments being smaller than all houses.\n\nD. **Some houses are bigger than every apartment.**\n   - This matches the proposition perfectly. It states that there exists at least one house that is bigger than every apartment, which aligns with the given logical statement.\n\nTherefore, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is:\n\n**D. Some houses are bigger than every apartment.**"
