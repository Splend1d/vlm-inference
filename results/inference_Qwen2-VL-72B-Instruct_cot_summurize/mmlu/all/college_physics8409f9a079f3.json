At this point, the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy can be calculated using Hooke's Law:\n   \\[\n   PE = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is the spring constant and \\( x \\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n   However, we don't have the value of the spring constant \\( k \\). Instead, we can use the fact that the total mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of friction. This means the potential energy at maximum displacement equals the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n   Therefore, the total mechanical energy \\( E \\) is equal to the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position:\n   \\[\n   E = KE = 0.00024 \\text{ J}\n   \\]\n\nConverting joules to millijoules:\n\\[\nE = 0.00024 \\text{ J} = 0.24 \\text{ mJ}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total mechanical energy of the system is:\n\n**A. 0.24 mJ**"
