An experiment\n\nExperiments are designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships by manipulating one or more variables while controlling for others, allowing researchers to isolate the effect of the manipulated variable on the outcome. This is done through random assignment to treatment and control groups, which helps to ensure that any observed differences can be attributed to the manipulation rather than other factors."
