They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nThe description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty?\n\nA. The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\nC. The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct inference about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty based on the given passage, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.**\n   - This option suggests that the Ming Dynasty was highly accommodating to foreign traders. However, the passage describes strict regulations such as limited time for trading, mandatory registration, and restrictions on overnight stays, which do not support this inference.\n\nB. **The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.**\n   - This option aligns well with the passage. It mentions that foreigners had to register upon entering and could not stay overnight in the city, indicating strict regulation. These measures likely helped in controlling foreign presence and facilitating tax collection.\n\nC. **The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.**\n   - There is no mention of piracy or battles in the passage. Therefore, this inference is not supported by the provided information.\n\nD. **The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.**\n   - While the passage does mention a large carrack going to Japan annually, it does not specify that only one boat per year was permitted or that Portugal was the exclusive trading partner. Thus, this inference cannot be conclusively drawn from the text.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most supported inference is:\n\n**B. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.**"
