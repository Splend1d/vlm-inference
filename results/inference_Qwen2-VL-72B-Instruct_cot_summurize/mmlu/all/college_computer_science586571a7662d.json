                    "text": "To determine which statements must be true if procedure \\( P \\) is guaranteed to terminate, let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. **P has a local variable.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. A procedure can be recursive without having any local variables. For example, consider the following simple recursive function in Python:\n     ```python\n     def factorial(n):\n         if n == 0:\n             return 1\n         else:\n             return n * factorial(n-1)\n     ```\n     Here, `factorial` is recursive but does not use any local variables other than the input parameter `n`.\n\nII. **P has an execution path where it does not call itself.**\n   - This statement must be true for \\( P \\) to be guaranteed to terminate. Every recursive procedure must have a base case that does not involve further recursive calls. Without such a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to non-termination.\n\nIII. **P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. A recursive procedure can be defined without referring to any global variables or taking parameters. For instance, consider the following recursive function in Python:\n     ```python\n     def countdown():\n         if i > 0:\n             print(i)\n             countdown()\n         else:\n             return\n     ```\n     Here, `countdown` is recursive and does not refer to any global variables or take any parameters.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only statement that must be true for \\( P \\) to be guaranteed to terminate is:\n\n**II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**"
