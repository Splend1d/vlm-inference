Anscombe was a prominent philosopher known for her work in ethics and moral philosophy. She is particularly noted for her critique of modern moral philosophy, especially her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" (1958), where she argues against the use of terms like \"obligation\" and \"duty\" in moral discourse.\n\nIn this context, Anscombe suggests that the concept of \"moral obligation\" as it is commonly used in modern moral philosophy does not refer to any real or meaningful concept. She argues that the idea of moral obligation has been divorced from its religious and theological roots and has become a vague and meaningless term in secular ethical discussions.\n\nGiven this background, the most accurate option according to Anscombe's perspective would be:\n\nD. no real concept at all."
