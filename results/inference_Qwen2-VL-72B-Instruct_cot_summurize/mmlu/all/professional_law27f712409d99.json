                    "text": "One day, an 11-year-old boy came home from school with red lipstick stains on his collar. When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n\nA. deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\nB. deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nExplanation:\nThe confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of a defendant to confront witnesses against them during their trial. However, this right applies specifically to the trial itself and not necessarily to preliminary hearings or other pretrial proceedings. Preliminary hearings are typically used to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial, and they do not involve the full procedural protections of a trial. Therefore, excluding the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's testimony at the preliminary hearing does not violate the confrontation clause."
