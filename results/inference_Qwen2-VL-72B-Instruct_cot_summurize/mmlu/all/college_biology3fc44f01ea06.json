                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. It increases diffusion of H+ from the intermembrane space to the matrix.\n\nExplanation: Mitochondria generate ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which involves the creation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. When mitochondria are placed in a buffered solution with a low pH (high hydrogen ion concentration), the concentration of H+ ions outside the mitochondria increases. This leads to an increased diffusion of H+ ions from the intermembrane space (which has a higher concentration of H+ due to the proton pumps) into the mitochondrial matrix (which has a lower concentration of H+). The movement of these protons back into the matrix through ATP synthase generates ATP. Therefore, the low external pH facilitates this proton gradient, enhancing ATP production."
