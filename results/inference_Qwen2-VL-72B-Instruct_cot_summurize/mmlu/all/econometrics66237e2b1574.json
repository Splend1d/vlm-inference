If the sample size is small or if the significance level is not robust, it may not provide compelling evidence against market efficiency.\n\n2. **Random Chance**: Even in an efficient market, some fund managers will outperform simply due to random chance. The number of managers who beat the market needs to be compared against what would be expected by chance alone.\n\n3. **Data and Methodology**: The specific methodology used (Jensen-type regression) and the data quality can influence the results. If the methodology is flawed or the data is biased, the findings may not be reliable.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Market conditions can also affect the performance of fund managers. Certain periods might favor active management more than others.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.**\n\nThe information provided does not include details about the statistical methods used, the significance levels, the sample characteristics, or other relevant factors necessary to make a definitive judgment about market efficiency."
