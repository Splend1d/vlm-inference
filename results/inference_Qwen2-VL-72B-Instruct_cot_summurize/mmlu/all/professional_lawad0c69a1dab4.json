He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer had probable cause to arrest the driver for driving with a suspended license. The search of the car, which led to the discovery of the cocaine, can be justified as being incident to the lawful arrest. This is based on the principle that police officers may conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle if they have made a lawful arrest of the occupant of that vehicle. Therefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the suppression motion."
