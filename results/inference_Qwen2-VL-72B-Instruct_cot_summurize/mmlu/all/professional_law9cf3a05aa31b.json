Additional terms always become part of the contract.\n\nThis statement is not true because according to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law principles governing contracts, additional terms proposed in an acceptance do not automatically become part of the contract. Instead, they may become part of the contract under certain conditions:\n\n- If the additional terms do not materially alter the agreement (Option A).\n- If the offer does not expressly limit acceptance to the terms of the offer (Option C).\n- If the offeror does not object within a reasonable time to the additional terms (Option D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
