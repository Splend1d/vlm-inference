T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\n\nT1 relaxation (longitudinal relaxation) is influenced by interactions with low-frequency molecular motions, such as those associated with the overall tumbling of molecules in solution. These motions can lead to fluctuations in the local magnetic field that affect the alignment of nuclear spins along the external magnetic field, thus influencing T1 relaxation times.\n\nOn the other hand, T2 relaxation (transverse relaxation) is more sensitive to high-frequency molecular motions and local field inhomogeneities, which cause dephasing of the nuclear spins in the transverse plane. This dephasing occurs due to variations in the local magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei, leading to shorter T2 relaxation times compared to T1 in many cases."
