When employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to stay with an organization for a longer period of time. Job satisfaction can encompass various aspects such as compensation, work environment, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, opportunities for growth, and alignment with personal values and goals. High job satisfaction tends to correlate with lower turnover rates."
