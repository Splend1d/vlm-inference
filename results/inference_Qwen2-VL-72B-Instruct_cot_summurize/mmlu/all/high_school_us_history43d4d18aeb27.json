The excerpt discusses the power given to a commanding officer over a district, describing it as \"absolute monarch\" and reducing the population to \"abject and degrading slavery.\"\n\n2. This language suggests a strong reaction against measures that significantly restrict individual freedoms and impose military control.\n\n3. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 were enacted during the post-Civil War period to establish military districts in the South and impose federal oversight on state governments to protect the rights of newly freed slaves.\n\nGiven this context, the excerpt aligns with the concerns expressed by President Andrew Johnson regarding the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, which he strongly opposed because they imposed significant federal control over the Southern states and restricted his ability to manage Reconstruction as he saw fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. President Andrew Johnson's veto of one of the Reconstruction Acts of 1867."
