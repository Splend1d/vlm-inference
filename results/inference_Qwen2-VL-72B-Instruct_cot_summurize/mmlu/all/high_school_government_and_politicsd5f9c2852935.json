They often create PACs to support candidates who favor business-friendly policies.\n\n4. **Religious Institutions**: While religious groups can be influential in certain political issues, they typically do not form as many PACs as other groups due to restrictions on political activity for tax-exempt organizations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n**C. For-profit business**\n\nThis choice reflects the significant role that businesses play in political funding and lobbying efforts through PACs."
