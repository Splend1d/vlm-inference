The degree of the sum of two polynomials does not necessarily equal the maximum of their individual degrees. Consider the following counterexample:\n\nLet \\( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = -x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\nThen,\n\\[ f(x) + g(x) = (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + (-x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 2x^2 + 2x + 2 \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\deg(f(x)) = 3 \\), \\( \\deg(g(x)) = 3 \\), but \\( \\deg(f(x) + g(x)) = 2 \\).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is false.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"If \\( F \\) is a field then every ideal of \\( F[x] \\) is principal.\"\n\nThis statement is true. In a field \\( F \\), the polynomial ring \\( F[x] \\) is a principal ideal domain (PID). This means that every ideal in \\( F[x] \\) can be generated by a single element. Specifically, every ideal in \\( F[x] \\) is of the form \\( (p(x)) \\) for some polynomial \\( p(x) \\in F[x] \\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is D: False, True."
