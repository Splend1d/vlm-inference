While it is true that skill plays a role in both, this does not fully capture the essence of a comparison between social life and chess.\n\nB. **Winning a game of chess, like life, frequently depends on luck.**\n   - This statement emphasizes the role of luck in both chess and life. However, chess is generally considered more about strategy and skill rather than luck, so this might not be the best fit for Ross' comparison.\n\nC. **In both games of chess and social life, there is effectively a dispute or contest.**\n   - This statement highlights the competitive nature of both chess and social interactions. While there can be disputes and contests in social life, this might not fully encapsulate the broader aspects of social life compared to chess.\n\nD. **Social life is similar to chess because individual actions are often related to a common idea of rules.**\n   - This statement suggests that both chess and social life operate under a set of rules. In chess, players follow specific rules to make moves, and in social life, individuals adhere to societal norms and expectations. This captures a fundamental similarity between the two.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that most accurately explains Ross' comparison of social life to the game of chess is:\n\n**D. Social life is similar to chess because individual actions are often related to a common idea of rules.**"
