The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?\n\nA. $4,000,000\nB. $5,000,000\nC. $8,000,000\nD. $8,500,000\n"

It seems there might be an error in the question or the options given. Based on the calculations, the correct depreciation expense for the year should be $12.5 million."
