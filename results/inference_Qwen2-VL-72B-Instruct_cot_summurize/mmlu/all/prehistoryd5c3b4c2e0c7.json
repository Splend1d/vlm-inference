It is not an ice mass.\n\nB. **Laurentide**: The Laurentide Ice Sheet was a vast ice sheet that covered much of Canada and the northern United States during the Pleistocene epoch. However, it was primarily centered over eastern North America, not the Rocky Mountains.\n\nC. **Cordilleran**: The Cordilleran Ice Sheet was a major ice sheet that covered parts of western North America, including the Rocky Mountains. This ice sheet extended from Alaska down through British Columbia and into Washington and Idaho.\n\nD. **McKenzie Corridor**: This term does not refer to an ice mass but rather to a potential migration route through the Rocky Mountains.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Cordilleran**"
