It is often used to describe population growth, where the initial slow growth is due to limited resources or other constraints, followed by rapid growth as those constraints are overcome, and finally leveling off as the population reaches its carrying capacity.\n\nGiven this context, the statement that best describes an application of the S-curve is:\n\nB. Graph of the growth of human populations since their first appearance on Earth\n\nThis option accurately reflects the typical pattern of population growth described by the S-curve: slow initial growth, followed by a period of rapid increase, and eventually leveling off as the population approaches the limits of its environment."
