The principal, sent the student's parents a letter notifying them of the three-day suspension for the above-mentioned charges. The suspension was to take effect on February 1. The principal also included a copy of the disciplinary code in the letter. On January 19, the student and his mother met with the principal in his office to discuss the matter, and the student admitted that he used abusive language to a fellow student. On January 22, the student's parents received a letter informing them that his teacher had upheld the school administration's decision to suspend their son. They were then notified of a hearing on the recommended suspension to be held at the school. The parents did not attend this hearing, but were advised that the school board upheld the suspension, effective February 1. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the student's suspension?\n\nA. The student's suspension deprived him of liberty and property without due process, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The student's conduct was protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.\nC. The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process.\nD. The disciplinary code violated the student's right to a compulsory school education.\n"

The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the student and his parents were given notice of the charges, an opportunity to meet with the principal to discuss the matter, and a hearing before the school board to appeal the suspension. These procedures generally satisfy the requirements of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, which mandates that individuals must receive fair notice and an opportunity to be heard before they can be deprived of a significant interest such as continued enrollment in school."
