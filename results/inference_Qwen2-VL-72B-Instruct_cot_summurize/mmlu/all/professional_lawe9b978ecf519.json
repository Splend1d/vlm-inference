Instead, he hit and injured a hiker. The hunter had not realized that the hiker was there. Does the injured hiker have an actionable battery claim against the hunter?\n\nA. No, because the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\nB. No, because the hunter did not make direct physical contact with the hiker.\nC. Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\nD. Yes, because the hunter intentionally shot the rifle.\n"

Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\n\nBattery is a tort that involves the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person without their consent. In this scenario, even though the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker, the act of shooting the rifle resulted in direct physical contact (the bullet hitting the hiker), which constitutes battery. The intent to shoot the deer does not negate the fact that the hiker was physically harmed by the hunter's actions."
