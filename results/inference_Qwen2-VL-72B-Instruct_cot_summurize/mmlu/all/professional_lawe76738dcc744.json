The prisoner came from a family of farmers, dating back to at least 1750. His family believed that all nourishment comes from the ground and that one's soul will be saved only if his diet consists totally of natural, farm-grown food. The prisoner followed that belief and ate only fresh fruits and vegetables. He further believes that a higher power has commanded him to eat only vegetarian foods. When the prisoner entered the prison state prison officials agreed to grant his wishes and served him only fresh fruits and vegetables for his meals. After six months, deciding that catering to his special diet was overly burdensome and administratively unworkable, the officials decided to stop giving the prisoner special treatment and began to serve him the same food as served to the rest of the prison population. Although nothing physically prohibited the prisoner from eating and surviving on the general prison population's diet, he refused to eat the food that was not in conformity with his special diet. The prisoner's best constitutional argument to support his claim of the right to a fresh fruit and vegetable diet is based on\n\nA. the First Amendment.\nB. the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as applied to the states.\nC. the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause.\nD. the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

In this case, the prisoner's refusal to eat the general prison population's diet stems from his deeply held religious beliefs about the importance of consuming only natural, farm-grown food. This belief is rooted in his family's long-standing tradition and his personal conviction that it is a commandment from a higher power. Therefore, the prisoner could argue that denying him access to a diet consistent with his religious beliefs violates his constitutional right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment."
