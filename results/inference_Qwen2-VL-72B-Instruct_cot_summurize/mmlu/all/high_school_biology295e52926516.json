Memory cells\n\nMemory cells, which include memory B cells and memory T cells, are responsible for the rapid and robust immune response observed when an individual is re-exposed to the same pathogen. These cells are generated during the initial immune response and persist in the body, allowing for a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposures. This results in fewer symptoms and quicker recovery, as seen in the scenario described."
