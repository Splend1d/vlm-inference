Civilians taking on this role without proper authority or training could lead to legal issues or harm to all parties involved.\n\nBased on these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is considered morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy and potential harm to the child.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that, while understandable, might not be legally or morally appropriate for a civilian to undertake without proper authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
