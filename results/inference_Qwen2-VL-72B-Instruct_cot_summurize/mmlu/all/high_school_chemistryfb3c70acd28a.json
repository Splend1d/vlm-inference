The larger the difference in electronegativity, the greater the bond polarity.\n\nHere are the electronegativities of the relevant elements:\n- Oxygen (O): 3.44\n- Fluorine (F): 3.98\n- Sulfur (S): 2.58\n- Phosphorus (P): 2.19\n- Carbon (C): 2.55\n- Nitrogen (N): 3.04\n- Boron (B): 2.04\n\nNow let's calculate the electronegativity differences for each bond:\n\nA. S\u2013O: |3.44 - 2.58| = 0.86\nB. P\u2013F: |3.98 - 2.19| = 1.79\nC. C\u2013B: |2.55 - 2.04| = 0.51\nD. C\u2013N: |3.04 - 2.55| = 0.49\n\nThe bond with the largest electronegativity difference is B. P\u2013F, which has an electronegativity difference of 1.79. Therefore, the P\u2013F bond is expected to have the largest bond polarity."
