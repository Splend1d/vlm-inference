According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him \"wandering aimlessly\", and at times \"suspiciously\" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?\n\nA. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.\nB. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.\nC. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n"

Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u2014 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n\nFalse imprisonment occurs when someone intentionally confines another person without lawful justification and against their will. In this scenario, the man was detained by the security officers and forced to sit in a chair in the hallway until the police arrived, even though he had not committed any crime. The fact that he later produced receipts for the items indicates that there was no probable cause for his detention. Therefore, the court may allow the case to go to the jury to determine whether the hotel is liable for false imprisonment."
