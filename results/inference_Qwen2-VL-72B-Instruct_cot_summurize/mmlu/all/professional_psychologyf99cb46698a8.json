When TQM fails, it is often because employees do not feel sufficiently involved or empowered to contribute their ideas and suggestions for improving quality. This can lead to a lack of buy-in and commitment from employees, which undermines the effectiveness of TQM initiatives. While leadership skills, team versus individual effort, and linking pay and benefits to team performance can also impact the success of TQM, insufficient employee involvement is typically the primary reason for failure."
