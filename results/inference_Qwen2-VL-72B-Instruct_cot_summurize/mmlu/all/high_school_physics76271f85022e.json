                    "text": "To determine the effect of adding a second block of equal mass to the oscillating block on the amplitude of the oscillations, we need to consider the conservation of energy and the dynamics of the system.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The system consists of a single block oscillating horizontally on a spring. The total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) of the system is conserved as long as there is no external work done on the system.\n\n2. **Adding the Second Block**: When the second block of equal mass falls onto the first block and sticks to it, the total mass of the oscillating system doubles. This changes the system's inertia but does not directly affect the total mechanical energy if we assume the collision is perfectly inelastic (i.e., no energy is lost).\n\n3. **Energy Consideration**: Since the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved, the new combined mass will continue to oscillate with the same total energy. However, because the mass has doubled, the kinetic energy at any given point in the oscillation will be distributed over twice the mass.\n\n4. **Amplitude of Oscillation**: The amplitude of an oscillation is related to the maximum displacement from equilibrium. For a simple harmonic oscillator, the amplitude is determined by the initial conditions and the total energy of the system. Since the total energy remains constant, the amplitude of the oscillation should also remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It will have no effect."
