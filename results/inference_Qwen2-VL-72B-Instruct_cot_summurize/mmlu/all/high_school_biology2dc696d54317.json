ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle.\n\nIn photosynthesis, the light reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are energy-rich molecules. These molecules then move into the stroma where the Calvin cycle takes place. The Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions or the dark reactions, uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose and other organic compounds. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
