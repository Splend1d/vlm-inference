There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934\nSenator Huey P. Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" was a political program intended to\n\nA. demonstrate Senator Long's commitment to fighting communism.\nB. return the United States to the economic ideas of the late nineteenth century.\nC. persuade voters that Senator Long had a plan to combat the Great Depression.\nD. showcase Senator Long's understanding of the constitutional ideas of the Founding Fathers.\n"

Long's statement:\n\n1. **Context**: The statement was made during the Great Depression, a time of significant economic hardship in the United States.\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - The society aims to limit poverty by ensuring a minimum level of wealth for families.\n   - It proposes limiting the wealth of the very rich to prevent extreme inequality.\n   - The goal is to provide basic necessities (home, automobile, radio, education) to all families.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is:\n\nC. persuade voters that Senator Long had a plan to combat the Great Depression.\n\nThe other options do not align as closely with the content of the statement:\n- A. There is no mention of communism or fighting it.\n- B. The proposal does not suggest a return to late nineteenth-century economic ideas.\n- D. There is no explicit reference to constitutional ideas of the Founding Fathers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is C."
