By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n"

It highlights how different military needs influenced the development of these technologies.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - In Europe, early cannons were useful in sieges, leading to further investment and innovation in gunpowder weaponry.\n   - In China, the main threat came from mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were ineffective.\n   - As a result, China focused on improving horse archer units rather than developing gunpowder weaponry.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\"\n     - The passage does not mention anything about Confucian traditionalism influencing the decision regarding gunpowder weaponry.\n   \n   - **Option B**: \"They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss the numerical strength of Chinese armed forces or any misplaced faith in it.\n   \n   - **Option C**: \"They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\"\n     - This option aligns well with the passage. The passage states that China faced threats from mobile steppe nomads and thus focused on improving horse archer units, which were more effective against such threats.\n   \n   - **Option D**: \"They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\"\n     - The passage does not mention financial constraints as a reason for China's focus on horse archers over gunpowder weaponry.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.**"
