Adequate glycogen stores help maintain energy levels throughout the race.\n\nD. **Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content**: While ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and phosphocreatine are important for short bursts of high-intensity activity, they are not the primary energy sources for endurance events like marathons. These compounds are more relevant for anaerobic activities that require quick bursts of energy rather than sustained aerobic effort.\n\nGiven this analysis, the characteristic that is not important for success in endurance events such as the marathon race is:\n\n**D. Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.**"
