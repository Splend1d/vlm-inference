Combinational circuits do not have feedback loops, whereas sequential circuits often do to store information.\n\nII. **Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.**\n   - This statement is correct. Combinational circuits produce outputs solely based on their current inputs and do not retain any memory of past inputs. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, can remember past inputs due to the presence of memory elements like flip-flops.\n\nIII. **Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Combinational circuits do not require an external clock as they operate based on the current input values. Sequential circuits typically require a clock signal to synchronize their operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. II only**"
