In contrast, animal cells do not have a cell wall; they only have a cell membrane. While ribosomes and cell membranes are present in both prokaryotic and animal cells, and chloroplasts are found in plant cells rather than animal cells, the presence or absence of a cell wall is a distinguishing feature between prokaryotic and animal cells."
