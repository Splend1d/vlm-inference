Although\\he driver immediately applied his brakes and swerved to avoid the girl, the cat hit the girl, fracturing her legs. As the girl was lying in the street awaiting an ambulance, the driver rushed over to her and said: \"Im terribly sorry. This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'fl pay for everything. \"When the girl was later released from the hospital, her parents contacted the driver who refused to pay anything. The driver told the girl's mother, \"Since your daughter ran into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you for the damage to my new car. \"If the girl's parents, on her behalf, sue the driver in tort, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements?\n\nA. The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car, as well as his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills, are both admissible on the issue of negligence.\nB.

The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills is not admissible in accordance with public policy considerations.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal terms, statements made by a party after an accident can be admissible or inadmissible depending on their nature and context. \n\n1. **Statement Regarding Operation of the Car**: This statement (\"I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault.\") is an admission that could be relevant to establishing negligence. Admissions by a party about their actions or responsibility are generally admissible in court as they can provide evidence of liability.\n\n2. **Statement Concerning Payment of Hospital Bills**: This statement (\"Send me all your hospital bills. I'll pay for everything.\") is typically considered an offer to pay medical expenses and is often excluded under the rule against admitting offers to pay medical expenses as evidence of liability. This exclusion is based on public policy considerations to encourage parties to make good-faith offers to settle claims without fear that such offers will be used against them in court.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately reflects the admissibility of these two types of statements in the context of a tort lawsuit."
