This is because the pKa represents the pH at which the acid (H2PO4-) and its conjugate base (HPO42-) have equal concentrations.\n\nGiven:\n- Chemical shift of H2PO4- = 3.42 ppm\n- Chemical shift of HPO42- = 5.82 ppm\n\nWhen the pH equals the pKa, the ratio of [HPO42-] to [H2PO4-] is 1:1. Therefore, the observed chemical shift will be the average of the two chemical shifts:\n\n\\[ \\text{Observed chemical shift} = \\frac{\\text{Chemical shift of H2PO4-} + \\text{Chemical shift of HPO42-}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Observed chemical shift} = \\frac{3.42 \\, \\text{ppm} + 5.82 \\, \\text{ppm}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Observed chemical shift} = \\frac{9.24 \\, \\text{ppm}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Observed chemical shift} = 4.62 \\, \\text{ppm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4.62 ppm"
