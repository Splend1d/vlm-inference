This allows them to prepare and schedule any necessary sessions before or after his absence. It also helps manage their expectations regarding his availability during that period. If there is a need for emergency contact or continuity of care, providing the phone number of a colleague who has agreed to accept calls in emergencies (option C) could be an additional measure to ensure client well-being. However, discussing the vacation plans directly with the clients is the most crucial step."
