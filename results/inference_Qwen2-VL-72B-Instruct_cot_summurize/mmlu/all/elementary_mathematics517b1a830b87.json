Add 4 each time to get the next number.**\n   - If we start with 0 and add 4 each time:\n     - \\(0 + 4 = 4\\)\n     - \\(4 + 4 = 8\\)\n     - \\(8 + 4 = 12\\)\n     - This sequence does not match the given pattern.\n\n2. **Option B: Start with 0. Add 5 each time to get the next number.**\n   - If we start with 0 and add 5 each time:\n     - \\(0 + 5 = 5\\)\n     - \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n     - \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\n     - This sequence also does not match the given pattern.\n\n3. **Option C: Start with 5. Add 4 each time to get the next number.**\n   - If we start with 5 and add 4 each time:\n     - \\(5 + 4 = 9\\)\n     - \\(9 + 4 = 13\\)\n     - \\(13 + 4 = 17\\)\n     - \\(17 + 4 = 21\\)\n     - \\(21 + 4 = 25\\)\n     - \\(25 + 4 = 29\\)\n     - This sequence matches the given pattern perfectly.\n\n4. **Option D: Start with 5. Add 5 each time to get the next number.**\n   - If we start with 5 and add 5 each time:\n     - \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n     - \\(10 + 5 = 15\\)\n     - \\(15 + 5 = 20\\)\n     - This sequence does not match the given pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct rule that could have been used to make the pattern is:\n\n**C.
