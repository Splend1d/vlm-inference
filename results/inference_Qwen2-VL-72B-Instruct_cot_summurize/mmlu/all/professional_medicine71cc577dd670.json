Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne?\n\nA. Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands\nB. Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone\nC. Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands\nD. Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens\n"

Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens\n\nAcne is often associated with increased levels of androgens, which can stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil (sebum). This excess sebum can lead to clogged pores and the development of acne lesions. The presence of breast and pubic hair development at Tanner stage 5 suggests that the patient has gone through normal puberty, during which androgen levels typically increase."
