The region where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be chosen is a rectangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,4)\\), and \\((0,4)\\).\n\nThe total area of this rectangle is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) square units, representing all possible combinations of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nNow, we want to find the area where \\(x < y\\). This condition is satisfied by the points below the line \\(y = x\\), within our rectangle. \n\nDrawing the line \\(y = x\\) on our rectangle, we see it will intersect the rectangle at \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,3)\\). The area under this line within our rectangle forms a right triangle with base and height both equal to 3 (since the line \\(y = x\\) intersects the rectangle at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 3\\)).\n\nThe area of this triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\) square units.\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(x < y\\) is the ratio of the area where \\(x < y\\) to the total area, which is \\(\\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{12} = \\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have led us astray because none of the provided options match this result. Let's re-evaluate the approach:\n\nUpon closer inspection, the correct approach should consider the entire area where \\(x < y\\), not just the triangle formed by \\(y = x\\). The correct area where \\(x < y\\) is actually the entire rectangle minus the triangle where \\(x > y\\).\n\nThe triangle where \\(x > y\\) has an area of \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\) square units, as previously calculated. However, this is the area we don't want; we want the area where \\(x < y\\), which is the rest of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the area where \\(x < y\\) is the total area minus the unwanted triangle: \\(12 - \\frac{9}{2} = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5\\) square units.\n\nThus, the probability that \\(x < y\\) is \\(\\frac{7.5}{12} = \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{5}{8}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is C. 5/8."
