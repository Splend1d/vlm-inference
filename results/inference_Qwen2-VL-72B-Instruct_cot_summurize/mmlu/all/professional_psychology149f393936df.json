ERP is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves gradually exposing the individual to the situations or objects that trigger their obsessions and compulsions, while teaching them to resist the urge to perform the compulsive behaviors. Antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have also been shown to be effective in reducing OCD symptoms. However, the combination of ERP and medication is typically more effective than either treatment alone."
