An upward shift in MC.\n\nWhen the per unit price of labor, a variable resource, increases, it directly affects the Marginal Cost (MC) because labor is a component of the cost to produce one additional unit of output. As the cost of labor rises, the cost of producing each additional unit also rises, leading to an upward shift in the Marginal Cost curve. \n\nAverage Fixed Cost (AFC) and Average Total Cost (ATC) are not directly affected by changes in the price of a variable input like labor in the short run, as they include fixed costs that do not change with output levels. The Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) measures the change in output from an additional unit of labor and is not directly influenced by the price of labor but rather by productivity."
