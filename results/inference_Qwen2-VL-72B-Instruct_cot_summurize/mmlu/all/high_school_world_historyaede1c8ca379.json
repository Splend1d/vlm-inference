The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Context and Core of the Question**: The passage describes the harsh conditions faced by Native Americans working in the mines of Spanish South America. It highlights the exploitation, lack of payment, and abuse by mine owners, as well as the corruption among colonial officials.\n\n2. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **A. The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts**: While the passage mentions that Indians end up in debt due to unfair practices, it does not explicitly state that debt slavery was formally adopted as a system.\n   - **B. The absence of corruption among elites**: This option is directly contradicted by the passage, which clearly states that colonial officials are corrupted by bribes from mine owners.\n   - **C. The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects**: The passage implies that the king is not being informed about the abuses due to corruption among officials, but it does not directly state that the king lacks interest.\n   - **D. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth**: The passage describes how Indians are exploited and treated differently from Spaniards and mestizos, indicating a social hierarchy based on origin of birth.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The most accurate interpretation of the passage is that it provides evidence for the imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth, as it highlights the differential treatment and exploitation of Native Americans compared to Spaniards and mestizos.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D. The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth."
