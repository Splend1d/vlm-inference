In this case, r = 0.9 indicates a strong positive correlation between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs.\n- The square of the correlation coefficient (r^2), also known as the coefficient of determination, represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable. \n- Therefore, r^2 = (0.9)^2 = 0.81 or 81%. This means that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in the number of study hours per day.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they make specific claims about percentages of students which cannot be directly inferred from the correlation coefficient alone. Option C is incorrect because it incorrectly states the percentage as 90%, whereas the correct calculation based on r^2 gives 81%."
