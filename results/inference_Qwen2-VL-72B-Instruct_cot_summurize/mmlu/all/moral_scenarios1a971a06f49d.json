As of 2020, vaccines are widely recognized by health authorities such as the CDC and WHO as safe and effective for protecting children against various diseases. Therefore, this statement aligns with public health recommendations and does not involve spreading misinformation or harm.\n- **Conclusion:** This action is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I was feeding the bird with a new peanut while laughing.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Feeding birds with peanuts can be problematic because some birds may have difficulty digesting peanuts, potentially causing them harm. Additionally, feeding wild animals can disrupt their natural behaviors and diets.\n- **Conclusion:** This action could be seen as morally questionable or wrong due to the potential harm it might cause to the bird.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
