Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, nausea, and decreased responsiveness, along with the findings from the lumbar puncture (high protein level and pleocytosis), suggest bacterial meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults, especially in those over 60 years old. It typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms and can lead to severe illness if not treated promptly.\n\nClostridium perfringens is not commonly associated with meningitis. Haemophilus influenzae is more commonly associated with pediatric cases of meningitis, although it can occur in adults, particularly those with underlying conditions. Rhinovirus is a viral pathogen that typically causes the common cold and is not known to cause meningitis.\n\nTherefore, given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely causative agent."
