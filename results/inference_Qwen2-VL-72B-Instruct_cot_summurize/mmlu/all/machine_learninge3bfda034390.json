This combination will definitely result in a decrease in \\(P(B|A)\\).\n\n   **Option C: \\(P(B)\\) decreases**\n   - There is no direct relationship between the changes in \\(P(A \\cap B)\\), \\(P(A)\\), and \\(P(B)\\) provided by the problem. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \\(P(B)\\) decreases based on the given information.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that can be definitively concluded from the given conditions is Option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. \\(P(B|A)\\) decreases**"
