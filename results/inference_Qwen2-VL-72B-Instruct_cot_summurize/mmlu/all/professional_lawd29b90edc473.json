One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n"

This action can be seen as aiding and abetting the crime, which can also constitute conspiracy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrect because it only addresses the two men\u2019s guilt for conspiracy.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect because it incorrectly states that the alarm specialist is guilty of conspiracy without considering attempted burglary.\n- **Option C**: Incorrect because it incorrectly states that the two men are guilty of conspiracy and attempted burglary, but does not include the alarm specialist's liability.\n- **Option D**: Correct because it accurately states that all three individuals (the two men and the alarm specialist) are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**D. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.**"
