He suggests that it is possible that an evil demon might be deceiving us about the nature of reality, including our own existence and the existence of the external world. This idea serves as a way for Descartes to doubt everything that can be doubted, leading him ultimately to affirm the one thing he cannot doubt: his own thinking existence (\"Cogito, ergo sum\" or \"I think, therefore I am\")."
