It is composed primarily of ionized gases, or plasma, at temperatures ranging from about 1 million to several million degrees Celsius. Despite its high temperature, the corona is not very bright because it is extremely diffuse, meaning that the density of the plasma is very low. This makes it difficult to see the corona with the naked eye or even with most telescopes, except during a total solar eclipse when the Moon blocks out the bright light of the Sun's photosphere, allowing the fainter corona to be seen."
