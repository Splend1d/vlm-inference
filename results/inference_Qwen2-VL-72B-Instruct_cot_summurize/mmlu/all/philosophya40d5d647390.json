Specifically, Socrates acknowledges that without knowledge of the essences of things (like justice), actions cannot be rationally justified.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **Justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.**\n   - This option suggests a pessimistic view that we can never attain knowledge. However, Socrates' wisdom is more nuanced; it's about recognizing ignorance rather than asserting permanent ignorance.\n\nB. **He knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.**\n   - This option implies that Socrates has a clear goal in mind: seeking knowledge of the essences of things. While this is true, it doesn't fully capture the essence of his wisdom regarding the justification of actions.\n\nC. **Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.**\n   - This option suggests an inherent paradox in knowing the essences of things. It aligns with Socratic thought by highlighting the difficulty in attaining such knowledge, which supports the idea that actions without such knowledge are unjustified.\n\nD. **His method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.**\n   - This option focuses on the method rather than the recognition of ignorance. It doesn't directly address the core of Socratic wisdom related to the justification of actions based on knowledge.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting option that encapsulates Socrates' wisdom in recognizing the necessity of knowledge for rational justification of actions is:\n\n**C. Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.**\n\nThis option best reflects the idea that without knowledge of the essences, actions cannot be rationally justified, aligning with Socrates' wisdom."
