                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of consequentialist ethics:\n\nA. **It fails to reconcile prima facie duties.**\n   - Prima facie duties are duties that appear to be binding unless overridden by other considerations. Consequentialism focuses on the outcomes of actions rather than on duties themselves, so this could be seen as a flaw if one believes that duties should be considered independently of consequences.\n\nB. **It can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels.**\n   - This suggests that consequentialism might not allow for a coherent integration of different life commitments or roles. However, this is more about the complexity of human life and less about a specific flaw in consequentialist calculation itself.\n\nC. **It can run counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational actors.**\n   - Consequentialism typically assumes that individuals make decisions based on the outcomes of their actions, which aligns with the idea of individual rationality. Therefore, this option doesn't seem to describe a flaw in consequentialist calculation.\n\nD. **It fails to recognize that possibility that the persons are best understood in relation to one another.**\n   - Consequentialism often focuses on individual actions and their outcomes without considering the relational aspects of human beings. This could be seen as a flaw because it overlooks the interconnectedness of people and the importance of relationships in ethical decision-making.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting description of a flaw in consequentialist calculation, according to Hourdequin, is:\n\n**D. It fails to recognize that possibility that the persons are best understood in relation to one another.**\n\nThis option highlights a significant critique of consequentialism: its tendency to overlook the relational and social dimensions of human existence."
