                    "text": "To determine which scenario would most clearly be constitutional under the new federal statute, we need to consider the scope and intent of the statute. The statute aims to stabilize rents for both residential and commercial properties across the United States, protecting tenants from excessive rent increases while ensuring that landlords' constitutional rights are not infringed upon.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.**\n   - This scenario involves a state-owned property being rented to a private entity. Federal statutes typically do not apply to state-owned properties, especially when the state itself is involved in the transaction. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be covered by the new federal statute.\n\nB. **The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.**\n   - The District of Columbia (D.C.) is a federal district, and federal statutes generally have jurisdiction over D.C. This scenario involves a residential property being rented to a family, fitting well within the statute's aim to protect tenants from spiraling rents. Thus, this option is likely to be constitutional under the new federal statute.\n\nC. **The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.**\n   - This scenario involves a commercial transaction where a real estate company is renting an apartment to an individual tenant. While it fits the general description of the statute's application to residential properties, it does not specify whether the apartment is in a federal jurisdiction or if there are any other factors that might affect its constitutionality.\n\nD. **The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.**\n   - This scenario involves a commercial property being rented to a city. Although the statute covers commercial properties, the involvement of a city (a local government entity) might complicate matters regarding jurisdiction and applicability. It is less clear-cut compared to a straightforward private transaction.\n\nGiven these analyses, the scenario that most clearly falls under the constitutional application of the new federal statute is:\n\n**B. The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.**\n\nThis option directly aligns with the statute's objectives and jurisdictional scope."
