The gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 for a proton is approximately 42.576 MHz/T, but since we're dealing with a carbon nucleus, we need to use the gyromagnetic ratio specific to 13C, which is about -0.0006725 MHz/T.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic moment:\n\n\u03bcI = \u03b3 * I\n\u03bcI = (-0.0006725 MHz/T) * (1/2)\n\u03bcI = -0.00033625 MHz/T\n\nTo convert this value into joules per tesla (J T^-1), we need to remember that 1 MHz/T is equivalent to approximately 6.582119569 \u00d7 10^-22 J T^-1.\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bcI = -0.00033625 MHz/T * 6.582119569 \u00d7 10^-22 J T^-1/MHz/T\n\u03bcI \u2248 -2.207 \u00d7 10^-25 J T^-1\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculated value exactly, and the negative sign indicates the direction of the magnetic moment relative to the spin. It seems there might have been an error in the question or the options provided. If we consider only the magnitude without the direction, it still doesn't match any of the given options. Please double-check the question or the options provided."
