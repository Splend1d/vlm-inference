If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThe long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following?\n\nA.

Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe\n\nOtto von Bismarck's speech highlights the grievances and insecurities faced by workers, particularly regarding their health, employment stability, and lack of support from society. This speech contributed to the development of social welfare policies and socialized programs aimed at addressing these issues. Bismarck's initiatives in Germany, such as the introduction of social insurance systems for workers, set a precedent that influenced other European countries to adopt similar social welfare measures. Therefore, the long-term effect of his speech includes the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe."
