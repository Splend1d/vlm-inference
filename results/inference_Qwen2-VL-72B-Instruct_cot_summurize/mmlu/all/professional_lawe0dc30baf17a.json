Although the developer wanted to build an office building on the property, the land was zoned residential. Due to the residential zoning, the developer could not pursue his planned development unless he received a variance from the building commission. The developer held a meeting with a member of the building commission to solicit his approval in securing a zoning variance. To do so, the developer gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. Thereupon, the commission member voted to approve the variance, thus making it possible for the developer to commence construction of the office building. The developer was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery. During the course of the trial, the commission member testified that he faked the agreement with the developer and would have approved the zoning variance regardless of whether the developer gave him any money. Furthermore, in his defense, the developer presented evidence that the other six members of the building commission voted affirmatively to approve the variance. If the jury believed that the commission member would have approved the variance even had he not received the $10,000, the developer should be found\n\nA. guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.\nB. guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.\nC. not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.\nD. not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the appropriate verdict for the developer based on the given scenario and the applicable bribery statute, let's analyze each option:\n\n### Option A: Guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.\n\n- **Analysis:** This option suggests that the mere agreement to accept the bribe is enough to establish guilt. However, the statute requires that a thing of value must actually be offered or given in exchange for official action. The developer did indeed give the $10,000, but the question here is whether the commission member's agreement alone is sufficient for a conspiracy charge without considering the actual receipt of the bribe.\n\n### Option B: Guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.\n\n- **Analysis:** According to the statute, offering or giving a thing of value in exchange for official action constitutes bribery. The developer did give $10,000 to the commission member in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. This directly aligns with the statutory definition of bribery.\n\n### Option C: Not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.\n\n- **Analysis:** This option hinges on the commission member's testimony that he would have approved the variance regardless of the bribe. However, the statute does not require that the official action be influenced by the bribe; it only requires that a thing of value be given in exchange for official action. The developer still gave the $10,000, which meets the statutory requirement.\n\n### Option D: Not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.\n\n- **Analysis:** This option implies that the developer and the commission member did not genuinely agree to the bribe. However, the developer did give the $10,000, and the commission member accepted it. Whether they had a genuine agreement is less relevant than the fact that the developer gave the money in exchange for the commission member's support.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\n**Final Answer: B. guilty, because he gave the commission member the $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.**\n\nThe developer's act of giving the $10,000 in exchange for the commission member's support directly satisfies the statutory requirements for bribery, regardless of the commission member's intent or subsequent actions."
