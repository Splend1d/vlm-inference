The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that \"shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20.\" When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n"

This means any deviation from these terms would not constitute a valid acceptance.\n\n2. **Manufacturer's Confirmation**: The manufacturer confirmed the order but proposed a different delivery schedule (half by August 10 and the other half by August 20). This is a material change to the original terms of the offer regarding delivery dates.\n\n3. **Withdrawal of Order**: The retailer withdrew the order when the shipment was not made by August 1, indicating dissatisfaction with the altered delivery terms.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the difference between the offer and acceptance was minimal. However, the change in delivery dates is significant enough to affect the retailer's business operations and thus cannot be considered minimal.\n\n- **Option B**: This option implies that the retailer's silence until after August 1 constitutes assent to the new terms. However, the retailer explicitly withdrew the order, indicating non-assent to the modified terms.\n\n- **Option C**: This option states that the offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. Since the manufacturer's confirmation deviated from these terms, it did not constitute a valid acceptance.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped, which is true but does not address the validity of the contract formation itself.\n\nBased on the principle that acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer for a contract to be formed, and given that the manufacturer's confirmation did not match the original terms, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.**"
