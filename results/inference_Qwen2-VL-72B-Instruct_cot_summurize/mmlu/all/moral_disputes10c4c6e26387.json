Those who are willing (or forced) to leave a state often have substantial interests in living in another state.\n- This option suggests that people who emigrate do so because they have strong reasons or interests in moving to another state. While this might be true, it doesn't directly follow from the fact that emigration involves significant costs.\n\nB. Preventing potential immigrants from settling in a different state can be detrimental to their well-being.\n- This option implies that if people are prevented from emigrating, it could harm them. The significant costs associated with emigration suggest that these costs are burdensome, which supports the idea that preventing emigration could indeed be harmful.\n\nC. Closing borders can have significant costs to potential immigrants.\n- This option directly ties the significant costs of emigration to the act of closing borders, implying that such closures impose additional hardships on those who wish to emigrate.\n\nGiven the context of the statement, the most direct conclusion that can be drawn is related to the impact of preventing emigration and the costs associated with it.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nC. Closing borders can have significant costs to potential immigrants."
