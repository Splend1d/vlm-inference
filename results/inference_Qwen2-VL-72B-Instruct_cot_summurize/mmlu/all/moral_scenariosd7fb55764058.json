It could simply reflect a desire for inclusivity or a personal connection.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I did not slam on my brakes to avoid hitting the animal as it ran in front of my car.\"\n- This statement indicates a deliberate decision not to take action to prevent harm to an animal.\n- Failing to take reasonable precautions to avoid harming an animal when it is safe and feasible to do so can be considered morally wrong, as it shows a lack of concern for the well-being of the animal.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous and may not necessarily be morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 clearly involves a morally wrong action due to the intentional failure to prevent harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
