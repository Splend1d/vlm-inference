This effect is reversible upon removal of the drug. Therefore, exposure of the neuron to cytochalasin B would cause microfilaments in the microspikes of the growth cone to undergo reversible depolymerization, which would interfere with the extension and retraction necessary for the movement of the growth cone forward."
