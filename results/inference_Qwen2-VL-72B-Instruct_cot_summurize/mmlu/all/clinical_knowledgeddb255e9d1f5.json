It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nShort-acting bronchodilators are typically used before other inhalers because they act quickly to relax the muscles around the airways, making it easier for other medications to reach the lungs effectively. This helps ensure that subsequent medications, such as corticosteroids or long-acting bronchodilators, can be deposited more efficiently and work more effectively."
