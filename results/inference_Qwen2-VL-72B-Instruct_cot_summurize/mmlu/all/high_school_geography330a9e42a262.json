                    "text": "To determine what the terms \"apartheid,\" \"ethnic cleansing,\" and \"integration\" have in common, let's analyze each term:\n\n1. **Apartheid**: This is a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that was practiced in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s.\n\n2. **Ethnic Cleansing**: This refers to the process of forcibly removing an ethnic or religious group from a given area by violent means, often involving mass killings, forced deportations, and other atrocities.\n\n3. **Integration**: This is the process of bringing together people of different racial, cultural, or social backgrounds into a cohesive whole, typically referring to the elimination of segregation and discrimination.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **They all occurred in Nazi Germany during World War I.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because apartheid occurred in South Africa, not Nazi Germany, and ethnic cleansing has occurred in various regions around the world, including but not limited to Nazi Germany.\n\nB. **They are all forms of residential segregation.**\n   - Apartheid involved residential segregation, but ethnic cleansing does not necessarily involve residential segregation; it involves the forcible removal of groups. Integration, on the other hand, aims to eliminate segregation.\n\nC. **They are all ways to integrate different ethnic populations in neighborhoods.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because apartheid and ethnic cleansing are methods of separation and exclusion, whereas integration is about combining different populations.\n\nD. **They are different expressions for the same concept.**\n   - While they all relate to the treatment of different ethnic populations, they represent different concepts: apartheid is a form of segregation, ethnic cleansing is a form of forced removal and violence, and integration is the opposite of segregation, aiming for unity.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the options perfectly capture the commonality among these terms. However, if we consider the broader context of how they relate to the treatment of ethnic populations, the closest fit would be:\n\n**Final Answer: D. They are different expressions for the same concept.**\n\nThis answer acknowledges that while they are distinct processes, they all pertain to the treatment and interaction of different ethnic populations."
