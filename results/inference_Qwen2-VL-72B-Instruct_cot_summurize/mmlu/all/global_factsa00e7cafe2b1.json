Therefore, we can eliminate option D.\n\nNext, considering the cultural context and the prevalence of corporal punishment in some regions, it is plausible that a significant portion of children might report experiencing physical punishment. However, a very low percentage like 10% seems too small for a widespread practice.\n\nBetween 20% and 40%, 40% seems more reasonable given that physical punishment might still be prevalent but not to an extreme extent.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. 40%"
