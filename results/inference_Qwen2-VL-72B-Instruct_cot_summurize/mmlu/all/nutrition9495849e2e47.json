Adipose tissue\n\nAdipose tissue, which consists of fat cells (adipocytes), stores triglycerides and serves as the primary energy reserve in the body. When energy is needed, these triglycerides can be broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be used for energy production. The amount of stored fat in adipose tissue far exceeds the energy stored in other forms such as liver glycogen or muscle glycogen."
