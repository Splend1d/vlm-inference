This is because Ebola is primarily spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person, and nursing a patient at home would involve close contact with the patient and their bodily fluids. Working in a category IV laboratory (A) could also be a risk factor if proper safety protocols are not followed, but this is less common than nursing a patient at home. Attending a funeral of a victim outside (B) or attending football matches or large gatherings (D) are not typically considered to be significant risk factors for Ebola infection."
