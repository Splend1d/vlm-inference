Mike suffers from erectile dysfunction.\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is characterized by the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual activity. In this scenario, Mike is experiencing difficulty in becoming aroused with his wife but not with his secretary, which suggests a specific issue related to erectile function rather than a global dysfunction affecting all aspects of his sexual response. The other options do not accurately describe the situation presented:\n\n- A. Global dysfunction would imply that Mike has trouble getting aroused in all situations, which is not the case here.\n- C. Lubrication inhibition typically refers to issues with vaginal dryness in women, not erectile problems in men.\n- D. While it is possible that Mike might be having an affair with his secretary, this cannot be concluded solely based on the information provided about his arousal difficulties."
