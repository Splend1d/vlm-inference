                    "text": "A. either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up\n\nThis statement is correct because in a balanced chemical equation, the stoichiometry dictates that all reactants will be consumed to form products, assuming the reaction goes to completion. In this case, sulfur (S) and oxygen (O2) will react in a 1:1 ratio to form sulfur dioxide (SO2). If you start with equal amounts of S and O2, one of them will be completely used up when they react to form SO2.\n\nB. Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The reaction quotient (Q) is not necessarily close to 1.0 just because there is an equal number of moles of gas on both sides of the equation. The value of Q depends on the actual concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at any given time during the reaction, not just on the stoichiometry of the balanced equation.\n\nC. this reaction goes to completion\n\nThis statement is incorrect without additional information. While it is possible for a reaction to go to completion under certain conditions, such as when one of the reactants is present in excess or when the product is removed from the system, we cannot assume that this reaction will go to completion based solely on the balanced equation. The extent to which a reaction proceeds depends on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the specific reaction.\n\nD. adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The equilibrium constant (K) for a reaction is a characteristic property of the reaction at a given temperature and does not change with changes in concentration or pressure of the reactants or products. Adding more O2 will shift the equilibrium position according to Le Chatelier's principle, but it will not change the value of the equilibrium constant K."
