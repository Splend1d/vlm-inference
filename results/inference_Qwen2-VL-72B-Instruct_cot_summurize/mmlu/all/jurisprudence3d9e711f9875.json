Organic solidarity leads to restitutive law.\n\nEmile Durkheim, a prominent sociologist, distinguished between two types of social solidarity: mechanical and organic. In societies characterized by mechanical solidarity, individuals perform similar tasks and share common values and beliefs. This type of solidarity is often found in simpler, less specialized societies. The law in such societies tends to be repressive, focusing on punishment and deterrence to maintain social cohesion.\n\nIn contrast, organic solidarity arises in more complex, specialized societies where individuals perform different roles and rely on each other for mutual support. Here, the law tends to be restitutive, aiming to restore the balance disrupted by offenses rather than merely punishing the offender. This approach reflects the interdependence of individuals in a highly specialized society."
