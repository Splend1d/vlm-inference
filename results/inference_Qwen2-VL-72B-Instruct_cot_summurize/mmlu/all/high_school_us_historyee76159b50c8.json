We apprehend it, therefore, to be hard usage, and will doubtless (if continued) reduce us to a state of beggary, whereby we shall become a burthen to others, if not timely prevented by the interposition of your justice and your power.\n\"Your petitioners further show, that we apprehend ourselves to be aggrieved, in that, while we are not allowed the privilege of freemen of the State, having no vote or influence in the election of those that tax us, yet many of our colour (as is well known) have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defence of the common cause, and that (as we conceive) against a similar exertion of power (in regard to taxation), too well known to need a recital in this place.\"\n\u2014Paul Cuffe's Petition, Massachusetts, 1780\nThe petition by Paul Cuffe, above, best illustrates which of the following developments?\n\nA. The rhetoric of the American Revolution raised awareness of social inequalities and inspired groups and individuals to call for greater political democracy.\nB. Slave rebellions, such as the Stono Rebellion, inspired enslaved Americans throughout North America to engage in similar behavior.\nC. African Americans who had fought alongside the British during the American Revolution felt doubly vulnerable\u2014as African Americans and as traitors to the patriot cause\u2014after the British defeat.\nD. African Americans received worse treatment under the state government of Massachusetts than they had under British law during the colonial period.\n"

The rhetoric of the American Revolution raised awareness of social inequalities and inspired groups and individuals to call for greater political democracy.\n\nThe petition by Paul Cuffe reflects the broader impact of the American Revolution on African Americans. The rhetoric of liberty and equality that emerged during the Revolution inspired many African Americans to demand their rights and freedoms. Cuffe's petition highlights the contradictions between the ideals of the Revolution and the reality of racial inequality and discrimination faced by African Americans. It calls for an end to discriminatory taxation practices and the extension of political rights to African Americans, reflecting the growing awareness of social inequalities and the desire for greater political democracy."
