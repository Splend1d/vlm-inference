Marquis believes that the moral status of a fetus should be considered in terms of its potential future as a person with interests and desires. He contends that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a person who has the potential for a future life, which makes it seriously presumptively wrong. However, Marquis acknowledges that there may be exceptional circumstances where abortion could be justified, such as when the mother's life is at risk or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities."
