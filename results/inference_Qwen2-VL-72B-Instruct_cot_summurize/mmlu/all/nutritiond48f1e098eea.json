All of the above.\n\nThe relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including the mechanisms regulating cholesterol absorption, the export of cholesterol in lipoproteins, the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver, and the various intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol. These complexities contribute to the inconclusive evidence regarding this relationship."
