In this case, since the exam only covers three specific units (motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior), it does not cover other important areas of AP Psychology such as cognitive processes, developmental psychology, personality, and others. Therefore, it lacks content validity because it does not represent the full range of topics that should be covered in an AP Psychology course."
