The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n"

Expert testimony must be relevant, reliable, and based on sufficient facts or data. It should also assist the trier of fact (the jury or judge) in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\n- This statement involves a reconstruction of the accident using a computer-animated film. While it may be helpful, the admissibility would depend on whether the expert can establish the reliability of the methods used to create the animation and its relevance to the case. If the expert can demonstrate that the animation is scientifically valid and accurately represents the circumstances of the accident, it might be admitted.\n\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\n- This statement addresses the feasibility and cost of marking the submerged island. It directly relates to the issue of negligence by providing information about the practicality and expense of implementing safety measures. As long as the expert has the necessary qualifications and expertise to make such an assessment, this opinion is likely to be admitted because it is relevant and assists in understanding the company's duty of care.\n\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\n- This statement involves legal interpretation, which typically falls outside the scope of expert testimony. Legal conclusions are generally reserved for the judge, who interprets the law. Therefore, this opinion is less likely to be admitted as expert testimony.\n\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n- This statement involves an opinion on the plaintiff's behavior and potential fault, which is a legal determination rather than a technical or scientific analysis. Determining contributory negligence is a matter for the trier of fact, not an expert witness. Thus, this opinion is unlikely to be admitted.\n\nGiven these considerations, the court is most likely to admit:\n\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\n\nThis opinion is relevant to the issue of negligence, provides useful information about the company's ability to prevent the accident, and is within the realm of the expert's qualifications."
