As the Earth rotates, different parts of it face the Moon at different times, causing the tides to rise and fall.\n   \n2. **Lunar Day**: A lunar day is slightly longer than a solar day (24 hours) because the Earth has to rotate a bit more than 360 degrees for the Moon to return to the same position in the sky due to its own orbit around the Earth. This additional rotation takes about 50 minutes.\n\n3. **High Tides**: High tides occur approximately every 12 hours and 25 minutes because of this extended lunar day.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 12 hours 25 minutes"
