The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nThis is because net primary productivity (NPP) is largely driven by the rate at which plants convert sunlight into biomass through photosynthesis. In tropical regions, the consistent warmth and abundant rainfall provide ideal conditions for photosynthesis year-round, leading to higher rates of plant growth and productivity compared to other regions with more extreme seasonal variations or limited water availability."
