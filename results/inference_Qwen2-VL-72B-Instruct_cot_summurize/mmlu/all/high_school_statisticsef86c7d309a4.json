Similarly, a fabric factory periodically checks the sizes of towels coming off an assembly line and halts production if measurements are sufficiently off target. In both situations, we have the null hypothesis that the equipment is performing satisfactorily. For each situation, which is the more serious concern, a Type I or Type II error?\n\nA. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type I error\nB. Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type II error\nC.

                    "text": "In the context of the dialysis center, a Type I error would occur if the center incorrectly concludes that the equipment needs recalibration when it is actually functioning correctly. This could lead to unnecessary downtime and costs associated with recalibration. A Type II error would occur if the center fails to detect that the equipment needs recalibration when it is indeed malfunctioning, potentially compromising patient safety.\n\nFor the fabric factory, a Type I error would occur if the factory incorrectly halts production due to a false alarm about the towel sizes being off target. This could lead to unnecessary production delays and costs. A Type II error would occur if the factory fails to halt production when the towel sizes are indeed off target, leading to defective products reaching the market.\n\nGiven these scenarios:\n\n- At the dialysis center, a Type II error (failing to detect a malfunction) is more serious because it could directly impact patient health.\n- At the fabric factory, a Type I error (incorrectly halting production) is less serious compared to a Type II error (letting defective products through), as the latter could damage the company's reputation and result in financial losses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Dialysis center: Type II error, towel manufacturer: Type I error"
