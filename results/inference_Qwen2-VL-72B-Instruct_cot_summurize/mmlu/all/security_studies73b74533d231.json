HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach.\nB. HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.\nC. HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\nD. HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.\n"

HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\n\nThe Historical Materialism (HM) approach to security analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding security issues within the context of broader historical and material conditions, rather than through a sectoral or compartmentalized lens. This perspective highlights the interconnectedness of various aspects of security and the role of class relations and economic structures in shaping security dynamics. Therefore, option C accurately reflects the HM approach's rejection of distinct and separate sectors of security in favor of a more comprehensive and integrated analysis."
