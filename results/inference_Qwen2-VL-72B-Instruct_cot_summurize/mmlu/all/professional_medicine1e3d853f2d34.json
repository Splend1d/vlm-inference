He denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose. Past medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has a blood pressure of 180/90\u00a0mmHg. Examination of the nasal passages reveals that the site of the bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. The most appropriate next step in management includes\n\nA. anterior packing\nB. placing an ice compress over the nose\nC. catheter balloon tamponade\nD. pinching the nares together for 5 minutes\n"

This involves inserting a pack into the nose to apply pressure to the bleeding site and stop the bleeding. If this does not work, then B. placing an ice compress over the nose may also be considered as it can help constrict blood vessels and reduce bleeding. C. Catheter balloon tamponade and D. Pinching the nares together for 5 minutes are not typically used as first-line treatments for epistaxis (nosebleeds). It's important to note that if the patient's blood pressure is elevated, it should be addressed as well."
