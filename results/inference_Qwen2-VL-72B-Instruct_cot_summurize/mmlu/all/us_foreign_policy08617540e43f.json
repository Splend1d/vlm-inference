Benevolent hegemony: The idea that the United States, as a global superpower, has a responsibility to lead and promote international stability and order, often through unilateral actions.\n\nB. Ineffectiveness of multilateralism: The belief that international organizations and agreements are too slow or ineffective in addressing global challenges, thus justifying unilateral action by the United States.\n\nC. American power: The notion that the United States possesses unparalleled military, economic, and cultural power, which allows it to act independently and achieve its objectives without relying on other nations or international institutions."
