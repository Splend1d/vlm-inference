Both a and b.\n\nNeandertals had several physical differences compared to modern Homo sapiens:\n\n1. **Wide, Squat Torsos and Short Extremities**: Neandertals had a stockier build with broader chests and shorter limbs relative to their body size. This is thought to be an adaptation to cold climates, helping them retain heat more effectively.\n\n2. **Smaller Brains and Larger Noses**: While Neandertals had large brains overall, they were proportionally smaller compared to the brain size of modern humans when adjusted for body size. Additionally, Neandertals had larger nasal cavities, which may have helped warm and humidify cold air before it reached their lungs.\n\nThese characteristics reflect some of the key physical distinctions between Neandertals and modern Homo sapiens."
