The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:\"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. \"The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n"

                    "text": "To determine the proper recovery for the dealership if they bring a suit against the youth for breach of contract, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Contract Validity**: Since the youth was 16 at the time of entering into the contract, and the age of majority in this jurisdiction is 18, the contract may be considered voidable by the youth until he reaches the age of majority. However, once the youth turns 18, the contract becomes valid and enforceable.\n\n2. **Partial Performance**: The youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000 during the first year of the contract. This indicates partial performance, which can sometimes make the contract binding even if it was initially voidable.\n\n3. **Letter and Offer**: The youth's letter offering to pay $10,000 if he finds a job within the next month can be seen as an attempt to renegotiate the terms of the contract. However, since no formal agreement was reached, the original contract terms remain in effect.\n\n4. **Total Demolition of Car**: The sports car was totally demolished in an accident, and its value at the time of the accident was $18,000. This means the dealership cannot recover more than the car's value at the time of the accident.\n\n5. **Remaining Balance**: The total amount due under the contract was $36,000, and the youth paid $12,000. Therefore, the remaining balance is $24,000. However, because the car was destroyed, the dealership can only recover the car's value at the time of the accident, which is $18,000.\n\nGiven these considerations, the proper recovery for the dealership is:\n\n**C. $18,000.00**\n\nThis amount represents the value of the car at the time of the accident, which is the maximum the dealership can recover given the circumstances."
