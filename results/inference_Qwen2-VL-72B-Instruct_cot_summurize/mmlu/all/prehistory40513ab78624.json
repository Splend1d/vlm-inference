However, it does not explain the initial discovery of the tombs.\n\nB. **A forest fire burned away the dense vegetation that concealed the cemetery.**\n   - This option implies that the tombs were hidden under vegetation and became visible after a forest fire. This is a plausible explanation for the discovery of previously unknown tombs.\n\nC. **Archaeologists discovered an exact replica of the city in the map room.**\n   - While this sounds intriguing, it is highly unlikely that an exact replica of a city would be found in a map room, especially one that leads directly to the discovery of tombs.\n\nD. **A flock of sheep that had been living there fell into a tomb.**\n   - This scenario suggests that the tombs were not immediately visible and were only discovered when animals accidentally fell into them. This could be a plausible way for the tombs to be discovered if they were covered or obscured.\n\nGiven these options, the most plausible explanation for the discovery of the royal cemeteries of the Moche is:\n\n**B. A forest fire burned away the dense vegetation that concealed the cemetery.**\n\nThis option provides a logical and realistic scenario where the tombs, previously hidden, became visible due to natural events."
