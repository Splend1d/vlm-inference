The defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense after he was attacked by the victim, who was drunk and belligerent. At trial, the defendant called a witness who testified that the victim was the aggressor in the altercation. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness the following question:\"Isn't it true that when you filed your federal income tax return last year, you failed to report the interest income from your savings accounts?\" The prosecuting attorney was informed of this fact by the witness's accountant. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the prosecutor's question is\n\nA. improper, because it is not relevant to the issues in the case.\nB. improper, because the defendant has not been convicted of any crime in connection with the tax return.\nC. within the court's discretion to allow, because filing a false income tax return is an act that bears on the witness's truthfulness.\nD. within the court's discretion to allow, because federal income tax evasion is a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\n"

The prosecutor's question about the witness failing to report interest income on their federal income tax return is aimed at impeaching the witness's credibility. This type of questioning is generally permissible if it relates to acts or omissions that reflect on the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the tax issue may not directly relate to the facts of the assault and battery case, it can still be relevant to assessing the witness's overall credibility.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the relevance of the question does not depend on whether the defendant has been convicted of a crime related to the tax return; the focus is on the witness's credibility.\n\nOption D is partially correct but less precise than option C. While it is true that tax evasion is a serious crime, the primary reason for allowing such a question is to assess the witness's truthfulness, not just because it is a felony.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C, as it correctly identifies the primary rationale behind the court's discretion to allow such a question."
