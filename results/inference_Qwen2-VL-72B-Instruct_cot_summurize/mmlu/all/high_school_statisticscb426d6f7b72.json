She obtains a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. All but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey. Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"
