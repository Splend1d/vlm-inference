However, it might still lack objectivity if the peers have similar biases or if there is a lack of structured feedback mechanisms.\n\nC. **Engage the services of a consultant who reviews tape recordings of typical sessions conducted by the therapists**: This method provides an external, objective evaluation based on recorded sessions. It allows for detailed analysis and feedback that is not influenced by personal biases or relationships.\n\nD. **Check in an objective manner their clients' ability to cope with their problems**: While client feedback is crucial, it may not always be objective or comprehensive enough to fully assess the quality of therapeutic services. Clients might not always provide accurate or complete information about their progress.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most valid way for psychotherapists to monitor the quality of their own services would be:\n\n**C.
