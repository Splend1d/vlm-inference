The number of chromosomes is reduced.\n\nMeiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating haploid cells from diploid cells. This reduction is crucial for sexual reproduction, ensuring that when two gametes (sperm and egg) fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct number of chromosomes."
