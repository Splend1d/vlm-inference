The exact fixation of the line will be established by a Russo-German commission.\"\n\nFrom this article, we can infer the following:\n- The territories mentioned were previously under Russian control.\n- These territories are located to the west of a certain line agreed upon by both parties.\n- These territories will no longer be under Russian sovereignty.\n\nGiven these points, the territories in question are being transferred from Russian control to another entity. Since the treaty was signed between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey (the Central Powers) on one side and Russia on the other, it implies that the territories are being surrendered to the Central Powers, specifically Germany in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is:\n\nC. the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire"
