Add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.\n- This option correctly specifies adding 167 mL of the stock solution and filling the rest of the flask with water.\n\nB. Add 600 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.\n- This option incorrectly specifies adding 600 mL of the stock solution, which is much more than needed.\n\nC. Fill the flask partway with water, then add 167 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n- This option also correctly specifies adding 167 mL of the stock solution but suggests an unnecessary step of partially filling the flask with water first.\n\nD. Fill the flask partway with water, then add 600 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n- This option incorrectly specifies adding 600 mL of the stock solution and also includes an unnecessary step of partially filling the flask with water first.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure is:\n\n**A. Add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution.**"
