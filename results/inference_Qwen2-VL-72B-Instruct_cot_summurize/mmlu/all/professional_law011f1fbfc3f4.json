The Supreme Court has held that if material is obscene it does not mandate First Amendment protection. Which of the following most accurately represents one of the prongs of the three-pronged test enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court's for determining whether a film, book, video or pictorial is obscene and therefore not subject to protection?\n\nA. Whether the work, taken as a whole and judged by contemporary community standards, would be seen by a sensitive or vulnerable person to appeal to the prurient interest.\nB. Whether the work depicts, in a direct or indirect way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state obscenity law.\nC. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\nD. Whether the work has been properly judged from a national standard to offend sensitive standards of community morals.\n"

Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nThis prong is part of the Miller test, which was established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Miller v. California (1973). According to this test, material is considered obscene and thus not protected by the First Amendment if it meets all three of the following criteria:\n1. The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\n2. The work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\n3. The work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies one of the prongs of the Miller test."
