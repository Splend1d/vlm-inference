Since Mr is proportional to the molecular volume, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_{r1}}{V_1} = \\frac{M_{r2}}{V_2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M_{r1} = 100 \\)\n- \\( M_{r2} = 8400 \\)\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the volumes \\( V_2 / V_1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{8400}{V_2} = \\frac{100}{V_1} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{8400}{100} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{V_2}{V_1} = 84 \\]\n\nNext, we consider the rotational correlation time formula:\n\n\\[ \\tau_c = \\frac{4\\pi \\eta r^3}{3 k_B T} \\]\n\nSince the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is proportional to \\( r^3 \\), we can express the volume ratio in terms of the radius ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\left( \\frac{r_2}{r_1} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nFrom our previous calculation:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{r_2}{r_1} \\right)^3 = 84 \\]\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\sqrt[3]{84} \\approx 4.38 \\]\n\nNow, we know that the rotational correlation time is proportional to \\( r^3 \\). Therefore, the ratio of the rotational correlation times will be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c2}}{\\tau_{c1}} = \\left( \\frac{r_2}{r_1} \\right)^3 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c2}}{\\tau_{c1}} = (\\sqrt[3]{84})^3 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c2}}{\\tau_{c1}} = 84 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\tau_{c1} = 50 \\) ps, we can calculate \\( \\tau_{c2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\tau_{c2} = 84 \\times 50 \\text{ ps} \\]\n\\[ \\tau_{c2} = 4200 \\text{ ps} \\]\n\\[ \\tau_{c2} = 4.2 \\text{ ns} \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated rotational correlation time for the small protein with Mr = 8400 is:\n\nC. 4.2 ns"
