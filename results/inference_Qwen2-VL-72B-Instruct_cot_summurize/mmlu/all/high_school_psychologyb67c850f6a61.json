Difference threshold\n\nThe ability to detect the difference between Coke and Pepsi most of the time is best explained by the concept of the difference threshold, also known as the just noticeable difference (JND). This refers to the smallest change in stimulus intensity that a person can reliably perceive. In this context, it means that most people can reliably detect the difference in taste between Coke and Pepsi because the difference exceeds their taste difference threshold."
