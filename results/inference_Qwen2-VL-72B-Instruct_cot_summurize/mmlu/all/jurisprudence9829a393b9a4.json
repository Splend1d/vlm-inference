The obligation arises independently of the precise legal provisions involved - unless there are grounds to justify a specific exception.\n\nA prima facie duty refers to an initial or apparent duty that holds unless there are stronger reasons to override it. In the context of obeying the law, this means that one generally has a duty to obey the law, but this duty can be overridden if there are justifiable exceptions or circumstances that make adherence to the law unjust or unreasonable."
