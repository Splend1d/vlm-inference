So, there are 3 ways to choose the male lead.\n\n3. **Selecting the Three Roles for the Remaining Members:**\n   After choosing the female and male leads, we have 6 members left (4 females + 3 males - 1 female lead - 1 male lead = 6).\n   \n   We need to select 3 members out of these 6 to fill the remaining roles. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n   \n   Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 members out of 6 is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Arranging the Three Roles:**\n   Once we have chosen the 3 members, we need to arrange them in the 3 different roles. Since the roles are distinct, we use permutations. The number of ways to arrange 3 members in 3 roles is given by \\( 3! \\):\n   \\[\n   3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\nNow, we multiply the results from each step to get the total number of ways to assign all the roles:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (female lead)} \\times 3 \\text{ (male lead)} \\times 20 \\text{ (ways to choose 3 members)} \\times 6 \\text{ (ways to arrange 3 roles)} = 4 \\times 3 \\times 20 \\times 6 = 1440\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1920"
