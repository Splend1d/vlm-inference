One year later, the buyer sold the house to a woman for $50,000 more than the buyer had paid, conveying it to the woman by a quitclaim deed. Four months after moving in, the woman discovered a number of latent defects in the foundation that caused the house's basement to take on water during heavy rains. The woman contacted the builder about the problem. Toward the end of their heated conversation, the builder yelled at her, \"So get it fixed!\" After the woman had the foundation repaired by a cement contractor at a cost of $25,000, she successfully sued the builder to recover that amount from him. What is the most likely reason that the woman was successful?\n\nA. The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\nB. The court found that by paying the buyer $50,000 more for the house than the buyer had paid the builder, the woman did not get the benefit of her bargain.\nC. The court found that by yelling at the woman to \"get it fixed,\" the builder had committed himself to paying for the repair.\nD. The court found that the defects in the foundation were a breach of the covenant of further assurances in the warranty deed from the builder to the buyer.\n"

The court found an implied warranty of habitability from the builder to the buyer that was enforceable by a subsequent buyer.\n\nExplanation:\nAn implied warranty of habitability generally means that a home sold by a builder must be fit for human habitation and free from significant defects that would render it uninhabitable. This warranty typically runs with the property and can be enforced by subsequent buyers if they discover latent defects that were present when the builder sold the property. In this case, since the defects in the foundation were latent and existed when the builder originally sold the house, the implied warranty of habitability would likely apply, allowing the woman to sue the builder for the cost of repairs."
