Construct validity refers to the extent to which a test measures the theoretical construct or trait it is intended to measure. In this case, the test should accurately measure learning disabilities in young children. Ensuring that the test has adequate construct validity is crucial for correctly identifying children who may need additional support or interventions due to a learning disability."
