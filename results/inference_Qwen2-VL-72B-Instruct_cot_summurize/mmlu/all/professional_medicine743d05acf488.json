Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes).

Filgrastim\n\nFilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell. It is commonly used to treat neutropenia, a condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils in the blood, which can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy. In this case, the patient has a very low neutrophil count (5% segmented neutrophils), making her susceptible to infections. Filgrastim would help to increase her neutrophil count and reduce her risk of infection."
