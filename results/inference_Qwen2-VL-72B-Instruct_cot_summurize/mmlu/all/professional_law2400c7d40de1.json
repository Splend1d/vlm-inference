A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\n\nThis rule is derived from the Speech and Debate Clause of the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 6, Clause 1), which provides immunity to members of Congress for any speech or debate in either House. This clause protects legislators from being held accountable outside of Congress for anything they say during their official duties, including legislative hearings. Therefore, the senator's derogatory statements made during the legislative hearing would be protected under this clause, and the president would not have a valid cause of action for defamation based on those statements."
