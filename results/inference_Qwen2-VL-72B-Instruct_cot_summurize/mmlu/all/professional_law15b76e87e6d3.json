Liability is based on a statute making owners of automobiles liable for the negligent actions of those driving with the consent of the owner of the vehicle. The plaintiff offered into evidence the testimony of his doctor that the plaintiff had said to the doctor, when consulting the doctor for treatment, that he felt pain in his back immediately after the accident, and that pain persisted. The trial court should rule this testimony\n\nA. admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\nB. admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible as conclusions.\n"

This type of statement is generally admissible under the hearsay exception because it is deemed reliable due to its close temporal proximity to the event and the declarant's personal experience of the condition."
