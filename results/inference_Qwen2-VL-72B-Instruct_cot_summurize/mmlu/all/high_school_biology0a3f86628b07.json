They also differ in that they release the nitrogen waste urea instead of ammonia. Which of the following statements correctly explains how this is an advantage for lungfish?\n\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\nB. Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\nC. Other fish in the small pools can use urea as an energy source.\nD. The highly toxic urea makes the pool uninhabitable to competitors.\n"

Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\n\nThis is because ammonia is highly toxic and can be harmful to aquatic organisms at relatively low concentrations. By converting ammonia into urea, lungfish are able to excrete their nitrogenous waste in a less toxic form, which allows them to survive in the small, stagnant freshwater pools where ammonia levels could quickly become dangerously high."
