This typically leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which can stimulate economic activity and potentially increase real GDP.\n\n2. **Increase in Tax Collections:**\n   - When taxes are raised by $12 million, this reduces disposable income for households and businesses. As a result, there is less money available for private consumption and investment, which can reduce aggregate demand.\n\nThe net effect on real GDP depends on how these two changes balance out:\n\n- The $12 million increase in government spending tends to boost economic activity.\n- The $12 million increase in tax collections tends to reduce economic activity by the same amount.\n\nSince the increase in government spending and the increase in tax collections are equal, they effectively cancel each other out in terms of their direct impact on aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the overall impact on real GDP in country Z would be:\n\n**C. Real GDP will remain unchanged.**"
