Secondary refuse, on the other hand, typically refers to waste that has been processed or treated in some way, often after being collected and sorted.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Kitchen; Garden\n- A kitchen generates primary refuse (e.g., food scraps, packaging).\n- A garden does not typically generate secondary refuse but rather compostable materials.\n\nB. Activity Area; Burial\n- An activity area could generate primary refuse (e.g., waste from various activities).\n- A burial site would contain primary refuse (e.g., buried items).\n\nC. Picnic Site; Trash Dump\n- A picnic site generates primary refuse (e.g., food packaging, leftover food).\n- A trash dump contains secondary refuse (e.g., sorted and collected waste).\n\nD. Activity Area; Recycling Area\n- An activity area generates primary refuse.\n- A recycling area processes and sorts waste, making it secondary refuse.\n\nBased on the definitions of primary and secondary refuse, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Picnic Site; Trash Dump"
