On September 3, the landlord mailed the following letter to the tenant:\"September 2 In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option for 20 days from the above date to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided you pay two months' rent in advance. \"The tenant received the letter on September 4, but did not read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant telephoned the landlord and said, \"I want to give you the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. \" The landlord replied, \"I've change my mind. I do not want to sign a lease with you. Moreover, I want you to vacate the apartment immediately. \" At no time after receiving the landlord's letter on September 4 did the tenant pay him the one-dollar consideration. Did the landlord's letter constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease?\n\nA. Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.\nB. Yes, because consideration for the option can be infeffed from the previous month-to-month lease.\nC. No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.\nD. No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease, we need to analyze the elements of contract formation, specifically focusing on the offer, acceptance, and consideration.\n\n1. **Offer**: The landlord's letter clearly stated terms for a two-year lease at $225 per month, with the condition of paying two months' rent in advance. This constitutes an offer since it specifies the terms and conditions under which the landlord is willing to enter into a lease agreement.\n\n2. **Acceptance**: The tenant expressed their intention to accept the offer by calling the landlord on September 23, stating they wanted to give the $450 and sign the lease. However, this acceptance occurred after the 20-day period specified in the offer had expired (the offer was dated September 2 and gave 20 days, expiring on September 22).\n\n3. **Consideration**: The offer included a requirement for the tenant to pay one dollar as consideration for the option. The tenant never paid or tendered this one-dollar consideration.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The offer was clear and specific.\n- The acceptance came after the expiration of the offer period.\n- The tenant did not provide the required consideration.\n\nBased on these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.**\n\nThis is because the offer was conditional upon the tenant paying the one-dollar consideration, which they did not do. Therefore, the offer was not effectively accepted within the specified timeframe and without fulfilling the condition of providing the consideration."
