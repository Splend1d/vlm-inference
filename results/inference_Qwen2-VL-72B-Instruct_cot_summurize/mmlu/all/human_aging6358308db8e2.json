One can make funeral and estate plans with the loved one\n\nAn expected death allows for preparation, which can include making arrangements for funerals and managing estates together with the loved one. This can provide a sense of closure and reduce the burden on surviving family members.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Using up some grief before the actual loss is not typically considered an advantage. Grief is a complex emotional process that cannot be fully \"used up\" or completed before a loss occurs.\n\nC. Finding ways to avoid having the same death for oneself is not directly related to the advantage of an expected death for the person who is dying or their loved ones.\n\nD. Assisting someone in speeding their death is generally considered unethical and illegal in most jurisdictions and does not align with the concept of an expected death providing an advantage."
