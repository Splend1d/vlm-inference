If a purple ball is drawn, the player loses $2.\n\nThe expected value (\\(E\\)) of the game can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[E = (\\text{Probability of winning}) \\times (\\text{Amount won}) + (\\text{Probability of losing}) \\times (\\text{Amount lost})\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[E = \\left(\\frac{5}{5+k}\\right) \\times 2 + \\left(\\frac{k}{5+k}\\right) \\times (-2)\\]\n\nWe know that \\(E = 0.50\\), so:\n\n\\[0.50 = \\left(\\frac{5}{5+k}\\right) \\times 2 - \\left(\\frac{k}{5+k}\\right) \\times 2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[0.50 = \\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k}\\]\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n\\[0.50 = \\frac{10 - 2k}{5+k}\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(5+k\\) to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[0.50(5+k) = 10 - 2k\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k\\]\n\nBringing like terms to one side:\n\n\\[0.5k + 2k = 10 - 2.5\\]\n\n\\[2.5k = 7.5\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2.5:\n\n\\[k = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3."
