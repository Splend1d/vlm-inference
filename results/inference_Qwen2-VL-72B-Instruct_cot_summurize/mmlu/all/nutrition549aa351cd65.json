Prohibiting the introduction into commerce food containing contaminants at levels greater than a specified level (a risk-based MRL or tolerance)\n\nRisk management for chemical contaminants in food typically involves setting Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) or tolerances, which are scientifically derived levels that ensure the safety of food products. These limits are established based on risk assessments and take into account the potential health risks associated with the contaminants. Foods containing contaminants above these specified levels are not allowed to be sold or distributed, ensuring consumer protection."
