The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. A second gene consisting of two alleles, E and e, codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair. In this case, the alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. If the dominant allele (E) is not present, regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus, the animal's fur will be yellow.\n\nA. BBEe will be brown.\nB. BbEe will be brown.\nC.

Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Gene B:**\n   - Dominant allele B codes for black fur.\n   - Recessive allele b codes for brown fur.\n\n2. **Gene E:**\n   - Dominant allele E codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair.\n   - Recessive allele e does not allow the deposition of pigment, resulting in yellow fur regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: BBEe**\n- Genotype at B locus: BB (black)\n- Genotype at E locus: Ee (pigment deposition allowed)\n- Since E is present, the fur color will be determined by the B locus.\n- Therefore, BBEe will have black fur.\n\n**Option B: BbEe**\n- Genotype at B locus: Bb (heterozygous, black)\n- Genotype at E locus: Ee (pigment deposition allowed)\n- Since E is present, the fur color will be determined by the B locus.\n- Therefore, BbEe will have black fur.\n\n**Option C: Bbee**\n- Genotype at B locus: Bb (heterozygous, black)\n- Genotype at E locus: ee (no pigment deposition, yellow fur)\n- Since ee is present, the fur color will be yellow regardless of the B locus.\n- Therefore, Bbee will have yellow fur.\n\n**Option D: BBee**\n- Genotype at B locus: BB (black)\n- Genotype at E locus: ee (no pigment deposition, yellow fur)\n- Since ee is present, the fur color will be yellow regardless of the B locus.\n- Therefore, BBee will have yellow fur.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- Option A (BBEe) will be black, not brown.\n- Option B (BbEe) will be black, not brown.\n- Option C (Bbee) will be yellow, not brown.\n- Option D (BBee) will be yellow, as stated correctly.\n\nThus, the correct statement is:\n**D.
