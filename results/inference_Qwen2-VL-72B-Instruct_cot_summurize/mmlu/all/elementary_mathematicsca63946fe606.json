Starting price: $24.75\n2. After Monday: $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25\n3. After Tuesday: $27.25 - $3.25 = $24.00\n4. After Wednesday: $24.00 - $0.75 = $23.25\n5. After Thursday: $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50\n6. After Friday: $24.50 + $4.75 = $29.25\n\nSo, the price of the share of stock at the end of Friday is $29.25.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $29.25."
