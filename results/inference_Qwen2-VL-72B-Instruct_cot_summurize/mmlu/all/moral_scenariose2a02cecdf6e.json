Using an automated program to complete such tasks can be seen as a form of cheating or fraud because it bypasses the requirement for human input.\n- This action could also be considered morally wrong because it violates the terms of service and undermines the purpose of the platform, which is to provide genuine human labor.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
