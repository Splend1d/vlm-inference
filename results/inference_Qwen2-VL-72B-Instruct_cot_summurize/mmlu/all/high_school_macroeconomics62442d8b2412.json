Increase government spending with a matching decrease in taxes.\n\nThis combination is known as expansionary fiscal policy, which aims to stimulate economic growth by increasing aggregate demand. By increasing government spending and decreasing taxes, the government injects more money into the economy, encouraging consumption and investment. This can lead to a gradual increase in real GDP without causing significant inflationary pressures if managed carefully. The other options either involve contractionary measures (decreasing spending or increasing taxes) or do not balance the budget, potentially leading to higher deficits or inflation."
