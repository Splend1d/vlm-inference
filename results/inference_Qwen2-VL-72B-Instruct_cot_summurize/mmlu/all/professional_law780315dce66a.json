The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher \u0080\u0094farmer deed nor the farmer \u0080\u0094 investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should\n\nA. prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.\nB. prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.\nC. not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\nD. not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.\n"

However, this does not apply here since the easement was already created and recorded.\n  \n- **Recorded Easement:** Once an easement is properly recorded, it generally remains in effect unless expressly released or extinguished by law (e.g., through merger).\n\n- **Merger Doctrine:** When the dominant and servient tenements unite in one person, the easement is extinguished. However, this doctrine typically applies when the easement is not specifically reserved or excepted in the deed conveying the dominant estate.\n\n### Application:\n\n- The easement was properly recorded and thus should remain in effect unless expressly released or extinguished by merger.\n- Merger would have extinguished the easement if the farmer had retained both the orange grove and the vineyard without reserving the easement. However, the farmer subsequently conveyed the vineyard to the investor, thereby separating the dominant and servient tenements again.\n- Since the easement was not expressly released or otherwise extinguished, it should continue to exist.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe investor should prevail because the easement was properly recorded and remains in effect until expressly released. The fact that the easement was not mentioned in the deeds does not extinguish its existence.\n\n**Final Answer: B. prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.**"
