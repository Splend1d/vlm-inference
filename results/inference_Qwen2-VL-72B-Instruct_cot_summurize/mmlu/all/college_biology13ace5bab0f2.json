The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of osmosis and how it relates to the proposed theory about asthma attacks following a thunderstorm.\n\nOsmosis is the movement of solvent molecules (usually water) across a semipermeable membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This movement occurs until the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equalized.\n\nIn the context of the theory:\n- Pollen grains exposed to water experience osmotic shock.\n- This shock causes the release of starch granules from the pollen grains.\n- These starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\"\n   - Hypotonic means that the interior has a lower solute concentration than the surrounding environment. This would cause water to move into the pollen grains, not out of them. This does not align with the theory where water exposure causes the release of starch granules due to osmotic shock.\n\nB. \"The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\"\n   - Higher osmotic pressure inside the pollen grains compared to the outside would cause water to move into the pollen grains, leading to swelling and potentially causing the release of starch granules due to osmotic shock. This aligns well with the theory.\n\nC. \"The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\"\n   - Plasmolysis is the process where cells shrink due to loss of water when placed in a hypertonic solution. This does not fit the scenario described in the theory, where water exposure leads to the release of starch granules.\n\nD. \"The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\"\n   - Shrinking implies that the pollen grains lost water, which contradicts the theory where water exposure causes the release of starch granules.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.**"
