It was a significant victory for the Muslims against the Quraysh tribe from Mecca, which helped establish the credibility of Muhammad's leadership and the Islamic cause. This victory eventually led to the conversion of many people to Islam and set the stage for the eventual conquest of Mecca by Muslim forces in 630 CE."
