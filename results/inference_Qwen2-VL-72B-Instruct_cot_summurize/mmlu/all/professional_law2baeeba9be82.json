He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: \"Take one tablet twice a day. \"The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus.

To determine the best defense for the pharmacist, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.**\n   - This defense is irrelevant to the issue at hand. The fact that the cashier received the payment does not address the pharmacist's responsibility for filling the prescription correctly.\n\nB. **He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.**\n   - Strict liability typically applies to sellers or manufacturers of products. However, in this case, the pharmacist is responsible for dispensing the medication, which makes him akin to a seller. Therefore, this defense is unlikely to succeed.\n\nC. **He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.**\n   - This defense addresses the pharmacist's conduct. If the pharmacist can demonstrate that despite being rushed, he still took all reasonable precautions and measures to ensure the correct medication was dispensed, it could mitigate his liability. However, given the severity of the mistake and the harm caused, proving reasonable care might be challenging.\n\nD. **The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.**\n   - While it is true that the drug store is not the manufacturer of either Clinoril or Clinitest, this defense does not absolve the pharmacist of his duty to correctly fill the prescription. The pharmacist's role involves ensuring the correct medication is dispensed, regardless of who manufactured it.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best defense for the pharmacist would be:\n\n**C. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.**\n\nThis defense focuses on the pharmacist's actions and whether they were reasonable given the circumstances, which is more relevant to the situation than the other defenses provided."
