                    "text": "To determine how the buoyant force acting on the balloon changes as it sinks deeper into the lake, we need to consider the principles of buoyancy.\n\n1. **Buoyant Force**: The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by an object. This can be described by Archimedes' principle, which states that any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\n2. **Depth and Pressure**: As the balloon sinks deeper into the lake, the pressure increases due to the increased depth. However, this increase in pressure does not directly affect the volume of water displaced by the balloon unless the balloon itself compresses significantly under the increased pressure. \n\n3. **Volume of Displacement**: Assuming the balloon is rigid or does not compress significantly under the increased pressure, the volume of water it displaces will remain constant regardless of its depth. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced (and thus the buoyant force) will also remain constant.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A (increases)**: Incorrect because the volume of water displaced by the balloon does not change significantly with depth if the balloon is rigid.\n- **Option B (decreases)**: Incorrect for the same reason as above; the volume of water displaced remains constant.\n- **Option C (remains largely unchanged)**: Correct because the volume of water displaced by the balloon remains constant, leading to a constant buoyant force.\n- **Option D (Need more information)**: Incorrect because sufficient information is provided to conclude that the buoyant force remains largely unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. remains largely unchanged.**"
