Out of these, he baked 6 pies for his family. The remaining pies were divided equally among the 4 school fund-raisers. Let's denote the number of pies baked for each school fund-raiser as \\(p\\).\n\nThe total number of pies baked for the school fund-raisers would then be \\(4 \\times p\\), since there are 4 fund-raisers.\n\nSo, the equation representing the total number of pies baked is:\n\n\\[6 + 4p = 18\\]\n\nThis matches option D: \\(6 + 4 \\times p = 18\\)."
