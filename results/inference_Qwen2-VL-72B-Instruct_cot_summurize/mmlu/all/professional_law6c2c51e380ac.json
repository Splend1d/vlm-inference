Shortly thereafter, the woman's financial condition worsened significantly, but she failed to disclose this fact to the bank. Unaware of the woman's changed financial condition, the bank then agreed to lend money to the woman. The bank later learned of the woman's true financial condition. The bank refused to honor its promise to lend money to the woman, contending that the parties' contract was voidable at the bank's option because of the woman's misrepresentation. If the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, will the bank's misrepresentation defense likely succeed?\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition.\nB. No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\nC. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\nD. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between them.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the bank's misrepresentation defense is likely to succeed if the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Misrepresentation**: Misrepresentation occurs when one party makes a false statement of fact that induces another party to enter into a contract. For a misrepresentation to be actionable, it must be material (i.e., it must have influenced the other party's decision to enter into the contract).\n\n2. **Materiality**: The woman's initial representation was accurate at the time she submitted the loan application. However, her financial condition subsequently worsened significantly, and she did not inform the bank of this change.\n\n3. **Obligation to Correct Prior Representations**: Generally, there is no legal obligation to update or correct prior representations unless there is a specific duty to do so, such as in certain fiduciary relationships or where there is a continuing duty to disclose material changes.\n\n4. **Fiduciary Relationship**: A fiduciary relationship exists when one party places trust and confidence in another, who has a corresponding duty to act in good faith and with loyalty. While the woman had a long-standing relationship with the bank, this does not necessarily imply a fiduciary relationship unless there is evidence of a special trust and confidence beyond ordinary banking transactions.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations. However, the issue here is not about making new misrepresentations but failing to correct a prior accurate representation that became inaccurate due to changed circumstances.\n\n- **Option B**: This option correctly notes that the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application. However, the bank's argument hinges on the subsequent change in her financial condition and her failure to disclose this change.\n\n- **Option C**: This option implies that the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations to prevent them from becoming fraudulent. This is a strong point because the failure to update the bank about the significant change in her financial condition could be seen as a form of misrepresentation by omission.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence. While this might be persuasive in some contexts, it is less legally compelling than the duty to correct prior representations to avoid fraud.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most compelling argument is that the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition to prevent them from being fraudulent. Therefore, the bank's misrepresentation defense is more likely to succeed based on this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer: C. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.**"
