Hemopneumothorax, not under tension\n\nThe presence of an air-fluid level in the chest, partial collapse of the left lung, and elevation of the stomach bubble suggests that there is both air and blood in the pleural space (hemopneumothorax). The fact that the mediastinum is in the midline indicates that this is not a tension pneumothorax, which would typically cause deviation of the mediastinum due to increased pressure on one side of the chest. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Hemopneumothorax, not under tension."
