It would continue rotating on its axis, but it would stop revolving around the Earth.\n\nExplanation: If the gravitational force between the Moon and the Earth were to suddenly cease, the Moon would no longer be influenced by Earth's gravity. As a result, it would not continue to orbit the Earth. However, the Moon's rotation on its own axis (which is separate from its orbital motion) would likely continue due to the conservation of angular momentum unless acted upon by another external force."
