When two different temperatures of water are mixed, the final temperature will be somewhere between the two initial temperatures, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings.\n\nGiven:\n- One part of water at 20\u00b0C\n- Another part of water at 28\u00b0C\n\nThe final temperature (T) after mixing will be between 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C. Therefore, the correct answer must be within this range.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 19\u00b0C - This is below the initial temperature of 20\u00b0C, so it cannot be the final temperature.\nB. 22\u00b0C - This is within the range of 20\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C.\nC. 30\u00b0C - This is above the initial temperature of 28\u00b0C, so it cannot be the final temperature.\nD. Higher than 30\u00b0C - This is also above the initial temperature of 28\u00b0C, so it cannot be the final temperature.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is:\n\nB. 22\u00b0C"
