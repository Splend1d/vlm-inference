Larger pages do indeed result in smaller page tables because there are fewer pages to track when the total memory is divided into larger segments.\nII. Smaller pages reduce internal fragmentation, which occurs when a process requires less space than an entire page, leaving unused space within that page.\nIII. The dominant factor in disk access time is typically the seek time and rotational latency, both of which are independent of page length. Therefore, using longer pages can be advantageous as it reduces the number of disk accesses required for a given amount of data."
