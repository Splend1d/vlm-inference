The rate law for the overall reaction will be determined by this slow step.\n\nThe given reaction mechanism consists of two steps:\n\n1. \\( \\text{NO}_2 + \\text{F}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2\\text{F} + \\text{F} \\) (Slow step)\n2. \\( \\text{F} + \\text{NO}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{NO}_2\\text{F} \\) (Fast step)\n\nSince the first step is the slow step, it will dictate the rate law for the overall reaction. The molecularity of the slow step is bimolecular because it involves two reactant molecules (\\( \\text{NO}_2 \\) and \\( \\text{F}_2 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the rate law for the slow step would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = k[\\text{NO}_2][\\text{F}_2] \\]\n\nThis indicates that the reaction is second order overall: first order with respect to \\( \\text{NO}_2 \\) and first order with respect to \\( \\text{F}_2 \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
