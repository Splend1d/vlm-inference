In fact, individuals are often more motivated to vote in closely contested races because their vote could have a greater impact on the outcome.\n\nB. Voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than they are at age 65.\n- This statement is false. Older individuals (such as those aged 65 and above) typically have higher voter turnout rates compared to younger individuals (such as those aged 18).\n\nC. An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\n- This statement is true. Higher levels of education are generally associated with higher voter turnout rates.\n\nD. Affluent individuals are less likely to vote than impoverished individuals.\n- This statement is false. Affluent individuals tend to have higher voter turnout rates compared to impoverished individuals.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is:\n\nC. An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma."
