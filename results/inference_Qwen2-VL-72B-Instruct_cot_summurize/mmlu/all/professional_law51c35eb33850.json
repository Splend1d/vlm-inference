At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

The ex post facto clause.\n\nThe ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution prohibits the application of laws retroactively, particularly in criminal cases. This means that a person cannot be prosecuted under a law that was not in effect at the time the alleged crime was committed. In this case, the defendant was charged with murder before the new law reducing the required jury consensus for conviction was enacted. Applying the new law to the defendant's case would violate the ex post facto clause because it changes the legal consequences of actions committed before the enactment of the law."
