X-bar chart\n\nAn X-bar chart, also known as an average chart, is commonly used in advanced manufacturing to monitor and control the central tendency (average) of a process over time. It is particularly useful for recording results data for a preproduction process because it helps in identifying shifts or trends in the process mean, which can be crucial for quality control and process improvement."
