The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: \"This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract.\" After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?\n\nA. No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\nB. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\nC. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.\nD. Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n"

No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\n\nExplanation:\nThe key point here is the interpretation of the non-assignment clause in the contract. The clause states that the contract may not be assigned, which typically means that neither party can transfer their rights or obligations under the contract to another party without permission. In this case, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor, effectively delegating the duty to manufacture the toasters to another entity.\n\nDelegation involves transferring the performance of a duty from one party to another, while assignment involves transferring the rights to receive benefits under the contract. Since the seller delegated the duty to manufacture the toasters to a competitor, this action violates the non-assignment clause, which also prohibits delegation of duties.\n\nTherefore, the buyer is correct in claiming that they are no longer bound by the contract due to the seller's breach of the non-assignment provision. The fact that the competitor's toasters are of equal quality does not negate the breach of contract."
