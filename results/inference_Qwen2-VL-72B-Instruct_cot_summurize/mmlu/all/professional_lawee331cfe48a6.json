The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the university is likely to prevail in this contract action, we need to analyze the nature of the booster's promise and the relationship between the parties involved.\n\nThe booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team under the coach's tutelage. This promise was made directly to the coach, not to the university. However, the university seeks to recover the funds based on the booster's promise.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.**\n   - For the university to be considered an intended third-party beneficiary, the contract between the coach and the booster must explicitly state that the university is intended to benefit from the agreement. Since the booster's promise was made to the coach and not directly to the university, it is unlikely that the university can claim to be an intended third-party beneficiary.\n\nB. **Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.**\n   - Detrimental reliance (promissory estoppel) requires that the university relied on the booster's promise to their detriment. While the university did hire the coach, the booster's promise was made to the coach, not to the university. Therefore, the university cannot claim detrimental reliance on the booster's promise.\n\nC. **No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.**\n   - There is no indication in the scenario that the booster's promise violates any rules or laws. Assuming the agreement does not violate any university or intercollegiate athletic association rules, it is unlikely that the promise is illegal or void as against public policy.\n\nD. **No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.**\n   - This option correctly identifies that the booster's promise was made to the coach, not to the university. A charitable subscription typically involves a direct promise to donate money to a charity or organization. Since the booster's promise was made to the coach, it does not qualify as a charitable subscription to the university.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.**\n\nTherefore, the university is unlikely to prevail in this contract action."
