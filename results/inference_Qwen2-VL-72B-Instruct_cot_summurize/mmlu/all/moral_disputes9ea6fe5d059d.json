Expressive harm as a causal consequence of hate speech suggests that the harm results directly from the act of hate speech itself.\n\nB. Expressive harm as a harm that derives from the kind of attitude expressed in the act of hate speech implies that the harm comes from the underlying attitudes conveyed through the speech.\n\nAltman's concept of expressive harm typically refers to the harm caused by the expression of certain attitudes or beliefs, rather than just the direct consequences of the speech. Therefore, it aligns more closely with option B.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\nB. a harm that derives from the kind of attitude expressed in the act of hate speech."
