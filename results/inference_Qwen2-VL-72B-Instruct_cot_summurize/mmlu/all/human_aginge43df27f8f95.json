Semantic memory refers to memory for facts and general knowledge about the world, such as names of cities, the capital of France, or the meaning of words. This type of memory tends to be less affected by aging compared to other types of memory like episodic memory (memory for personal experiences and specific events) or working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information over short periods)."
