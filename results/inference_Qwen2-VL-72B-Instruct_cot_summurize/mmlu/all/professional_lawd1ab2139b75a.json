Which of the following statements about this law is most accurate as a matter of constitutional law?\n\nA. The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class.\nB. State durational residence requirements that are estab-lished for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state.\nD. State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis is because the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. A durational residence requirement that denies access to public schools based on how long someone has lived in the state could be seen as discriminatory and potentially unconstitutional if it is not justified by a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In this case, the sole purpose of reducing state expenditures would likely not meet the standard required to justify such a restriction."
