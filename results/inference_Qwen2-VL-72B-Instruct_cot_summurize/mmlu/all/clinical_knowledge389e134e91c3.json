Phosphocreatine stores.\n\nDuring very high force contractions that last for 1-2 seconds, the primary energy source is the immediate breakdown of phosphocreatine (PCr) to regenerate ATP. This process is rapid and does not require oxygen, making it ideal for short bursts of intense activity where ATP needs to be replenished quickly. The other options listed involve processes that take longer or are less efficient for such brief, high-intensity efforts."
