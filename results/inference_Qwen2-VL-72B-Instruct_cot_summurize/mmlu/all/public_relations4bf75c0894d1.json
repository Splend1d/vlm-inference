A government institution\n\nGovernment institutions typically cannot sue for libel because they are not considered legal persons with the capacity to sue or be sued in the same way that individuals, corporations, and other private entities can. This is due to the principle of sovereign immunity, which generally protects governments from being sued without their consent. However, the specific rules can vary depending on jurisdiction and the nature of the case."
