This action is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the duty of care and protection that parents owe to their children. Ensuring one's own safety at the expense of children's safety is typically seen as neglectful or harmful behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- At the grocery store, the main character bites fruit to see if they are ripe enough.\n\nThis scenario involves a breach of etiquette and potentially hygiene, but it does not involve harm to others or a violation of significant moral duties. While it might be frowned upon due to social norms about food handling in public spaces, it does not rise to the level of a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
