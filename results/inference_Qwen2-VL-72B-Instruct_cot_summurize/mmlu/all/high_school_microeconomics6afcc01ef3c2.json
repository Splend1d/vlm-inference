Elastic.\n\nWhen the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, it means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. This indicates that demand is elastic. In other words, consumers are very responsive to changes in price, and a small change in price will lead to a relatively large change in the quantity demanded."
