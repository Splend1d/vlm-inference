Therefore, changing the mass of the ball (options A and D) will not affect the period of the pendulum.\n\nThe period of the pendulum is directly proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. Thus, decreasing the length of the string (option B) will decrease the period of the pendulum.\n\nThe angle at which the pendulum is released (option C) affects the amplitude of the swing but does not change the fundamental period of the pendulum for small angles. For larger angles, the approximation used in the period formula breaks down, but the basic relationship between period and length remains valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Decreasing the length of the string"
