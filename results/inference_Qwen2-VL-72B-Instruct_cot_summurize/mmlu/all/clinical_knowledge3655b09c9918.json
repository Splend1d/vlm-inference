It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\nUlnar nerve palsy, also known as ulnar neuropathy, is a condition that occurs when the ulnar nerve becomes compressed or damaged. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. In particular, ulnar nerve palsy can cause loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and the medial one and a half digits on both the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ulnar nerve does not run through the spiral groove of the humerus; it runs along the inner side of the forearm and wrist. Option B is incorrect because Phalen's sign is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, not ulnar nerve palsy. Option D is incorrect because the ulnar nerve does not supply the biceps muscle; it supplies the muscles in the forearm and hand."
