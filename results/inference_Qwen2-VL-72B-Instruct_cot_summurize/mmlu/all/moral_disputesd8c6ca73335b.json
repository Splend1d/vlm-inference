Nathanson is known for his work in legal philosophy and ethics, particularly in the area of punishment and retributive justice. His views often emphasize fairness and proportionality in punishment.\n\nConsidering this, the most fitting option would be:\n\nB. **Proportional retributivism**\n\nThis choice aligns with the principle that punishment should be commensurate with the severity of the crime, which is a central theme in Nathanson's work on retributive justice."
