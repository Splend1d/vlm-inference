                    "text": "A man borrowed $150,000 from a bank to remodel his home and executed a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan over a 10-year period. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification. The mother asserted that her mortgage had become a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage had become a second lien. Is the mother's assertion correct?\n\nA. No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.\nB. No, because the man was not in default in his payments to his mother at the time of the bank's loan modification.\nC. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.\nD. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the mother's assertion is correct, we need to analyze the legal principles related to liens, mortgages, and the impact of loan modifications.\n\n1. **Initial Lien Status**: Initially, the bank's mortgage was recorded first and thus held the first lien position on the property. The mother's mortgage was recorded later and therefore held the second lien position.\n\n2. **Loan Modification Impact**: The bank modified the loan terms by extending the amortization period, reducing the monthly payments. This modification did not change the principal amount or the interest rate.\n\n3. **Default Status**: At the time of the modification, the man was not in default on his payments to his mother.\n\n4. **Notice and Consent**: Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother about the modification.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Materiality of the Modification**: A modification that does not increase the principal amount or the interest rate but merely extends the amortization period to reduce monthly payments is generally considered non-material. It does not fundamentally alter the nature or priority of the lien.\n\n- **Effect on Priority**: The priority of liens is typically determined by the date of recording. Since the bank's mortgage was recorded first, it retains its priority unless there is a specific legal basis for changing this priority.\n\n- **Consent Requirement**: While it might be prudent to inform all lienholders of such modifications, the lack of notice alone does not necessarily change the lien priority. The key consideration is whether the modification materially affects the rights of the junior lienholder (the mother).\n\nGiven these points, the mother's assertion that her mortgage has become a first lien due to the bank's modification is incorrect. The modification did not materially affect the rights of the mother, as it did not increase the principal or interest rate, nor did it put her in a worse position relative to the bank's lien.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.**"
