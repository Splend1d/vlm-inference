A young associate was leaving his office for the day when he was stopped by the defendant, who asked him to open his briefcase. The senior associate explained that some files from the law office had been stolen. Startled, the young associate refused to permit the senior associate to look in his briefcase. The young associate said that he had personal papers in his briefcase and he didn't want the senior associate to see them. Having his suspicions aroused, the senior associate raised his clenched fist and exclaimed, \"If you don't hand over that briefcase, I'm going to punch you in the mouth. \" The young associate, who, unknown to the senior associate, suffered from a serious heart condition, had a seizure and died as a result of fright produced by the threatened attack. Which of the following is the most serious crime for which the senior associate should be found guilty?\n\nA. Assault.\nB. Voluntary manslaught\u00c3\u00a7r.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD.

To determine the most serious crime for which the senior associate should be found guilty, we need to analyze the elements of each potential charge:\n\n1. **Assault**: This typically involves an attempt or threat to inflict harm on another person. The senior associate did threaten the young associate with physical harm, so assault could be applicable.\n\n2. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This involves the intentional killing of someone in the heat of passion or during a sudden quarrel. There is no indication that the senior associate intended to kill the young associate; thus, voluntary manslaughter seems unlikely.\n\n3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This involves unintentional killing resulting from reckless behavior or negligence. The senior associate's actions (threatening violence) led to the young associate's death, even though it was not intentional. This fits the definition of involuntary manslaughter.\n\n4. **Murder**: This involves the intentional and unlawful killing of another human being. There is no evidence that the senior associate intended to cause the young associate's death, so murder does not seem appropriate.\n\nGiven these definitions, the most serious crime for which the senior associate should be found guilty is:\n\n**C. Involuntary manslaughter.**\n\nThis choice reflects the unintentional but reckless nature of the senior associate's actions, which resulted in the young associate's death."
