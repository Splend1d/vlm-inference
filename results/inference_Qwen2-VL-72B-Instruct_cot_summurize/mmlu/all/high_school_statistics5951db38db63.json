In surveying 50 basketball players, it is noted that the 25 who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 who study less. Based on this study, the coach begins requiring the players to spend more time studying. Which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. While this study may have its faults, it still does prove causation.\nB. There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.\nC. While this is a controlled experiment, the conclusion of the coach is not justified.\nD. To get the athletes to study more, it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages, as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.\n"

There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.\n\nExplanation:\nThe study observes a correlation between more hours of academic studying and higher point scoring among basketball players. However, correlation does not imply causation. There could be other factors (confounding variables) influencing both the amount of time spent studying and the point scoring. For example, players who are more disciplined or motivated might study more and also perform better on the court due to their overall attitude and work ethic, rather than the studying itself directly causing higher point scores.\n\nTherefore, while the study suggests a relationship, it does not prove causation, and there could be other underlying factors at play. The coach's decision to require more study time based solely on this correlation might not yield the desired results if these confounding variables are not accounted for."
