The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n"

The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nThis is the correct answer because the Internet relies on standardized protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which allow devices from different manufacturers to communicate effectively regardless of their specific hardware or software configurations. These protocols ensure interoperability across diverse systems."
