It still suggests that euthanasia could limit the choices available to patients.\n\nD. **by tempting a patient to undergo a painful procedure**\n   - This option suggests that the availability of euthanasia might lead patients to choose a painful process (euthanasia) over other options.\n\nGiven these options, the most significant way in which Velleman believes euthanasia might harm patients seems to be related to the emotional and psychological burden placed on them. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n**A. by burdening a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence**"
