In the long run, firms will not be able to sustain losses indefinitely, so they will exit the market. As firms exit, the supply in the market decreases, leading to an increase in the market price. This process continues until the price rises to the level where it equals the minimum ATC, which is the break-even point for the remaining firms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The price will rise to the breakeven point as firms exit the industry."
