When people face a common challenge or threat, they may set aside their previous conflicts and work together to achieve this higher goal. This concept was introduced by Muzafer Sherif in his Robbers Cave experiment, which demonstrated how conflict between groups could be reduced when they were faced with a shared problem that required cooperation to solve."
