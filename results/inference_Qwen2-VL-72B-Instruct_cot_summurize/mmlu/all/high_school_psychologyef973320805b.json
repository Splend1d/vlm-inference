The process starts with a stimulus being detected by a receptor, which then sends a signal via an afferent (sensory) neuron to the spinal cord or brain. In the central nervous system, the signal may be processed by interneurons before being sent out via an efferent (motor) neuron to an effector, such as a muscle or gland, to produce a response."
