Produce 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 step ahead conditional variance forecasts and add them up and take the square root**\n\nHere's why this method is most valid:\n\n1. **Conditional Variance Forecasting**: In a GARCH model, you can forecast the conditional variance \\( h_t \\) for future periods \\( t+1, t+2, \\ldots, t+n \\). Each step-ahead forecast will give you an estimate of the variance for that specific day.\n\n2. **Summing Variances**: To get the total variance over multiple days, you sum up these individual variances:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Variance} = h_{t+1} + h_{t+2} + \\cdots + h_{t+10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Therefore, to obtain the total standard deviation over the 10-day period, you take the square root of the summed variances:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{h_{t+1} + h_{t+2} + \\cdots + h_{t+10}}\n   \\]\n\nThis approach accounts for the dynamic nature of the GARCH model, where the variance changes with each new forecast period. It provides a more accurate representation of the cumulative volatility risk over the 10-day horizon compared to other methods which might oversimplify or incorrectly aggregate the volatility estimates.\n\nThe other options either incorrectly aggregate the variances or do not properly account for the time-varying nature of the GARCH model:\n\n- **Option A** sums up the variances but does not convert to standard deviation.\n- **Option C** takes the square root of each variance before summing, which is mathematically incorrect.\n- **Option D** assumes constant volatility over the 10-day period, which is not consistent with the dynamic nature of GARCH models.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most valid method for calculating the 10-day volatility forecast using a GARCH model."
