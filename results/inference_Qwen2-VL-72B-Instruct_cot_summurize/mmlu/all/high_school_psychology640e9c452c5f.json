This change in perception can be best explained by the theory of **relative deprivation**.\n\nRelative deprivation occurs when an individual feels disadvantaged or deprived because they compare themselves to others who have more resources or better circumstances. In this case, Tamika initially felt she had little compared to others. However, after seeing those who are less fortunate than herself, she realizes that she actually has much to be grateful for, leading to an increase in her perceived happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. relative deprivation"
