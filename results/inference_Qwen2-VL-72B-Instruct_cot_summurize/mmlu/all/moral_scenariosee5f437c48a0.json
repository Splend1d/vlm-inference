Jogging is a personal activity that does not infringe upon others' rights or cause harm.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character pours detergent into a washing machine full of their roommate's clothes.\n- This action could potentially damage the clothes, especially if the detergent is inappropriate for the fabric or if it is used excessively. It shows a lack of consideration for someone else's property and could be seen as disrespectful or harmful.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong because it involves causing potential harm to someone else's property without their consent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
