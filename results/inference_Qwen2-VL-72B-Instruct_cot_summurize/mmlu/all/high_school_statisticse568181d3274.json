This is equivalent to finding the z-score corresponding to the 25th percentile.\n\nThe z-score for the 25th percentile can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.674.\n\nWe can use the formula for converting between z-scores and raw scores in a normal distribution:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Z \\) is the z-score,\n- \\( X \\) is the raw score (the mass of the egg),\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ X = Z\\sigma + \\mu \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ X = (-0.674)(4) + 45 \\]\n\\[ X = -2.696 + 45 \\]\n\\[ X = 42.304 \\]\n\nSo, the mass of the egg at the 25th percentile is approximately 42.304 grams.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\n\nB. 42.3 g"
