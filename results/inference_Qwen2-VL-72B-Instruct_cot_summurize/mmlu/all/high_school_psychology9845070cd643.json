To determine which stage a child is in, Piaget would test their understanding of conservation. Conservation refers to the ability to understand that certain properties of objects remain constant despite changes in their form or appearance. For example, a child in the concrete operational stage would understand that the amount of liquid remains the same when it is poured from a tall, thin glass into a short, wide one, whereas a child in the pre-operational stage might believe the amount has changed because the shape of the container has changed.\n\nObject permanence (A) is typically tested in the sensorimotor stage, which precedes both the pre-operational and concrete operational stages. Attachment (B) is related to emotional and social development rather than cognitive development as described by Piaget. Hypothesis testing (D) is more relevant to the formal operational stage, which comes after the concrete operational stage."
