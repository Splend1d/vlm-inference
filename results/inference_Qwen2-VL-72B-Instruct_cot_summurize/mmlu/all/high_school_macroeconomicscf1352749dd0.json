An auto mechanic fixing his dentist\u2019s car for a filling\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. It includes transactions that involve payment for goods and services. In this case, the auto mechanic fixing the dentist's car for a filling involves an exchange of services for payment, which would be included in GDP calculations.\n\nThe other options do not involve market transactions or payments for goods and services:\n\nB. A stay-at-home dad providing childcare for his children is a non-market activity and does not involve a monetary transaction.\nC. A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross is a transfer payment and does not represent production of goods or services.\nD. High school students spending their Saturdays building homes for the homeless is volunteer work and typically not included in GDP as it does not involve a market transaction."
