When the pedestrian started to cross the street, she saw the traffic light was red. She momentarily stopped, thought about waiting until the light turned green, but then decided to cross anyway. As the pedestrian was halfway across the street, the motorist, who was driving 50 m. p. h. in a 25 m. p. h. zone, struck her with his vehicle. The pedestrian suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries in the accident. While in the hospital, the pedestrian's insurance company paid $10,000 of her medical expenses. Six months later, the pedestrian brought suit against the motorist to recover damages for all her medical expenses. This jurisdiction has a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute in effect. Suppose a jury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The motorist was 60 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The pedestrian was 40 percent at fault in crossing the street against the red light; and (3) The pedestrian suffered damages from the accident totaling $50,000. After the verdict, the court was advised that the pedestrian's insurance company had already paid the pedestrian $10,000. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of\n\nA. $50,000, because the motorist's negligence was greater than the pedestrian's.\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nC. $20,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule.\nD. $10,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by her own negligence, less the $10,000 in hospital expenses already paid by the insurance company.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct judgment amount for the pedestrian, we need to consider both the principles of modified comparative negligence and the collateral source rule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Modified Comparative Negligence Statute**:\n   - The motorist is found to be 60% negligent.\n   - The pedestrian is found to be 40% negligent.\n   - Under modified comparative negligence, the pedestrian can still recover damages as long as their negligence is not more than 50%. Since the pedestrian's negligence is 40%, they are eligible to recover damages.\n\n2. **Calculation of Recoverable Damages**:\n   - Total damages suffered by the pedestrian: $50,000.\n   - Percentage of fault attributed to the motorist: 60%.\n   - Therefore, the recoverable damages from the motorist = 60% of $50,000 = $30,000.\n\n3. **Collateral Source Rule**:\n   - The collateral source rule generally states that payments received from other sources (like insurance) do not reduce the amount the defendant owes to the plaintiff.\n   - In this case, the pedestrian's insurance company has already paid $10,000 of her medical expenses.\n   - Under the collateral source rule, this $10,000 payment does not reduce the amount the motorist owes to the pedestrian.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven these considerations, the court should enter a judgment for the pedestrian in the amount of $30,000, which represents the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, without reducing it by the $10,000 already paid by the insurance company.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $30,000, the proportion of the pedestrian's damages caused by the motorist's negligence, but the payment of $10,000 in hospital expenses will be disregarded under the collateral source rule."
