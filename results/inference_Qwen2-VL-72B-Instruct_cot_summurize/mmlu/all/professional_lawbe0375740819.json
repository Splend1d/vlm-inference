She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?\n\nA. No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.\nB. No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\nD. Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.\n"

No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\n\nIn cases involving personal injury, courts generally allow for some degree of speculation regarding future earning capacity, especially when the plaintiff has demonstrated a clear trajectory towards a career that requires significant training and dedication. The fact that the plaintiff was considered a bright and upcoming student in ballet suggests that she had a reasonable expectation of success in her chosen field. While the defendant's argument about the speculative nature of her potential success is valid, it does not necessarily warrant exclusion of the evidence or reversal of the verdict. The jury's decision to award compensation for lost earning capacity reflects their consideration of the plaintiff's potential future earnings, which is a common practice in such cases."
