Because boys and girls tend to play differently with toys, a randomly selected group of children was divided into two groups by sex.

Type of paint is a blocking factor.\nC. Sex is a blocking factor.\nD. This is a completely randomized design.\n"

Sex is a blocking factor.\n\nIn this experiment, the children were divided into two groups by sex, which suggests that sex is being used as a blocking factor to control for potential differences in how boys and girls play with the toys. Blocking factors are used to reduce variability within treatment groups by grouping similar experimental units together. In this case, the experimenters are likely trying to ensure that any observed differences in durability can be attributed to the type of paint rather than differences in how boys and girls play with the toys."
