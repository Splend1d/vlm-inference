An increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding.\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis is the process by which the body increases its energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate) in response to changes in energy intake or environmental conditions, such as chronic overfeeding or exposure to cold temperatures. This increase in energy expenditure helps to maintain energy balance and prevent excessive weight gain or loss. It is distinct from non-shivering thermogenesis, which is a specific type of adaptive thermogenesis that occurs in response to cold exposure and involves the activation of brown adipose tissue."
