One of these changes involves the vasodilation of blood vessels in active muscles, which decreases total peripheral resistance (TPR). This allows for an increased blood flow to the muscles that need it the most.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Pulse pressure: Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures. While exercise can increase both systolic and diastolic pressures, the increase in systolic pressure is typically greater, so pulse pressure usually increases during exercise.\n\nB. Stroke volume: Stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) generally increases during exercise as the heart works harder to meet the body's increased oxygen demands.\n\nC. Systolic blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure tends to increase during exercise due to the higher cardiac output and increased blood flow to the muscles.\n\nTherefore, the most likely measurement to be decreased compared with the measurement before the session is total peripheral resistance."
