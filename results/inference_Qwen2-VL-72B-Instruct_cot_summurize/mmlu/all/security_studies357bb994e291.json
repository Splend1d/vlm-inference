The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.\nB. The security paradigm of US led strategy has been the undertaking of short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community. They focus on peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural change for preventing further conflict.\nC. The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems.\nD. The dominant approach to security studies has been a US led initiative which recognizes the need to undertake responsibility for inter-governmental cooperation, particularly for the commitment towards ethical intervention and for securing peaceful transformations alongside demilitarization of the international community.\n"

                    "text": "The predominant paradigm in security and threat perception following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 can be characterized as a combination of elements from options B and C.\n\n**Option B:** This option highlights the US-led strategy focusing on short-term measures derived from peace studies research, emphasizing peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural changes to prevent further conflicts. This reflects the immediate responses post-9/11, such as military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, aimed at disrupting terrorist networks and stabilizing regions perceived as threats.\n\n**Option C:** This option describes a reversion to 'liddism,' where efforts are made to manage and contain potential disruptions within the international system without addressing the root causes of these issues. This is evident in the subsequent years where the focus shifted towards counter-terrorism strategies, surveillance, and intelligence operations to prevent future attacks rather than addressing broader socio-economic and political grievances that fuel terrorism.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Short-Term Measures and Military Interventions (Option B):**\n   - Post-9/11, there was a significant emphasis on military action to dismantle terrorist networks and stabilize volatile regions. This included the invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq, reflecting a proactive stance against perceived threats.\n   - These actions were informed by research and strategies from the peace studies community, aiming to bring about peace through direct intervention and structural reforms.\n\n2. **Liddism and Containment Strategies (Option C):**\n   - Over time, the approach evolved into more containment-oriented policies, focusing on managing threats rather than resolving them. This involved increased surveillance, intelligence gathering, and counter-terrorism measures to prevent attacks.\n   - This paradigm acknowledges the complexity of global security challenges and the difficulty in addressing underlying causes, leading to a more pragmatic approach of managing risks.\n\n**Adequacy of Response:**\n\n- **Effectiveness in Immediate Threat Mitigation:** The initial military interventions and subsequent counter-terrorism measures have been somewhat effective in disrupting terrorist networks and preventing large-scale attacks similar to 9/11.\n- **Long-Term Sustainability:** However, the failure to address underlying socio-economic and political issues has led to persistent instability and the emergence of new threats, such as the rise of ISIS and ongoing regional conflicts.\n- **Ethical and Humanitarian Considerations:** The reliance on military solutions and containment strategies has raised concerns about civilian casualties, human rights violations, and the long-term humanitarian impact of these approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, while the predominant paradigm post-9/11 has been effective in managing immediate threats, its adequacy as a long-term solution is questionable due to the neglect of underlying causes and the associated humanitarian and ethical implications. A more balanced approach that combines short-term measures with sustained efforts to address root causes would likely be more effective in achieving lasting security and stability."
