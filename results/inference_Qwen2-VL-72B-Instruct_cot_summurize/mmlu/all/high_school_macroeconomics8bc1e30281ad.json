Savers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate.\n\nUnexpectedly high rates of inflation can harm savers who have invested in long-term assets with fixed interest rates because the purchasing power of their returns diminishes over time as prices rise. This means that even though they receive the same amount of money, it buys fewer goods and services than before, effectively reducing their real income."
