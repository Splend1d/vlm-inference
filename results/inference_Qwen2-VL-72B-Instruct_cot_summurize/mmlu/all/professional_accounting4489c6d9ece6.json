Due care.\n\nIn a suit alleging negligence by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), the defense of \"due care\" is likely to be successful if the CPA can demonstrate that they acted with the level of skill, diligence, and prudence expected of a competent professional in their field. This means that the CPA followed generally accepted accounting principles and standards, performed thorough work, and took reasonable steps to avoid errors or omissions. The other defenses listed\u2014ignorance of the law, lack of intent, and lack of mental capacity\u2014are generally not effective in defending against allegations of professional negligence."
