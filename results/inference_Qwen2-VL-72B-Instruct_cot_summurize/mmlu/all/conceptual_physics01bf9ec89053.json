The airspeed is the speed of the airplane relative to the air around it, while the wind speed is the speed of the air relative to the ground.\n\nIn this case, the airplane's airspeed is 40 km/h, and the wind speed is 30 km/h at right angles to the direction of the airplane. This means that the wind is blowing perpendicular to the direction the airplane is heading.\n\nTo find the groundspeed, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( v_{\\text{airspeed}} \\) as the airspeed of the airplane,\n- \\( v_{\\text{wind}} \\) as the wind speed,\n- \\( v_{\\text{groundspeed}} \\) as the groundspeed of the airplane.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( v_{\\text{airspeed}} = 40 \\, \\text{km/h} \\)\n- \\( v_{\\text{wind}} = 30 \\, \\text{km/h} \\)\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}}^2 = v_{\\text{airspeed}}^2 + v_{\\text{wind}}^2 \\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}}^2 = 40^2 + 30^2 \\]\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}}^2 = 1600 + 900 \\]\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}}^2 = 2500 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}} = \\sqrt{2500} \\]\n\\[ v_{\\text{groundspeed}} = 50 \\, \\text{km/h} \\]\n\nTherefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is 50 km/h.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 50 km/h"
