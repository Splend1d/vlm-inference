                    "text": "The scenario described involves an employee who saves his boss's life by performing CPR, and as a result, the boss promises the employee lifetime employment. To determine the correct characterization of the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date, we need to analyze the elements of contract law, particularly focusing on consideration.\n\n**Option A:** This option suggests that the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract based on the boss's oral promise. However, for such a contract to be enforceable, it must meet certain criteria, including mutual assent, consideration, and legality. In this case, while there is mutual assent (the boss promised lifetime employment), the issue revolves around whether there was sufficient consideration.\n\n**Option B:** This option implies that the boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life based on a contract implied-in-fact. While the employee's actions could be seen as beneficial to the boss, the context does not suggest that the employee expected or demanded payment for their actions. Therefore, this option does not accurately reflect the situation.\n\n**Option C:** This option states that the employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise. Past consideration generally cannot serve as valid consideration for a new contract because it refers to an act already performed without any prior agreement. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** This option asserts that since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment. This is the most accurate characterization. The employee's act of saving the boss's life was done gratuitously, without any prior agreement or expectation of reward. Therefore, there was no consideration exchanged at the time of the promise, making the promise unenforceable.\n\nIn conclusion, the best characterization of the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.**"
