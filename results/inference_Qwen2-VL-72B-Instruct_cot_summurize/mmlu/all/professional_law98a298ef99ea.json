                    "text": "In 1980, an attorney purchased an 80-acre tract in a rural county. The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract. The board, which had the power of eminent domain, planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property. The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract. The attorney \u0080\u0094county deed, however, did contain a provision, which stated:\"The grantee hereby covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns that this conveyance is made in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. \"Thereafter, the county enacted a zoning ordinance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit the construction of a pest-control office building. When the county started construction, all the other lot owners in the 80-acre tract brought suit to enjoin the building plan or, in the alternative, to recover damages. If the county board of supervisors, the named defendant, prevails on both counts, it will be because\n\nA. the power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.\nB. the purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.\nC. the abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\nD. restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n"

                    "text": "To determine why the county board of supervisors would prevail on both counts if they do so, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in the case.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Restrictive Covenants**: The original deeds contained restrictive covenants limiting the use of the property to single-family residences and requiring the grantor to include similar restrictions in future deeds.\n\n2. **Deed to County**: The deed from the attorney to the county board of supervisors did not mention these restrictive covenants but included a provision stating that the conveyance was made in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain.\n\n3. **Zoning Ordinance**: The county enacted a zoning ordinance rezoning the 30 lots to permit the construction of a pest-control office.\n\n4. **Legal Action**: Other lot owners sued to either enjoin the construction or recover damages, claiming violation of the restrictive covenants.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Eminent domain refers to the government's power to take private property for public use, while zoning involves regulating land use through ordinances. They are distinct powers.\n\nB. **The purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.**\n   - Inverse condemnation occurs when a government action results in a taking without formal condemnation proceedings. However, the purchase here was voluntary, not an act of inverse condemnation.\n\nC. **The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.**\n   - This could be relevant if the court determines that the restrictive covenants are unenforceable against the county due to their public nature or the specific terms of the deed to the county. However, it does not directly address the zoning issue.\n\nD. **Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.**\n   - This is the most pertinent point. Restrictive covenants generally bind only those who have notice of them, typically through inclusion in their deeds. Since the county's deed did not contain the restrictive covenants, the county would not be bound by them.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.**\n\nThis means that since the county's deed did not include the restrictive covenants, the county would not be bound by them, allowing them to proceed with their plans without violating any enforceable restrictions."
