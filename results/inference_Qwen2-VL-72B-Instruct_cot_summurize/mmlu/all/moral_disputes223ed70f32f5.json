The question asks us to identify which facts explain why someone is required to act in a certain way toward an animal for the sake of the animal.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **the animal** - This suggests that the reasons for acting in a certain way are based on characteristics or needs specific to the animal itself.\n\nB. **the wider effects on human beings** - This implies that the reasons for acting in a certain way are based on how it impacts humans, possibly through moral obligations or societal norms.\n\nC. **both A and B** - This suggests that both the characteristics/needs of the animal and the effects on human beings contribute to the explanation.\n\nD. **neither A nor B** - This would mean that neither the animal nor the wider effects on humans explain the requirement to act in a certain way.\n\nGiven that the question specifies \"for the sake of the animal,\" it implies that the primary concern is the well-being or interests of the animal itself. Therefore, the most direct explanation for why someone is required to act in a certain way would be related to the animal.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. the animal.**"
