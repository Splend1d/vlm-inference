This leads to an increase in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland, as it tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more hormones. Therefore, a raised TSH level is a characteristic feature of hypothyroidism.\n\nWeight loss (Option A) is typically associated with hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Pre-tibial myxoedema (Option B) is a rare skin condition that can occur in patients with Graves' disease, a type of hyperthyroidism, rather than hypothyroidism. An aversion to warm places (Option D) might be experienced by individuals with hyperthyroidism who have increased metabolism and heat intolerance, but it is not a typical symptom of hypothyroidism."
