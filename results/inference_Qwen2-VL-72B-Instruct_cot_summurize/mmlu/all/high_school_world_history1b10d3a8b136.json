Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nD. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n"

However, there is no evidence in the quote or general historical context that indicates Europeans were the primary source of food for population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa during this period.\n\nB. **Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.**\n   - This option aligns well with historical knowledge. During the 15th to 18th centuries, Europeans traded firearms and other goods with Sub-Saharan African states, which helped these states consolidate power and expand their territories.\n\nC. **Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.**\n   - While Europeans did participate in the slave trade, they were not the sole purchasers of slaves. Other regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, also engaged in the slave trade with Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nD. **Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.**\n   - There is no specific historical evidence suggesting widespread alliances between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans aimed at evicting Muslim and Arab merchant princes during this period.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate statement based on historical context and the quote provided is:\n\n**B. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.**\n\nThus, the final answer is B."
