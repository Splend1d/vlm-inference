                    "text": "To find the volume of the solid cut out of the sphere, we can use the method of disks or washers in integral calculus. However, for this problem, it's more straightforward to calculate the volume of the entire sphere and then subtract the volumes of the two spherical caps that are removed.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\n\\[ V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is 2, the volume of the entire sphere is:\n\n\\[ V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 8 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume of one of the spherical caps. The height of each cap is 1 unit (since each plane is 1 unit from the center), and the radius of the sphere is 2 units. We can use the formula for the volume of a spherical cap:\n\n\\[ V_{cap} = \\frac{\\pi h^2(3R - h)}{3} \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is the height of the cap and \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere. Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ V_{cap} = \\frac{\\pi (1)^2(3 \\cdot 2 - 1)}{3} = \\frac{\\pi (6 - 1)}{3} = \\frac{5\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nSince there are two such caps, the total volume removed is:\n\n\\[ 2V_{cap} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5\\pi}{3} = \\frac{10\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nFinally, the volume of the solid left after cutting out the caps is:\n\n\\[ V_{solid} = V_{sphere} - 2V_{cap} = \\frac{32\\pi}{3} - \\frac{10\\pi}{3} = \\frac{22\\pi}{3} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. 22\u03c0/3"
