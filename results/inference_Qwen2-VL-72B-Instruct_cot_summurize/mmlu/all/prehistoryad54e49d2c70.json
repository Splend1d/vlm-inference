It freed the hands to carry things - This is a common hypothesis suggesting that bipedalism allowed hominids to use their hands for carrying food, tools, and other items.\n\nB. It allowed for braincase expansion - This hypothesis suggests that walking upright freed up space in the body for a larger brain, contributing to cognitive development.\n\nC. It expended less energy than quadrupedalism for going long distances - This hypothesis posits that bipedalism is more energy-efficient for long-distance travel compared to four-legged locomotion.\n\nD. It allowed hominids to see greater distances - This hypothesis suggests that standing upright provided a height advantage, allowing hominids to spot predators or resources from a distance.\n\nUpon reviewing these options, all of them except B directly relate to the physical advantages of bipedalism. Option B focuses on an anatomical change (braincase expansion) rather than a direct benefit of walking on two legs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. It allowed for braincase expansion"
