The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{SE} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{3.9 - 4}{0.0395} \\approx \\frac{-0.1}{0.0395} \\approx -2.53 \\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability that corresponds to a z-score of -2.53. This gives us the area to the left of -2.53 under the standard normal curve, which represents \\( P(Z < -2.53) \\).\n\nLooking up -2.53 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.0057"
