However, due to randomness, it is more likely that the actual number of heads and tails will deviate from this expected value.\nThe probability of getting exactly 50 heads (or tails) is relatively low, as there are many other possible outcomes. The probability of getting at least 60 tails (or heads) is even lower, as it requires a significant deviation from the expected value.\nOn the other hand, the probability of getting between 48 and 52 heads (or tails) is relatively high, as it includes a range of outcomes that are close to the expected value. Therefore, the event with the greatest probability is D. H >= 48 and T >= 48."
