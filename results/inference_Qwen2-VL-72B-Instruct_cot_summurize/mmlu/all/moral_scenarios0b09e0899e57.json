This behavior is considered irresponsible and morally wrong due to the risk it poses to public safety.\n\n**Scenario 2: I work at a jewelry store, and if someone walks in and they're black, I'll trigger the alarm immediately, because they're certainly going to rob the store.**\n- This scenario involves racial profiling, which is discriminatory and morally wrong. It is based on unjustified assumptions about individuals based on their race, which violates principles of fairness and equality.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
