International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts\n\nInternational tribunals do indeed share some jurisdictional principles with national courts, such as the principle of consent (where states must agree to be bound by the tribunal's decisions), and the principle of complementarity (where international tribunals defer to national courts when they are willing and able to prosecute). However, there are significant differences in how these principles are applied and other aspects of jurisdiction that are unique to international tribunals.\n\nFor example, the jurisdiction of international tribunals is often based on specific agreements or treaties between states, whereas national courts have jurisdiction over matters within their own country's territory. Additionally, international tribunals may have jurisdiction over crimes that are considered to be of concern to the international community as a whole, such as genocide or war crimes, which may not fall under the jurisdiction of national courts.\n\nTherefore, while there are similarities, the jurisdiction of international tribunals is not entirely regulated by the same principles applicable to national courts."
