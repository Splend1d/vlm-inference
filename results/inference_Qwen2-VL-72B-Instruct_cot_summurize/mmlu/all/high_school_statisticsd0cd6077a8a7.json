Confidence intervals can indeed include negative values. Negative values in this context indicate that one group (Toyota owners) has a lower proportion of satisfaction compared to the other group (Subaru owners).\n\nB. **The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. The validity of a confidence interval does not depend on whether it contains zero. The interval is valid as long as it is calculated correctly.\n\nC. **Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.**\n   - This statement is misleading. The confidence interval is given as -0.197 \u00b1 0.081, which means the estimated difference in proportions ranges from -0.278 to -0.116. This indicates that Subaru owners have a higher proportion of satisfaction, but the exact percentage difference is not precisely 19.7%.\n\nD. **We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.**\n   - This statement accurately reflects the interpretation of the confidence interval. It correctly states that we are 90% confident that the true difference in proportions lies within the range of -0.278 to -0.116.\n\nTherefore, the proper conclusion is:\n\n**D. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.**"
