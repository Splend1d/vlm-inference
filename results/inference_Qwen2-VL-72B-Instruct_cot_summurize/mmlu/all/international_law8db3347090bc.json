Port States generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not infringe their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order.\n\nThis is the most accurate statement according to international law principles.

However, there are exceptions and specific circumstances where other options might apply, but option A captures the general rule."
