On a busy day, three of his partners had clients waiting to see them, and all of the chairs in the office waiting room were filled. A woman had an appointment with the attorney, and the attorney came out to greet her in the crowded waiting room. As the woman saw the attorney she said, \"Am I glad to see you! I need a will made up right away, because I don't want my rotten son to get any of my money. He will just throw it away at the race track. \" The attorney replied, \"Let's go back to my office to discuss this matter. \" The attorney prepared a will for the woman.\nB. A woman arrived at a law office for an appointment and was escorted to her attorney's office. She sat down and said to the attorney, \"You know, I pay you a large retainer every year for your valued counsel. I need some advice now. There was a fire in my house yesterday. It was minor, but I'm covered for $15,000 under my fire insurance policy. I didn't have any furniture in the room where the fire took place, but I want to put in a claim for a sofa and love seat. How should I go about it?\" The attorney refused to give her any advice.\nC. A woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings. During the course of his representation, she told the attorney some very personal facts about her lifestyle that the attorney needed in order to prepare a petition for adoption. The adoption took place, but the woman never paid her agreed fee to the attorney. The attorney sued the woman to collect his fee.\nD. A woman consulted an attorney regarding a sale of 70% of the stock of a closely held corporation in which the woman was the majority shareholder. She explained the reason for the sale and divulged the financial condition of the corporation and its prospects for the future. The attorney determined that the transaction would be complicated. Since he felt he was inexperienced in handling such a transaction, the attorney decided to decline to represent the woman. The woman nevertheless sold her stock with the assistance of another attorney.\n"

The attorney-client privilege is one of the most well-known types of privilege, and it applies to communications between a client and their attorney made for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice.\n\nIn situation C, the woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings and shared personal information with the attorney as part of that representation. This communication is protected by the attorney-client privilege because it was made for the purpose of seeking legal advice and representation. Even though the woman did not pay her agreed fee to the attorney, the privilege still applies to the communications made during the course of the representation.\n\nIn contrast, the communications in situations A, B, and D are not privileged. In situation A, the woman's statement to the attorney in the waiting room was not made for the purpose of seeking legal advice, so it is not privileged. In situation B, the woman's request for advice on submitting a false insurance claim is illegal and therefore not protected by the attorney-client privilege. In situation D, the woman's consultation with the attorney was not for the purpose of seeking legal advice, but rather to determine whether the attorney was qualified to handle the transaction. Therefore, the communications made during that consultation are not privileged."
