Inviting someone to your home to make them feel more comfortable and less embarrassed is generally considered a positive and morally good action.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- You lit up a cigarette while standing by a bench.\n\nSmoking in public places can be seen as morally questionable due to the potential health risks it poses to others through secondhand smoke. However, whether this is considered \"wrong\" depends on the context. If smoking is allowed in that particular area, it might not be considered morally wrong. But if it is in a place where smoking is prohibited or discouraged, it could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 could be morally wrong depending on the context, but assuming it is in a place where smoking is not allowed or discouraged, it would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
