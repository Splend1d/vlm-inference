It is typically written as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = k[A]^x[B]^y[C]^z \\]\n\nwhere \\( [A] \\), \\( [B] \\), and \\( [C] \\) are the molar concentrations of the reactants A, B, and C respectively, \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) are the reaction orders with respect to each reactant, and \\( k \\) is the rate constant.\n\nGiven that when the concentration of reactant A is tripled, the reaction rate also triples, we can deduce the order of the reaction with respect to A. Let's denote the initial concentration of A as \\( [A]_0 \\) and the new concentration as \\( 3[A]_0 \\). If tripling the concentration of A triples the reaction rate, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Rate} = 3 \\times \\text{Initial Rate} \\]\n\nSubstituting into the rate law gives:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times k[A]_0^x = k(3[A]_0)^x \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[ 3k[A]_0^x = 3^xk[A]_0^x \\]\n\nSince \\( k[A]_0^x \\) is common on both sides, we can cancel it out:\n\n\\[ 3 = 3^x \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the appropriate exponent for A in the rate law is:\n\nA. 1"
