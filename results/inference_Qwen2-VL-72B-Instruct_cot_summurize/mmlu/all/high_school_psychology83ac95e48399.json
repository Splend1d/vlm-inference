It lacks diversity and does not represent the broader population of male college students.\n\nB. **A random sample taken between classes in the business wing of various universities**\n   - While this sample includes students from multiple universities, it is limited to those who attend business classes. This introduces bias towards students in business programs and may not be representative of all male college students.\n\nC. **Sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia**\n   - This sample includes students from prestigious Ivy League institutions but only from these five schools. Although it covers different classes, it still lacks diversity by excluding other types of colleges and universities.\n\nD. **Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities**\n   - This sample includes students from a variety of colleges and universities, ensuring a broader representation across different types of institutions. It also covers different classes, providing a more comprehensive view of the male college student population.\n\nConsidering these analyses, the most representative sample of male college students would be:\n\n**D. Twenty male members of each class from a cross-section of colleges and universities**\n\nThis option ensures a diverse and inclusive sample that reflects the broader population of male college students."
