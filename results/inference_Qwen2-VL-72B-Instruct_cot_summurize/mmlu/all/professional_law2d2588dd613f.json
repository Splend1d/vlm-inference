The wife obtained a divorce from the husband after learnitg that he was engaging in an extramarital love affair with one of his co-workers. Following the divorce, the husband was arrested and charged with embezzling funds from his employer during a two- year period. In preparing for trial, the prosecuting attorney interviewed the wife, who stated that during their marriage, the husband admitted committing the embezzlement. This jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify regarding statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding commission of the crime. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony will be\n\nA. admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.\nB. admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.\nC. admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.\nD. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n"

However, this privilege generally does not extend to communications made after the marriage has ended, such as through divorce. Since the wife learned about the embezzlement during their marriage, the marital communication privilege would typically apply to protect those communications from being disclosed in court.\n\nThe spousal privilege, on the other hand, allows a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse in certain circumstances. However, once a divorce has occurred, the spousal privilege no longer applies, and the former spouse can be compelled to testify.\n\nGiven that the wife learned about the embezzlement during the marriage (which would normally be protected by the marital communication privilege), but the divorce has since occurred (rendering the spousal privilege inapplicable), the wife's testimony would likely be inadmissible due to the ongoing protection of the marital communication privilege. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges."
