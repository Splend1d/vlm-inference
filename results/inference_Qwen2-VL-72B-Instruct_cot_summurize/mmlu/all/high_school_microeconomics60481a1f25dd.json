Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers\n\nA shift to the right in the demand curve for orange juice indicates an increase in demand at every price level. This can be caused by factors such as:\n\n- An increase in consumer income (if orange juice is a normal good)\n- Positive changes in consumer preferences or tastes\n- An increase in the price of a substitute good\n- An expectation of higher future prices for orange juice\n\nOption D, expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers, would lead consumers to expect they will have more purchasing power in the future, potentially increasing their current demand for orange juice. The other options either suggest a decrease in demand (A and B) or do not directly relate to an increase in demand (C)."
