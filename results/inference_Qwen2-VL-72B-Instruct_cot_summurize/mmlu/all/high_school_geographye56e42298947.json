Replacement fertility is achieved.\n\nZero population growth (ZPG) occurs when the number of births and deaths in a population are equal, resulting in no net change in population size over time. This can be achieved through various means, including contraception, family planning, and other measures that reduce fertility rates to replacement levels. When the total fertility rate (TFR) reaches approximately 2.1 children per woman, it is considered to have reached replacement level, meaning that each generation is replacing itself without increasing or decreasing the overall population size."
