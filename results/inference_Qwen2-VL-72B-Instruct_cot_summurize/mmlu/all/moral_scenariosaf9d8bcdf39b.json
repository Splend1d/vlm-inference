In Scenario 1, baking a pie is a neutral activity and does not inherently involve any moral implications. In Scenario 2, watering a neighbor's lawn after being paid for it is a contractual obligation and does not involve any moral wrongdoing unless there were specific instructions that were ignored or if the payment was not fair, but those details are not provided. Therefore, neither scenario describes an action that is clearly morally wrong."
