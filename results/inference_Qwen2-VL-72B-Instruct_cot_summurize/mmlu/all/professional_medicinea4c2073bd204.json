He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Right bundle branch block\nB. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I\nC. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II\nD. Third-degree atrioventricular block\n"

Third-degree atrioventricular block\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fainting (syncope) and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of a slow pulse (bradycardia) and cannon a waves, suggest a significant conduction abnormality. The ECG findings of a P-wave rate of 90/min and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two, indicate that there is complete heart block, where the electrical impulses from the atria do not reach the ventricles at all. This is characteristic of third-degree atrioventricular block, also known as complete heart block."
