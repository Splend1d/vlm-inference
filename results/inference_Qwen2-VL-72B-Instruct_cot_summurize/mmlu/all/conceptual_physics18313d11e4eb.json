The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move on average. This relationship is described by the equipartition theorem in statistical mechanics, which states that each degree of freedom in a system contributes equally to the total energy at thermal equilibrium. For simple gases, the primary degrees of freedom are translational, making the average translational kinetic energy directly proportional to temperature."
