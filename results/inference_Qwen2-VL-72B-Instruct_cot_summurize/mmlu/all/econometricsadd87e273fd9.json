The diagonal VECH model does not ensure a positive-definite variance-covariance matrix\n\nThe BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner) formulation addresses this issue by ensuring that the resulting variance-covariance matrix is always positive definite, which is a crucial property for covariance matrices. This makes the BEKK model more suitable for practical applications where maintaining the positive definiteness of the covariance matrix is essential."
