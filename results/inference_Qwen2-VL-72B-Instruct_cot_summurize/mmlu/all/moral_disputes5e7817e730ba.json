However, since I don't have real-time access to current statistics or databases, I will provide an analysis based on general knowledge and typical trends in legal studies.\n\n1. **Understanding Capital Cases**: Capital cases refer to those where the death penalty is sought or imposed.\n2. **Serious Errors**: These can include issues like wrongful convictions, procedural mistakes, ineffective counsel, etc.\n\nHistorically, studies and reports on capital punishment often highlight significant error rates in these cases. For instance, the Death Penalty Information Center has reported that many capital cases have been overturned due to various forms of serious errors.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Option A (under 50 percent)**: This seems unlikely given the high scrutiny and frequent appeals in capital cases.\n- **Option B (52 percent)**: This is plausible but might be considered low for the level of scrutiny applied to capital cases.\n- **Option C (68 percent)**: This is also plausible as it reflects a substantial rate of error correction.\n- **Option D (82 percent)**: This is quite high and might be considered extreme unless there is specific evidence supporting such a high rate.\n\nBased on general knowledge and typical trends, the most reasonable estimate would likely fall between 52% and 68%. Given the nature of capital cases and the extensive review processes they undergo, a higher percentage of overturned cases due to serious errors seems more plausible.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate among the provided options is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. 68 percent**"
