Because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice.\n\nRawls' theory focuses on the distribution of primary goods (such as rights, liberties, opportunities, income, and wealth) in society, aiming for fairness in these distributions. However, the capability approach argues that merely distributing resources or ensuring formal equality is not enough. It emphasizes the importance of what people are actually able to do or be, their \"capabilities.\" This approach critiques Rawls' theory for not sufficiently considering how individuals can effectively use the resources they receive to achieve well-being and lead a good life. The capability approach seeks to ensure that people have real opportunities to achieve valuable functionings, such as being healthy, educated, and participating in social life, rather than just having access to resources that might not translate into actual benefits due to various constraints."
