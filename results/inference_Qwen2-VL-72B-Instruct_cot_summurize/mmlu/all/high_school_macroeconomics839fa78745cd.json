Consumers seek substitutes for sugar and products that use sugar.\n\nAn import quota on sugar would limit the amount of sugar that can be imported into the United States, leading to higher prices for sugar and sugar-containing products. As a result, consumers may look for alternatives or substitutes to reduce their consumption of sugar and products that use sugar. This is a common response when the availability of a product decreases and its price increases due to trade restrictions like quotas."
