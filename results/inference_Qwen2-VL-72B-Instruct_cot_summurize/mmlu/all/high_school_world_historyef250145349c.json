This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors. And all other lands, both islands and mainlands, found or to be found hereafter, discovered or to be discovered hereafter, which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., and by their vessels, on the western side of the said bound, determined as above, after having passed the said bound toward the west, in either its north or south latitude, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King and Queen of Castile, Leon, etc., and to their successors.\"\nTreaty of Tordesillas, 1494\nWhich of the following inferences best explains the reason the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line?\n\nA.

The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine the best inference explaining why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism.**\n   - The Barbary states were located in North Africa, not in the territories west of the demarcation line. Therefore, this option does not align with the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nB. **The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World.**\n   - This option suggests a strategic advantage based on secrecy. However, the Treaty of Tordesillas was negotiated after the discovery of the New World was known to both parties. Thus, this option is unlikely to be the primary reason.\n\nC. **The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.**\n   - This option implies a desire to maintain Native independence, which contradicts historical evidence. The Spanish were more interested in colonization and control rather than preserving Native independence.\n\nD. **The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.**\n   - This option aligns well with historical context. The Spanish had already established a foothold in the New World and likely perceived it as easier to conquer and colonize compared to India, which was further away and potentially more challenging due to existing empires and cultures.\n\nGiven the historical context and the content of the Treaty of Tordesillas, the most plausible inference is:\n\n**D. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.**"
