China was forced to open some of its ports to international trade.\n\nThe First Opium War, fought between Britain and China from 1839 to 1842, resulted in the Treaty of Nanking. This treaty required China to open several ports to British merchants, cede Hong Kong to Britain, pay an indemnity, and grant extraterritorial rights to British citizens in China. These terms significantly impacted China's sovereignty and economic policies."
