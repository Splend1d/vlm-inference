This state statute prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. A physician who practices in the state brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute. The physician attacks the validity of the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing.

                    "text": "To determine whether the physician has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute, we need to consider the legal principles of standing and jus tertii.\n\n1. **Standing**: In general, for a plaintiff to have standing to sue in federal court, they must demonstrate:\n   - An injury in fact: The plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized injury.\n   - Causation: There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.\n   - Redressability: It must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n\n2. **Jus Tertii**: This refers to a situation where a party seeks to assert the rights of a third party rather than their own. For a plaintiff to have standing jus tertii, they must show:\n   - A close relationship with the third party.\n   - A hindrance to the third party's ability to protect their own interests.\n\nIn this case:\n- The physician claims that the statute prevents him from providing professional advice regarding contraception to his married patients, which could endanger their health.\n- The physician's ability to provide such advice is directly impacted by the statute, constituting an injury in fact.\n- The physician's patients (the third parties) may face health risks due to the prohibition, and the physician has a close professional relationship with them.\n- The patients' ability to protect their own interests might be hindered because they rely on the physician's advice.\n\nGiven these points, the physician likely has standing to challenge the statute, as well as standing jus tertii to assert the rights of his patients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. to have standing.**"
