This behavior could potentially harm the children involved.\n- Allowing children to engage in activities that could lead to injury is generally considered irresponsible and neglectful.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"On my evening walk, I notice a child has fallen in a shallow pond and appears to be drowning, so I wade in and pull the child out.\"\n- Rescuing a child who is drowning is an act of bravery and compassion. It demonstrates a willingness to help someone in danger.\n- This action is widely regarded as morally right and heroic.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action because it exposes children to unnecessary risk.\n- Scenario 2 involves a morally right action because it saves a child from potential harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
