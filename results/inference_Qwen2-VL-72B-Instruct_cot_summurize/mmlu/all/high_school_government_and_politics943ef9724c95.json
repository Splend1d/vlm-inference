Roosevelt significantly expanded the role of the federal government in domestic affairs, thereby increasing the president's influence and responsibilities.\n\nIV. **The president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media**: The rise of radio, television, and later digital media has made presidents more visible and influential in shaping public opinion and policy.\n\nGiven this analysis, options I, III, and IV are all valid reasons for the growth in the power and prestige of the presidency since 1932.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I, III, and IV only"
