This means that when divided by $13$, the remainder is $5$. \n\nLet's start with the smallest positive number in our range that fits this description:\n\nFor $k = -15$, we get $13(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190$.\n\nWe continue increasing $k$ until we exceed $200$:\n\nFor $k = 15$, we get $13(15) + 5 = 195 + 5 = 200$.\n\nSo, the sequence of numbers congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ within our range starts at $-190$ and ends at $200$. To find out how many such numbers there are, we calculate the difference between the values of $k$ that give us the first and last numbers in our sequence, and add one (because both endpoints are included).\n\nThe value of $k$ for $-190$ is $-15$, and for $200$ is $15$. So, the total number of integers is $15 - (-15) + 1 = 31$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 31."
