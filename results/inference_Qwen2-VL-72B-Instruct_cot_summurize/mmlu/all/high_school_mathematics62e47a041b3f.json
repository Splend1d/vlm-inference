We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting point:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(3)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{45} \\approx 6.7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the person is approximately 6.7 miles away from the starting point.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 6.7."
