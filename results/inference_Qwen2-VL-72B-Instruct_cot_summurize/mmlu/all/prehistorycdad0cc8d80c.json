Monuments and possessions were used as symbols to reinforce the inequalities on which state societies are based.\n\nIn state societies, the elite often displayed conspicuous consumption to demonstrate their power, status, and wealth. This served to reinforce social hierarchies and inequalities within the society. Monuments, grand buildings, and lavish possessions were visible signs of their elevated position and helped to maintain their authority and control over the less privileged members of society."
