Impacts: Venus has a relatively small number of impact craters compared to other planets like Mars or Mercury, suggesting that its surface has been resurfaced by other processes.\n\nB. Erosion: Although Venus does not have liquid water on its surface, wind erosion can occur due to the planet's high-speed winds.\n\nC. Volcanism: Venus is believed to have had significant volcanic activity in its past, and there is evidence of lava flows and volcanic features on its surface."
