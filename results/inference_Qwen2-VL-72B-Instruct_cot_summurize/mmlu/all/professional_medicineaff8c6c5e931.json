She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 \u03bcU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acute stress disorder\nB. Agoraphobia\nC. Generalized anxiety disorder\nD. Hypothyroidism\n"

Acute stress disorder\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, along with her recent traumatic experience (being robbed at knifepoint), suggest that she may be experiencing acute stress disorder. This condition can occur after a traumatic event and includes symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.\n\nWhile the other options listed (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and hypothyroidism) could also present with some similar symptoms, the context of the recent trauma makes acute stress disorder the most plausible diagnosis. The patient's hypothyroidism is being treated with levothyroxine, and her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is within the normal range, which suggests that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled and less likely to be causing her current symptoms."
