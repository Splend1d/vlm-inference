Achievement tests measure specific knowledge or skills that have been acquired through education or training, as opposed to aptitude tests, which predict future performance based on innate abilities, or intelligence tests, which measure general cognitive abilities. Projective tests are used in psychological assessment to reveal underlying thoughts, feelings, or conflicts by analyzing a person's response to ambiguous stimuli."
