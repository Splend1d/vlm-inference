The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n"

Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the lumber mill has encountered an unforeseeable event (a forest fire) that has destroyed its lumber reserve, making it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual obligations to deliver the remaining shipments of plywood. This situation falls under the doctrine of impossibility, which excuses a party from performing their contractual obligations when an unforeseen event makes performance objectively impossible. Therefore, the court would likely rule in favor of the mill due to the impossibility of fulfilling the contract terms as a result of the unforeseen event."
