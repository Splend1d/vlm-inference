The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n"

This rule is based on the idea that firefighters assume the risks inherent in their profession when they respond to emergencies. However, this rule typically does not extend to police officers. Police officers are often considered to have different duties and responsibilities compared to firefighters, and thus, the firefighter's rule may not apply to them in the same way. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment should be denied because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers."
