This implies that Pico believed in the uniqueness of man.\n\nB. **that God intended man to strive to achieve**\n   - The passage mentions \"The great generosity of God\" and \"To man it is allowed to be whatever he chooses to be,\" indicating that God has given man the freedom to achieve and choose his own path.\n\nC. **that man is unworthy of admiration**\n   - The passage explicitly states that man is \"worthy of all admiration.\" Therefore, Pico did not reject this notion.\n\nD. **that humans are God's equals**\n   - The passage does not suggest that humans are equal to God. It emphasizes the unique position and potential of humans but does not equate them with God.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct inference is:\n\n**C. that man is unworthy of admiration**\n\nThus, Pico rejected the notion that man is unworthy of admiration."
