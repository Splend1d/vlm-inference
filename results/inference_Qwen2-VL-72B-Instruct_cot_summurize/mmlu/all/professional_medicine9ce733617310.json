Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?\n\nA. Parkinson disease\nB. Progressive supranuclear palsy\nC. Sarcopenia\nD. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)\n"

This condition is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, which can affect the hands and forearms, as well as other parts of the body. It can also cause joint stiffness and limited range of motion, as well as other symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty swallowing. The patient's slow and deliberate gait may also be related to this condition. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Options A, B, and C are not supported by the information provided in the case."
