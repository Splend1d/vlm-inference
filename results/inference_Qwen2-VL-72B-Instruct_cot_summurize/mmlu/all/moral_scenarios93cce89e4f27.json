Smoke alarms are crucial for warning people of potential fires, and disabling them puts lives at risk.\n- This action is clearly morally wrong as it endangers the safety of others, including potentially vulnerable individuals like grandparents.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
