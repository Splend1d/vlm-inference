The court ruled that the right to a fair trial includes the right to legal aid when necessary. While this case is significant for interpreting Article 6, it does not prominently illustrate the living instrument principle as much as other cases might.\n\nB. **A v UK (2009)**: This case involved the use of control orders against suspected terrorists without trial. The court found that such measures violated Article 5 (right to liberty) and Article 6 (right to a fair trial). This case reflects an evolving interpretation of human rights in the context of national security concerns, aligning well with the living instrument principle.\n\nC. **Goodwin v UK (2002)**: This case concerned the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention. It dealt with the issue of transsexuals' rights to marry and have their gender legally recognized. The court's decision reflected a broader understanding of personal identity and rights, showing how the Convention adapts to societal changes, thus illustrating the living instrument principle.\n\nD. **Osman v UK (1998)**: This case involved the failure of the authorities to prevent the murder of a child. The court held that there was a violation of Article 2 (right to life) due to the state's failure to take reasonable steps to protect the victim. While important, this case primarily focuses on the state's duty to protect rather than on the evolving nature of the Convention itself.\n\nConsidering the principle of the living instrument, which emphasizes the evolution and adaptation of the Convention to contemporary standards, **Option C: Goodwin v UK (2002)** best illustrates this principle. The case shows how the court adapted its interpretation of Article 8 to accommodate changing societal attitudes towards gender identity and recognition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**C. Goodwin v UK (2002)**"
