Access and exchange 'private' information about consumers: Through data mining, social media monitoring, and other digital tracking methods, companies can gather extensive information about consumer behavior, preferences, and personal details.\n\nB. Reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging: Electronic tagging allows for the monitoring of offenders in the community, which can help alleviate overcrowding in prisons by providing an alternative to incarceration for certain types of offenses.\n\nC. Monitor employees' activities at work: Employers can use various technologies such as keylogger software, GPS tracking, and video surveillance to monitor their employees' activities, productivity, and compliance with company policies.\n\nThese advancements in surveillance technology have significant implications for privacy, security, and the balance between individual rights and collective safety or efficiency."
