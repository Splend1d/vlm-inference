Although the state provides both sexes with equal pay and benefits, the state has adopted a policy that prohibits the assignment of female officers to its special undercover narcotics division. This is a moderate risk position that sometimes involves violent encounters with drug dealers. Since the special narcotics division was first established, five undercover agents have been killed in the line of duty. It is because of the state's concern with the safety and well-being of its female officers that it has adopted such a policy. The woman, who desired to be a member of the narcotics division, filed an application for assignment as a special drug agent. After she was rejected for the position, the woman sued the state in federal court to enjoin enforcement of its stated policy on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following results in this suit is most appropriate?\n\nA. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.\nB. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.\nC. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.\nD. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.\n"

To determine the most appropriate result in this suit, we need to consider the principles of constitutional law, particularly those related to gender discrimination and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Equal Protection Clause**: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to treat similarly situated individuals equally under the law. Gender-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny, meaning the state must show that the classification serves an important governmental objective and is substantially related to achieving that objective.\n\n2. **Intermediate Scrutiny**: Under intermediate scrutiny, the state must demonstrate:\n   - An important governmental objective.\n   - A substantial relationship between the means (the classification) and the objective.\n\n3. **State's Objective**: The state's objective here is to protect the safety and well-being of its female officers. This is generally considered an important governmental objective.\n\n4. **Substantial Relationship**: The question then becomes whether prohibiting female officers from joining the narcotics division is substantially related to protecting their safety. The state argues that the high-risk nature of the job and the history of fatalities justify the exclusion.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n\n**A. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.**\n\n- This option suggests that the state has failed to show a substantial relationship between the exclusion of women from the narcotics division and the goal of protecting their safety. Given the history of fatalities and the high-risk nature of the job, it could be argued that there is indeed a substantial relationship.\n\n**B. Judgment for the woman, because the terms and conditions of state government employment are privileges or immunities of state citizenship that may not be abridged by the state on the basis of gender.**\n\n- This option incorrectly conflates the Privileges or Immunities Clause with the Equal Protection Clause. The Privileges or Immunities Clause protects certain fundamental rights against state infringement, but it does not directly address gender discrimination in employment.\n\n**C. Judgment for the state, because it is within a state's police power to insulate the terms and conditions of governmental employment.**\n\n- While states do have broad police powers, these powers are not absolute and must comply with constitutional limitations, including the Equal Protection Clause. This option fails to address the constitutional scrutiny required for gender-based classifications.\n\n**D. Judgment for the state, because the state has articulated a rational basis for this classification and, therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of responsible state officials.**\n\n- This option misapplies the standard of review. Rational basis review applies to economic regulations and other non-suspect classifications, not to gender-based classifications, which require intermediate scrutiny.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate result is:\n\n**A. Judgment for the woman, because the facts asserted do not demonstrate that the particular classification contained in this policy is substantially related to the advancement of an important state interest.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the requirement under intermediate scrutiny that the state must show a substantial relationship between the means (excluding women from the narcotics division) and the objective (protecting their safety). The state's argument might not sufficiently meet this standard, especially if alternative measures could achieve the same objective without excluding women based on gender."
