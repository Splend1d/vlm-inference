As the Soviet government prioritized mass education and literacy campaigns, especially in rural areas, this group likely saw significant improvements in literacy.\n\nB. **Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy**: This group typically already had higher literacy rates due to their religious education and roles within the church. While they might have benefited from general improvements in literacy, they were not the primary focus of the Soviet literacy campaigns.\n\nC. **The urban middle class**: This group generally had better access to education and higher literacy rates even before the Soviet period. While they would continue to benefit from improved educational opportunities, they were not the main target of the literacy campaigns aimed at increasing overall national literacy.\n\nD. **Officers in the armed forces**: Military officers often had higher literacy rates as part of their training and professional requirements. While they would benefit from general improvements in education, they were not the primary focus of the mass literacy campaigns.\n\nGiven the historical context and the focus of Soviet literacy campaigns on improving overall national literacy, particularly targeting those with historically lower literacy rates, the rural peasantry would have benefited most from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart.\n\n**Final answer: A. The rural peasantry**"
