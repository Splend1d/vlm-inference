The man stole a car and parked it two blocks from the bank. He left the car key under the floor mat with a note saying that he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, the woman robbed the bank and ran to the spot where the man had said he would leave the stolen car. She then escaped in the car and disappeared. She never shared any of the money with the man. In a jurisdiction that has adopted the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, can the man properly be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank?\n\nA. No, because the man received no benefit from the robbery.\nB. No, because the man withdrew from the conspiracy.\nC. Yes, because the robbery was successful due in part to the man's actions.\nD. Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the man can be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank, we need to analyze the elements of conspiracy under the bilateral requirement.\n\n1. **Agreement**: There must be an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime.\n2. **Overt Act**: At least one party must perform an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n- The man and the woman agreed that the woman would rob a bank and that the man would steal a car for her to use as a getaway vehicle.\n- The man stole a car and left it near the bank with the key and a note indicating his withdrawal from the scheme.\n- The woman used the stolen car to escape after robbing the bank.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Agreement**: The man and the woman clearly agreed to rob the bank.\n- **Overt Act**: The man stole a car and left it near the bank, which is an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nThe fact that the man left a note stating his desire to withdraw from the scheme does not negate the existence of the conspiracy. Withdrawal from a conspiracy typically requires affirmative acts demonstrating a clear and unequivocal renunciation of the criminal purpose, which may include notifying co-conspirators and taking steps to thwart the success of the conspiracy. Simply leaving a note does not necessarily constitute effective withdrawal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there was an agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, the man can be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank.\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.**"
