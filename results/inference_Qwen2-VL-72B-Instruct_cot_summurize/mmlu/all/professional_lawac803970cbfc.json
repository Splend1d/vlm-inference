Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. \" However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?\n\nA. On June 1 the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nB. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nC.

On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Statute of Limitations**: The statute of limitations for collecting on the promissory note expired on September 30 of last year. This means that after that date, the creditor could no longer sue to collect the original $12,000 debt.\n\n2. **Debtor's Letter**: On June 1 of this year, the debtor sent a letter promising to pay $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of the debt. This promise is significant because it indicates a new agreement between the parties.\n\n3. **Failure to Pay**: The debtor did not make the promised payment on July 1. By failing to fulfill this new agreement, the debtor has breached the new contract.\n\n4. **Legal Rights**: When the debtor breached the new agreement on July 1, the creditor was entitled to enforce the terms of that new agreement. Since the debtor offered to pay $5,000 in full satisfaction of the debt, the creditor can sue for the $5,000 promised.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the creditor's rights against the debtor for the original $12,000 debt. The new agreement does not revive the original debt; it replaces it with a new obligation. Therefore, the creditor cannot sue for the original $12,000 based on the new agreement.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C: On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000. This statement is incorrect because the creditor cannot sue for the original $12,000 based on the new agreement. The correct interpretation should be that the creditor can sue for the $5,000 promised in the new agreement, but none of the provided options correctly reflect this."
