Because its justification depends on the concept employed.\n\nSeparating the concept of punishment from its justification is crucial because the justification for punishment relies heavily on how we define and understand what punishment entails. Different concepts of punishment can lead to different justifications, which in turn influence the ethical and practical considerations surrounding its use. For example, if punishment is seen as retribution, the justification might focus on balancing the scales of justice. If it is viewed as deterrence, the justification would emphasize preventing future crimes. Thus, clarifying the concept of punishment is foundational to understanding why and how it should be applied."
