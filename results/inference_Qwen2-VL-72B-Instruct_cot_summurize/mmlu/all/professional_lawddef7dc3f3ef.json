Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it would be land fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber and has clearings where someone could build a home and live. The woman conveyed the tract to her brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother then proceeded to clear some timber on the tract and used it in repairing fences, buildings, equipment, and the like on the property. In an action by the woman to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber, the woman will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.\nB. succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.\nC. not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.\nD. not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.\n"

A life tenant generally has the right to make reasonable use of the land, including exploiting its natural resources, as long as they do not commit waste. Waste refers to actions that diminish the value of the property beyond what is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the life estate.\n\nThe brother's actions\u2014clearing 40 acres of timber on the cultivable land and cutting 60 acres of timber in the swampland\u2014can be considered reasonable use of the land for his benefit during his life tenancy. The fact that the swampland had never been used for timber production before does not necessarily mean that the brother cannot exploit it now, provided that his actions do not constitute waste.\n\nTherefore, the woman will most likely not succeed in her action to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting more timber on the swampland section of the tract or to account for profits received from the sale of the timber, because a life tenant has the right to make reasonable use of the land."
