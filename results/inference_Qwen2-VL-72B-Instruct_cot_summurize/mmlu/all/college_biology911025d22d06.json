They often exert a disproportionate influence on their environment relative to their abundance. By preventing dominant species from monopolizing resources, keystone species help maintain biodiversity and the balance within the ecosystem. This is typically achieved through predation, competition, or other interactions that limit the population growth of certain species, thereby allowing less competitive species to coexist."
