Hall coefficient\n\nThe Hall coefficient is a property that can be used to determine the type and concentration of charge carriers in a material, including doped semiconductors. It is measured by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to an electric current flowing through the material and observing the resulting voltage (Hall voltage) across the sample. The sign of the Hall coefficient indicates whether the majority charge carriers are positive (holes) or negative (electrons)."
