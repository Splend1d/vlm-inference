This could complement an expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nB. **Lowering the income tax rate**: This is actually a fiscal policy measure rather than a monetary policy one. Lowering income taxes increases disposable income, which can stimulate consumption and investment, thereby enhancing the effects of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nC. **Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks**: When central banks sell Treasury securities to commercial banks, it reduces the amount of money in circulation because banks use their reserves to buy these securities. This action is contractionary and would reduce the money supply, thereby lessening the stimulative effects of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nD. **Lowering the discount rate**: A lower discount rate encourages banks to borrow more from the central bank, increasing the money supply and making credit cheaper and more available. This would generally support and enhance the effects of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the monetary policy that would lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy is:\n\n**C. Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks.**"
