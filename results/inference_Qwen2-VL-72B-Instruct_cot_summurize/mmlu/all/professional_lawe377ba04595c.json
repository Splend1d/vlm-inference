Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. equitable servitude.\nB. restrictive covenant.\nC. unenforceable restriction.\nD. easement for public use.\n"

                    "text": "The investor's proposed designation of the 10-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a **restrictive covenant**.\n\nRestrictive covenants are agreements that limit the use of land in some way. They can be imposed by various parties, including developers or homeowners' associations, and are typically recorded with the property deed. In this case, the investor has designated a portion of the land specifically for the purpose of constructing a public school, which is a restriction on how that land can be used.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\n- **Equitable servitude**: This term generally refers to a legal obligation that runs with the land and binds successive owners. While it might seem similar, the specific designation for a school building is more accurately described as a restrictive covenant because it directly restricts the use of the land.\n  \n- **Unenforceable restriction**: Without additional context suggesting that the restriction cannot be legally enforced, it is not appropriate to label the restriction as unenforceable. The investor's proposal appears to be a clear and enforceable restriction on the use of the land.\n\n- **Easement for public use**: An easement typically allows someone to use part of another person's land for a specific purpose, such as access or utilities. In this scenario, the land is being designated for the construction of a school, which is more akin to a permanent restriction rather than an easement.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is:\n\n**B. restrictive covenant.**"
