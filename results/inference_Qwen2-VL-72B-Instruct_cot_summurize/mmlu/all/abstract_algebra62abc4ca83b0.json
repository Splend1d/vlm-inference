Closure: For all a,b in H, a*b must also be in H.\n  2. Associativity: For all a,b,c in H, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).\n  3. Identity: There exists an element e in H such that for all a in H, e*a = a*e = a.\n  4. Inverse: For every element a in H, there exists an element b in H such that a*b = b*a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nOption A only guarantees closure, but not associativity, identity or inverse. Option B only guarantees the existence of inverses, but not closure, associativity or identity. Option D only guarantees the existence of the identity element, but not closure, associativity or inverse.\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer as it guarantees both closure and the existence of inverses, which are necessary conditions for H to be a group."
