Southeast\u2014African Americans: This is generally accurate as the Southeastern United States has a significant African American population due to historical factors such as slavery and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nB. Oklahoma and the Southwest\u2014Native Americans: This is also accurate as Oklahoma and the Southwest have large Native American populations, including tribes like the Navajo, Apache, and various tribes in Oklahoma.\n\nC. Quebec and northern Maine\u2014French Americans and French Canadians: This is accurate as Quebec is predominantly French-speaking and has a significant French Canadian population, and northern Maine has a notable French American community.\n\nD. Southern prairie provinces\u2014African Americans: This is not accurate. The southern prairie provinces in Canada (such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) do not have a significant concentration of African Americans. The African American population in Canada is more concentrated in urban areas like Toronto and Montreal.\n\nTherefore, the association that is NOT correct is:\n\nD. Southern prairie provinces\u2014African Americans"
