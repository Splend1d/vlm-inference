Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets.\n\nIn the context of a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization, total net assets on the statement of financial position typically include three categories:\n1. Unrestricted net assets: These are assets that can be used at the discretion of the organization's management without any donor-imposed restrictions.\n2. Temporarily restricted net assets: These are assets that have donor-imposed restrictions that will expire either with the passage of time or upon the completion of a specified event.\n3. Permanently restricted net assets: These are assets that have donor-imposed restrictions that do not expire and must be maintained in perpetuity, often to generate income for the organization.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies the components that would be included in total net assets for such an organization."
