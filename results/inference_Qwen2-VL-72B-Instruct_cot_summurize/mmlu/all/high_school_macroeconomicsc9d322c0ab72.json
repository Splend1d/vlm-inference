When the deficit is negative, the debt decreases.\n\nExplanation:\n- A federal budget deficit occurs when government spending exceeds its revenue in a given fiscal year.\n- The federal debt is the total amount of money that the government owes, which includes all past deficits minus surpluses.\n- If the deficit is negative (indicating a surplus), it means the government has more revenue than spending for that year, which would reduce the overall debt.\n- Options A and B are incorrect because they incorrectly relate the sign of the debt to changes in the deficit.\n- Option C is incorrect because the deficit is not the accumulation of past debts; rather, it contributes to the increase in the debt each year if there is a deficit."
