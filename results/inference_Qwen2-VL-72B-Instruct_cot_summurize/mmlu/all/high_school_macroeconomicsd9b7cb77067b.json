Therefore, we want policies that increase aggregate demand.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Increase Taxes (Fiscal) + Increase Reserve Ratio (Monetary)**:\n   - Both actions are contractionary, likely worsening the recessionary gap by reducing both consumer spending and the money supply.\n\nB. **Decrease Spending (Fiscal) + Sell Treasury Securities (Monetary)**:\n   - Both actions are contractionary, likely worsening the recessionary gap by reducing government spending and the money supply.\n\nC. **Decrease Taxes (Fiscal) + Buy Treasury Securities (Monetary)**:\n   - Both actions are expansionary, likely helping to reduce the recessionary gap by increasing consumer spending and the money supply.\n\nD. **Increase Spending (Fiscal) + Increase Reserve Ratio (Monetary)**:\n   - One action is expansionary (increase spending), while the other is contractionary (increase reserve ratio). The net effect might be mixed or neutral depending on the magnitude of each policy.\n\nThe combination that most effectively reduces a recessionary gap is:\n\n**C. Decrease taxes. Buy Treasury securities.**"
