To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nD.

Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\n\nThis statement reflects the Copenhagen School's emphasis on securitization theory, which posits that security is not an objective condition but rather a process through which issues are transformed into matters of existential concern for a referent object (often a state or community). This transformation is achieved through speech acts, where actors declare certain issues as existential threats requiring emergency measures. The Copenhagen School argues that this process is socially constructed and context-dependent."
