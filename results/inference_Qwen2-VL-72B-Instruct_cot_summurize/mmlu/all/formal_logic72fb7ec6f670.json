This means if \\( E \\) is true, then \\( F \\) must also be true.\n2. \"or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds\" translates to: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow C \\). This means if \\( \\neg S \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n\nPutting these together with the \"either...or\" structure, we get:\n\\[ (E \\rightarrow F) \\lor (\\neg S \\rightarrow C) \\]\n\nNow, let's match this with the provided options:\n\nA. \\( (E \\supset F) \\lor (C \\equiv \\neg S) \\)\n   - This option incorrectly uses equivalence (\\( \\equiv \\)) instead of implication (\\( \\rightarrow \\)) in the second part.\n\nB. \\( (F \\supset E) \\lor (\\neg S \\equiv C) \\)\n   - This option reverses the direction of the implication in the first part and incorrectly uses equivalence (\\( \\equiv \\)) in the second part.\n\nC. \\( (E \\supset F) \\lor (S \\supset \\neg C) \\)\n   - This option incorrectly reverses the implication in the second part.\n\nD. \\( (F \\supset E) \\lor (\\neg S \\supset C) \\)\n   - This option correctly represents both implications but reverses the direction of the first implication.\n\nNone of the options perfectly matches our translation. However, the closest one is D, even though it has a reversed implication in the first part. Given the options provided, D is the most accurate representation among them.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence from the provided options is:\nD. \\( (F \\supset E) \\lor (\\neg S \\supset C) \\)"
