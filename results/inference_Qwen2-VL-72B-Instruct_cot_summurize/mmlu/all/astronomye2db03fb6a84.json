                    "text": "To determine the length of a solar day on Planet X, we need to understand the relationship between the planet's orbital period (the time it takes to orbit its sun) and its rotational period (the time it takes to rotate once on its axis).\n\nGiven:\n- Orbital period = 100 Earth days\n- Sidereal rotation period = 100 Earth days\n\nThe sidereal day is the time it takes for a planet to complete one rotation relative to the fixed stars. The solar day is the time it takes for a planet to complete one rotation relative to the sun.\n\nFor a planet that is not tidally locked, the solar day can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Solar Day} = \\frac{\\text{Sidereal Day}}{1 - \\frac{\\text{Orbital Period}}{\\text{Sidereal Day}}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Solar Day} = \\frac{100}{1 - \\frac{100}{100}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Solar Day} = \\frac{100}{1 - 1} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Solar Day} = \\frac{100}{0} \\]\n\nThis calculation results in an undefined value because the denominator becomes zero. This indicates that Planet X is tidally locked, meaning it always keeps the same face towards its sun, and thus there is no distinct solar day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. There is no solar day; Planet X is tidally locked."
