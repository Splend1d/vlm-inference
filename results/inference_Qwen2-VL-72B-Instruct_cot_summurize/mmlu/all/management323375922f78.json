Business continuity planning typically includes elements such as contingency planning, scenario planning, and financial planning to ensure that a business can continue operations during and after a disaster or major disruption. Building planning, on the other hand, generally refers to the process of designing and constructing physical structures and is not directly related to business continuity strategies."
