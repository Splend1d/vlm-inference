They are variable stars whose brightness changes periodically due to their pulsation.\n\nB. **To measure galactic distances.**\n   - Cepheid stars are used as standard candles in astronomy because there is a known relationship between their intrinsic brightness and the period of their pulsation. This relationship allows astronomers to calculate their distance by comparing their observed brightness with their known intrinsic brightness. Therefore, they are crucial for measuring galactic distances.\n\nC. **To measure galactic energy-density.**\n   - While Cepheid stars can provide information about the energy output of galaxies indirectly through their luminosity, they are not primarily used for measuring galactic energy-density.\n\nD. **To measure interstellar density.**\n   - Cepheid stars do not directly measure interstellar density. Their primary use is related to their periodic variability and luminosity.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. To measure galactic distances.**"
