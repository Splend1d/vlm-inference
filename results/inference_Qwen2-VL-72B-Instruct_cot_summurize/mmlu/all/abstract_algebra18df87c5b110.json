Formally, \\( \\ker(f) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid f(g) = e_H \\} \\), where \\( e_H \\) is the identity element in \\( H \\).\n\nFor a homomorphism \\( f \\) to be one-to-one (injective):\n- It must satisfy \\( f(a) = f(b) \\implies a = b \\) for all \\( a, b \\in G \\).\n- This implies that if \\( f(a) = e_H \\), then \\( a \\) must be the identity element in \\( G \\), i.e., \\( a = e_G \\).\n\nTherefore, the kernel of \\( f \\) being just the identity element (\\( \\ker(f) = \\{e_G\\} \\)) is equivalent to \\( f \\) being injective.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Image of a Group under a Homomorphism**: The set of all elements in \\( H \\) that are images of elements in \\( G \\) under the homomorphism \\( f \\). Formally, \\( \\text{Im}(f) = \\{ h \\in H \\mid \\exists g \\in G \\text{ such that } f(g) = h \\} \\).\n\nFor a group \\( G \\) with 6 elements, consider a homomorphism \\( f: G \\to H \\). The image of \\( G \\) under \\( f \\) can have fewer elements than \\( G \\) because multiple elements in \\( G \\) might map to the same element in \\( H \\).\n\nHowever, the number of elements in the image must divide the order of the original group due to Lagrange's theorem applied to the kernel of the homomorphism. Specifically:\n- If \\( |G| = 6 \\), then the possible orders of the image \\( |\\text{Im}(f)| \\) must divide 6.\n- The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nSince 4 does not divide 6, it is impossible for the image of a group of 6 elements under any homomorphism to have exactly 4 elements.\n\n**Conclusion:** Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
