However, the period during which they began to spread and evolve into the forms we recognize as early humans is generally considered to be between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. This timeframe includes significant developments such as the migration out of Africa, the development of complex tools and technologies, and the eventual emergence of modern human societies."
