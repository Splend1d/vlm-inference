Given that a stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter, we can establish a ratio where each penny contributes \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\) centimeters to the height.\n\nNick's stack has a height of 4 centimeters. To find out how many pennies contribute to this height, we divide the total height by the height contributed by one penny:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{\\text{Total Height}}{\\text{Height per Penny}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{7}}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[n = 4 \\times 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct equation to find the number of pennies, \\(n\\), in Nick\u2019s stack of pennies is:\n\n\\[n = 7 \\times 4\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(n = 7 \\times 4\\)"
