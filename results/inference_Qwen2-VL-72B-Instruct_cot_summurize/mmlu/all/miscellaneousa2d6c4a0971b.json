Therefore, they require more frequent irrigation to ensure the roots have access to adequate moisture. In contrast, heavy-textured soils like silty clay retain water longer and may not need as frequent watering. Dispersed alluvial fan soils can vary widely in texture and drainage properties, so the appropriateness of moderate and frequent irrigation would depend on the specific characteristics of that soil. The humidity level of the region (option D) also affects irrigation needs but does not directly determine the frequency of irrigation based solely on soil type."
