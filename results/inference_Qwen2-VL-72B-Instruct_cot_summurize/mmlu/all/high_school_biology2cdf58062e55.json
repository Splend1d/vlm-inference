All new alleles are the result of nucleotide variability.\n\nThis statement is true because alleles, which are different forms of a gene, arise from variations in the DNA sequence (nucleotides) that make up the gene. Nucleotide variability can lead to changes in the gene's function or expression, resulting in different alleles. The other statements are not universally true:\n\nA. Not all phenotypic variation is due to genotypic variation; environmental factors also play a significant role.\nB. Genetic variation does not always produce phenotypic variation; some genetic changes may be silent or have no observable effect on the phenotype.\nC. Not all nucleotide variability results in neutral variation; some variations can be advantageous or deleterious."
