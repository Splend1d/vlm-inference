The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Begin a trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication\nB. Order CT scan of the head\nC. Order EEG\nD. Refer him for consultation with a neurologist\n"

The presence of blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally suggests possible increased intracranial pressure, which could be caused by a variety of conditions including tumors, hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus. A CT scan can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing the symptoms. It's important to rule out any serious underlying causes before considering other treatment options such as medications or referral to a specialist."
