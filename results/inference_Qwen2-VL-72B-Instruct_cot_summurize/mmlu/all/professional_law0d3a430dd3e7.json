After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n"

No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nIn legal terms, this situation involves the concept of res ipsa loquitur, which is Latin for \"the thing speaks for itself.\" This doctrine allows a plaintiff to infer negligence on the part of the defendant when certain conditions are met: the accident would not normally occur without negligence, the defendant had exclusive control over the instrumentality causing the injury, and the plaintiff did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Given these circumstances, the trial judge would likely allow the case to proceed to the jury, as there is sufficient evidence to suggest negligence on the part of the building owner."
