But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA.

It highlights the opposition to internal taxes imposed by a Parliament in which the colonists had no representation.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Homestead Act of 1862**: This act allowed settlers to acquire ownership of government-owned land in exchange for improving it. It does not relate directly to President Jackson's policies or the context of taxation discussed by Franklin.\n\nB. **Immigration Act of 1921**: This act restricted immigration based on national origins. It is unrelated to President Jackson's policies or the historical context of colonial taxation.\n\nC. **Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson**: This case established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which upheld racial segregation laws. It is unrelated to President Jackson's policies or the context of taxation.\n\nD. **Dawes Act of 1887**: This act aimed to assimilate Native Americans into American society by dividing communal tribal lands into individual plots and encouraging agriculture. It is related to President Jackson's Indian Removal Policy, which sought to relocate Native Americans west of the Mississippi River.\n\nGiven the context and the options, the most relevant answer is:\n\n**D. Dawes Act of 1887**."
