Creating a world military to enforce the ban with greater strength:\n- This option suggests a more aggressive approach to enforcing a ban on genetic engineering. However, it does not address the underlying issue of preventing genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects.\n\nB. Requiring genetic engineering for every newborn child:\n- This option is counterintuitive because it promotes genetic engineering rather than prohibiting it. It does not align with the idea of banning or limiting genetic engineering.\n\nC. Using a lottery system so everyone gets a fair chance at the benefits of genetic engineering:\n- This option aims to distribute the benefits of genetic engineering fairly among people. It does not suggest a bolder strategy to prohibit genetic engineering beyond eliminating obvious defects.\n\nD. None of the above:\n- This option implies that none of the provided strategies align with what Singer suggests as a \"bolder\" strategy.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis of each option, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. None of the above"
