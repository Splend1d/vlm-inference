Herpes zoster\n\nHerpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, can cause a band-like, burning pain that follows the distribution of a nerve. The pain typically occurs on one side of the body and can extend from the front to the back. Given the patient's age and the description of the pain, herpes zoster is a strong possibility. The other conditions listed (acalculous cholecystitis, chronic relapsing pancreatitis, and diverticulitis of the cecum) would more likely present with abdominal tenderness or other specific symptoms not described here."
