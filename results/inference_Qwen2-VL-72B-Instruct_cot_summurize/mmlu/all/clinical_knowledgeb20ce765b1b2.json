Tension headaches is a common cause of headache\n\nTension headaches are indeed one of the most common types of headaches, characterized by mild to moderate pain that feels like a tight band around the head. They can be caused by stress, muscle tension, or other factors and are not typically indicative of a serious underlying condition.\n\nLet's briefly address the other options:\n\nA. When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis - This statement is incorrect. While meningitis can cause neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity), it is not the only cause. Neck stiffness can also be due to other conditions such as muscle strain or other infections.\n\nB. Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause - This is not necessarily true. While severe headache pain can sometimes indicate a serious condition such as a hemorrhage or aneurysm, it can also be due to less serious causes like migraines or cluster headaches.\n\nC. Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis - This statement is misleading. Temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis) is more commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica and is not specifically linked to rheumatoid arthritis. It is an inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that primarily affects older adults."
