Timolol\n\nTimolol is a beta-blocker commonly used to treat glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure. Beta-blockers can cause bronchoconstriction and exacerbate symptoms of respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is common in long-term smokers. The patient's history of smoking and the onset of increased shortness of breath after starting the medication suggest that timolol may be responsible for her symptoms."
