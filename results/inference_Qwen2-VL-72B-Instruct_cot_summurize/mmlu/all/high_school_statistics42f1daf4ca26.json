To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000.

When you add (or subtract) a constant value to each data point, it shifts the entire distribution but does not change the spread between the data points. Therefore, the standard deviation remains unchanged.\n\nGiven:\n- Original mean = $125,000\n- Original standard deviation = $23,000\n\nAfter raising all appraised house values by $5,000:\n- New mean = $125,000 + $5,000 = $130,000\n- Standard deviation remains the same because adding a constant value does not affect the spread.\n\nThus, the new standard deviation is still $23,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $23,000"
