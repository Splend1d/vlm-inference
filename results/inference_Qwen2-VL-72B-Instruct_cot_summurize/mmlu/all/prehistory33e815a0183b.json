C3 plants, which include many trees and shrubs, dominate cooler and wetter environments, while C4 plants, such as grasses, thrive in warmer and drier conditions. The expansion of grasslands during certain periods in Earth's history led to an increase in the availability of C4 plants.\n\nThis change in vegetation likely influenced the diets of ancient hominids. As grasslands expanded, early humans would have had greater access to foods derived from C4 plants, such as seeds and tubers, and potentially grazers that fed on these plants. This dietary shift could have been a factor in the evolution of early human digestive systems and foraging behaviors."
