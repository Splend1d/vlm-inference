By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably\n\nA. recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.\nB. recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.\nC. not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\nD. not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n"

The original lease between the landlord and the friend (the lessee) included a covenant that the lessee would pay the taxes on the premises. When the friend assigned the lease to the professor, the professor agreed to pay the monthly rental of $300 but did not explicitly agree to pay the taxes. Since the assignment was silent on the matter of tax payment, the professor is not bound to pay the taxes unless there is an express agreement to do so.\n\nThe professor then subleased the third floor to the student. The sublease agreement between the professor and the student is separate from the original lease between the landlord and the friend. The student's obligation is to pay the professor $100 per month, not to pay any additional rent to the new owner.\n\nTherefore, if the student defaults on his payments to the professor, the professor remains liable to the new owner for the full amount of rent due under the original lease. The new owner must seek the remaining $100 from the professor, not the student."
