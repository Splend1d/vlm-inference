The factor group (or quotient group) of a non-Abelian group can be Abelian. For example, consider the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\), which is non-Abelian. The center of \\( S_3 \\) is trivial, so the quotient group \\( S_3 / Z(S_3) \\) is isomorphic to \\( S_3 \\) itself, which is non-Abelian. However, if we take a different normal subgroup, such as \\( A_3 \\) (the alternating group on three letters), then \\( S_3 / A_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), which is Abelian. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\n### Statement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also false. For K to be a normal subgroup of G, it must commute with all elements of G. Just because K is normal in H and H is normal in G does not imply that K is normal in G. A counterexample can be constructed using the following groups:\n- Let \\( G = S_4 \\) (the symmetric group on four letters).\n- Let \\( H = A_4 \\) (the alternating group on four letters, which is a normal subgroup of \\( S_4 \\)).\n- Let \\( K \\) be a Klein four-group within \\( A_4 \\).\n\nHere, \\( K \\) is normal in \\( H \\) (since \\( A_4 \\) has only two subgroups of order 4, both of which are normal), and \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\). However, \\( K \\) is not normal in \\( G \\) because conjugation by an odd permutation in \\( S_4 \\) will move elements of \\( K \\) outside of \\( K \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
