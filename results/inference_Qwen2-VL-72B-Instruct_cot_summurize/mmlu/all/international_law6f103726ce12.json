The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor\n\nProportionality in international law, particularly in the context of self-defense, refers to the principle that the measures taken by a state in response to an armed attack must be proportional to the threat posed. This means that the responding state should use only the amount of force necessary to repel the attack and defend itself, without resorting to excessive or disproportionate actions."
