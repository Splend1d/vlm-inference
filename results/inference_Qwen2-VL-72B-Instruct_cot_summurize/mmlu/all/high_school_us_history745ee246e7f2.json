The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nThe scenario described in the passage above is most directly reflected in the ideas of which of the following?\n\nA. Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nB. Equal Rights Amendment.\nC. Pure Food and Drug Act.\nD. Interstate Commerce Act.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which option best reflects the scenario described in the passage, let's analyze the context and core of the passage:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage discusses how economic necessity has forced women to enter the workforce, leading to significant social changes such as women eating in public without male escorts.\n\n2. **Core Question**: Which of the options most directly relates to the described social change driven by economic necessity?\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Civil Rights Act of 1964**: This act primarily addresses racial discrimination and does not specifically focus on gender roles or women entering the workforce due to economic necessity.\n\nB. **Equal Rights Amendment**: This amendment aims to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. While it is related to gender equality, it does not directly address the historical context of women entering the workforce due to economic necessity.\n\nC. **Pure Food and Drug Act**: This act regulates the manufacturing and sale of food and drugs, ensuring their safety and quality. It does not relate to women's roles in society or economic necessity.\n\nD. **Interstate Commerce Act**: This act regulates trade across state lines but does not directly address social changes related to women\u2019s roles in society or economic necessity.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of these options perfectly align with the specific historical context described in the passage. However, if we consider the broader theme of social change driven by economic factors, the closest fit would be an option that deals with women's rights and societal roles.\n\nSince the passage emphasizes the impact of economic necessity on women's roles in society, the best reflection of this scenario among the provided options is:\n\n**B. Equal Rights Amendment**\n\nWhile the Equal Rights Amendment was proposed much later (in 1972), its aim to ensure equal rights for all citizens regardless of sex aligns with the broader theme of women's changing roles in society due to economic factors. Therefore, the closest match to the described scenario is the Equal Rights Amendment."
