And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the likely cause of women not wearing the veil in Mali as described by Ibn Battuta, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.**\n   - There is no indication in the passage that the women were rebelling against oppression. The text describes their behavior without suggesting any form of protest or rebellion.\n\nB. **It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.**\n   - This option suggests that the practice of not veiling women was part of a long-standing cultural tradition. The passage does not provide direct evidence of this, but it does describe the behavior without implying it is new or unusual, which could imply a cultural continuity.\n\nC. **As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.**\n   - The passage does not suggest that women were treated as sexual objects or that they were prevented from veiling themselves for such reasons. Instead, it mentions that there is no sexual jealousy among men and that women do not veil themselves despite their religious practices.\n\nD. **The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.**\n   - While the climate might influence clothing choices, the passage does not mention the climate as a reason for not veiling. It focuses more on social and cultural aspects rather than environmental conditions.\n\nGiven the context provided by the passage, the most plausible explanation is:\n\n**B. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the lack of any indication of rebellion or oppression and the absence of environmental factors being mentioned. The description suggests that the behavior is part of the established customs of the society."
