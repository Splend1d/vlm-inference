It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\nC. Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\nD.

A margin of error of 3% means that if the survey were repeated many times, we would expect the results to vary within plus or minus 3% of the reported percentage most of the time.\n\nSo, if the survey found that 82% of the population uses grocery coupons with a margin of error of 3%, it suggests that the actual percentage of the population that uses grocery coupons could reasonably be anywhere from 79% to 85%."
