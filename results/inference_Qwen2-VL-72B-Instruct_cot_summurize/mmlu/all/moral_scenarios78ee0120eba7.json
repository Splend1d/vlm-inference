It could be considered a minor lapse in generosity rather than a morally wrong act.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character is a landlord.\n- The landlord has elderly tenants who are feeble.\n- The landlord wants to replace these tenants with new ones.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Evicting elderly and feeble tenants purely for the purpose of replacing them with new tenants can be seen as exploitative and lacking empathy. This action could be considered morally wrong as it disregards the well-being and security of vulnerable individuals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
