A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\n\nThis means that when assessing whether someone has acted reasonably, their actions are compared to those of a hypothetical reasonable person who also has the same physical disability. This approach takes into account the limitations imposed by the disability and evaluates behavior accordingly. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the reasonable person standard does not vary from person to person; it is an objective standard applied uniformly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's behavior rather than their subjective mental state.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the reasonable person standard generally does not make allowances for mental disabilities in the same way it does for physical disabilities. Instead, it typically holds individuals to the standard of a reasonable person without such a disability, unless there are specific legal doctrines or exceptions that apply."
