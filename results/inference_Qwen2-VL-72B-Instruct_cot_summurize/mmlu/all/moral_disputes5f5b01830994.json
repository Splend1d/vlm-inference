Hedonism typically refers to the pursuit of pleasure as the highest good, and it is not usually discussed in terms of rules.\n\nC. **Rule utilitarianism**: This is a form of utilitarianism that emphasizes following general rules that maximize overall happiness or utility. It is less likely to justify terrorism in extreme cases because it adheres to general rules rather than specific situations.\n\nD. **Act utilitarianism**: This is a form of utilitarianism that evaluates the morality of actions based on their consequences in individual instances. It considers the greatest good for the greatest number in each specific situation.\n\nGiven that Dershowitz is discussing justifying terrorism in \"certain extreme particular cases,\" it implies an evaluation of the consequences in those specific situations. Therefore, the most fitting answer would be:\n\n**D. Act utilitarianism**"
