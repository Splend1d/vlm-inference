Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

Truman's statement:\n\n1. **Context**: The quote is from 1947, shortly after World War II, during a period when the United States was transitioning into a global superpower and grappling with its role in international affairs.\n\n2. **Content Analysis**:\n   - The passage discusses the conditions under which totalitarian regimes thrive: \"misery and want,\" \"poverty and strife,\" and the \"death of hope for a better life.\"\n   - It emphasizes the importance of keeping hope alive and facing responsibilities squarely, suggesting a proactive stance on preventing the spread of totalitarianism.\n   - The mention of \"Congress\" indicates a call for legislative action or support.\n\nGiven this analysis, the passage is most closely related to debates about the role of the United States in world affairs. This is because it addresses the broader implications of global conditions and the need for the United States to take responsibility in preventing the spread of totalitarian regimes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Debates about the role of the United States in world affairs."
