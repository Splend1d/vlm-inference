One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a contract has been negotiated and agreed upon between a purchasing agent for a women's clothing store and a dressmaking company. The dressmaking company later claims that there was an error in calculating the contract price and demands an additional $15,000 for the delivery of the garments.\n\nTo determine the most accurate statement regarding the enforceability of the contract, we need to consider the principles of contract law, particularly those related to mistakes and mutual assent.\n\n**Option A:** \"There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\"\n\nThis option suggests that the mistake was merely computational and therefore does not affect the enforceability of the contract. However, the fact that the purchasing agent knew or should have known about the error complicates this analysis.\n\n**Option B:** \"There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\"\n\nThis option implies that since the mistake was on one side (the dressmaking company), it does not invalidate the contract. However, if the purchasing agent knew about the error, this could impact the enforceability due to the lack of good faith.\n\n**Option C:** \"There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\"\n\nMutuality of assent means both parties must agree to the same terms. If the purchasing agent knew the price was incorrect and still agreed to the contract, there might be an argument that there was no genuine meeting of the minds, thus invalidating the contract.\n\n**Option D:** \"There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\"\n\nThis option indicates that the contract can be voided by the party who made the mistake (the dressmaking company) because the other party (the purchasing agent) should have known about the error. This aligns with the principle that if one party knows or should know of the other party's mistake, the contract may be voidable by the mistaken party.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Option D** is the most accurate statement. It acknowledges that while a contract was formed, its enforceability is contingent upon the circumstances surrounding the error and the knowledge of the purchasing agent.\n\nFinal answer: **D. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.**"
