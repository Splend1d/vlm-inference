The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus\n\nAttentional load theory, proposed by Lavie in 1995, suggests that the processing of unattended stimuli is influenced by the cognitive load of the attended task. When the attended task requires high levels of cognitive resources (high load), there is less capacity to process unattended information. Conversely, when the attended task requires fewer cognitive resources (low load), more unattended information can be processed. This theory emphasizes the role of attentional resources and how they are allocated between attended and unattended stimuli based on the demands of the attended task."
