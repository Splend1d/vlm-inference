This period of severe famine has been extensively studied for its long-term health impacts on individuals exposed in utero.\n\nResearch indicates that exposure to famine during different trimesters of pregnancy can have varying effects on the developing fetus. Specifically, studies have shown that exposure during the second trimester is particularly critical for epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation patterns.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Second trimester of pregnancy."
