In this context, he suggests that when faced with a choice between saving someone else's life (X) or preserving part of one's own body (Y), one should prioritize their own well-being.\n\n2. **Option A: Y is obligated to choose saving the life of X**:\n   - This option implies that Y, whose arm is at stake, has an obligation to sacrifice their own arm to save X's life. However, according to Taurek's egoistic perspective, Y would prioritize their own well-being over X's life.\n\n3. **Option B: We are obligated to choose saving the life of X**:\n   - This option suggests that from an external perspective, we have an obligation to prioritize saving X's life over Y's arm. However, Taurek's egoistic stance would argue against this, as it would not align with prioritizing one's own interests.\n\n4. **Option C: Both A and B**:\n   - This option combines both perspectives, which is contradictory given Taurek's egoistic viewpoint.\n\n5. **Option D: Neither A nor B**:\n   - This option aligns with Taurek's egoistic perspective, suggesting that neither Y nor anyone else is obligated to prioritize X's life over Y's arm.\n\nGiven Taurek's egoistic stance, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Neither a nor b.**"
