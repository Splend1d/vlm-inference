In the experiment, participants were instructed to administer what they believed were painful electric shocks to another person (the \"learner\") as punishment for incorrect answers in a memory test. The \"teacher\" (participant) was under the influence of an authority figure (the experimenter), who gave explicit orders to continue administering the shocks despite the learner's pleas to stop. This experiment highlighted how individuals can be influenced to perform actions they might otherwise consider unethical or harmful, simply because they are obeying an authority figure. Therefore, the type of social influence represented by the Milgram effect is obedience."
