These viruses can cause diseases in humans and animals. While genetic recombination or reassortment can occur among some members of this family, it is not a defining characteristic of all Bunyaviruses. The amplification through persistent infection of vectors like mosquitoes and ticks is a key feature, but the primary mode of transmission to humans is through the bite of an infected arthropod vector."
