                    "text": "To determine the most accurate statement based on archaeological evidence regarding civilization in general, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The occurrence of warfare decreases as people increasingly invest time in the production of art.**\n   - This statement suggests a direct correlation between artistic production and a decrease in warfare. While some civilizations may have periods where art flourished alongside peace, there is no universal archaeological evidence to support that increased artistic activity necessarily leads to decreased warfare.\n\nB. **The occurrence of warfare is uncommon and occurs only with the concentration of wealth.**\n   - Archaeological evidence indicates that warfare has been a common feature throughout human history, not just associated with wealth concentration. Warfare can occur for various reasons including territorial disputes, resource control, and ideological conflicts.\n\nC. **The concentration of wealth is a common feature.**\n   - Archaeological evidence supports this statement. Many ancient civilizations show signs of wealth concentration through monumental architecture, elaborate tombs, and the presence of luxury goods. This concentration often correlates with social hierarchies and elite classes.\n\nD. **The concentration of wealth is uncommon and occurs only occasionally.**\n   - This contradicts much of the archaeological evidence. Wealth concentration is a recurring theme in many civilizations, indicating it is more common than occasional.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate statement based on archaeological evidence is:\n\n**C. The concentration of wealth is a common feature.**"
