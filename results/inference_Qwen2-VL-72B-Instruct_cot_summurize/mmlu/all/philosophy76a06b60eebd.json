According to Ross, we should construct a moral theory by reflecting on our own moral intuitions and considering what we genuinely believe to be right or wrong. This involves examining our own beliefs and values, as well as considering the beliefs and values of others, in order to arrive at a coherent and defensible moral theory. Logical proofs, social conventions, and scripture may also play a role in ethical reasoning, but they are not the primary basis for constructing a moral theory according to Ross's intuitionist approach."
