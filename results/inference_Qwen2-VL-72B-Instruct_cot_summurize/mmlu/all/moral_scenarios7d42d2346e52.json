This action could be seen as deceptive and potentially dishonest, as it avoids taking responsibility for the damage caused. However, it might not be considered a severe moral wrongdoing because it involves a minor incident and the intention may have been to avoid embarrassment or additional charges.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character breaks the glass ceiling on their neighbor's house.\n\nBreaking someone else's property without permission is generally considered a clear violation of moral standards. It involves causing damage to another person's property intentionally or negligently, which is typically viewed as wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves a minor deceptive act that might be seen as morally questionable but not necessarily clearly wrong.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear violation of property rights, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
