The world was divided into several rival overseas empires: Imperialism led to competition for colonies and resources, which often resulted in conflicts and wars.\n\nB. Industrialization provided better transport, technology, and administration: The Industrial Revolution brought about advancements in transportation (e.g., railways), communication (e.g., telegraph), and weaponry, making it easier to mobilize armies and conduct warfare on a larger scale.\n\nC. There was intense economic, political, and military competition: The scramble for power, resources, and influence among European nations created a tense international environment where conflicts were more likely to escalate into wars.\n\nAll these factors contributed to the increased likelihood and scale of wars between nation-states during the nineteenth century."
