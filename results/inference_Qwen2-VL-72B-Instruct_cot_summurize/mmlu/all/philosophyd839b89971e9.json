People in the state of nature might find it difficult to secure their freedoms and possessions due to the lack of a common authority to enforce agreements and resolve disputes. Therefore, according to Locke, individuals would agree to form a civil society or state, where they would give up some of their absolute freedom to a government in exchange for protection of their rights and properties. This transition from the state of nature to civil society is based on the social contract theory, which posits that people consent to be governed in order to live more securely and peacefully."
