                    "text": "To determine which political position from the twentieth century aligns with the sentiment expressed in the veto message, let's analyze the context and core of the message:\n\n- The veto message criticizes the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual (the commanding officer), likening it to \"absolute monarchy\" and suggesting it leads to \"abject and degrading slavery.\"\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. **Justice Frank Murphy's dissent in the Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. United States in 1944**: This case involved the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Murphy's dissent argued against the constitutionality of such actions, emphasizing civil liberties and the dangers of unchecked government power.\n\nB. **U.S. Army lawyer Joseph Welsh's opposition to Senator Joseph McCarthy in the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954**: Welsh opposed McCarthy's tactics and methods, which were seen as a form of unchecked power and abuse of authority during the Red Scare.\n\nC. **Governor Orval Faubus's response to the steps taken by President Dwight Eisenhower to resolve the Little Rock crisis in 1957**: Faubus resisted federal efforts to integrate schools, invoking states' rights and opposing federal intervention.\n\nD. **John Lewis's endorsement of the Voting Rights Act in 1965**: Lewis supported the act, which aimed to protect voting rights for African Americans, advocating for equal rights and justice.\n\nGiven the veto message's emphasis on the dangers of concentrated power and its comparison to \"abject and degrading slavery,\" the closest parallel is likely to be found in situations where individuals or groups have opposed the abuse of power and advocated for civil liberties and constitutional rights.\n\n**Option A** (Justice Frank Murphy's dissent) fits well because it involves a critique of government overreach and the protection of individual freedoms, similar to the concerns raised in the veto message.\n\nTherefore, the political sentiment of the veto message is most similar to **Justice Frank Murphy's dissent in the Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. United States in 1944**."
