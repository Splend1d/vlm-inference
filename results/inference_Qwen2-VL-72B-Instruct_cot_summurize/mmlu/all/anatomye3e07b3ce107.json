This synchondrosis primarily affects the neurocranium (the braincase).\n\nC. **ceases activity at 7 years of age.**\n   - The spheno-occipital synchondrosis typically fuses between the ages of 18 and 25, not at 7 years of age.\n\nD. **can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly.**\n   - Acromegaly, caused by excess growth hormone, can lead to reactivation of growth centers including the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, resulting in continued growth and changes in skull structure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly.**"
