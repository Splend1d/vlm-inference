The firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits.\n\nIn the short run, a perfectly competitive firm can experience different profit outcomes depending on market conditions and its own costs. It can earn positive economic profit if the market price is above its average total cost, it can earn normal profit if the price equals its average total cost, or it can incur losses (negative economic profit) if the price is below its average total cost but above its average variable cost, leading it to continue operating to cover some of its fixed costs. If the price falls below its average variable cost, the firm would shut down to minimize losses."
