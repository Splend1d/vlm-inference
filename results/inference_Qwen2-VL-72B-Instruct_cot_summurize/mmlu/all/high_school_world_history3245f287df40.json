And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nThe inclusion of the author's pending litigation with the British government serves to do which of the following?\n\nA.

Place blame on both his home country as well as the Zulus\n\nThe author mentions his pending litigation with the British government to highlight the impact of the Anglo-Zulu War on his property and livelihood. By doing so, he places blame on both the British government for not providing adequate protection or compensation and the Zulus for causing the destruction. This dual focus underscores the broader implications of the conflict on individuals caught in the middle."
