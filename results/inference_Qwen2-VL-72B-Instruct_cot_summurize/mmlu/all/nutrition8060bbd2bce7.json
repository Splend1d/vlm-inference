All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids\n\nThis statement is correct because while many plant-based proteins do contain all essential amino acids, they often have lower amounts of certain amino acids compared to animal-based proteins. This means that combining different plant protein sources can help ensure an adequate intake of all essential amino acids."
