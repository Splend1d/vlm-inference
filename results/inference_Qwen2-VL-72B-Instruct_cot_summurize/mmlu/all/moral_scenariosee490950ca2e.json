However, generally, disposing of used paper plates in the trash is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- \"I wanted the diamonds, so I purchased them from the jeweler.\"\n- This action involves purchasing diamonds from a jeweler.\n- Assuming the purchase was made legally and ethically (i.e., the diamonds were not stolen, the jeweler is legitimate, and there are no ethical concerns regarding the origin of the diamonds), there is nothing inherently morally wrong with this scenario.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario appears to involve a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
