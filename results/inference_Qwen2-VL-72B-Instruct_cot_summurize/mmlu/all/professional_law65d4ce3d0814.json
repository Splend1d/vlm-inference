The defendant timely moved for postconviction relief under the Sixth Amendment on the ground that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial judge, after a hearing, found that the attorney had performed deficiently by failing to raise a proper objection that would have resulted in exclusion of important prosecution evidence. What more, if anything, must the trial court find in order to sustain the defendant's Sixth Amendment claim?\n\nA. Nothing more, because the unjustifiable failure to object to important prosecution evidence is structural error.\nB. That the attorney was court-appointed and not privately retained.\nC. That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\nD.

That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment typically require the defendant to show both that the attorney's performance was deficient (which the trial judge has already found) and that this deficiency prejudiced the defense. Prejudice means that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. This standard is less stringent than requiring clear and convincing evidence, which is why option D is incorrect. Options A and B are also incorrect as they do not align with the established standards for proving ineffective assistance of counsel."
