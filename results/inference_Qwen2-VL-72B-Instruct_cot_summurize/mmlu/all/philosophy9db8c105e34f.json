His arguments often emphasize that we have a moral duty to help those in need, which can involve substantial changes in personal behavior and societal structures.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole.\n- This option suggests minimal personal adjustments without broader societal changes. Singer's philosophy typically demands more than just minor personal changes.\n\nB. Modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society.\n- This option implies some level of change in both personal habits and society, but it specifies \"modest\" changes. Singer's ideas often call for more significant transformations.\n\nC. Drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society.\n- This option suggests major personal changes without societal changes. Singer's work often emphasizes systemic changes as well as individual actions.\n\nD. Drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.\n- This option aligns closely with Singer's philosophy, which advocates for significant shifts in both personal behavior and societal structures to address issues like global poverty and animal welfare effectively.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate reflection of Singer's principle of compliance would be:\n\n**D. Drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.**"
