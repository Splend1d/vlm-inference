Stratified sample\n\nIn this scenario, it's important to ensure that the sample reflects the diversity of the student population across different communities (urban, suburban, and rural) as well as different academic tracks (honors, regular, and below-grade). A stratified sample would be most appropriate because it allows for the division of the population into distinct subgroups (strata) based on these characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This ensures that all segments of the population are represented proportionally in the study, providing a more accurate reflection of the overall attitudes toward tracking."
