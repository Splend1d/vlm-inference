It would oscillate back and forth from one opening to the other indefinitely.\n\nHere's why: \n\nIf you drop an object into a hole that goes straight through the center of the Earth, it will experience gravitational force pulling it towards the center. As it passes the center, it will start moving away from the center due to inertia. Once it reaches the other side, gravity will pull it back towards the center again. This process will repeat itself, causing the object to oscillate back and forth between the two ends of the tunnel. Assuming no friction or air resistance, this oscillation would continue indefinitely."
