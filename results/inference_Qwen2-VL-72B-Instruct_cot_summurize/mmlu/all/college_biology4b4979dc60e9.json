FAPs are innate and do not require prior experience or learning to occur. They are often associated with critical periods in an animal's development when exposure to certain stimuli can have long-lasting effects on behavior.\n\nGiven these characteristics, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life\" - This statement is incorrect because FAPs are innate behaviors that occur upon first exposure to the correct stimulus, not necessarily the second time.\n\nB. \"occurs in the absence of sensory feedback\" - This statement is also incorrect because FAPs are typically triggered by specific sensory stimuli.\n\nC. \"is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously\" - This statement is incorrect because FAPs are usually carried out to completion once initiated, rather than being terminated spontaneously.\n\nD. \"is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment\" - This statement is correct because FAPs are indeed triggered by specific sensory signals in the animal's environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
