Earth is a few thousand years old, and populations are unchanging.\n\nThis belief was largely based on literal interpretations of religious texts, particularly the Bible, which suggested a young Earth and static species. Charles Lyell's work in geology introduced the concept of uniformitarianism, suggesting that the Earth was much older than previously thought, and Charles Darwin's theory of evolution proposed that species change over time through natural selection."
