That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the man's strongest argument against the formation of an enforceable contract, we need to analyze the elements of contract law, specifically focusing on the offer, acceptance, and revocation.\n\n1. **Offer**: The man made an offer to the mechanic on February 1, stating specific terms for the repair work.\n2. **Acceptance**: Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror in a manner prescribed or implied by the offer. If no method is specified, any reasonable means can be used.\n3. **Revocation**: An offer can be revoked before it is accepted, but once accepted, the offer becomes a binding contract.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.**\n- This statement is true but irrelevant to whether a contract was formed. Performance is not required for acceptance; acceptance itself forms the contract.\n\n**B. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.**\n- There is no indication in the scenario that the offer required a return promise. The offer was unconditional and did not specify any particular form of acceptance.\n\n**C. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.**\n- This is incorrect. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, an offer can be accepted by any reasonable means, including verbal communication.\n\n**D. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.**\n- This is the most relevant point. For a contract to be formed, there must be an acceptance of the offer. The mechanic's preparation (ordering materials) does not constitute acceptance. Acceptance requires a clear and unequivocal communication of agreement to the terms of the offer. Since the mechanic did not communicate acceptance before the man revoked the offer, no contract was formed.\n\nTherefore, the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties is:\n\n**D. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.**"
