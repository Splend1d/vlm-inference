Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nExplanation:\n- During oxidative phosphorylation, the electron transport chain (ETC) uses the high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient.\n- This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through the enzyme ATP synthase, as protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix.\n- The majority of ATP generated during cellular respiration comes from this process, making oxidative phosphorylation the stage where the most energy is harvested."
