It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the way the options are presented. If we interpret \"Jan\" as a typo for \"in,\" then the correct answer would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the given options correctly represent this fraction. The closest interpretation could be:\n\nA. 6-Jan \u2192 1/6\n\nBut since the options don't clearly represent fractions, it's difficult to give a definitive answer based on the provided choices. If you meant to ask for the probability in a different format or if there's an error in the question, please clarify so I can provide a more accurate response."
