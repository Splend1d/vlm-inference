False, True\n\nL1 regularization tends to make models more sparse by driving many coefficients to zero, whereas L2 regularization tends to shrink the coefficients but does not necessarily drive them to zero. Therefore, the first statement is false.\n\nResidual connections are indeed used in both ResNets (Residual Networks) and Transformers, so the second statement is true."
