Pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a conditioned stimulus\n\nIn classical conditioning, the process begins by pairing a neutral stimulus (which eventually becomes the conditioned stimulus) with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicits a response (the unconditioned response). Through repeated pairings, the neutral stimulus alone comes to elicit a similar response, which is then known as the conditioned response."
