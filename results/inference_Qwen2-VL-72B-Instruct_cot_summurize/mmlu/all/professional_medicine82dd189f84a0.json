Among the chemotherapy agents listed, vincristine (option D) is known for causing peripheral neuropathy as a side effect.\n\nVincristine is a vinca alkaloid that disrupts microtubule function, leading to neurotoxicity. This can manifest as sensory and motor neuropathy, which matches the patient's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the adverse effects described is:\n\nD. Vincristine"
