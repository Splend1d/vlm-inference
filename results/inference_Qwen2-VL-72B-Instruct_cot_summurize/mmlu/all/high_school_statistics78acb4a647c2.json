Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18 points, while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41 points.\nB. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\nC.

The confidence interval (18, 41) refers to the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between Lipitor and niacin, not the absolute values for each treatment.\n\nB. A 95% confidence interval does not imply a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin on any given individual. Instead, it means that if we were to repeat the experiment many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true difference in mean cholesterol level lowering.\n\nC. This statement also misinterprets the confidence interval. It suggests a specific point estimate (at least 23 points), whereas the confidence interval provides a range of plausible differences (18 to 41 points).\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options accurately reflects the information given by the 95% confidence interval."
