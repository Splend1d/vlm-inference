The behavior is learned through direct observation rather than through symbols or cultural practices.\n\nII. **A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent.**\n   - This example involves the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture because it includes learning rules and norms that are part of a cultural practice (playing baseball).\n\nIII. **A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits.**\n   - This example also involves the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Hazing rituals are cultural practices passed down through generations within the organization.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. I only**"
