                    "text": "A department store had suffered a succession of thefts of merchandise over a period of months. From reports by employees and customers, the department store's manager concluded that the losses were due, wholly or in large part, to the depredations of a female shoplifter, aged 30 to 40 years, about 5 feet 5 inches in height, with red hair and green eyes, who usually wore a suit. This information was passed on to all of the employees of the department store. One day, a woman entered the store to purchase accessories. The woman was 5 feet 5 inches tall, 37 years old, red-haired and green-eyed, and dressed in a smartly tailored suit. She carried a large shopping bag. The manager noticed her as she picked up, examined, and put down a number of gloves and scarves. After a while, she looked about tentatively, and then started to walk out, swinging her bag. The manager intercepted her and, standing in front of her, politely asked the woman if she would accompany her to the store manager's office. When the woman asked for an explanation, the manager told her of the store's recent experience and the suspicion that the woman might be concealing pilfered merchandise in her bag. Flushing angrily, the woman replied, \"Very well,\" and followed her to the office. Once there, the manager began to question the woman quite intensively. After the questioning, the manager then asked the woman's permission to inspect the contents of her shopping bag. At first, the woman curtly refused and announced that she had had enough of this nonsense. When she rose to go, the manager told her, \"Listen, unless you let me look inside that bag, I'm going to call the police. \" The woman replied, \"Very well,\" and handed her the bag. The manager inspected the contents of the bag thoroughly but did not find any pilfered merchandise. She then gave the woman permission to leave. The total length of the woman's detention was 30 minutes. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the department store, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because she was detained for an unreasonably long period of time.\nB. prevail, because the manager did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nC. not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nD. not prevail, because the manager gave the woman permission to leave after conducting her investigation.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the woman will most likely prevail in a claim for false imprisonment against the department store, we need to analyze the elements of false imprisonment and the specific circumstances described.\n\nFalse imprisonment is a tort that occurs when one person intentionally restrains another without lawful justification. Key factors include:\n\n1. **Intentional Detention**: The manager intentionally detained the woman by intercepting her and asking her to accompany her to the office.\n2. **Lack of Lawful Justification**: The manager must have had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft to justify the detention.\n\nGiven the details provided:\n- The manager had received reports indicating a specific profile of a suspected shoplifter.\n- The woman matched the description of the suspected shoplifter.\n- The manager observed the woman examining items and then leaving the store, which could be seen as suspicious behavior.\n\nHowever, the manager did not find any stolen merchandise in the woman's bag after inspecting it. This suggests that the manager's suspicion may not have been substantiated by evidence of theft.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**B. prevail, because the manager did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.**\n\nWhile the manager had some basis for suspicion based on the matching description and behavior, the lack of actual evidence of theft (i.e., no stolen merchandise found) weakens the case for reasonable grounds. Therefore, the woman is more likely to prevail in a claim for false imprisonment."
