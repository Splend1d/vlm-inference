All of these options.\n\nEach of the provided options presents a significant obstacle to developing robust IT security in the context of commerce and marketing:\n\nA. **There is no direct return on investment in building security systems.** This perception can lead companies to underinvest in security measures because the benefits are not immediately tangible or quantifiable in terms of revenue generation.\n\nB. **Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.** Enhanced security measures often come with trade-offs that affect user experience, such as increased complexity, slower performance, or additional steps required for authentication.\n\nC. **There is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.** The urgency to launch products quickly can lead to shortcuts in security protocols, prioritizing speed over thorough security testing and implementation.\n\nTherefore, all three factors contribute to the challenges faced in developing effective IT security solutions within the commercial and marketing sectors."
