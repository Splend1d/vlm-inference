The absolute threshold is the minimum intensity level at which a stimulus (in this case, the bell) can be detected.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever.\n- At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever.\n- At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever.\n\nThe number of mice pressing the lever decreases as the power level decreases. The absolute threshold would correspond to the lowest power level where any mouse still detects the sound. Since some mice still detected the sound at 60% power, it indicates that 60% power is below the absolute threshold for all mice but above the absolute threshold for some.\n\nTherefore, the absolute threshold must be lower than 60% power. Given the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not enough information given."
