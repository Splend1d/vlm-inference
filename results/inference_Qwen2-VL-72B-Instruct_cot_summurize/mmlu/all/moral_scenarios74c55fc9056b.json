Not being cited for littering implies that you did the right thing by cleaning up after your pet.\n\nScenario 2: Teaching an 18-year-old son how to drive in a private parking lot is also not morally wrong. It is a common practice for parents or guardians to help young adults learn to drive in a controlled environment before they venture onto public roads."
