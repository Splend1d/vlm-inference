Sales journal to the shipping documents.\n\nWhen an auditor aims to detect the overstatement of sales, they would typically start by tracing transactions from the sales journal to the shipping documents. This process helps verify that recorded sales have corresponding shipping documents, which indicates that the goods were actually shipped and not just recorded as sold without shipment. This approach helps in identifying any potential overstatements or fictitious sales entries."
