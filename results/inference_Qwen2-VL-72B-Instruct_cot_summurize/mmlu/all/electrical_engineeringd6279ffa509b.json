This is because in a parallel configuration, the voltage across each capacitor is the same, but the total charge stored is the sum of the charges on each capacitor.\n\nGiven that each capacitor has a capacitance of 40 \u00b5F and there are four capacitors connected in parallel, the equivalent capacitance \\( C_{eq} \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 \\]\n\nSince all capacitors have the same capacitance (40 \u00b5F):\n\n\\[ C_{eq} = 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F \\]\n\\[ C_{eq} = 4 \\times 40 \\, \\mu F \\]\n\\[ C_{eq} = 160 \\, \\mu F \\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent capacitance of the system is 160 \u00b5F.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 160 \u00b5F."
