This means that states can regulate actions that fall within the scope of the amendment's protections.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A private individual from discriminating against a person based on race.**\n   - The Fourteenth Amendment primarily addresses state action and does not directly regulate private individuals' behavior. However, Congress has used its powers under the amendment to pass laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by private employers.\n\nB. **A private individual from discriminating against a person based on nationality.**\n   - Similar to option A, this involves private conduct rather than state action. While the Fourteenth Amendment itself does not directly address private discrimination, Congress has enacted laws such as the Immigration and Nationality Act to regulate such behavior.\n\nC. **A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.**\n   - This is a clear case where the Fourteenth Amendment applies directly. The amendment prohibits states (and their officials) from denying any person equal protection of the laws. Therefore, a state would be most able to regulate state officials from discriminating against a person based on race under the enabling clause.\n\nD. **A federal official from discriminating against a person based on nationality.**\n   - The Fourteenth Amendment primarily constrains state action, not federal action. Federal officials are subject to other constitutional provisions and federal laws, but the enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not the primary mechanism for regulating federal officials.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.**"
