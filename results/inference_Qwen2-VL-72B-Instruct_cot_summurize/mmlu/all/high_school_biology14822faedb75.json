The flu virus is known for its ability to change its envelope proteins (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase), a process called antigenic drift, which allows it to evade the immune system.\n\nC. **MRSA, which has become resistant to many antibiotics**:\n   - This describes antibiotic resistance, which is a different mechanism from antigenic variation. It involves changes in bacterial genes that confer resistance to antibiotics rather than changes in surface antigens to evade the immune system.\n\nD. **Multiple sclerosis, which attacks the cells of the nervous system**:\n   - This is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own nerve cells. It does not involve antigenic variation in pathogens.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins**"
