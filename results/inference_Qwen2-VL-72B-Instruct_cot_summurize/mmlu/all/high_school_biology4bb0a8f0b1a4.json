HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with the concept of natural selection and the development of drug resistance in viral populations. Initially, there may have been a small number of HIV variants in the patient that had mutations conferring resistance to 3TC. When the drug was administered, it effectively targeted and reduced the population of viruses that were sensitive to the drug. However, the resistant variants continued to replicate and eventually became the dominant strain due to the selective pressure exerted by the drug. This process is a common mechanism by which viruses develop resistance to antiretroviral therapies."
