Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC.

While some empires did encourage cultural assimilation, it wasn't a universal trait across all classical empires.\n\nB. **They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.**\n   - This implies that classical empires supported various religions to gain broader acceptance and loyalty. While some empires did this, it wasn't a common practice across all classical empires.\n\nC. **They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.**\n   - Many classical empires, including the Roman Empire, did undertake extensive public works projects such as roads, aqueducts, and buildings to facilitate trade, communication, and integration within their territories. This is a common trait among classical empires.\n\nD. **They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.**\n   - While some classical empires had merit-based systems, many relied on patronage, family connections, or other non-meritocratic principles. Therefore, this isn't a universal trait.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate and common trait among classical empires is:\n\n**C. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.**"
