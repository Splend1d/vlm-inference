The formula for this model is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the current stock price.\n- \\( D_1 \\) is the expected dividend in the next period.\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return (expected return on equity).\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate of dividends.\n\nGiven values:\n- \\( P = \\$75 \\)\n- \\( D_0 = \\$3 \\) (the most recent dividend)\n- \\( r = 12\\% \\) or 0.12\n\nWe need to find \\( g \\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate \\( D_1 \\), which is the dividend expected in the next period. Assuming the dividend grows at a constant rate \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ D_1 = D_0 \\times (1 + g) \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( D_1 \\) into the Gordon Growth Model equation:\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3 \\times (1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( (0.12 - g) \\):\n\n\\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 75g + 3g \\]\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\nSolve for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} \\]\n\\[ g = \\frac{1}{13} \\]\n\\[ g \\approx 0.0769 \\]\n\nConverting to percentage:\n\n\\[ g \\approx 7.69\\% \\]\n\nThe closest option to 7.69% is:\n\nB. 8%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 8%."
