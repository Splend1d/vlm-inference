She suggests that a life devoid of personal interests and pleasures is not a desirable one.\n\n3. **Utilitarianism and Kantianism**:\n   - **Utilitarianism**: This ethical theory emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or utility. However, Wolf argues that the moral saint's life, while maximizing utility for others, neglects the saint's own well-being and happiness.\n   - **Kantianism**: This ethical framework focuses on duty and adherence to moral laws. Wolf suggests that the rigid adherence to duty without room for personal interests makes the life of the moral saint unattractive.\n\nGiven this analysis, Wolf's argument about the unattractiveness of the moral saint applies to both utilitarianism (due to the neglect of personal happiness) and Kantianism (due to the rigid adherence to duty).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. both a and b."
