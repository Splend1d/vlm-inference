This means the slope is \\( \\frac{nR}{P} \\). Since \\( \\frac{nR}{P} \\) is a constant, it is inversely proportional to the pressure \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Y-intercept**: When \\( T = 0 \\), the volume \\( V \\) should also be 0 according to the equation \\( V = \\frac{nR}{P} \\cdot T \\). Therefore, the y-intercept is 0 m\u00b3.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m\u00b3.**"
