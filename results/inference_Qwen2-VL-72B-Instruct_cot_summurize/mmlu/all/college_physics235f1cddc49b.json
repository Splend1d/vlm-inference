This means that the energy differences between any two levels in Li++ will also be 9 times larger than the corresponding energy differences in hydrogen.\n\nSince the wavelength of emitted light is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the levels, the wavelengths in Li++ will be shorter (decreased) compared to hydrogen by a factor of 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. decreased by a factor of 9"
