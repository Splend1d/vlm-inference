Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases\nC. The development of the joint-stock company\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships\n"

The development of the joint-stock company"
