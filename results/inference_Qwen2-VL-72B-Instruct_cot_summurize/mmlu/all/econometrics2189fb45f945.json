(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nWhen Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is applied in the presence of autocorrelation, it can lead to several issues:\n\ni) Coefficient estimates may be misleading: While OLS estimators remain unbiased in the presence of autocorrelation, they are no longer the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). This means that the coefficient estimates might not be as precise as they would be under the assumption of no autocorrelation.\n\nii) Hypothesis tests could reach the wrong conclusions: The standard errors of the coefficient estimates are likely to be underestimated, leading to an overstatement of the precision of the estimates. This can result in hypothesis tests incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis more often than they should (Type I error).\n\niii) Forecasts made from the model could be biased: Autocorrelation implies that there is some systematic pattern in the residuals that is not captured by the model. This can lead to biased forecasts, especially for future time periods.\n\niv) Standard errors may be inappropriate: The presence of autocorrelation typically leads to underestimated standard errors, which can affect the reliability of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n\nTherefore, all of the listed consequences are potential issues when using OLS in the presence of autocorrelation."
