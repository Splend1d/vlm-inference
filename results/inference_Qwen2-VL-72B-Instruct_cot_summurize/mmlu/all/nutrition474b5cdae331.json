Folate deficiency in older people is less prevalent in countries with mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid.\n\nThis statement is correct because mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid has been shown to reduce folate deficiency across populations, including older adults. This public health intervention helps ensure adequate folate intake, which is important for preventing various health issues, especially neural tube defects in newborns and reducing the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases."
