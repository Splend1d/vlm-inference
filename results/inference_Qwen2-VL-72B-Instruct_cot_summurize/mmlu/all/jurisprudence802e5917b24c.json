It aligns with the idea that those involved in perpetuating injustice should step down.\n\nC. **If a moral judge resigns, he or she may be replaced by a less moral judge.**\n   - This statement introduces a potential consequence of resignation: the replacement judge might be less ethical. This could argue against resignation because it might worsen the situation.\n\nD. **Judges do not make the law, hence they cannot be held responsible for applying unjust legislation.**\n   - This statement suggests that judges are merely executors of the law and thus absolves them from responsibility for the unjust nature of the laws themselves. This directly contradicts the argument that judges should resign due to the unjust system, as it implies they have no culpability.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is least consistent with the argument that judges in an unjust legal system ought to resign is:\n\n**D. Judges do not make the law, hence they cannot be held responsible for applying unjust legislation.**"
