                    "text": "To determine the simplest explanation for the inheritance of feather colors in chickens based on the given data, let's analyze the phenotypes and their ratios.\n\nThe parents both have gray feathers, and they produce offspring with three different phenotypes: gray, black, and white. The numbers provided are:\n- Gray: 17\n- Black: 7\n- White: 8\n\nThis gives us a ratio of approximately 2:1:1 (gray:black:white).\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. **The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for black.**\n   - Epistasis occurs when one gene masks the expression of another gene. If gray were epistatic over black, we would expect all offspring to be either gray or black, but not white. This does not fit the observed data.\n\nB. **The trait for gray is epistatic over the trait for white.**\n   - Similarly, if gray were epistatic over white, we would expect all offspring to be either gray or white, but not black. This also does not fit the observed data.\n\nC. **The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.**\n   - Incomplete dominance means that the heterozygous genotype results in an intermediate phenotype. If black and white were incompletely dominant, the gray phenotype could be the result of the heterozygous genotype, while black and white would be the homozygous recessive and dominant phenotypes, respectively. This fits the observed 2:1:1 ratio, where gray (heterozygous) is more frequent than black and white (homozygous).\n\nD. **The traits for black and white color demonstrate codominance.**\n   - Codominance means that both alleles are expressed equally in the heterozygote. This typically results in a phenotype that clearly shows both traits, which is not described here. Additionally, codominance would not explain the observed ratio.\n\nGiven the analysis, the simplest explanation for the inheritance pattern observed is:\n\n**C. The traits for black and white color demonstrate incomplete dominance.**"
