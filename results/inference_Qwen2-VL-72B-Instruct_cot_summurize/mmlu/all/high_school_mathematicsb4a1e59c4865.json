                    "text": "Given that the amount of paint needed to cover a cube is directly proportional to its surface area, we can use this information to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the surface area of the cube with a side length of 2 feet. The surface area \\(A\\) of a cube is given by \\(A = 6s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length of the cube.\n\nFor a cube with a side length of 2 feet:\n\\[A = 6 \\times (2)^2 = 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ square feet}\\]\n\nDavid uses 16 quarts of paint to cover this surface area. Therefore, the rate at which paint covers the surface area is:\n\\[Rate = \\frac{\\text{Paint used}}{\\text{Surface area}} = \\frac{16 \\text{ quarts}}{24 \\text{ square feet}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ quarts per square foot}\\]\n\nNow, if David has 169 quarts of paint, we want to find out how much surface area he can cover with it. Using the rate we found:\n\\[Surface Area = \\frac{\\text{Paint used}}{\\text{Rate}} = \\frac{169 \\text{ quarts}}{\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ quarts per square foot}} = 169 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 253.5 \\text{ square feet}\\]\n\nWe need to find the side length of a cube that has a surface area of 253.5 square feet. We know the formula for the surface area of a cube is \\(A = 6s^2\\). Rearranging this to solve for \\(s\\):\n\\[s^2 = \\frac{A}{6}\\]\n\\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{6}}\\]\n\nSubstituting the surface area we calculated:\n\\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{253.5}{6}} = \\sqrt{42.25} = 6.5 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nHowever, none of the options match 6.5 feet directly. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the options provided. Given the calculation and the options, let's re-evaluate the interpretation:\n\nIf we consider the direct proportionality and the calculation based on the provided options, it appears there was an error in the interpretation of the final step. Let's correct that by directly relating the paint quantity to the cube size without explicitly calculating the intermediate surface area step for clarity:\n\nGiven that 16 quarts of paint cover a cube of side length 2 feet, we can establish a relationship between the paint quantity and the cube's side length. If \\(x\\) is the side length of the cube that can be covered with 169 quarts of paint, then using the direct proportionality:\n\n\\[\\frac{16 \\text{ quarts}}{2 \\text{ feet}} = \\frac{169 \\text{ quarts}}{x \\text{ feet}}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{169 \\times 2}{16} = \\frac{338}{16} = 21.125 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nThis result doesn't align with the provided options, indicating a misunderstanding in the approach to solving the problem based on the given options. Given the direct calculation from the initial setup, the correct approach should focus on establishing the relationship between the paint quantity and the cube's side length directly, without explicitly calculating the surface area as an intermediate step.\n\nRevisiting the direct proportionality approach correctly:\n\nGiven that 16 quarts of paint cover a cube of side length 2 feet, and we're looking for the side length of a cube that can be covered with 169 quarts of paint, we can set up the proportion as follows:\n\n\\[\\frac{16 \\text{ quarts}}{(2 \\text{ feet})^3} = \\frac{169 \\text{ quarts}}{(x \\text{ feet})^3}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[(x)^3 = \\frac{169 \\times (2)^3}{16}\\]\n\n\\[(x)^3 = \\frac{169 \\times 8}{16}\\]\n\n\\[(x)^3 = \\frac{1352}{16}\\]\n\n\\[(x)^3 = 84.5\\]\n\n\\[x = \\sqrt[3]{84.5}\\]\n\n\\[x \u2248 4.4\\]\n\nNone of the provided options (A. \\(\\frac{13}{4}\\), B. 8, C. \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\), D. 13) directly match this calculation. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options provided. Given the direct calculation from the initial setup, the correct approach should focus on establishing the relationship between the paint quantity and the cube's side length directly, without explicitly calculating the surface area as an intermediate step. However, based on the provided options and the calculations, it appears there might have been an error in the interpretation or the options themselves do not directly correspond to the correct calculation method applied."
