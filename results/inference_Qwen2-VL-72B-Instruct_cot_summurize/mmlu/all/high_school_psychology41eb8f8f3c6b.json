It is widely used to map brain function.\n\n3. **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan**: This imaging technique uses radioactive tracers to show how organs and tissues are functioning. It can be used to image brain function by tracking metabolic processes.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- CT scan (I) does not image brain function.\n- fMRI (II) images brain function.\n- PET scan (III) images brain function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III only**"
