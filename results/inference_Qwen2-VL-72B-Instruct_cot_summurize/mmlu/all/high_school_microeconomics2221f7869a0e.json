The demand for labor is derived from the demand for the products produced by labor.\n\nThis means that the demand for labor is not independent but rather depends on the demand for the goods and services that labor helps to produce. When there is higher demand for certain products, businesses may need to hire more workers to meet that demand, thus increasing the demand for labor. Conversely, if demand for products decreases, the demand for labor may also decrease as businesses may not need as many workers."
