The question is asking about Hare's stance on the success of various ways of escaping moral arguments.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. **None of them are successful.** This suggests that Hare believes no methods of escaping moral arguments work at all.\n\nB. **Some, but not all of them are successful.** This implies that Hare acknowledges that certain methods can be effective, while others are not.\n\nC. **All are entirely successful.** This indicates that Hare believes every method of escaping moral arguments works perfectly.\n\nD. **All might be successful, but at a price.** This suggests that while all methods may work, they come with significant drawbacks or consequences.\n\nGiven the nature of philosophical discussions, it is unlikely that Hare would claim that all methods are entirely successful (Option C) without any qualifications. Similarly, claiming that none of them are successful (Option A) seems extreme and unlikely in a nuanced discussion.\n\nThe most reasonable options are B and D. However, Option D provides a more nuanced view by acknowledging potential success but also highlighting the associated costs or drawbacks. This aligns better with typical philosophical analysis where trade-offs are often discussed.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**D. All might be successful, but at a price.**"
