Since Jim and Tim are monozygotic (identical) twins, they share 100% of their genes, making it more likely that their IQ scores will be very similar. On the other hand, Scott and Michael are dizygotic (fraternal) twins, meaning they share only about 50% of their genes on average, similar to any siblings. Therefore, while they may still have similar IQs due to shared environmental factors, it is less likely to be as similar as that of monozygotic twins."
