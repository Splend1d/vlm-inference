The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nThe Lorenz Curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the distribution of income or wealth within a population. It helps to visualize and measure income inequality by plotting the cumulative percentage of the population against the cumulative percentage of income they receive. A perfectly equal distribution would be represented by a straight line, while more unequal distributions would show a curve that deviates further from this line."
