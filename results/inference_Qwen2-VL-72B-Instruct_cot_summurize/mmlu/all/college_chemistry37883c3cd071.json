The \\( 3p \\) orbital is the outermost occupied orbital and therefore the electron in this orbital will be the easiest to remove.\n\nThe orbital angular momentum quantum number \\( l \\) for the \\( p \\) orbital is:\n\\[ l = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the electron that is most easily removed from ground-state aluminum has an orbital angular momentum quantum number \\( l \\) of 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1"
