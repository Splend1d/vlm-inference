There are approximately 30 days in a month.\n2. Each box lasts for 5 days.\n\nFirst, find out how many 5-day periods there are in a month:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ days}}{5 \\text{ days/period}} = 6 \\text{ periods} \\]\n\nSince Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days, and there are 6 such periods in a month, he would use:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ periods} \\times 1 \\text{ box/period} = 6 \\text{ boxes} \\]\n\nTherefore, Rob uses approximately 6 boxes of cat food per month.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6 boxes."
