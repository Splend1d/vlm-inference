Let's analyze each property mentioned:\n\nI. **Soundness**: This means that if a formula is proven unsatisfiable using resolution, then it truly is unsatisfiable. In other words, the resolution method will never incorrectly conclude that a satisfiable formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution theorem proving is indeed sound.\n\nII. **Completeness**: This means that if a formula is unsatisfiable, then there exists a proof using resolution that demonstrates this unsatisfiability. Resolution theorem proving is also known to be complete for propositional logic.\n\nIII. **Succinctness**: This refers to the efficiency of the proof system in terms of the length of the proof relative to the length of the input formula. While resolution is a powerful method, it is not necessarily succinct in the sense that the length of the proof can sometimes grow exponentially with respect to the size of the input formula. Therefore, resolution is not generally considered a succinct proof system.\n\nGiven these analyses, we can conclude that:\n\n- Property I (soundness) holds.\n- Property II (completeness) holds.\n- Property III (succinctness) does not hold.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
