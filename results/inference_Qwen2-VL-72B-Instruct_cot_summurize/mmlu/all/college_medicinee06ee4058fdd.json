They form the spindle apparatus that helps in the separation of chromosomes during these processes. Therefore, if there is an increase in microtubule degradation due to reduced function of MAPs, it would significantly affect meiosis, which relies heavily on the integrity and stability of microtubules for proper chromosome segregation.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not as directly affected by microtubule degradation:\n\nA. **Cardiac muscle contraction** - This process primarily involves the interaction between actin and myosin filaments, not microtubules.\n\nB. **Transcription of mRNA from DNA** - This process occurs within the nucleus and involves RNA polymerase enzymes interacting with DNA, not microtubules.\n\nC. **Krebs cycle** - This metabolic pathway takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and does not involve microtubules."
