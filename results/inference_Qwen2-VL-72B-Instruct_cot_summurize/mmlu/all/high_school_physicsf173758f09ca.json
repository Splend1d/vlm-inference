Velocity has dimensions of length (L) per time (T), so momentum has dimensions of ML/T.\n\nImpulse is the integral of force over time, where force is mass times acceleration. Acceleration has dimensions of L/T^2, so force has dimensions of ML/T^2. Integrating force over time gives us ML/T^2 * T = ML/T.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of impulse are ML/T.\n\nThe correct answer is C. LM/T."
