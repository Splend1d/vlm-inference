During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following in later years would be most likely to see themselves in Logan's position?\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n"

                    "text": "To determine which option best fits Logan's position, we need to analyze the context and core message of Logan's address. Logan expresses deep frustration and anger towards the actions of one man (Colonel Cresap) who caused significant harm to his family and community. Despite his previous peaceful stance and advocacy for peace, Logan felt compelled to seek revenge due to the extreme injustice inflicted upon him.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s:\n- This person would likely focus on issues related to government overreach and individual liberties rather than personal or communal injustices.\n\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s:\n- This person would be concerned about materialism and the negative impacts of mass consumption, which does not align with Logan's personal vendetta against a specific individual.\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s:\n- This person would advocate for social equality, civil rights, and progressive policies, which is more about broader societal change rather than personal revenge.\n\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s:\n- This person would fight for gender equality and women's rights, which is a collective struggle rather than a personal vendetta.\n\nNone of these options perfectly match Logan's situation, but the closest fit would be someone who feels deeply wronged by a specific individual or group and seeks personal justice or revenge. Given this analysis, none of the options provided precisely matches Logan's position, but if forced to choose, the closest might be:\n\n**D. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s**\n\nWhile this option doesn't perfectly align with Logan's personal vendetta, it could represent someone fighting against a specific form of oppression (in this case, gender-based), which is somewhat analogous to Logan's fight against the injustice caused by Colonel Cresap.\n\nFinal answer: D. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s"
