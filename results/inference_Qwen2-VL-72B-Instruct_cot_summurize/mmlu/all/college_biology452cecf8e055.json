Marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine.\n\nMarine birds, such as albatrosses and gulls, have evolved unique adaptations to cope with the high salinity of seawater. They possess specialized salt-exchange glands, often located near the eyes, which help them excrete excess salt. These glands filter out the excess salt from their bloodstream and excrete it through the nostrils as a salty solution. This process allows them to maintain a lower internal osmolarity than the seawater they drink. Additionally, they produce small volumes of highly concentrated urine to further conserve water."
