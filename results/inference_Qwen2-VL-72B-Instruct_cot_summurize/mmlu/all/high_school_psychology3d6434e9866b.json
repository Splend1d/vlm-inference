This means that we may stop noticing certain sensations if they remain consistent. In option C, initially feeling the coldness of the pool but then not noticing it as much after being in the water for a few minutes is a classic example of sensory adaptation. The body adjusts to the temperature and the sensation of cold diminishes."
