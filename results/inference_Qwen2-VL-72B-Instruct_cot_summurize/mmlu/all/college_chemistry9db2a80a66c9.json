                    "text": "To predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide ((CH3)2NO\u2022), we need to consider the hyperfine splitting caused by the interaction between the unpaired electron and the nuclear spins of the atoms in the molecule.\n\nDimethylnitroxide has one unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen nucleus has a spin of 1, which means it can contribute three energy levels (I = 1 gives 2I + 1 = 3).\n\nEach methyl group (CH3) contains three equivalent hydrogen nuclei, each with a spin of 1/2. Therefore, each methyl group contributes 2^n lines, where n is the number of equivalent nuclei. For three hydrogen nuclei, this gives 2^3 = 8 lines per methyl group.\n\nSince there are two equivalent methyl groups, the total contribution from the hydrogen nuclei is 8 lines from one methyl group times 8 lines from the other methyl group, giving 64 lines.\n\nHowever, these lines will be further split by the interaction with the nitrogen nucleus, resulting in a multiplication of the number of lines by the factor from the nitrogen nucleus (3). So, the total number of lines is:\n\n64 lines (from the hydrogens) * 3 lines (from the nitrogen) = 192 lines\n\nBut this calculation assumes that all lines are resolved and do not overlap, which is not realistic for an actual EPR spectrum due to line broadening and instrumental limitations. In practice, the spectrum would show fewer distinct lines.\n\nGiven the options provided and assuming no overlap, the closest answer to our calculated value would be:\n\nD. 24\n\nThis is because the actual spectrum would likely show a much smaller number of resolved lines than the theoretical maximum due to overlap and broadening effects. However, none of the options exactly match the theoretical calculation, so D. 24 is the best approximation among the choices given."
