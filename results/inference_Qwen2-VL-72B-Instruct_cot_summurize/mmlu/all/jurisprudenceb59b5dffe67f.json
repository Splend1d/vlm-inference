That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nJohn Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason primarily on the grounds that he believes human reason can indeed help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life. This contrasts with Hume's view, which suggests that reason alone cannot determine values or what makes life worth living; rather, these are determined by our passions and desires. Finnis argues for a more robust role of reason in ethical decision-making and the determination of the good."
