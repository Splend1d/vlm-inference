Bruce likely participated in more female-typical play than Chuck.\n\nResearch has shown that children who later identify as gay or lesbian may exhibit behaviors that are considered atypical for their gender during childhood, such as engaging in play activities typically associated with the opposite sex. However, it's important to note that this is not always the case and individual experiences can vary widely. Additionally, sexual orientation is not determined by parental characteristics, so option D is not supported by scientific evidence."
