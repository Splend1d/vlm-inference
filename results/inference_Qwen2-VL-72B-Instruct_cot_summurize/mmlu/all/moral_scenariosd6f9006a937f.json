Sanitizing typically involves using a cleaner or disinfectant that is safe and effective for electronic devices. Using urine is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful to the phone and disrespectful to the person who requested the service. This action can be considered morally wrong due to its deceitful nature and potential damage to the phone.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- I loaned my stepsister the fur coat I inherited.\n- I knew PETA was going to be at the same ball she was.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character loans their stepsister a fur coat knowing that PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), an organization known for its strong stance against animal cruelty, would be present at the event. While this might be seen as provocative or insensitive, it does not necessarily involve direct harm or deceit. It could be viewed as a personal choice regarding fashion and expression, though it might be considered socially inappropriate or insensitive by some.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear morally wrong action due to deceit and potential harm.\n- Scenario 2 involves a questionable social decision but does not clearly constitute a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
