                    "text": "To determine how much of the rental losses Smith can deduct, we need to consider the passive activity loss rules and the specific provisions for rental real estate activities.\n\n1. **Passive Activity Loss Rules:**\n   - Generally, passive activity losses cannot be used to offset non-passive income.\n   - However, there is an exception for active participation in rental real estate activities.\n\n2. **Rental Real Estate Activity Exception:**\n   - If an individual actively participates in rental real estate activities, they can deduct up to $25,000 of rental real estate losses against their non-passive income if their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $100,000.\n   - This deduction phases out between $100,000 and $150,000 MAGI, reducing by $1 for every $2 of MAGI over $100,000.\n   - Above $150,000 MAGI, no rental real estate loss deduction is allowed.\n\n3. **Smith's Situation:**\n   - Smith's AGI is $120,000.\n   - Smith has $40,000 in rental real estate losses.\n   - Smith actively participates in the rental real estate activities.\n\nGiven Smith's MAGI of $120,000:\n- The $25,000 deduction starts phasing out at $100,000.\n- For each dollar of MAGI above $100,000, the deduction reduces by 50 cents.\n- Smith's MAGI is $20,000 above $100,000 ($120,000 - $100,000 = $20,000).\n- Therefore, the reduction in the deduction is $10,000 ($20,000 * 0.5).\n\nSo, Smith's allowable deduction is calculated as follows:\n- Initial allowable deduction: $25,000\n- Reduction due to MAGI: $10,000\n- Final allowable deduction: $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000\n\nTherefore, Smith may deduct $15,000 of the rental losses in determining taxable income.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. $15,000"
