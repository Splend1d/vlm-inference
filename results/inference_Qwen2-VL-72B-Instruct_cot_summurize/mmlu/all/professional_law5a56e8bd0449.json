On June 1, 2007, two tenants took possession of a three- bedroom apartment in the landlord's building under a three-year lease at a rental of $1,200 per month. Their lease (as all other leases given by the landlord) contained the following provisions:\"The term of this lease shall be three years from the date hereof as long as all the agreements herein shall be faithfully performed. \"The two tenants lived in the apartment for two years. On June 10, 2009, however, a fire destroyed the apartment building. As a result, all the apartments in the building were rendered uninhabitable. After the two tenants were dispossessed from their apartment, the landlord brought suit against them to recover the rent due for the balance of the lease. The two tenants claim that they are no longer liable for rent or any other obligations under the lease. The landlord \u0080\u0094 tenants leasehold contract contained no provision regarding liability for fire.

                    "text": "To determine why the decision might be in favor of the two tenants, we need to analyze the situation and the relevant legal principles.\n\n1. **Lease Term and Performance**: The lease states that the term is three years as long as all agreements are faithfully performed. This implies that the lease is contingent upon the continued existence of the apartment and its habitability.\n\n2. **Fire Incident**: A fire destroyed the apartment building, rendering all apartments uninhabitable. This event significantly impacts the ability of the tenants to use and occupy the premises as intended under the lease.\n\n3. **Common Law Principles**: Generally, under common law, if the leased premises become uninhabitable due to no fault of the tenant, the tenant may be relieved of their obligation to continue paying rent. This principle is known as the doctrine of frustration of purpose or impossibility of performance.\n\n4. **Contractual Provisions**: Since the lease does not contain specific provisions regarding liability for fire, the common law principles would apply.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **There was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.**\n   - This is true, but it doesn't directly explain why the tenants would be relieved of their obligations. It sets the stage for applying common law principles.\n\nB. **The two tenants did not own an interest in the property.**\n   - This statement is irrelevant to the issue at hand. Tenants typically do not own the property; they have a leasehold interest.\n\nC. **The jurisdiction has rejected the common law view on the tenant's duty to pay rent.**\n   - If this were true, it would mean that tenants are still obligated to pay rent regardless of the condition of the property, which contradicts the tenants' claim.\n\nD. **The landlord did not contract to convey the property to the two tenants.**\n   - This is also irrelevant. The issue is about the leasehold interest and the ability to inhabit the premises, not ownership.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most likely reason the decision would be in favor of the two tenants is because the jurisdiction adheres to common law principles regarding the tenant's duty to pay rent when the premises become uninhabitable through no fault of the tenant. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The jurisdiction has rejected the common law view on the tenant's duty to pay rent.**\n\nHowever, this seems to be a misinterpretation based on the context provided. The correct interpretation should be that the jurisdiction adheres to the common law view, which supports the tenants' position. Thus, the correct answer should actually reflect adherence to common law principles rather than rejection. Given the options provided, the best fit is:\n\n**A. There was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.**\n\nThis option indirectly leads to the application of common law principles, which support the tenants' claim."
