A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll.\n\nHorse-race journalism refers to media coverage that focuses on the competition between candidates or parties, often emphasizing polls and election strategies over substantive policy discussions or issues. This type of journalism tends to treat elections like a sporting event, where the focus is on who is winning or losing rather than on the policies or qualifications of the candidates."
