The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

Since the lease specifies a three-year term, this option does not apply.\n\n- **Option B (Periodic Tenancy from Month-to-Month)**: This type of tenancy renews automatically every month unless terminated by either party. While the lease mentions monthly payments, it also specifies a three-year term, making this option incorrect.\n\n- **Option C (Periodic Tenancy from Year-to-Year)**: This type of tenancy renews automatically every year unless terminated by either party. However, the lease explicitly states a fixed term of three years, so this option is also incorrect.\n\n- **Option D (Tenant's Equitable Three-Year Term Became a Legal Three-Year Term)**: This option correctly reflects that the lease agreement established a fixed term of three years. The tenant has an equitable interest in the property for the duration of the lease, and the landlord has accepted the terms, making it a legally binding agreement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
