During economic expansions, when GDP is rising, tax revenues tend to increase because more people are employed and earning income, leading to higher tax collections. At the same time, government expenditures on certain programs (like unemployment benefits) tend to decrease because fewer people are unemployed and in need of such assistance. Therefore, during economic expansions, government expenditures typically fall while taxes rise due to the operation of automatic stabilizers."
