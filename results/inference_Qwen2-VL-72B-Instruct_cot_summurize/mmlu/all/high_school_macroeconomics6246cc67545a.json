This is because a larger labor force means more people are available to work and produce goods and services, which can lead to increased output and economic growth. A decrease in the unemployment rate may also contribute to economic growth, but it is not as direct a factor as an increase in the size of the labor force. An increase in the unemployment rate or a decrease in the population would generally have a negative impact on economic growth."
