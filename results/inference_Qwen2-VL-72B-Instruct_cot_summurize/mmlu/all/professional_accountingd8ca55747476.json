Obtain an understanding of the client's internal control activities.\n\nBefore the balance sheet date, an auditor would typically obtain an understanding of the client's internal control activities as part of their risk assessment process. This helps the auditor identify areas where there may be a higher risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. Understanding the internal controls allows the auditor to plan their audit approach effectively.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the most likely procedure to perform before the balance sheet date:\n\nA. Confirm with the client's lawyer that all litigation probable of assertion has been disclosed to the auditor - While this is an important task, it is more likely to be performed during the audit rather than before the balance sheet date.\n\nC. Determine whether there are any liens or encumbrances on assets that have been pledged as collateral - This is a specific audit procedure that would be performed as part of the substantive testing of assets, which typically occurs after the balance sheet date.\n\nD. Consider the client's plans and ability to meet imminent purchase commitments and cash flow obligations - This is related to going concern considerations, which are assessed throughout the audit process but are particularly relevant at the end of the audit when the auditor is forming an opinion on the financial statements."
