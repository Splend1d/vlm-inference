The molar mass of mercury(II) oxide (HgO) is given as 216 g/mol.\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HgO} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of HgO}}{\\text{Molar Mass of HgO}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HgO} = \\frac{4.32 \\text{ g}}{216 \\text{ g/mol}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HgO} = 0.0200 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nAccording to the balanced chemical equation, 2 moles of HgO produce 1 mole of O\u2082. Therefore, the number of moles of oxygen gas produced can be calculated using the stoichiometric ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{\\text{Moles of HgO}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{0.0200 \\text{ mol}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of O}_2 = 0.0100 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.0100 mol"
