This makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially worsening the trade deficit.\n\nD. **A higher rate of inflation relative to other nations**: Higher inflation can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of the domestic currency, making imports more expensive and exports cheaper. This can increase imports and decrease exports, worsening the trade deficit.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that most likely worsens a nation's trade deficit is:\n\n**D. A higher rate of inflation relative to other nations.**"
