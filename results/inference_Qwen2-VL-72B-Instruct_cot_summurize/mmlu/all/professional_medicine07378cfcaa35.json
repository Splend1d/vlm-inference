He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils\nC. Sweat chloride test\nD. Sputum cytology\n"

The physical examination findings of scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi, along with the chest X-ray showing hyperinflation and spirometry results indicating a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, point towards a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis - This would provide information about the patient's oxygenation and acid-base balance but would not confirm the diagnosis of CF.\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils - While this might be useful in diagnosing other conditions like asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, it would not confirm CF.\nC. Sweat chloride test - This is the gold standard diagnostic test for CF. It measures the concentration of chloride ions in sweat, which is typically elevated in patients with CF.\nD. Sputum cytology - This would be used to look for malignant cells or other cellular abnormalities and would not confirm CF.\n\nTherefore, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in this case is:\n\nC.
