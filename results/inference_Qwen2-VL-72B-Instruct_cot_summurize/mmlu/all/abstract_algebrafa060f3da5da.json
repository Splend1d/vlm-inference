In R^2, it is possible to have two vectors that are linearly dependent. For example, if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other (e.g., [1, 0] and [2, 0]), they would be linearly dependent because one can be expressed as a linear combination of the other with non-zero coefficients.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\( V = \\text{span}(v_1, \\ldots, v_k) \\) and \\( \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\) are linearly independent, then \\( \\dim(V) = k \\).\nThis statement is **true**. By definition, if a set of vectors \\( \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\) is linearly independent and spans the vector space \\( V \\), then these vectors form a basis for \\( V \\). The dimension of a vector space is equal to the number of vectors in any basis of that space. Therefore, if \\( \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\) is a basis for \\( V \\), then \\( \\dim(V) = k \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
