Avoid effect of saturation.\n\nWhen operating an AC motor with a variable frequency supply, it is important to adjust the voltage along with the frequency to maintain the proper flux level in the motor. This is because the magnetic flux in the motor is proportional to the ratio of voltage to frequency (V/f). If the voltage is not adjusted accordingly, the motor can become saturated, which can lead to overheating and damage to the motor. Therefore, varying the voltage along with the frequency helps to avoid the effect of saturation and ensures that the motor operates efficiently and safely."
