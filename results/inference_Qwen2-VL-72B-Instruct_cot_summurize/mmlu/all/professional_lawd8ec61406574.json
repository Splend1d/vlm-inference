This includes records or statements made by employees with knowledge, at or near the time of the event recorded, and kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity.\n\n2. **Personal Knowledge**: While the billing clerk may not have personal knowledge of the specific mailing, their testimony about the routine process can be considered reliable because it reflects the standard operating procedure of the company. This routine practice provides a basis for inferring that the notice was mailed as part of this established procedure.\n\n3. **Corroboration**: Although corroboration might strengthen the case, it is not strictly necessary under FRE 803(6). The routine nature of the practice itself serves as sufficient foundation for the admissibility of the testimony.\n\n4. **Specific Mailing**: The fact that the billing clerk remembers preparing the notice and placing it in the \"out\" box supports the inference that the notice was mailed according to the company's usual procedures. This is sufficient to establish the admissibility of the testimony regarding the routine practice.\n\nTherefore, the court should find the billing clerk's testimony admissible without requiring additional corroborative evidence, as it pertains to the routine practice of the business."
