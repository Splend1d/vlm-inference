This is because diversity can bring a wider range of ideas, experiences, and problem-solving approaches to the table, which can enhance creativity and improve the quality of decisions made by the group. However, it's important to note that managing a heterogeneous group can also present challenges, such as potential conflicts and communication barriers, which need to be addressed to fully leverage the benefits of diversity."
