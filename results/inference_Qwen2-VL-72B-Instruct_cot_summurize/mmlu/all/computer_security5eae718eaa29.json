Assume that the query is not satisfiable and stop executing the path.\n\nWhen an STP (Simple Theorem Prover) solver times out on a constraint query for a particular path, it typically means that the solver was unable to determine within the given time limit whether the set of constraints is satisfiable or not. In this case, the EXE (Executable) would usually assume that the query is not satisfiable and stop executing the path. This approach helps in avoiding infinite loops or unnecessary computations on paths that are unlikely to lead to a solution."
