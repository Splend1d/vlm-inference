During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy\nC. Oral nystatin therapy\nD. Salt water gargle\n"

                    "text": "The patient's presentation is consistent with peritonsillar abscess, also known as quinsy. This is a complication of tonsillitis where an abscess forms between the tonsil and the pharyngeal wall. The key findings that support this diagnosis include:\n\n- Sore throat and fever for 5 days.\n- Change in voice and increased pain with swallowing.\n- Erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate.\n- Deviation of the uvula to the left.\n- White exudate on the right tonsil.\n- Trismus (difficulty opening the mouth).\n- Enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.\n\nGiven these findings, the most appropriate management in addition to antibiotic therapy would be:\n\nA. Incision and drainage\n\nIncision and drainage is necessary to remove the pus from the abscess, which will help alleviate symptoms and prevent complications such as airway obstruction or spread of infection. Antibiotics alone may not be sufficient to resolve the abscess, and surgical intervention is typically required.\n\nIntravenous methylprednisolone therapy (option B) might be considered in certain cases to reduce inflammation, but it is not the primary treatment for a peritonsillar abscess. Oral nystatin therapy (option C) is used for fungal infections and would not be appropriate for a bacterial abscess. A salt water gargle (option D) can provide symptomatic relief but does not address the underlying abscess.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Incision and drainage."
