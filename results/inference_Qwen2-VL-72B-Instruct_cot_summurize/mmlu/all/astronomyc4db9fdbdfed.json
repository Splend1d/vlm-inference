Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n\nRadioactive dating provides a direct measurement of the age of rocks based on the decay rates of radioactive isotopes within them. This method allows scientists to determine the absolute ages of lunar samples, which have been found to be billions of years old, significantly older than most rocks on Earth's surface."
