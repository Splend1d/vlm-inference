The complaint sought $50,000 in damages and alleged that the entrepreneur's use of the name \u00d2Best Hot Sauce\u00d3 infringed the company's federal trademark. The entrepreneur filed an answer denying the allegations, and the parties began discovery. Six months later, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion?\n\nA. No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.\nB. No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.\nC. Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\nD. Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court should grant the entrepreneur's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we need to consider both federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction.\n\n1. **Federal Question Jurisdiction:**\n   - The company's claim is based on federal trademark law, which falls under federal question jurisdiction. This means the court has subject-matter jurisdiction if the claim arises under federal law.\n\n2. **Amount in Controversy:**\n   - For federal question jurisdiction, there is no specific amount in controversy requirement. However, for diversity jurisdiction (which is not explicitly mentioned but could be relevant), the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Option A suggests that the court should not grant the motion because the claim arises under federal law. This is correct regarding federal question jurisdiction.\n- Option B suggests that the entrepreneur waived the right to challenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising it initially. This is generally true; however, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, including after discovery has begun.\n- Option C suggests that the court should grant the motion because the amount in controversy is not satisfied. This would only apply if the case were relying on diversity jurisdiction, which requires more than $75,000 in controversy. Since the claim is based on federal trademark law, this argument does not hold.\n- Option D suggests that the court should grant the motion because there is diversity but the amount in controversy is not satisfied. Again, this would only apply if the case were relying on diversity jurisdiction, which is not the primary basis here.\n\nConsidering the information provided, the most accurate response is:\n\n**A. No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the federal question jurisdiction is sufficient to establish subject-matter jurisdiction in this case."
