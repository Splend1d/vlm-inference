While some plant-based foods can be fortified with vitamin B12, strict vegans who do not consume these fortified foods or supplements may be at risk for deficiency.\n\nThe exact proportion of vegans who are deficient in vitamin B12 can vary depending on factors such as diet quality and individual health status. However, studies have shown that a significant portion of vegans may have low levels of vitamin B12. For example, one study found that about 68% of vegans had low serum vitamin B12 concentrations (1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 66%."
