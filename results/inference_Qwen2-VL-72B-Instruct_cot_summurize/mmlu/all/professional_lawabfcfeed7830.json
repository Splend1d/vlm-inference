(3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the woman delivered to her daughter, the woman promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the woman delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the woman thereafter defaulted on the mortgage debt, which of the following is probably correct?\n\nA. Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.\nB. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\nC. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine who has a cause of action against the woman if she defaults on the mortgage debt, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the legal implications of each step.\n\n1. **Mortgage Creation (1993):** The woman mortgaged the tract of land to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9\u00bd percent interest per annum. This establishes a lien on the property in favor of the mortgage company.\n\n2. **Recording of Mortgage (1996):** The mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land. Recording provides public notice of the mortgage and protects the mortgage company's interest.\n\n3. **Promise to Convey and Pay Debt (2007):** The woman promised in a signed writing to convey the tract of land to her daughter and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. This creates an obligation between the woman and her daughter but does not affect the mortgage company's lien.\n\n4. **Delivery of Quitclaim Deed (2008):** The woman delivered a quitclaim deed to her daughter without referencing the mortgage. A quitclaim deed transfers any interest the grantor has in the property to the grantee but does not extinguish existing liens or encumbrances.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The mortgage company retains its lien on the property because the mortgage was recorded and the quitclaim deed did not address or extinguish the mortgage.\n- The daughter received whatever interest the mother had in the property, subject to the existing mortgage lien.\n\nIf the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company can enforce its lien against the property, regardless of the quitclaim deed to the daughter. The daughter, having received the property subject to the mortgage, does not have a cause of action against the woman for the mortgage debt itself, as the mortgage remains valid and enforceable by the mortgage company.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman."
