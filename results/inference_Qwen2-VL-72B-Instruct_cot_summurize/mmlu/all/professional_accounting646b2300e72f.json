It seems there might be an error in the question or the options provided. Based on the given information and standard tax rules, the correct answer should be $4,000, but since this option is not listed, it appears there may be a discrepancy. \n\nGiven the options provided:\n- A. $0\n- B. $10,000\n- C. $14,000\n- D. $30,000\n\nNone of these directly match the calculated result. If forced to choose among the provided options, the closest would be:\n\n**B. $10,000**\n\nThis is because the adjusted basis of the land to Chyme was $10,000, which could be considered as a starting point before any adjustments. However, based on the detailed calculation, the correct basis should be $4,000."
