The image of \\( G \\) under \\( \\phi \\), denoted as \\( \\phi(G) \\), is a subset of \\( H \\).\n- By definition, the size (order) of the image \\( \\phi(G) \\) cannot exceed the size of \\( G \\). This is because each element in \\( G \\) maps to at most one element in \\( H \\), so the number of distinct elements in \\( \\phi(G) \\) cannot be more than the number of elements in \\( G \\).\n\nGiven that \\( G \\) has 6 elements, the maximum possible size of \\( \\phi(G) \\) is also 6. Therefore, it is impossible for the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism to have 12 elements.\n\n### Statement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n- A homomorphism can map a smaller group into a larger group. For example, consider the cyclic group \\( C_6 \\) of order 6 and the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\) of order 6. There exists a homomorphism from \\( C_6 \\) to \\( S_3 \\), but this does not imply anything about mapping into a group of 12 elements.\n- However, there is no inherent restriction preventing a homomorphism from mapping a group of 6 elements into a group of 12 elements. For instance, consider the trivial homomorphism where every element in the group of 6 elements maps to the identity element in the group of 12 elements. This is a valid homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
