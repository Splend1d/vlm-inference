When he saw the headlights of another car appear in the distance, he reached to turn the high beams off. Instead of turning from high-beam to low-beam, the headlights on the car turned off completely. The man tried repeatedly to turn the lights on again but could not do so. He collided with the other car and suffered injuries. The man has brought an action against the manufacturer of the headlight controls in his car, the manufacturer of his car, and the retailer who sold him the car. If the man can establish that a defect in the controls caused the accident, from whom can he recover?\n\nA. Only the manufacturer of the car and the retailer of the car.\nB. Only the manufacturer of the car.\nC. Only the manufacturer of the headlight controls and the manufacturer of the car.\nD. All three defendants.\n"

All three defendants.\n\nIn a product liability case, if the man can establish that a defect in the headlight controls caused the accident, he may be able to recover damages from all parties involved in the manufacturing and distribution chain of the defective product. This includes:\n\n1. The manufacturer of the headlight controls: They are responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of their product.\n2. The manufacturer of the car: They are responsible for integrating the headlight controls into the vehicle and ensuring that all components work safely together.\n3. The retailer who sold the car: They are responsible for selling a product that is safe for use.\n\nEach party in the supply chain can potentially be held liable under various theories of liability such as strict liability, negligence, or breach of warranty. Therefore, the man may have grounds to sue all three defendants."
