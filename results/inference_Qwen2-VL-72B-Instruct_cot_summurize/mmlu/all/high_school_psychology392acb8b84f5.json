Instead, they are supported or refuted based on empirical evidence gathered through research methods such as experiments, observational studies, and other forms of data collection. Theories in psychology are continually tested and refined as new evidence emerges.\n\nWhile running experiments (A) and finding statistically significant results (B) are important steps in supporting a theory, they do not constitute proof. Similarly, replication (C) is crucial for verifying the reliability of findings, but even consistent replication does not equate to absolute proof. Scientific theories remain open to revision or rejection based on future evidence."
