It discusses the concept of self-awareness and reaching a state where one is not reborn, implying a spiritual goal beyond reincarnation.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Retained the concept of karma**: Both Hinduism and Buddhism believe in the concept of karma, which is the idea that one's actions have consequences that affect future lives. This is a shared belief between the two religions.\n\nB. **Proposed a heavenly existence after death**: While Hinduism does have concepts of heaven (Svarga) and hell (Naraka), Buddhism focuses more on achieving enlightenment and escaping the cycle of rebirth rather than a specific heavenly existence.\n\nC. **Rejected the validity of all gods**: Buddhism generally does not focus on worshipping gods as Hinduism does. However, this rejection is more about the emphasis on personal spiritual development rather than a direct comparison to reincarnation.\n\nD. **Mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class**: Neither Hinduism nor Buddhism mandates blind obedience to a priestly class. Buddhism especially emphasizes individual effort and understanding.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate comparison between the message of the excerpt and Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation is:\n\n**A. Retained the concept of karma.**\n\nThus, the final answer is A."
