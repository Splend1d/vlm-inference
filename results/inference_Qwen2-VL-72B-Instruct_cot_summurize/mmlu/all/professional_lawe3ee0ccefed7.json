As the tenant inspected the room one last time, he noticed a bookcase that he had screwed into the wall when he first moved in. While he pondered whether to remove the bookcase, the tenant concluded that it constituted a fixture and, therefore, was a permanent part of the realty. Nonetheless, the tenant decided that the bookcase would fit nicely in his new apartment, so he removed it from the bedroom wall. When the landlord learned that the tenant had removed the bookcase, he contacted the tenant and demanded that he return it to the apartment. The tenant refused. If the tenant is subsequently prosecuted for larceny, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because the chattel was the personal property of the landlord.\nB. guilty, because severance of the bookcase from the wall was sufficient asportation to constitute larceny.\nC. not guilty, because the tenant cannot be found guilty of theft for removing his own property.\nD. not guilty, because the bookcase was a fixture.\n"

The landlord demands its return, but the tenant refuses. To determine the outcome if the tenant is prosecuted for larceny, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Chattel vs. Fixture**: A key issue here is whether the bookcase is considered a chattel (personal property) or a fixture (part of the real property). Generally, a fixture is something that was originally movable but has been attached to the real estate in such a way that it becomes part of the property. However, the intention of the party who installed it plays a significant role in determining whether it remains personal property or becomes a fixture.\n\n2. **Tenant's Intent**: Since the tenant installed the bookcase himself and intended to use it temporarily, it is more likely to be considered a chattel rather than a fixture. This intent is crucial in distinguishing between a fixture and a chattel.\n\n3. **Larceny Elements**: For larceny to occur, there must be an unlawful taking of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. In this case, the bookcase was the tenant's property, not the landlord's.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests the tenant is guilty because the bookcase was the landlord's property. This is incorrect because the bookcase was installed by the tenant and intended to be temporary, making it the tenant's personal property.\n  \n- **Option B** states that severing the bookcase from the wall constitutes larceny. This is also incorrect because the bookcase was the tenant's property, and severing it does not amount to stealing someone else's property.\n\n- **Option C** indicates the tenant is not guilty because he removed his own property. This is correct because the bookcase was installed by the tenant and intended to remain his personal property.\n\n- **Option D** claims the tenant is not guilty because the bookcase was a fixture. This is incorrect because the bookcase was not a fixture; it was a chattel due to the tenant's intent and installation method.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. not guilty, because the tenant cannot be found guilty of theft for removing his own property.**"
