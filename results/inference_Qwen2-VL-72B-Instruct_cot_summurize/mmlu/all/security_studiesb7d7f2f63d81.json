This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups.\nB. Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.\nC. Weak states cannot remain isolated from processes of globalization. Increasingly porous borders lead to migration and immigration. In order to compete in a globalized market weak states look to secure financial-credit assistance or aid from international institutions. However, these processes undermine the hegemonic idea of the state and societal identity is blurred which makes it difficult for the state to sustain its ideological appeal.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Diplomatic pressures from powerful states, which can include economic sanctions and restrictions on arms deals, potentially destabilizing the military and increasing the risk of internal unrest or coups.\n\nB. The proliferation of small arms, which can empower non-state actors such as warlords, criminals, and private militias, thereby undermining the state's authority.\n\nC. The impacts of globalization, which can lead to increased migration and competition in the global market. Seeking financial assistance from international institutions can also erode national sovereignty and blur societal identities, making it harder for the state to maintain its ideological appeal.\n\nEach of these factors represents significant external challenges that can exacerbate the vulnerabilities of weak states."
