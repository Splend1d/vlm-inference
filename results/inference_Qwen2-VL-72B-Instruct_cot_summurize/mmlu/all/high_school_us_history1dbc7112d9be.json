It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy.\n\"We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\"\nSouth Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860\nIn the excerpt above, the reference to \"the sanctions of a more erroneous religious belief\" most probably refers to\n\nA.

The document outlines the reasons for South Carolina's decision to secede from the United States, primarily due to the perceived threat posed by the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party's stance against the expansion of slavery. The reference to \"the sanctions of a more erroneous religious belief\" likely refers to the moral arguments made by Christian abolitionists who opposed slavery on religious and ethical grounds. These abolitionists argued that slavery was incompatible with Christian teachings and the principles of human equality and freedom. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Christian abolitionist rejection of slavery on moral grounds."
