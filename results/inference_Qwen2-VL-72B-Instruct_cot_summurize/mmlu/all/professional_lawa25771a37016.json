Before making the gift, the Secretary was approached by the head of a church. The church leader indicated that he would be sponsoring a worldwide crusade and suggested to the Secretary that such an undertaking would serve to strengthen relations with foreign governments. The Secretary donated the plane to the church instead of the organization. Who would have the best standing to challenge the Secretary's action?\n\nA. A citizen of the United States.\nB. A taxpayer of the United States.\nC. The national organization.\nD. A state within the United States.\n"

In this case, a citizen would likely not have a direct and personal injury from the Secretary's decision to donate the plane to the church rather than the national organization.\n\n3. **A Taxpayer of the United States**: Taxpayers generally do not have standing to challenge government actions unless they can show a direct and personal injury. The mere fact of being a taxpayer is usually insufficient for standing.\n\n4. **The National Organization**: This organization was directly affected by the Secretary's decision because it was initially intended to receive the plane but did not due to the Secretary's change of plans. The organization has a clear interest in the outcome and could argue that it suffered a direct and concrete injury as a result of the Secretary's action.\n\n5. **A State Within the United States**: States typically have standing to sue when their interests are directly affected by federal actions. However, in this specific case, there is no indication that any state's interests were directly impacted by the Secretary's decision regarding the plane donation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the entity with the best standing to challenge the Secretary's action is:\n\n**C. The national organization.**\n\nThis organization has a direct and concrete interest in the outcome and can demonstrate a direct injury resulting from the Secretary's decision to donate the plane to the church instead of them."
