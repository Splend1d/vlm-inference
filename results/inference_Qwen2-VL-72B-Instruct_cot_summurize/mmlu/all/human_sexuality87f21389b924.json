Skinner was a prominent behaviorist who developed the concept of operant conditioning, which includes the idea that behaviors can be influenced by their consequences. In this context, if experiencing pain during intercourse leads to the behavior of having intercourse occurring less frequently or not at all, Skinner would likely view the pain as a form of punishment that decreases the likelihood of the behavior being repeated."
