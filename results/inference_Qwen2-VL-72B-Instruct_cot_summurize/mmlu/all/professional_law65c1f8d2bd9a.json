They paced back and forth, walked around the store, and periodically looked in the window. The experienced officer feared that these individuals were most likely \"casing\" the place prior to robbing it. He approached, identified himself, and patted down the outer clothing of each. He found a hand gun in each man's pocket and arrested them for carrying concealed weapons. Will the court suppress the guns on the basis that there was no probable cause and the search was unconstitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because there was no probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed.\nB. No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\nC. No, because the officer did have probable cause to believe that a crime was being attempted.\nD. Yes, because the officer is not allowed to take anything out of the men's pockets while conducting a pat-down.\n"

No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\n\nIn this scenario, the police officer had reasonable suspicion based on the behavior of the two men, which led him to believe they might be planning a robbery. This reasonable suspicion justified the officer's decision to conduct a pat-down for weapons, which is permitted under the Terry v. Ohio case law. During the pat-down, the officer discovered the handguns, which provided probable cause for arrest. Therefore, the search was constitutional, and the court would not suppress the guns."
