This agreement provided that the bank would \"use maximum efforts in selling the company's assets at the highest possible price. \" The bank proceeded to sell the company's assets, discharging the indebtedness of the widget company. Later, it was ascertained that the bank did not realize the \"highest possible price\" in administering the sale of the company's assets.

In this case, the shareholder was not a direct party to the agreement between the bank and the company regarding the sale of assets. Therefore, she might not have standing to sue based on the terms of that agreement.\n\nB. **Not prevail, because the bank's sale of the company's assets discharged whatever contractual relationship existed between the shareholder and the bank.**\n   - The discharge of the company's indebtedness does not necessarily mean that any personal guarantees or other obligations between the shareholder and the bank were also discharged. The shareholder's personal guarantee could still be enforceable.\n\nC. **Prevail, because the bank did not realize the highest possible price from the sale of the company's assets.**\n   - While the bank had an obligation to use maximum efforts to sell the assets at the highest possible price, proving that they did not achieve the highest possible price can be challenging. Additionally, the shareholder's status as an incidental beneficiary may limit her ability to enforce this obligation directly.\n\nD. **Prevail, because the bank breached its fiduciary duty to the shareholder under the terms of the contract between the bank and the company.**\n   - A fiduciary duty typically arises in specific relationships where one party (the fiduciary) has a duty to act in the best interest of another party (the principal). However, the relationship described here is primarily commercial, and there is no indication that a fiduciary duty was established between the bank and the shareholder. Thus, this argument is less likely to succeed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**A. Not prevail, because the shareholder was an incidental beneficiary of the bank's sale of the company's assets.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the shareholder was not a direct party to the agreement between the bank and the company, which limits her ability to enforce the terms of that agreement."
