However, as of my last update in 2021, neither the CDC nor the WHO had implemented mandatory testing policies for any specific group, including prisoners or high-risk individuals.\n\nInstead, both organizations recommended voluntary testing for individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 or who are experiencing symptoms of the virus. The CDC also recommended that healthcare providers prioritize testing for certain populations, such as those who are hospitalized or who work in healthcare settings.\n\nIt's important to note that testing policies can change over time based on new scientific evidence and public health needs. Therefore, it's always best to check with local health authorities or trusted sources for the most up-to-date information on testing policies in your area."
