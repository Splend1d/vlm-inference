The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?\n\nA. The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\nD.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer regarding the state of title to the tract, we need to consider the principles of adverse possession and how they apply to minors.\n\n1. **Statutory Period**: The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.\n2. **Possession Duration**: The man has been in possession for 12 years since the woman moved to another state.\n3. **Intestacy and Heir**: The woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as the sole heir.\n4. **Age of Majority**: The age of majority is 18 years.\n\nWhen the son inherited the property at the age of six, his rights were protected under the law because he was a minor. Adverse possession statutes typically provide that the period of adverse possession does not begin to run against a minor until they reach the age of majority. This means that the statutory period for adverse possession starts counting from when the minor turns 18.\n\nHere\u2019s the timeline:\n- The man took possession 12 years ago.\n- The woman died 9 years ago, when the son was 6.\n- The son will turn 18 in 3 more years (since he is currently 15).\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- The man has already been in possession for 12 years.\n- The son will turn 18 in 3 years.\n- The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.\n\nThe man needs to continue in adverse possession for an additional 8 years (from the time the son turns 18) to meet the full 20-year requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.**"
