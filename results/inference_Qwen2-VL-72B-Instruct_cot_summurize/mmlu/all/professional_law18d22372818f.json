The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n"

For a plaintiff to have standing in federal court, they must demonstrate that they have suffered or are imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\n\nThe eight state taxpayers, who are avowed atheists, are challenging the state's statute that authorizes the payment of state funds to private institutions of higher learning, including those affiliated with churches, provided they meet certain criteria and do not use the funds for sectarian purposes. However, simply being taxpayers does not generally confer standing to challenge government spending unless there is a direct and personal injury beyond the general grievance of having to pay taxes.\n\nGiven that the plaintiffs are challenging the expenditure of state funds rather than federal funds, their standing would typically be insufficient because the Supreme Court has held that taxpayers generally lack standing to challenge state expenditures on Establishment Clause grounds. Therefore, the federal district court is most likely to dismiss the action for lack of standing."
