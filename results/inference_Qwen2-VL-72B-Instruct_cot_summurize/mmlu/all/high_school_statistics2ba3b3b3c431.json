She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\n\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n"

No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n\nThis experimental design has a potential issue with confounding variables. The different grade levels (sixth, seventh, and eighth) could introduce variability in GPA that is not solely due to the amount of extra reading time. Students at different grade levels might have varying levels of academic maturity, prior knowledge, or other factors that could affect their GPA independently of the reading intervention. To address this, the experimenter should consider using a randomized block design where students within each grade level are randomly assigned to the different reading conditions. This would help to control for the effects of grade level and isolate the impact of the reading intervention on GPA."
