Pyruvate is converted to lactate.\n\nDuring intense exercise, when the body's demand for energy exceeds its capacity to supply oxygen, cells switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism. In this process, pyruvate (a product of glycolysis) is converted into lactate in order to regenerate NAD+ and allow glycolysis to continue producing ATP without oxygen. This conversion generates hydrogen ions (H+), which can lead to a decrease in pH within the muscle cells, contributing to muscle fatigue."
