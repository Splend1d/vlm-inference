                    "text": "Given that \\(A = A^{-1}\\) for a real \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(A\\), we can use properties of matrices to find the trace of \\(A\\).\n\nFirst, recall that if \\(A = A^{-1}\\), then \\(A^2 = I\\), where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix.\n\nFor a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\), its square \\(A^2\\) is given by:\n\n\\[A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\\\ ac + cd & bc + d^2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nSince \\(A^2 = I\\), we have:\n\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\\\ ac + cd & bc + d^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n1. \\(a^2 + bc = 1\\)\n2. \\(bc + d^2 = 1\\)\n\nFrom these equations, we can deduce that \\(a^2 = 1 - bc\\) and \\(d^2 = 1 - bc\\). Since \\(a^2\\) and \\(d^2\\) must be non-negative (as they are squares of real numbers), it follows that \\(bc\\) must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nThe trace of \\(A\\) is defined as the sum of its diagonal elements, which in this case is \\(a + d\\).\n\nGiven \\(A = A^{-1}\\), we also know that the determinant of \\(A\\) is 1 (since \\(|A||A^{-1}| = |I| = 1\\)). The determinant of \\(A\\) is given by \\(ad - bc\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[ad - bc = 1\\]\n\nWe already know from our previous deductions that \\(a^2 = 1 - bc\\) and \\(d^2 = 1 - bc\\). Adding these two equations together gives:\n\n\\[a^2 + d^2 = 2 - 2bc\\]\n\nBut since \\(ad - bc = 1\\), we can substitute \\(bc = ad - 1\\) into the equation above to get:\n\n\\[a^2 + d^2 = 2 - 2(ad - 1)\\]\n\\[a^2 + d^2 = 2 - 2ad + 2\\]\n\\[a^2 + d^2 = 4 - 2ad\\]\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our deduction process. Let's correct it:\n\nGiven \\(A = A^{-1}\\), we have \\(A^2 = I\\), which implies:\n\n\\[a^2 + bc = 1\\]\n\\[ab + bd = 0\\]\n\\[ac + cd = 0\\]\n\\[bc + d^2 = 1\\]\n\nFrom \\(ab + bd = 0\\) and \\(ac + cd = 0\\), we can deduce that \\(b(a + d) = 0\\) and \\(c(a + d) = 0\\). This implies that either \\(b = 0\\) and/or \\(c = 0\\), or \\(a + d = 0\\). However, since \\(A \\neq -I\\), we cannot have \\(a + d = 0\\) directly leading to \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\), because that would imply \\(A\\) is the negative identity matrix, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nInstead, let's focus on the determinant condition: \\(ad - bc = 1\\). Given \\(A^2 = I\\), we have:\n\n\\[a^2 + bc = 1\\]\n\\[bc + d^2 = 1\\]\n\nAdding these two equations gives:\n\n\\[a^2 + d^2 + 2bc = 2\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(ad - bc = 1\\) into the equation above, we get:\n\n\\[a^2 + d^2 + 2(ad - 1) = 2\\]\n\\[a^2 + d^2 + 2ad - 2 = 2\\]\n\\[a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = 4\\]\n\\[(a + d)^2 = 4\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get \\(a + d = \\pm 2\\). However, since \\(A \\neq I\\) and \\(A \\neq -I\\), we cannot have \\(a + d"
