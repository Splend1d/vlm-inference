Nd \u2283 (Bj \u2228 Sl)\n\nHere's why:\n- \"Nd\" represents \"Delilah is in New York City.\"\n- \"Bj\" represents \"Juana is in Bogota.\"\n- \"Sl\" represents \"Layla is in San Juan.\"\n- The symbol \"\u2283\" means \"implies.\"\n- The symbol \"\u2228\" means \"or.\"\n\nSo, the correct logical form captures the conditional relationship where if Delilah is in New York City (Nd), then either Juana is in Bogota (Bj) or Layla is in San Juan (Sl). This is represented as \"Nd \u2283 (Bj \u2228 Sl).\""
