If P, then Q (major premise)\n2. P (minor premise)\n\nGiven that the minor premise affirms the antecedent (P), we need to determine what valid conclusions can be drawn from this structure.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **no valid conclusion can be drawn**\n   - This is incorrect because if the minor premise affirms the antecedent, a valid conclusion can indeed be drawn based on the major premise.\n\nB. **the conclusion must affirm the consequent**\n   - This is correct because if the minor premise affirms the antecedent (P), and the major premise states \"If P, then Q,\" then logically, the consequent (Q) must also be affirmed. This follows directly from the rules of hypothetical syllogisms.\n\nC. **the conclusion must deny the consequent**\n   - This is incorrect because denying the consequent would not follow from affirming the antecedent in a valid hypothetical syllogism.\n\nD. **the conclusion must deny the antecedent**\n   - This is incorrect because the minor premise already affirms the antecedent, so there is no basis for denying it in the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: the conclusion must affirm the consequent."
