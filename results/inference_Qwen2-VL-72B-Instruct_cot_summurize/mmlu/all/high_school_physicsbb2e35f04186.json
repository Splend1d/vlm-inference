Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n"

This indicates that the cart is decelerating.\n\n### Newton's Second Law\n\nNewton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{net}} = m \\cdot a \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F_{\\text{net}} \\) is the net force,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the object,\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration (or deceleration).\n\nSince the cart is decelerating, its acceleration \\( a \\) is negative. The change in velocity (\\( \\Delta v \\)) is also negative because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity:\n\n\\[ \\Delta v = v_f - v_i = 15 \\, \\text{cm/s} - 25 \\, \\text{cm/s} = -10 \\, \\text{cm/s} \\]\n\nThis negative change in velocity implies that the acceleration \\( a \\) is negative, meaning the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the motion.\n\n### Direction of Net Force\n\nThe direction of the net force is determined by the direction of the acceleration. Since the acceleration is negative (opposite to the direction of motion), the net force must also be in the opposite direction of the motion.\n\nTherefore, the net force is acting westward (opposite to the eastward motion of the cart).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the cart is decelerating, we can conclude that the net force is in the direction opposite to the motion of the cart. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.**"
