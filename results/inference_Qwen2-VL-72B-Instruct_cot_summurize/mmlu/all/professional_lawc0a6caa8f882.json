She didn't tell him that she was pregnant, and decided to get an abortion without telling him. Her state had a law requiring her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. She refused to sign and sued the state to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Is the law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle established by the Supreme Court in cases such as Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which recognize a woman's constitutional right to privacy and reproductive autonomy. The requirement for spousal notification or consent can be seen as an undue burden on this right, especially if it significantly hinders or delays access to abortion services. The law in question appears to impose an additional hurdle that could potentially violate the constitutional protections afforded to women seeking abortions."
