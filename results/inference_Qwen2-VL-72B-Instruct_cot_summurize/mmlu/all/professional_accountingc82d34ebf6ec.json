Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements.\n\nWhen an accountant is engaged in a compilation service for a nonissuer, they are not required to provide an opinion on the financial statements as they would in an audit or review engagement. Instead, their responsibility is to present the financial information in a manner that is free from material misstatement based on the information provided by management. If there is a departure from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that is material, the accountant should disclose this fact in the compilation report.\n\nIn this case, since management has chosen to state the land at appraised value rather than historical cost, which is contrary to GAAP, and this departure has a material effect on the financial statements, the accountant should include a separate paragraph in the compilation report disclosing this departure and its effects. This disclosure is necessary to inform users of the financial statements about the noncompliance with GAAP and its impact on the reported financial position and results of operations."
