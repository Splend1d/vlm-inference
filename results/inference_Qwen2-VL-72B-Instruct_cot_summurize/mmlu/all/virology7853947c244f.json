Mutations negate the effect of one drug\n\nDrug combinations, often referred to as antiretroviral therapy (ART), are essential in the treatment of HIV because they help to overcome the high mutation rate of the virus. HIV can rapidly develop resistance to single drugs through mutations, rendering them ineffective over time. By using multiple drugs that target different stages of the viral life cycle, the likelihood of the virus developing resistance to all drugs simultaneously is greatly reduced. This approach increases the effectiveness of treatment and helps to maintain viral suppression."
