The Fallacy of Composition occurs when someone argues that what is true of the parts must also be true of the whole. For example, if every brick in a wall is light, it doesn't necessarily mean the entire wall is light.\n\nIf Heather hasn't made the third option (which we assume to be the Fallacy of Composition) into the correct answer for a while, and even then only once, it suggests that the pattern of her answers might be leading you to believe that the current question could involve the Fallacy of Composition.\n\nGiven the information provided and the process of elimination, it would be reasonable to guess that the answer to number 8 is:\n\nC. Fallacy of Composition\n\nHowever, without more context or specifics about the question itself, this remains an educated guess based on the pattern you've observed in Heather's previous answers."
