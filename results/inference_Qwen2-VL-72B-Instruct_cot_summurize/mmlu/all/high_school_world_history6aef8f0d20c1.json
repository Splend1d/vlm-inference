Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas\n\nThe poem \"To New York\" by Senegalese poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor reflects the strong transatlantic cultural exchanges between Africa and the Americas during the mid-20th century. This period saw significant interactions and mutual influences in literature, music, and other arts, particularly between African and African-American artists. The poem's vivid imagery and celebration of New York City as a vibrant cultural melting pot suggest a deep appreciation and connection to the artistic and intellectual movements happening across the Atlantic."
