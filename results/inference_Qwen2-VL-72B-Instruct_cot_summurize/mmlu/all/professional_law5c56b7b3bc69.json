The summons and complaint were served at the stockbroker's office in State B, where the process server handed the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant. The stockbroker has answered the complaint, asserting the defense of improper service of process. Assume that both states' requirements for service of process are identical to the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Is the court likely to dismiss the action for improper service of process?\n\nA. No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\nB. No, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\nC. Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\nD. Yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n"

Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), Rule 4(e)(2) specifies that an individual can be served directly or by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the individual's dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there. However, this rule does not extend to serving an individual defendant through a third party at their place of employment unless that third party is specifically authorized to accept service on behalf of the defendant. In this case, since the process server handed the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant rather than the stockbroker themselves or someone authorized to accept service on their behalf, the service would likely be considered improper under FRCP Rule 4(e).\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to dismiss the action for improper service of process."
