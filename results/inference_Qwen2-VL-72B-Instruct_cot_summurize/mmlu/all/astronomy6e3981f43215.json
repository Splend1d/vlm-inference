A kilogram of feathers:** \n     - Mass = 1 kg\n     - Weight on Moon = \\( 1 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 1.625 \\text{ N} \\)\n\n   - **B. Five pounds of bricks as measured on Earth:**\n     - First, convert pounds to kilograms: \\( 5 \\text{ lbs} \\times 0.453592 \\text{ kg/lb} = 2.26796 \\text{ kg} \\)\n     - Weight on Moon = \\( 2.26796 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 3.684 \\text{ N} \\)\n\n   - **C. Five kilograms of feathers:**\n     - Mass = 5 kg\n     - Weight on Moon = \\( 5 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 8.125 \\text{ N} \\)\n\n   - **D. A kilogram of bricks:**\n     - Mass = 1 kg\n     - Weight on Moon = \\( 1 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\text{ m/s}^2 = 1.625 \\text{ N} \\)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The option with the highest weight on the moon is C. Five kilograms of feathers, which weighs 8.125 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**C. Five kilograms of feathers**"
