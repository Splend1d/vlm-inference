The dissociation reaction of phenol in water is:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- + \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+ \\]\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^-][\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+]}{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}]} \\]\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of phenol is 1.0 M and assuming negligible change in the concentration of phenol due to its low Ka value, we can approximate the concentration of phenol as 1.0 M after dissociation.\n\nLet x be the concentration of H+ ions (or equivalently, the concentration of C6H5O- ions) produced by the dissociation of phenol. Then, the Ka expression becomes:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{x^2}{1.0 - x} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{1.0} \\]\n\nSince Ka is very small (1 \u00d7 10^-10), we can assume that x is much smaller than 1.0, so 1.0 - x \u2248 1.0. Therefore,\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 10^{-10} = \\frac{x^2}{1.0} \\]\n\nSolving for x gives:\n\n\\[ x^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\\[ x = 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nTherefore, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M"
