Argument from Ignorance\n\nThis type of logical fallacy occurs when someone claims that a proposition must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. In this case, the argument suggests that because atheists have not successfully proven the non-existence of God, one is justified in believing in God's existence. This overlooks the fact that the burden of proof typically lies with the person making the positive claim (in this case, the existence of God), rather than requiring the negative to be proven."
