That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury.

This legal principle allows plaintiffs to infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's harm. The presence of a dead mouse in a sealed container of milk suggests that the dairy was negligent in its manufacturing process, as such an incident would not typically occur without some form of negligence. The buyer's severe emotional distress, while significant, does not preclude recovery; rather, it supports the claim that the dairy's negligence led to a harmful event. Therefore, the buyer is likely to recover damages based on the presumption of negligence established by res ipsa loquitur."
