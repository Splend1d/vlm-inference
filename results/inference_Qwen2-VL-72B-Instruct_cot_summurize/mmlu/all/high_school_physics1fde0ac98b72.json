The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nIn this scenario, since the ice is frictionless, there are no external forces acting on the system of the two skaters except for their mutual interaction during the collision. According to the law of conservation of momentum, if the net external force on a system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system remains constant. Therefore, the linear momentum of the system is conserved.\n\nThe collision is inelastic because the skaters stick together after the collision, which means that some kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat or deformation), so kinetic energy is not conserved. However, this does not affect the conservation of linear momentum."
