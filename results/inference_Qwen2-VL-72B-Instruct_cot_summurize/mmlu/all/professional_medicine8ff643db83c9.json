Given that thyroid function studies and an electrocardiogram (ECG) have shown no abnormalities, it is likely that these symptoms are related to a psychological condition rather than a physical one.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Lithium carbonate is primarily used for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\nB. Methylphenidate is a stimulant commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nC. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\nD. Paroxetine is an antidepressant from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class, which is often used to treat anxiety disorders, including panic disorder.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the absence of physical abnormalities, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be D. Paroxetine, as it is effective in treating panic disorder and other anxiety-related conditions. However, it is important to note that any pharmacological treatment should be accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation and possibly psychotherapy, as recommended by a healthcare professional."
