POSITIVE FEEDBACK\u2192 disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo\n\nPositive feedback in systems theory refers to a process where the output of a system is fed back into the system as input in a way that increases the effect of the initial change, leading to further deviation from the original state. This is different from homeostasis, which involves negative feedback mechanisms that work to restore the system to its equilibrium or original state after a disruption. Therefore, positive feedback does not necessarily disrupt homeostasis; rather, it can amplify changes away from the equilibrium."
