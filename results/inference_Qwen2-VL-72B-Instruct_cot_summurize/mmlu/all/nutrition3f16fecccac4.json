                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This leads to a lack of insulin production, which is necessary for regulating blood sugar levels.\n\nOn the other hand, type 2 diabetes is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, and often there is also a relative deficiency in insulin production. While genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes, it is not considered an autoimmune disorder.\n\nLet's briefly address the other options:\n\nA. Persons with type 2 diabetes may or may not require insulin, and if they do, the dose can vary widely depending on individual needs. The statement that they usually require lower doses of insulin because they have a milder form of diabetes is not accurate. Type 2 diabetes can be severe and require significant management, including high doses of insulin.\n\nB. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to chronic complications over time if not well managed. However, it is not accurate to say that persons with type 1 diabetes rapidly develop chronic complications compared to those with type 2 diabetes. The rate at which complications develop depends on various factors, including how well the condition is managed.\n\nD. Persons with type 1 diabetes do not have functioning beta cells to produce insulin, so they cannot increase endogenous insulin production by taking oral hypoglycemic agents. These medications are typically used to manage type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity or increasing insulin secretion from remaining beta cells."
