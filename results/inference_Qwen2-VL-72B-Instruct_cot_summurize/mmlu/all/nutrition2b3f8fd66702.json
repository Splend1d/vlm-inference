It contains zinc and copper at its active site.\n\nB. **Alkaline phosphatase**: This enzyme is also known to be zinc-dependent. Zinc ions play a crucial role in its catalytic activity.\n\nC. **Glutathione peroxidase**: This enzyme is selenium-dependent, not zinc-dependent. Selenium is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase.\n\nD. **DNA polymerase**: While some DNA polymerases can require metal ions for their activity, they are typically magnesium-dependent rather than zinc-dependent.\n\nGiven this analysis, the enzyme that is not zinc-dependent is:\n\n**C. Glutathione peroxidase**"
