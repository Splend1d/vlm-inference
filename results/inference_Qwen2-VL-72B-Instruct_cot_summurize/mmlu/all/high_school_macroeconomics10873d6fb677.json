Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies\n\nHigher government funding for research on clean energy supplies can lead to technological advancements, innovation, and new industries, which in turn can contribute to faster rates of economic growth. This is because such investments can improve productivity, create jobs, and stimulate economic activity.\n\nIn contrast:\n- A more restrictive immigration policy could limit the labor force and reduce the diversity of skills available, potentially slowing economic growth.\n- Negative net investment means that the economy is not investing enough to maintain or grow its capital stock, which would hinder economic growth.\n- Higher taxes on households and firms can reduce disposable income and investment, which may slow down economic growth by decreasing consumption and business expansion."
