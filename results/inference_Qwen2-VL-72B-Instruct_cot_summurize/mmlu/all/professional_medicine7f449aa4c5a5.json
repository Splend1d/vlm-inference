Ultrasonography.\n\nAn elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level can indicate several conditions, including neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects, multiple gestations, or incorrect dating of the pregnancy. An ultrasound can help determine the number of fetuses, assess fetal anatomy for potential anomalies, and more accurately estimate the gestational age, which could explain the elevated MSAFP if the pregnancy is further along than initially thought.\n\nIf the ultrasound does not reveal any abnormalities or if there is still concern after the ultrasound, further testing such as amniocentesis might be considered to measure the \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration in the amniotic fluid. However, this is typically done after an ultrasound has been performed to provide more context and information."
