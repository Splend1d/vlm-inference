When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends'\n\nAccording to international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), piracy is defined as an act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or aircraft, and directed on the high seas against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property aboard such ship or aircraft.\n\nTherefore, if an illegal act of violence on the high seas does not involve another vessel and is not committed for private ends, it would not qualify as piracy under this definition."
