There is no action or behavior here that can be considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When I broke a glass at my mother-in-law's house, I swept the shards under the rug.\"\n- This statement describes an action where the main character hides the broken glass instead of cleaning it up properly or admitting the mistake. Hiding the broken glass could potentially cause harm to others who might step on the shards unknowingly. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves deceit and negligence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
