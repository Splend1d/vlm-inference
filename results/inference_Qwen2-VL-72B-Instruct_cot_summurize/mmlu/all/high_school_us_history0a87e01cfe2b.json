He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nThe excerpt from the Sugar Act of 1764 indicates that Prime Minister Grenville believed in controlling trade, raising revenue, and having Parliament impose taxes on the colonies to help pay for the costs of defending them. The concept of \"salutary neglect,\" which refers to a more lenient approach to colonial governance and trade policies, does not align with these views. Therefore, option D does not represent Grenville's views after the French and Indian War."
