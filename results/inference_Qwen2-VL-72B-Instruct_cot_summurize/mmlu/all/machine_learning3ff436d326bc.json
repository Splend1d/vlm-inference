Lasso\n\nLasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is more appropriate for feature selection because it can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating those features from the model. This property makes Lasso useful for selecting a subset of features that contribute most to the predictive power of the model.\n\nRidge regression, on the other hand, does not perform feature selection in the same way. It shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero, so it does not eliminate any features entirely. Instead, Ridge regression helps to reduce the complexity of the model by penalizing large coefficients, which can help prevent overfitting."
