Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD. The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\n\nThe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. However, not all classifications are treated equally under the law. Social class is generally considered a non-suspect classification, meaning that courts typically apply a rational basis review rather than strict scrutiny when evaluating claims involving economic status. Under rational basis review, a law or policy must simply be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nIn this case, the high fees charged by the hotel do not involve a fundamental right or a suspect classification (such as race, national origin, or religion), so the court would likely apply rational basis review. The hotel's pricing decisions are typically considered a legitimate business practice and do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Therefore, the resident's claim that the high fees discriminate against the poor is unlikely to succeed under the equal protection clause."
