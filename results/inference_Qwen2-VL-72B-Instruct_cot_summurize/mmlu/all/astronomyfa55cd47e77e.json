As the planet slowly contracts over time, the gravitational potential energy is converted into thermal energy, which heats up the interior. This process is different from nuclear fusion, which powers stars like our Sun. Jupiter does not have enough mass or pressure at its core to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. The other options listed (internal friction due to its high rotation rate and chemical processes) also contribute to some extent but are not the primary source of Jupiter's internal heat."
