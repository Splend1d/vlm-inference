Suppresses milk production: Nicotine and other chemicals in tobacco smoke can reduce milk supply by constricting blood vessels, which decreases the flow of nutrients to the breasts.\n\nB. Alters the composition of breast milk: Smoking can change the chemical composition of breast milk, potentially affecting its nutritional value and introducing harmful substances to the baby.\n\nC. Increases the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding: The stress and health complications associated with smoking can make it more difficult for mothers to continue breastfeeding, leading to an increased risk of early cessation.\n\nTherefore, all of the provided options are correct."
