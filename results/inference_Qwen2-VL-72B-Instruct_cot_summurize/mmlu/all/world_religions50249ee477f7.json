Sexual union\n\nTantric Buddhism, also known as Vajrayana or Esoteric Buddhism, incorporates a variety of practices that are often misunderstood or misrepresented in popular culture. One of its central components involves the use of sexual union as a spiritual practice. This is not to be confused with mere bodily pleasure; rather, it is seen as a means to achieve enlightenment by transcending dualistic thinking and experiencing the unity of opposites. The practice is highly ritualized and symbolic, often involving visualizations and meditations."
