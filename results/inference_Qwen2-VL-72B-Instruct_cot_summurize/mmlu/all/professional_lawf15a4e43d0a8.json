They would fly from their home to the city and spend the week at a hotel in the most luxurious suite. On March 1, the husband mailed a letter to the hotel, reserving the suite for the first week in July. The hotel then sent back a confirmation notice stating that it was reserving the suite for the husband and wife for the first week in July \"for the weekly rental of $25,000. \"When the husband and wife arrived at the hotel on July 1, the hotel, without legal excuse, informed the man and his wife that the hotel had rented the suite to another couple for the first week in July. Quite apologetic, the manager of the hotel offered the husband and wife the hotel's next best accommodation at a weekly rental of $20,000. The manager informed the husband and wife that the other suite was beautifully furnished, \"but not quite as luxurious as the suite they reserved. \" Visibly upset, the husband and wife rejected the manager's offer and relocated to another hotel, where they rented the other hotel's most luxurious suite for the first week in July at a cost of $25,000. If the husband and wife now sue the first hotel for breach of contract, they will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the hotel knew that for the past 20 years the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite.\nB. prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.\nC. not prevail, because the hotel did offer substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings.\nD. not prevail, because the husband and wife sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the husband and wife will most likely prevail if they sue the first hotel for breach of contract, we need to analyze the situation based on contract law principles.\n\n1. **Contract Formation**: The husband and wife mailed a letter to reserve the suite, and the hotel confirmed the reservation with a specific price ($25,000). This exchange constitutes an agreement, forming a binding contract between the parties.\n\n2. **Breach of Contract**: The hotel failed to provide the reserved suite despite confirming the reservation. This failure is a clear breach of the contract.\n\n3. **Remedies for Breach**: When a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to remedies such as damages or specific performance. In this case, the husband and wife sought alternative accommodations, which means they are seeking monetary compensation for the breach.\n\n4. **Substitute Accommodations**: The hotel offered a substitute suite at a lower price ($20,000), but the husband and wife rejected it due to its lesser luxury compared to the reserved suite. The fact that the substitute was not comparable to what was reserved is significant.\n\n5. **Legal Damages**: The husband and wife rented a comparable suite at another hotel for the same price ($25,000). However, the issue here is not just about the price but also about the breach of the original contract and the inconvenience caused by having to find alternate accommodations.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Prevail, because the hotel knew that for the past 20 years the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite**:\n   - While this is true, it does not directly address the breach of the specific contract for the current year.\n\nB. **Prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved**:\n   - This is a strong argument. The substitute accommodations were not equivalent to what was reserved, which is a key factor in determining the breach.\n\nC. **Not prevail, because the hotel did offer substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings**:\n   - Offering a less expensive substitute does not absolve the hotel of liability for failing to provide the contracted suite.\n\nD. **Not prevail, because the husband and wife sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental**:\n   - This overlooks the inconvenience and potential additional costs (e.g., time spent finding new accommodations) associated with the breach.\n\nConsidering all factors, the most compelling reason for the husband and wife to prevail is that the substitute accommodations offered were not comparable to the reserved suite, which is a direct violation of the terms of the contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.**"
