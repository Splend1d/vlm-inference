Since it is only a representation and not an actual act causing harm, this does not involve any real-world moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I called the police on the non-violent lady.\"\n- This scenario involves calling the police on someone who is described as non-violent. Depending on the context, calling the police on a non-violent person could be seen as an overreaction or unnecessary escalation, potentially leading to harm for the individual involved. In many cases, this action might be considered morally wrong if there was no legitimate reason for involving law enforcement.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 may involve a morally wrong action depending on the context, but generally, calling the police on a non-violent person without cause can be seen as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
