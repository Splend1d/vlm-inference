Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Budget surpluses and higher discount rates**: \n   - Budget surpluses imply that the government is collecting more revenue than it spends, which can reduce aggregate demand and further slow down an already contracting economy.\n   - Higher discount rates make borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn reduces lending and can lead to decreased investment and consumption.\n\nB. **Tax reductions and open market purchases**:\n   - Tax reductions increase disposable income for households and businesses, potentially boosting consumption and investment.\n   - Open market purchases (buying securities) by the central bank injects money into the economy, lowering interest rates and encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\nC. **Budget surpluses and lower discount rates**:\n   - As mentioned earlier, budget surpluses can reduce aggregate demand.\n   - Lower discount rates encourage borrowing and spending, but this might not be sufficient to counteract the negative effects of budget surpluses.\n\nD. **Increases in government spending and higher discount rates**:\n   - Increased government spending can boost aggregate demand and stimulate the economy.\n   - However, higher discount rates would counteract this effect by making borrowing more expensive and reducing overall economic activity.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate combination of fiscal and monetary policies during the contractionary phase of the business cycle is:\n\n**B. Tax reductions and open market purchases.**\n\nThese measures work together to stimulate the economy by increasing disposable income and liquidity, thereby encouraging spending and investment."
