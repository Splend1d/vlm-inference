The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p = 2\\). Therefore, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2\\).\n\nNext, consider the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). We need to find the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), its minimal polynomial must be of degree at least 2. The polynomial \\(x^2 - 3\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) and thus also over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) because it has no roots in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Therefore, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2\\).\n\nBy the tower law for field extensions, we have:\n\\[ [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4. \\]\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 4."
