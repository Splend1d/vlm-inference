Hiding this from teachers, who are mandated reporters and have a duty to report signs of abuse, is a serious issue. This action could prevent the child from receiving necessary help and protection.\n- **Conclusion:** According to ordinary moral standards in the US, failing to address or report potential abuse is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I moved to the United States to become a resident.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Moving to another country for residency is a personal decision that does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoing. It is a common and legal action taken by many individuals seeking better opportunities or a new life.\n- **Conclusion:** According to ordinary moral standards in the US, moving to another country for residency is not considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
