Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed, let's analyze each option based on the information provided:\n\nA. **The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.**\n   - This statement suggests that the covenant only binds the builder and not the buyer. However, since the original covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office and the builder's deed included the same language, it implies that the covenant was intended to run with the land. Therefore, this statement is inaccurate because the covenant should bind both the builder and the buyer.\n\nB. **The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.**\n   - This statement is generally true for covenants running with the land. Any lot owner in the subdivision can enforce such covenants against other lot owners.\n\nC. **The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.**\n   - Since the original covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office, it becomes part of the public record. Any subsequent purchaser, including the buyer, should have constructive notice of the recorded covenant.\n\nD. **All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.**\n   - Privity of estate refers to the relationship between successive owners of the same property. If the covenant runs with the land, then all subsequent grantees (purchasers) would indeed be in privity of estate and bound by the covenant.\n\nGiven this analysis, the least accurate statement is:\n\n**A. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.**\n\nThis statement incorrectly implies that the covenant does not bind the buyer, whereas the recorded nature of the covenant and its inclusion in the builder's deed suggest it should bind all subsequent owners."
