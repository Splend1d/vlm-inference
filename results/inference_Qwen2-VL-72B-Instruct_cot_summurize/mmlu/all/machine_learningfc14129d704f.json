True, False\n\nStatement 1 is true because Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve high classification performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, often exceeding 95% accuracy with appropriate architectures and training techniques.\n\nStatement 2 is false because ensembles of neural networks can indeed improve classification accuracy. While it's true that individual models within an ensemble might learn highly correlated representations, combining their predictions through voting or averaging can still reduce variance and improve overall performance. This is because each model might make different types of errors, and combining them can help mitigate these errors."
