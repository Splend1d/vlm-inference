To find the \\( z \\)-score that corresponds to an area of 0.03 in the right tail, we look up the value in the standard normal distribution table that gives us an area of 0.97 (since the total area to the left of this \\( z \\)-score will be 1 - 0.03 = 0.97).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the \\( z \\)-score corresponding to an area of 0.97 is approximately 1.88.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1.88"
