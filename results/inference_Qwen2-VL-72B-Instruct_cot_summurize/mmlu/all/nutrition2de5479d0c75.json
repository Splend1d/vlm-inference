While it is possible for vegan diets to be deficient in protein if not properly planned, many plant-based foods are good sources of protein. Legumes, nuts, seeds, and grains can provide adequate protein when consumed in sufficient quantities.\n\nB. Cereals are deficient in lysine.\n- This statement is true. Many cereals (such as wheat, rice, and corn) are low in lysine, an essential amino acid that they lack compared to other grains like quinoa or amaranth.\n\nC. Legumes are deficient in methionine.\n- This statement is true. Legumes (like beans, lentils, and chickpeas) are generally low in methionine, another essential amino acid.\n\nD. Dairy products are rich sources of tryptophan.\n- This statement is true. Dairy products, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, are indeed good sources of tryptophan, an essential amino acid.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true is:\n\nA. Vegan diets are likely to be deficient in protein."
