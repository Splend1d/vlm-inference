After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.\nB. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\nD. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n"

No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the original note limited the bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. This means that the bank cannot seek additional funds beyond what was specified in the original agreement. If the bank obtained a deficiency judgment for $10,000 despite this limitation, the court would likely rule that the judgment is invalid because it violates the terms agreed upon in the original note. Additionally, many jurisdictions have public policies that limit or prohibit deficiency judgments to protect consumers from excessive debt burdens following foreclosure. Therefore, the court would not enforce the deficiency judgment for $10,000."
