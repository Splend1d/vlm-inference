It highlights a significant disparity in financial status and may cause emotional distress or humiliation to the homeless person.\n- According to ordinary moral standards, this behavior is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I woke up at 4 AM this morning while my roommates were still asleep, and turned on the blender to make myself a smoothie.\"\n- Using a noisy appliance like a blender early in the morning when others are still sleeping can be disruptive and disrespectful to the roommates' need for rest.\n- This action could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it disturbs their sleep.\n\nBased on these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong due to its insensitivity and disrespect towards the homeless person.\n- Scenario 2 also involves an action that is morally questionable because it disregards the needs and comfort of the roommates.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
