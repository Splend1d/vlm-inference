That is, for all \\( a, b \\in G \\),\n\\[ f(ab) = f(a)f(b). \\]\n\nFor any two groups \\( G \\) and \\( G' \\), we can always define the trivial homomorphism (also known as the zero homomorphism or the constant homomorphism), which maps every element of \\( G \\) to the identity element of \\( G' \\). This mapping satisfies the homomorphism property because the identity element in any group commutes with all other elements under the group operation.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\n\nA homomorphism being one-to-one means that it is injective; i.e., if \\( f(a) = f(b) \\), then \\( a = b \\). However, not all homomorphisms are injective. For example, consider the trivial homomorphism mentioned above, where every element of \\( G \\) is mapped to the identity element of \\( G' \\). This mapping is clearly not one-to-one unless \\( G \\) itself is the trivial group containing only the identity element.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. True, False"
