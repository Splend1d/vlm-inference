She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies\nB. Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations\nC. Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n"

The low serum glucose concentration (30 mg/dL) further supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the history of stress and recent increase in alcohol consumption, which can contribute to hypoglycemia, the next appropriate step would be to investigate the cause of the hypoglycemia. Among the options provided:\n\nA. Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies - This could help identify an autoimmune cause of hypoglycemia, such as insulinoma or insulin resistance.\nB. Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations - These measurements are more relevant for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency, which is not suggested by the clinical presentation.\nC. Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations - These are more relevant for diagnosing growth hormone deficiency or acromegaly, which are not indicated by the patient's symptoms.\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations - This would help determine if there is an inappropriate secretion of insulin, which could indicate an insulinoma or other causes of endogenous hyperinsulinism.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be:\n\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n\nThis will help differentiate between endogenous hyperinsulinism (such as from an insulinoma) and exogenous insulin administration (which might occur in cases of factitious hypoglycemia)."
