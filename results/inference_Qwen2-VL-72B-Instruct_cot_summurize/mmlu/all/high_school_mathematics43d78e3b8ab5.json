We can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{(7)^2 - 4(3)(-10)}}{2(3)}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{6}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{6}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{6}\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\(x\\):\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{-7 + 13}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\\]\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{-7 - 13}{6} = \\frac{-20}{6} = -\\frac{10}{3}\\]\n\nHowever, since \\(x\\) represents a dimension of a rectangle, it must be positive. Therefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 1\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1"
