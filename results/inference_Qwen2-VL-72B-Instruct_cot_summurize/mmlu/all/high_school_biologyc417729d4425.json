Lake B is alkaline.**\n- pH values above 7 indicate an alkaline solution. Since Lake B has a pH of 6.0, it is not alkaline but rather acidic. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**B. Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.**\n- This statement is incorrect because Lake B is actually less alkaline (more acidic) than Lake A. Additionally, the term \"alkaline\" does not apply to Lake B since its pH is below 7.\n\n**C. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.**\n- The relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration (\\([H^+]\\)) is given by:\n  \\[\n  [H^+] = 10^{-pH}\n  \\]\n  For Lake B with a pH of 6.0:\n  \\[\n  [H^+] = 10^{-6} \\text{ M}\n  \\]\n  This means the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is \\(10^{-6}\\) M, not 104 M. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n**D. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.**\n- Acid rain contains acidic components such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid, which can lower the pH of water bodies. Since both lakes have pH values that could be affected by additional acidity, it is reasonable to conclude that the pH of both lakes would decrease if exposed to acid rain. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct statement is:\n\n**D. The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.**"
