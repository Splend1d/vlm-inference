While the Middle Paleolithic was characterized by the widespread use of stone hand axes and other similar tools, the Upper Paleolithic saw a decline in their use and an increase in the production of more specialized and finely crafted tools made from materials like bone, antler, and ivory. This change reflects advancements in technology and a more diverse range of activities, including art, clothing, and more sophisticated hunting techniques."
