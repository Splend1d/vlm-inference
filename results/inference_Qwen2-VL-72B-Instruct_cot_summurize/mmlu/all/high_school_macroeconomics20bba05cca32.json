This helps to boost aggregate demand, which can lead to increased economic activity, job creation, and ultimately help pull the economy out of recession. Increasing government spending directly injects money into the economy, while reducing taxes leaves more disposable income in the hands of consumers and businesses, encouraging them to spend and invest more."
