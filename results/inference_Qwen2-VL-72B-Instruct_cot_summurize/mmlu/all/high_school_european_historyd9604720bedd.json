I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following motivations for exploration is most evident from the document above?\n\nA. The rise of mercantilism gave the state a new role in promoting commercial development and the acquisition of colonies overseas.\nB. European states sought direct access to gold and spices and luxury goods as a means to enhance personal wealth and state power.\nC. Individual captains sought great glory and wealth.\nD. Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the content of Hernan Cortez's letter:\n\n1. **Religious Motivation**: The letter mentions teaching the Indians about the worship of one God and turning away from their idols and practices, which indicates a strong religious motivation to spread Christianity.\n\n2. **Subjugation of Indigenous Peoples**: The letter also discusses the prohibition of certain customs (like cannibalism) and the need for the Indians to submit to the imperial yoke, suggesting a desire to culturally and physically subjugate the indigenous population.\n\n3. **Protection and Rule**: There is mention of protecting the lives and property of the Indians, but this is framed within the context of establishing Spanish rule and obedience to the Spanish crown.\n\nGiven these points, the most evident motivation from the document is related to spreading Christianity and justifying the subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations."
