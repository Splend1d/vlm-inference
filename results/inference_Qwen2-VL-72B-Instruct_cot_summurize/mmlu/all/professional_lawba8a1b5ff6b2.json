She left the store without paying for it. Unknown to the girl, the store security guard saw what she had done. He immediately ran outside, grabbed her arm, and accused her of stealing the candy bar. The girl broke down and started crying. She then told the security guard that she was hungry because she hadn't eaten any lunch. At a juvenile delinquency court hearing, the security guard proposes to testify to what the girl said. Upon objection by the girl's attorney, the strongest reason for admitting her statement will be because\n\nA. Miranda warnings need not be given to juveniles.\nB. the security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation.\nC. the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\nD. the girl was not in custody.\n"

In legal terms, statements made in response to an accusation are generally admissible as they are considered spontaneous and not coerced. This contrasts with statements made during an interrogation, which require Miranda warnings to ensure the rights of the individual are protected. Since the security guard's action was more akin to an immediate reaction to witnessing the theft rather than a structured interrogation, the girl's statement can be admitted as evidence."
