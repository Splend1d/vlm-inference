He argues against genetic enhancement primarily on the grounds of fairness and justice. Sandel emphasizes that allowing genetic enhancement could exacerbate social inequalities by creating a divide between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot. This would lead to an unfair society where advantages are determined by one's economic status rather than merit or effort.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Its use would be unsafe.\n- While safety concerns might be relevant, they are not the primary focus of Sandel's argument.\n\nB. Its use would be unfair.\n- This aligns closely with Sandel's main concern about genetic enhancement leading to increased social inequality and unfairness.\n\nC. Both of the above.\n- Although safety might be a secondary concern, it is not the central issue Sandel focuses on.\n\nD. None of the above.\n- This option is incorrect since Sandel does have specific concerns about genetic enhancement.\n\nBased on Sandel's primary argument, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Its use would be unfair."
