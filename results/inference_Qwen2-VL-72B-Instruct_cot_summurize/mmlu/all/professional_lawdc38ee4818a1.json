This means they can be admitted into evidence without further authentication or proof of their genuineness. The reasoning behind this rule is that newspapers are generally recognized as reliable sources of information and are widely distributed, making it reasonable to assume their authenticity. Therefore, Jan does not need to take additional steps to authenticate the newspaper before it can be admitted into evidence."
