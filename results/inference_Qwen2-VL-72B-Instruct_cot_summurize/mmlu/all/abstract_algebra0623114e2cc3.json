Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.\n- Not every ring has a multiplicative identity. For example, consider the ring of even integers (2Z), which does not have a multiplicative identity because there is no element \\( e \\) such that for every even integer \\( a \\), \\( ae = ea = a \\).\n\nTherefore, this statement is false.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
