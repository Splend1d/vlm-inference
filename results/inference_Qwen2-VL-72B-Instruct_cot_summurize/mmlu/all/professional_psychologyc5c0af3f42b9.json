Therefore, there seems to be no statement that is not about Z-scores based on the provided options. \n\nHowever, if we consider the context of the question and assume there might be an error in the formulation, it could be that the question intended to ask for a statement that does not directly relate to Z-scores but rather to another type of transformed score. In that case, none of the given statements fit the criteria since they all correctly describe Z-scores.\n\nThus, based on the provided options and their accuracy regarding Z-scores, there is no statement that is not about Z-scores."
