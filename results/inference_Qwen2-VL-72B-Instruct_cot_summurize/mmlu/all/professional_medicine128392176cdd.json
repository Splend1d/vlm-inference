He also has had a 13-kg (30-lb) weight loss and bulky, foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily. He has a 10-year history of drinking 8 to 10 beers daily. He has been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain 4 and 6 years ago. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. He appears cachectic and chronically ill. The abdomen is nontender. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present. His serum calcium concentration is 6.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Hypomagnesemia\nB. Hypoparathyroidism\nC. Osteomalacia\nD. Vitamin D deficiency\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Hypoparathyroidism.\n\nHypoparathyroidism is characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to decreased calcium absorption from the intestines and increased urinary excretion of calcium. This results in hypocalcemia, which can cause symptoms such as muscle cramps, numbness and tingling, and tetany (muscle spasms). The presence of Chvostek and Trousseau signs, which are clinical signs of hypocalcemia, further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's history of alcohol abuse and previous hospitalizations for abdominal pain suggest possible chronic pancreatitis, which can lead to malabsorption and weight loss. The bulky, foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily are consistent with steatorrhea, which is a symptom of fat malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nWhile hypomagnesemia, osteomalacia, and vitamin D deficiency can also cause hypocalcemia, they are less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia by impairing PTH secretion and action, but it typically presents with other electrolyte abnormalities and does not usually cause the symptoms described in this case. Osteomalacia and vitamin D deficiency can cause hypocalcemia by impairing calcium absorption from the intestines, but they typically present with bone pain and fractures rather than the symptoms described in this case."
