Don't let her do it again!\" can be considered an excited utterance, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. An excited utterance is a statement made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition, and it is made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This type of statement is considered reliable because it is spontaneous and not subject to reflection or fabrication. Therefore, the bystander's testimony about what they heard the customer say would be admissible as an excited utterance."
