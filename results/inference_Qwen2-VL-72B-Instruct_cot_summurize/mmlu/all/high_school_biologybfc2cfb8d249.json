The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic.\n\nIn fact, it is the opposite: the head of a phospholipid is hydrophilic (attracted to water), while the tails are hydrophobic (repelled by water). This property allows phospholipids to form bilayers in aqueous environments, which is fundamental to the structure of cell membranes."
