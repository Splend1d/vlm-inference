Yes, admission by party.\n\nOfficer Friendly's testimony about what Polly said is admissible because it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule known as \"admission by party.\" In legal proceedings, statements made by a party to the lawsuit (in this case, Polly) that are against their own interest can be admitted as evidence. Since Polly's statement acknowledges her negligence and responsibility for Justin's death, it is considered an admission by party and is therefore admissible in court."
