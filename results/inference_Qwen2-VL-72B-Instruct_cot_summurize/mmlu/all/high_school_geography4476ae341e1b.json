It does not provide enough information for an absolute location.\n\nC. \"3 degrees south\" - This could refer to a latitude of 3 degrees south of the equator, but it lacks a longitudinal component, making it incomplete for an absolute location.\n\nD. \"479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana\" - This is an absolute location because it provides a specific address that can be pinpointed on a map.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana"
