Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?\n\nA. Infraspinatus\nB. Pectoralis\nC. Subscapularis\nD. Supraspinatus\n"

Infraspinatus\n\nThe symptoms described, including pain reproduced with external rotation against resistance and no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness, suggest an injury to one of the rotator cuff muscles. The infraspinatus muscle, along with the teres minor, is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. Therefore, inflammation of the infraspinatus tendon is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms."
