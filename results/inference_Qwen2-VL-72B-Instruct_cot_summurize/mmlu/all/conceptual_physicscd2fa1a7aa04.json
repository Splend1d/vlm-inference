Let's denote the new velocity as \\( v' \\):\n\n\\[\nmv'^2 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mv^2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( v' \\):\n\n\\[\nv'^2 = 2v^2\n\\]\n\\[\nv' = \\sqrt{2}v\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find out how the momentum changes with this new velocity:\n\nOriginal momentum (\\( p \\)):\n\\[\np = mv\n\\]\n\nNew momentum (\\( p' \\)):\n\\[\np' = m(\\sqrt{2}v)\n\\]\n\\[\np' = \\sqrt{2}mv\n\\]\n\nComparing the new momentum to the original momentum:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p'}{p} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}mv}{mv}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{p'}{p} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41 \\), the momentum increases by approximately 41%, which is less than doubling but more than just increasing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. increases but less than doubles"
