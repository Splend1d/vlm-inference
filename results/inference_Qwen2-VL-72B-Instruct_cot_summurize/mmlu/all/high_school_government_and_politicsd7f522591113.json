While interest groups representing businesspeople and investors may have significant influence due to their financial resources, long-standing presence, and campaign contributions, it does not follow that they constitute the majority of voters in many districts. Voters typically consist of a diverse range of individuals with various interests and affiliations, and it would be unusual for businesspeople and investors alone to make up the majority of voters in most districts."
