Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such\n\nNaturalism posits that there are inherent moral principles that should guide the creation and interpretation of laws. These principles are considered universal and objective, transcending specific legal systems or state interests. In contrast, positivism asserts that laws are valid if they are enacted by legitimate authority within a given legal system, focusing on the formal and procedural aspects of law rather than underlying moral values."
