He also has been confused and agitated during this period. He has a history of mild hypertension. His current medication is a diuretic. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 70/47 mm Hg. Physical examination shows delayed capillary refill of the lips and nail beds and cool extremities. His oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein is 60% (N=70\u201375). These findings are most consistent with which of the following types of shock?\n\nA. Cardiogenic\nB. Distributive\nC. Hypovolemic\nD. Obstructive\n"

The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea suggest fluid loss, and his signs of confusion, agitation, low blood pressure, delayed capillary refill, and cool extremities are indicative of poor perfusion due to decreased intravascular volume. The low oxyhemoglobin saturation in the central vein further supports the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock, as it suggests poor tissue oxygenation due to inadequate blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Hypovolemic"
