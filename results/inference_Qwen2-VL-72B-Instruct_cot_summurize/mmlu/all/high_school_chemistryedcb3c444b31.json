This means that some of the collected gas is actually water vapor, which can affect the accuracy of measurements such as volume and pressure. To obtain accurate results, it is necessary to correct for the vapor pressure of water, which is the pressure exerted by the water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water at a given temperature. This correction involves subtracting the vapor pressure of water from the total pressure of the gas mixture to obtain the partial pressure of the dry gas."
