To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?\n\nA. Limestone is never pure CaCO3.\nB. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\nC. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\nD. Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.\n"

                    "text": "To determine why the student consistently obtained low results for the moles of carbon dioxide gas formed in the experiment, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Limestone is never pure CaCO3.**\n   - This could be a factor if the limestone contains impurities that do not react with the acid to produce carbon dioxide. However, this would imply that the limestone sample used was not entirely composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which might lead to lower yields of CO2.\n\nB. **Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.**\n   - Limestone is typically composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), not calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). If the limestone were calcium bicarbonate, it would react differently with the acid, but this is unlikely since limestone is predominantly CaCO3.\n\nC. **Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.**\n   - Carbon dioxide is indeed somewhat soluble in water, which means some of the CO2 produced could dissolve in the water used to collect the gas. This would result in a lower measured volume of CO2 than actually produced, leading to low results.\n\nD. **Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.**\n   - If there wasn't enough acid to fully react with the limestone, then not all the CaCO3 would be converted to CO2, resulting in a lower yield of CO2.\n\nGiven these options, the most plausible reasons for obtaining low results are:\n\n1. **Option A**: The limestone may contain impurities that do not react with the acid to produce CO2.\n2. **Option C**: Some of the CO2 produced dissolves in the water used to collect the gas, leading to a lower measured volume.\n3. **Option D**: There may not have been enough acid to completely dissolve all the limestone, resulting in incomplete reaction and thus lower CO2 production.\n\nAmong these, **Option C** (carbon dioxide being soluble in water) is particularly relevant because it directly affects the measurement process by causing a loss of CO2 during collection. Therefore, the most likely reason for the low results is:\n\n**C. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.**\n\nThis explanation aligns well with the experimental setup where CO2 is collected over water, making it a plausible cause for the observed discrepancy."
