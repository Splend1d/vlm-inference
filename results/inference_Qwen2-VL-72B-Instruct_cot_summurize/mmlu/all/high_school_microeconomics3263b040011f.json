The deadweight loss in this market would decrease.\n\nWhen a monopoly is regulated to produce at the allocative efficient quantity, it means that the output level is set where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal benefit (MB), which is also the point where price equals marginal cost (P=MC). This output level maximizes social welfare by eliminating the deadweight loss that typically occurs when a monopoly produces less than the socially optimal quantity and charges a higher price.\n\nIn an unregulated monopoly, the firm sets its price above marginal cost, leading to a deadweight loss due to underproduction. By regulating the monopoly to produce at the allocative efficient quantity, the government ensures that the price is closer to the competitive level, thereby reducing or eliminating the deadweight loss.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true:\n\nA. The monopoly might not break even; it could still make a profit or incur a loss depending on its costs and the regulated price.\nB. Similarly, the monopoly might not incur an economic loss; it could still make a profit if the regulated price covers its average total cost.\nC. The monopoly might make an economic profit, but this is not guaranteed as it depends on the specific costs and the regulated price."
