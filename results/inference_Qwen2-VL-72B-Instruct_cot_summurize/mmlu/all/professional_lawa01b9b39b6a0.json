The putrid smell from the slaughterhouse travels over the woman's property. The woman and her family members find the odor to be foul and nauseating. As a result of the man's slaughterhouse, the value of the woman's property was diminished by 20 percent, and the woman incurred expenses for prescription drugs to treat her family's nausea. There is no applicable zoning ordinance preventing the man's slaughterhouse operation. The woman has asserted a nuisance action against the man. The complaint seeks recovery for damages and injunctive relief enjoining operation of the slaughterhouse. The court should\n\nA. award damages, but not grant injunctive relief.\nB. grant injunctive relief, but not award damages.\nC. grant injunctive relief and award damages.\nD. neither award damages nor grant injunctive relief, because there was no violation of any ordinance.\n"

The foul and nauseating odor has diminished the value of her property and caused health issues requiring medical treatment. Even though there is no applicable zoning ordinance preventing the slaughterhouse operation, the actions of the man have created a private nuisance that affects the woman's enjoyment and use of her property.\n\nThe court can grant injunctive relief to stop the nuisance (the operation of the slaughterhouse) and award damages to compensate the woman for the loss in property value and the medical expenses incurred. The absence of a zoning ordinance does not preclude the court from providing relief under common law principles of nuisance."
