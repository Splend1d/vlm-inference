Armed attack includes all high intensity instances of armed force\n\nAccording to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, an \"armed attack\" refers to a situation where there is a significant use of armed force against a state. This article allows states to exercise individual or collective self-defense in response to such an attack. It does not include all types of armed force (option A) or specifically mention terrorist attacks (option C). Additionally, it does not give the right to invade the aggressor state (option D), but rather permits defensive measures to repel the attack and restore international peace and security."
