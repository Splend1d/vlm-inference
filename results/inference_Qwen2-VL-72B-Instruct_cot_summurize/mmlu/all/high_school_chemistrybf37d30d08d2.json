                    "text": "The solubility of a substance decreases with increasing temperature when the dissolution process is exothermic. This is because the dissolution process releases heat, and according to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will try to counteract the increase in temperature by shifting the equilibrium towards the reactants (the undissolved solid), thus decreasing the solubility.\n\nGiven that cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water than in cold, we can infer that the dissolution of cerium(III) sulfate is exothermic. Therefore, the correct conclusion related to this observation is:\n\nA. The heat of solution of cerium(III) sulfate is exothermic."
