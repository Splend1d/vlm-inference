The contract provided that the closing would be 60 days after the contract was signed and that the seller would convey to the buyer a \"marketable title\" by a quitclaim deed at closing. The contract contained no other provisions regarding the title to be delivered to the buyer. A title search revealed that the land was subject to an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement over a portion of the land. The buyer now claims that the title is unmarketable and has refused to close. Is the buyer correct?\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. quitclaim deed.\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\nD. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n"

Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\nIn real estate transactions, a marketable title is one that is free from any defects or encumbrances that could reasonably affect the value or use of the property. An unsatisfied mortgage is a significant defect in the title because it represents a lien on the property that must be satisfied before clear ownership can be transferred. This lien could potentially give the mortgage holder the right to foreclose on the property if the debt is not paid off. Therefore, the presence of an unsatisfied mortgage renders the title unmarketable, giving the buyer grounds to refuse to close on the transaction."
