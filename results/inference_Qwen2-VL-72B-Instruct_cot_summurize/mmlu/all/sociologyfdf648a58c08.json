It specifies the poverty line at a level set in the 1960s and adjusted since to reflect inflation.\n\nThis definition refers to the official poverty measure established by the U.S. Census Bureau, which uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is considered poor. These thresholds are updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The measure does not include non-cash benefits like Medicaid or public housing, nor does it adjust for geographic differences in the cost of living."
