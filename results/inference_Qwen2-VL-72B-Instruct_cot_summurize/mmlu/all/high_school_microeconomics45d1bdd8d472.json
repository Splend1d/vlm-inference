The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nHere's why: \n\nWhen Nancy chooses to study for an hour instead of babysitting, she gives up the $8 she could have earned by babysitting. This $8 is the opportunity cost of studying. For Nancy to choose studying over babysitting, it must be that the benefit (or value) she receives from studying is greater than this opportunity cost of $8. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the opportunity cost of studying is not $14; it's $8 (the wage from babysitting). Option C is incorrect because Nancy chose to study, indicating she prefers studying over mowing the lawn. Option D is incorrect because Nancy's choice can still be rational if the benefit of studying outweighs the opportunity cost, even though babysitting pays more in monetary terms."
