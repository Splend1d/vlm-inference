The molar mass of \\(O_2\\) is:\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nSince there are two oxygen atoms per molecule of \\(O_2\\), its molar mass is:\n\\[ 2 \\times 16.00 \\text{ g/mol} = 32.00 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the mass of 2.00 moles of \\(O_2\\):\n\\[ \\text{Mass of } O_2 = \\text{Number of moles of } O_2 \\times \\text{Molar mass of } O_2 = 2.00 \\text{ moles} \\times 32.00 \\text{ g/mol} = 64.0 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the quantity of oxygen (\\(O_2\\)) that contains very nearly the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water is 64.0 grams.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 64.0 grams"
