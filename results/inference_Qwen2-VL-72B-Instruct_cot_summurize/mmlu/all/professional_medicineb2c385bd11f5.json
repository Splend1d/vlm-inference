Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Complete blood count\nC. Determination of serum albumin concentration\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level\n"

Determination of serum albumin concentration.\n\nWeight loss, lack of appetite, and nausea can be indicative of several underlying conditions, including malnutrition. Serum albumin levels can provide insight into a patient's nutritional status and overall health. A low serum albumin level may suggest protein-energy malnutrition, which can be exacerbated by conditions like congestive heart failure and certain medications.\n\nWhile the other options (chest x-ray, complete blood count, and determination of serum digoxin level) might also be relevant depending on the clinical context, they do not directly address the issue of poor appetite and weight loss as effectively as measuring serum albumin concentration would. A chest x-ray might be useful if there were signs or symptoms suggesting a respiratory issue, a complete blood count could help identify anemia or infection, and a serum digoxin level would be important if there were concerns about toxicity or underdosing, but these are not the primary concerns based on the information provided."
