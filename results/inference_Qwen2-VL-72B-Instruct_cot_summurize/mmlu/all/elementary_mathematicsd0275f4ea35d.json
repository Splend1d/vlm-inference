So, it seats \\(200 - 20 = 180\\) people.\n3. **Green Section**: Seats 2 times as many people as the blue section. So, it seats \\(2 \\times 180 = 360\\) people.\n\nNow, adding the capacities of all three sections together:\n\n\\[200 (Red) + 180 (Blue) + 360 (Green) = 740\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who can sit in the baseball park is **740**.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 740**."
