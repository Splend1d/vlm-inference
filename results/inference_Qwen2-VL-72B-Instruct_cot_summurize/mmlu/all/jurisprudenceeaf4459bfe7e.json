                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the distinction between the will theory of rights and the interest theory of rights. The will theory posits that rights are based on the will or choice of individuals, and it assumes a direct correlation between rights and duties. In contrast, the interest theory focuses on the interests of individuals rather than their wills.\n\nWe are asked to identify which option formulates the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.**\n   - This option still implies a direct relationship between X's interest and Y's duty, which aligns more with the will theory's assumption of correlativity.\n\nB. **Accepting that conferring right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.**\n   - This option suggests that recognizing an interest leads to the conferring of a right. While it acknowledges the importance of interests, it does not explicitly reject the correlativity of rights and duties.\n\nC. **Treating an interest as the exercise of choice.**\n   - This option conflates interest with choice, which leans towards the will theory rather than the interest theory.\n\nD. **Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties - only when they are actually imposed.**\n   - This option clearly separates the recognition of an interest from the imposition of duties. It states that X has a right based on the recognition of an interest, independent of whether duties are actually imposed. This formulation avoids the assumption of correlativity inherent in the will theory.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the one that successfully formulates the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties - only when they are actually imposed.**"
