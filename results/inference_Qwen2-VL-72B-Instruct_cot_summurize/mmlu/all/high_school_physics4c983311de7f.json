This statement is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity always acts downward, regardless of whether the projectile is moving upward or downward.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because the speed at the top of the trajectory is not zero; only the vertical component of the velocity is zero, while the horizontal component remains constant.\n- C. This statement is incorrect because the total speed (resultant of horizontal and vertical components) changes throughout the flight due to the changing vertical component.\n- D. This statement is correct because the vertical speed decreases as the projectile ascends due to gravity and increases as it descends due to gravity."
