She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC. Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem\nD. Review the patient's sexual history\n"

Recommend behavioral therapy\n\nGiven the patient's history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence associated with anxiety about flying and prior to examinations, it suggests a psychosomatic or stress-related condition rather than a physical one. Since the urinalysis and urine culture are normal, there is no evidence of a urinary tract infection or other organic cause for her symptoms.\n\nBehavioral therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be effective in managing anxiety-related conditions and may help the patient cope with her fear of flying and exam-related stress. This approach can teach the patient strategies to manage her anxiety and reduce the associated urinary symptoms.\n\nPsychoanalytic psychotherapy (option B) might also be beneficial but is generally more time-consuming and less focused on symptom management compared to CBT. Avoiding stressful activities (option C) is not a practical long-term solution and could limit the patient's quality of life. Reviewing the patient's sexual history (option D) does not seem relevant to the current presentation of symptoms related to anxiety and travel."
