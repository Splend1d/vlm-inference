This stage of vocalization occurs before the infant begins to produce sounds that are characteristic of the language(s) they are exposed to, usually around the age of 6-8 months. After this initial period, the babbling becomes more influenced by the phonetic structures of the languages the infant hears, leading to the production of sounds and patterns that are specific to those languages."
