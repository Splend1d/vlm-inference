                    "text": "To determine which living organisms most resemble the common ancestor of all life based on genetic testing, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Viruses**: Viruses are not considered living organisms by many definitions because they cannot reproduce outside of a host cell. They lack cellular structures and do not perform metabolic functions independently.\n\nB. **Bacteria such as E. coli**: Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotes with relatively simple cellular structures. They have been around for billions of years and are often considered some of the earliest forms of life. However, they have evolved significantly since the origin of life.\n\nC. **Organisms living deep in the oceans around seafloor volcanic vents and in hot springs**: These organisms, often referred to as extremophiles, live in extreme environments that are thought to be similar to conditions on early Earth. They include archaea and certain types of bacteria that can survive in high temperatures, high pressure, and other harsh conditions. These organisms are often considered to be more closely related to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) due to their ability to thrive in environments similar to those hypothesized for early Earth.\n\nD. **Plankton that use sunlight as an energy source through photosynthesis**: Plankton, including phytoplankton, are primarily photosynthetic organisms. While photosynthesis is a crucial process in the history of life on Earth, it is a complex biochemical pathway that likely developed after the emergence of simpler life forms.\n\nGiven this analysis, the organisms that most closely resemble the common ancestor of all life according to genetic testing are likely those found in extreme environments such as deep-sea vents and hot springs. These organisms have retained many primitive characteristics and are adapted to conditions that may have been prevalent when life first emerged.\n\n**Final answer: C. Organisms living deep in the oceans around seafloor volcanic vents and in hot springs.**"
