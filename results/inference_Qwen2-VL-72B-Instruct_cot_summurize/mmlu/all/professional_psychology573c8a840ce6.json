According to this rule, if the selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than 80% of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate, then the procedure may be considered to have an adverse impact on the underrepresented group. This rule is often used in conjunction with other analyses to ensure that employment practices are fair and non-discriminatory."
