A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should\n\nA. grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\nB. grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.\nC. deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.\nD. deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.\n"

However, this protection does not apply when the subsequent prosecution is brought by a different sovereign entity. In this scenario, the state and the city are considered separate sovereigns, each with their own authority to enforce laws within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the city can prosecute the defendant for the same incident under its own anti-smoking ordinance without violating the defendant's rights against double jeopardy."
