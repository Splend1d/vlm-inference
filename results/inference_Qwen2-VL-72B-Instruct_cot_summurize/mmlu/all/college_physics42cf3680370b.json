These measurements provide information about the orbit but not about the mass of the moon itself.\n\n2. **Mass of the planet**: Using Kepler's laws and the principles of gravitational force, it is possible to calculate the mass of the planet if you know the period of the orbit and the semi-major axis (which can be derived from the minimum and maximum distances). Specifically, the mass of the planet can be found using the formula for the orbital period \\( T \\) in terms of the semi-major axis \\( a \\) and the masses of the two bodies:\n   \\[\n   T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M + m)}a^3\n   \\]\n   where \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the planet, \\( m \\) is the mass of the moon, and \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis. Since we don't have the mass of the moon, we can assume \\( m \\ll M \\), simplifying the equation to:\n   \\[\n   T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}a^3\n   \\]\n   Thus, knowing \\( T \\) and \\( a \\), we can solve for \\( M \\).\n\n3. **Minimum speed of the moon**: The minimum speed of the moon occurs at the maximum distance from the planet (apogee). This can be calculated using the conservation of angular momentum or by considering the elliptical nature of the orbit and applying the vis-viva equation:\n   \\[\n   v_{min} = \\sqrt{\\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r_{max}} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mu \\) is the standard gravitational parameter of the planet, \\( r_{max} \\) is the maximum distance, and \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis.\n\n4. **Period of the orbit**: The period of the orbit can be calculated using Kepler's third law, which relates the period \\( T \\) to the semi-major axis \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}a^3\n   \\]\n   Once again, \\( a \\) can be derived from the minimum and maximum distances, and \\( M \\) can be approximated as described earlier.\n\nGiven this analysis, the quantity that **cannot** be calculated from the provided measurements is:\n\n**A.
