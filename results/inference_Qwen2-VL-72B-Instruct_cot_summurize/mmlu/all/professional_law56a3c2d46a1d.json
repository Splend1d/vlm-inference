The senator claimed that the allegations in the newspaper story were false, and he brought a defamation action against the newspaper. Which of the following is the most accurate statement with regard to the newspaper's liability?\n\nA. A qualified privilege of fair comment existed because the newspaper was reporting on a matter of public interest.\nB. Because the senator is a public figure, he has the burden of proof to show malice on the part of the newspaper.\nC. The newspaper would not be liable because, under the First Amendment's freedom of the press, the newspaper was privileged to publish the story.\nD. The newspaper would be relieved of any liability for defamation because an absolute privilege existed.\n"

Because the senator is a public figure, he has the burden of proof to show malice on the part of the newspaper.\n\nIn defamation cases involving public figures, such as politicians, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning they knew the information was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. This standard is established by the landmark Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Therefore, the senator would need to demonstrate that the newspaper either knew the allegations were false or acted with reckless disregard for their truthfulness."
