However, this contradicts the fact that \\( f(z) \\) is analytic and non-constant (since a non-constant analytic function cannot map an uncountable set like the imaginary axis onto another uncountable set like the real axis without violating the open mapping theorem).\n   - If \\( f(z) \\) maps the imaginary axis onto a single point, it implies that \\( f(z) \\) is constant on the imaginary axis, which contradicts the fact that \\( f(z) \\) is analytic and non-constant.\n   - A ray or an open finite interval are possibilities, but we need to consider the implications more carefully.\n\n5. **Open Mapping Theorem**:\n   - The open mapping theorem states that if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic and non-constant, then it maps open sets to open sets.\n   - The imaginary axis is not an open set, but its image under \\( f(z) \\) must still be an open set since \\( f(z) \\) is analytic and non-constant.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**D. an open finite interval**\n\nThis conclusion follows from the fact that the image of the imaginary axis under \\( f(z) \\) must be an open set due to the open mapping theorem, and among the given options, an open finite interval is the only one that fits this description."
