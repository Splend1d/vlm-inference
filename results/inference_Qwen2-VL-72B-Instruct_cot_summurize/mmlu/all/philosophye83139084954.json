Utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize overall happiness or utility, could lead to policies that benefit the majority at the expense of the minority. Since parties in the original position cannot know whether they will be part of the majority or the minority, accepting utilitarianism would be too risky for them. They might instead choose principles that ensure basic rights and fair distribution of resources, even if this does not maximize overall happiness."
