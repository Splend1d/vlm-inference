If there is a range of possible amounts and no single amount within that range is more likely than any other, the company should use the midpoint of the range as the amount to be accrued. \n\nIn this case, the range is from $150,000 to $200,000. The midpoint of this range is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{\\text{Lower Limit} + \\text{Upper Limit}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{$150,000 + $200,000}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{$350,000}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Midpoint} = $175,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Dari Inc. should accrue a contingent liability of $175,000 on its December 31 balance sheet."
