A defendant is the owner of a car that he permits a friend, whom he knows to have been drinking that night, to drive. As a consequence, the friend is involved in an accident that causes a victim's death.\n\nWhile the owner of the car may face civil liability or other legal consequences for allowing an intoxicated person to drive, criminal liability typically requires a higher standard of proof and intent. In this scenario, the owner did not directly engage in the act that caused the death (driving while intoxicated), and proving criminal intent might be more challenging compared to the other scenarios where the defendants had direct knowledge of and were facilitating illegal activities."
