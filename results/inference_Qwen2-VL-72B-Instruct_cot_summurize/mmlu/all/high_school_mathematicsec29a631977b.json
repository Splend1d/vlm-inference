                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a pair from a standard 52-card deck. A pair consists of two cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to draw any 3 cards from the deck. This can be done using combinations, denoted as \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 3 cards from a 52-card deck is:\n\\[ C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to draw a pair:\n\n1. Choose a rank for the pair: There are 13 ranks (Ace through King).\n2. Choose 2 out of the 4 cards of that rank: \\( C(4, 2) \\)\n3. Choose a different rank for the third card: There are 12 remaining ranks.\n4. Choose 1 out of the 4 cards of that rank: \\( C(4, 1) \\)\n\nSo, the number of ways to draw a pair is:\n\\[ 13 \\times C(4, 2) \\times 12 \\times C(4, 1) \\]\n\\[ = 13 \\times \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \\times 12 \\times \\frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} \\]\n\\[ = 13 \\times \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} \\times 12 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ = 13 \\times 6 \\times 12 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ = 78 \\times 48 \\]\n\\[ = 3744 \\]\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing a pair is the number of ways to draw a pair divided by the total number of ways to draw any 3 cards:\n\\[ P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744}{C(52, 3)} \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( C(52, 3) \\):\n\\[ C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{132600}{6} \\]\n\\[ = 22100 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the probability:\n\\[ P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100} \\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 3744 and 22100 is 4.\n\n\\[ P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744 \\div 4}{22100 \\div 4} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{936}{5525} \\]\n\nThis fraction does not match any of the provided options directly. However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question or the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the calculation with the correct approach.\n\nUpon reevaluation, I realize that my initial calculation was incorrect. The correct approach should consider the total number of ways to draw any 3 cards without restriction and then calculate the probability based on the number of favorable outcomes (drawing a pair).\n\nThe correct calculation for the total number of ways to draw any 3 cards from a 52-card deck is:\n\\[ C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100 \\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to draw a pair is correctly calculated as:\n\\[ 13 \\times C(4, 2) \\times 12 \\times C(4, 1) = 3744 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a pair is:\n\\[ P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100} \\]\n\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n\\[ P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{936}{5525} \\]\n\nHowever, this fraction does not match any of the provided options.
