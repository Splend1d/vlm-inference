It focuses on the intentions behind actions rather than their consequences.\n\nB. **Application of the Ethics of Prima Facie Duty**: This involves duties that are binding unless overridden by other duties. It is more about weighing different duties rather than a specific ethical framework.\n\nC. **Virtue Ethics Approach**: This approach centers on the development of good character traits and virtues. It focuses on the moral character of the person performing the action rather than the action itself or its consequences.\n\nD. **Natural Law Theory Approach**: This approach argues that there are inherent moral principles derived from human nature and reason, which guide what is right and wrong.\n\nGiven that Sandel's arguments often revolve around the intrinsic value of human nature and the potential dangers of altering it through technologies like genetic engineering, his stance aligns well with the idea of preserving natural human characteristics and the inherent moral order.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting description for Sandel's case against moral engineering would be:\n\n**D. a natural law theory approach.**"
