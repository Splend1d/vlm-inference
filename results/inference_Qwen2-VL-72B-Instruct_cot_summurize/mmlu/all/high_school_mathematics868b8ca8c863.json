An isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 2, 2, 3\n- This is an isosceles triangle with two sides of equal length (2 and 2) and the third side being 3. The sum of any two sides is greater than the third side (2+2>3, 2+3>2, 3+2>2), so this can form an isosceles triangle.\n\nB. 2, 2, 4\n- This is not an isosceles triangle because the sum of the two equal sides (2+2=4) is not greater than the third side (4). In fact, it equals the third side, violating the triangle inequality theorem.\n\nC. 4, 12, 12\n- This is an isosceles triangle with two sides of equal length (12 and 12) and the third side being 4. The sum of any two sides is greater than the third side (12+12>4, 12+4>12, 12+4>12), so this can form an isosceles triangle.\n\nD. 5, 5, 5\n- This is an equilateral triangle, which is a special case of an isosceles triangle where all three sides are equal. The sum of any two sides is greater than the third side (5+5>5, 5+5>5, 5+5>5), so this can form an isosceles triangle.\n\nTherefore, the set of lengths that could NOT be the sides of an isosceles triangle is **B. 2, 2, 4**."
