They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs\n\nIdeational approaches to US foreign policy during the Cold War emphasize the role of ideas, beliefs, and values in shaping international relations. This perspective highlights the importance of ideological competition between capitalism and communism as a driving force behind many of the policies and actions taken by the United States and its adversaries during this period.\n\nIn contrast, Realist accounts focus more on material interests and power dynamics, such as military capabilities, territorial control, and balance of power considerations. While Realists acknowledge the influence of ideology, they tend to view it as secondary to the pursuit of national security and strategic advantage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs"
