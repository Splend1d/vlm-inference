If judges have strong discretion, it implies they can make different decisions for similar cases, suggesting multiple possible answers rather than a single right answer.\n\n4. **Option D: Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.**\n   - This aligns with Dworkin\u2019s view as well, since seeking the best fit with historical context implies a search for the singular correct interpretation grounded in precedent and tradition.\n\nGiven this analysis, the proposition that is most inconsistent with Dworkin\u2019s claim is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. Judges exercise strong discretion.**"
