This is a strong indicator that the rock is a meteorite.\n\nB. **It contains solidified spherical droplets (chondrules)**: Chondrules are small, round particles found in many meteorites. Their presence is a significant indicator that the rock might be a meteorite.\n\nC. **It is highly processed**: This term is vague and could refer to various processes. However, if \"highly processed\" means that the rock has been altered or modified significantly by human activity or geological processes on Earth, this would not necessarily indicate that the rock is a meteorite. In fact, it could suggest the opposite.\n\nD. **It has a different elemental composition than Earth**: Meteorites often have distinct elemental compositions compared to terrestrial rocks. Finding elements or isotopic ratios that do not match those typically found on Earth can be a strong indicator that the rock is a meteorite.\n\nGiven this analysis, the characteristic that would not necessarily suggest that a rock we found is a meteorite is:\n\n**C. It is highly processed**"
