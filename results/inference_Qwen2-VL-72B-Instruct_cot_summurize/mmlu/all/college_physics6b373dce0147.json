For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is equal to the radius \\( R \\) of the orbit.\n\nKepler's Third Law can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[ T^2 \\propto R^3 \\]\n\nThis means that the orbital period \\( T \\) is proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. proportional to \\( R^{3/2} \\)"
