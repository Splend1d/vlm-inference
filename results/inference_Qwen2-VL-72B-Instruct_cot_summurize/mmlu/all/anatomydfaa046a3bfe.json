The articular surfaces of the TMJ are covered by fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\nProprioceptive information from the TMJ is carried by the auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve. The chorda tympani and deep temporal nerves do not carry proprioceptive information from the TMJ. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\nThe masseteric nerve is a motor nerve that innervates the masseter muscle, which is involved in chewing. It does not carry proprioceptive information from the TMJ. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage."
