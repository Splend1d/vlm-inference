Each day, the number of amoebas doubles because each amoeba splits into two new amoebas.\n\nStarting with 1 amoeba on Day 1, the number of amoebas after \\(n\\) days can be calculated as \\(2^n\\).\n\nSince we're looking at the end of one week, which is 7 days, we substitute \\(n = 7\\) into our formula:\n\n\\[2^7 = 128\\]\n\nTherefore, after one week, there will be 128 amoebas in the puddle.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 128."
