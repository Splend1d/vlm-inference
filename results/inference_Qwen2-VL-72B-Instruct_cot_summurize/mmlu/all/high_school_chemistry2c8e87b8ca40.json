Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC.

The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nLondon dispersion forces are a type of intermolecular force that arises from the attraction between temporary dipoles created by the movement of electrons within molecules. These forces are stronger when the electron clouds are more polarizable, which means they can be distorted more easily to create these temporary dipoles. Since chlorine atoms are larger and have more electrons than fluorine atoms, their electron clouds are more polarizable, leading to stronger London dispersion forces between Cl2 molecules compared to F2 molecules. This results in a higher boiling point for chlorine."
