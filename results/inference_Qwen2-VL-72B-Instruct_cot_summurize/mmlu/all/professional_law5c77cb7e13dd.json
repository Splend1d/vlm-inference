After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of their property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n\nThis option correctly reflects the principle that while the Fifth Amendment guarantees just compensation for takings, it does not mandate that payment must be made before the taking occurs. The requirement for just compensation can be satisfied by providing a mechanism for determining and awarding damages after the fact, which is consistent with the state court's order to deposit a sum deemed adequate to cover potential damages."
