As the man approached the rear of the woman's car, he became impatient and tried to pass her along a section of the highway designated as a no-passing zone. When the man swerved his car into the westbound lane to pass the woman, he didn't see another driver, who was rounding a curve in the westbound lane. In order to avoid a head-on collision with the man, the other driver swerved his car to the shoulder of the roadway. The other driver, however, was unable to control his car along the narrow strip of the shoulder, and it fell down the steep mountain. The man and the woman both saw the other driver's car slide down the hillside. They immediately stopped their vehicles and walked over to the edge of the roadway looking for the car. They saw the other driver's car overturned in a gully about 200 feet down the mountain. The man and the woman heard the other driver moaning and calling for help. However, the man and the woman failed to provide any assistance. They walked back to their cars and drove off. Although the man and the woman passed through a business area a short while later, they neither reported the accident nor sought aid for the other driver. Hours later, the other driver died from injuries suffered in the accident. If the man and the woman are subsequently prosecuted for the other driver's death, the most likely outcome would be that\n\nA. the man and the woman are both guilty of manslaughter.\nB. the man is guilty of manslaughter only.\nC. the woman is guilty of manslaughter only.\nD. neither the man nor the woman is guilty of manslaughter.\n"

To determine the most likely legal outcome if the man and the woman are prosecuted for the other driver's death, we need to consider the elements of manslaughter.\n\nManslaughter typically involves the unintentional killing of another person due to recklessness or negligence. In this case:\n\n1. **The Man's Actions:**\n   - The man attempted to pass the woman in a no-passing zone, which is inherently reckless behavior.\n   - His actions directly led to the other driver having to swerve onto the shoulder and eventually falling down the mountain.\n   - The man's reckless behavior can be seen as a direct cause of the other driver's death.\n\n2. **The Woman's Actions:**\n   - The woman was driving in front of the man and did not engage in any reckless behavior that contributed to the accident.\n   - She did not initiate the sequence of events that led to the other driver's death.\n\n3. **Failure to Provide Assistance:**\n   - Both the man and the woman witnessed the accident and heard the other driver calling for help.\n   - They chose not to assist the injured driver and did not report the accident or seek help.\n   - This failure to act could be considered a form of negligence, but it might not meet the threshold for manslaughter since the primary cause of death was the man's reckless driving.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely outcome would be:\n\n**B. The man is guilty of manslaughter only.**\n\nThe man's reckless behavior directly caused the accident and subsequent death, whereas the woman's actions did not contribute to the accident. The failure to provide assistance by both individuals might be addressed separately under different charges, such as failure to render aid, but it does not necessarily equate to manslaughter in this context."
