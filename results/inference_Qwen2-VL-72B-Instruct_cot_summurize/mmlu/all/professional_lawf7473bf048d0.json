He contacted an architect, who designed plans and specifications for a major \"facelift\" of the homeowner's home. The homeowner was very pleased with the plans and specifications. He showed the plans and specifications to his neighbor, who agreed that the facelift would greatly enhance the value of the homeowner's home. The homeowner contacted a contractor, who was considered to be the best in the area, to rebuild his house according to the plans and specifications. The contractor reviewed the plans and specifications and told the homeowner that he could do all the work called for by the plans and specifications for $100,000. The homeowner replied, \"That's a little more than I can afford. I really can only free up $80,000 for this project. Would you do it for that amount?\" The contractor responded, \"That's awfully low. I'll have to think about it,\" and then left. The next day, the neighbor telephoned the contractor. The neighbor explained to the contractor that he realized the value of his home would be enhanced by the improvement done to the homeowner's property. For that reason, the neighbor told the contractor he would pay him $10,000 if he would accept the homeowner's proposal and do the work called for by the plans and specifications. The contractor agreed. The next day the contractor informed the homeowner that he would accept his $80,000 offer. The contractor did all the work called for by the plans and specifications, and collected the $80,000 due him from the homeowner. However, the neighbor refused to pay the contractor the $10,000. If the contractor brings a breach of contract action against the neighbor, judgment for whom?\n\nA. The contractor, because his signing a contract with the homeowner and completing the work according to the plans and specifications was legally sufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise to pay him the $10,000.\nB. The contractor, provided the neighbor realizes an increase in his property value as a result of the work done by the contractor.\nC. The neighbor, because his promise to the contractor was illusory.\nD. The neighbor, because at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which was insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the contractor can successfully bring a breach of contract action against the neighbor, we need to analyze the elements of a valid contract and the concept of consideration.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Promise by Neighbor**: The neighbor promised to pay the contractor $10,000 if the contractor accepted the homeowner's proposal and completed the work according to the plans and specifications.\n\n2. **Consideration**:\n   - **Legal Consideration**: For a contract to be enforceable, there must be legal consideration on both sides. Consideration is something of value given by each party to the other.\n   - **Contract with Homeowner**: The contractor entered into a separate contract with the homeowner to perform the work for $80,000.\n   - **Neighbor's Promise**: The neighbor's promise to pay $10,000 was made after the contractor had already agreed to perform the work for the homeowner. This means the contractor had already undertaken a pre-existing obligation to complete the work for the homeowner.\n\n3. **Pre-Existing Obligation**:\n   - When the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he was already under a pre-existing obligation to perform the work. This obligation existed independently of any promise made by the neighbor.\n   - A pre-existing duty (the contractor's obligation to the homeowner) generally does not constitute new consideration to support a new promise (the neighbor's promise).\n\n4. **Illusory Promise**:\n   - The neighbor's promise to pay $10,000 was contingent upon the contractor accepting the homeowner's offer and performing the work. Since the contractor was already bound by the homeowner's contract, the neighbor's promise did not create new consideration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the contractor was already under a pre-existing obligation to perform the work for the homeowner when the neighbor made his promise, the neighbor's promise lacks new consideration to make it binding. Therefore, the neighbor's promise is unenforceable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. The neighbor, because at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which was insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise."
