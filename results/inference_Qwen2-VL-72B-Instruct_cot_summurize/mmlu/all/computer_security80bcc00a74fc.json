TLS provides integrity protection through message authentication codes (MACs), which ensure that any modification to the data will be detected. Therefore, TLS can protect against this type of attack.\n\n2. **An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client**:\n   - This describes eavesdropping or passive interception of data. TLS provides confidentiality through encryption, ensuring that the data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and cannot be read by an attacker without the decryption key. Therefore, TLS can protect against this type of attack as well.\n\nGiven these analyses, both types of attacks are protected against by TLS under the assumptions provided.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
