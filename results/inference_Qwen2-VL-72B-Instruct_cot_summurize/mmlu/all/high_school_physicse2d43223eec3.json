Since capacitance is directly proportional to the area, using smaller plates would decrease the capacitance.\n\nB. **Replacing the dielectric material between the plates with one that has a smaller dielectric constant**: The dielectric constant (\\( \\kappa \\)) affects the effective permittivity (\\( \\epsilon \\)) of the medium between the plates, where \\( \\epsilon = \\kappa \\epsilon_0 \\). A smaller dielectric constant would result in a smaller effective permittivity, thus decreasing the capacitance.\n\nC. **Decreasing the voltage between the plates**: The voltage does not affect the capacitance itself; capacitance is a property of the capacitor structure and materials. Changing the voltage does not change the capacitance.\n\nD. **Moving the plates closer together**: This would decrease the distance \\( d \\) between the plates. Since capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates, moving them closer together would increase the capacitance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Moving the plates closer together**"
