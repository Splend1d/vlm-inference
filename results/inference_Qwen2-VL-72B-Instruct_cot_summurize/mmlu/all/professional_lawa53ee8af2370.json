She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\n\nIn this scenario, the passenger was not actively participating in the operation of the vehicle or the decision-making process that led to the accident. Her act of smoking marijuana and blowing it out the window does not constitute active participation in the joint enterprise of driving. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim as she did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident."
