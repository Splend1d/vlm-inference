Negative reinforcements are used in classical conditioning, and punishments are used in operant conditioning.\nC. Punishments are primarily used when training an organism to perform a behavior and negative reinforcements are used to train an organism to stop performing a behavior.\nD. Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior.\n"

In contrast, punishment involves the application of an unpleasant stimulus or the removal of a pleasant one to decrease the likelihood of a behavior being repeated."
