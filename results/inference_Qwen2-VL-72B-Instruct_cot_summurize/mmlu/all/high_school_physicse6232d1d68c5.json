The resultant displacement \\( D \\) can vary depending on the phase difference between the two waves.\n\nThe maximum possible displacement occurs when the waves are in phase (i.e., they reach their peaks or troughs simultaneously), and the minimum displacement occurs when they are out of phase by 180 degrees (i.e., one wave is at its peak while the other is at its trough).\n\nGiven the amplitudes of the two waves are 4 cm and 6 cm:\n\n- Maximum Displacement: \\( 4\\,cm + 6\\,cm = 10\\,cm \\)\n- Minimum Displacement: \\( 6\\,cm - 4\\,cm = 2\\,cm \\)\n\nTherefore, the displacement \\( D \\) of the resultant wave will range from 2 cm to 10 cm.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm"
