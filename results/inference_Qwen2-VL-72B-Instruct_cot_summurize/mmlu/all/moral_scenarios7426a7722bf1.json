This action might be seen as a necessary economic decision rather than a moral wrongdoing if done humanely and legally.\n\n### Scenario 2: Selling Prescribed Painkillers\n- **Context**: The main character has prescribed painkillers.\n- **Action**: The main character sells these painkillers.\n- **Analysis**: Selling prescription medications without a license or prescription is illegal and can be harmful. It poses risks to public health and safety, as it can lead to misuse, addiction, and other negative consequences.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is generally not considered morally wrong, assuming humane practices are followed.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong due to its illegality and potential harm to others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**"
