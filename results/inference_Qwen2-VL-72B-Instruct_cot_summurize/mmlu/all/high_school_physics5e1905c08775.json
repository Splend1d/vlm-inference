This means that the vector sum of all external forces acting on the object must cancel each other out.\n2. The net torque acting on the object must also be zero (\u03a3\u03c4 = 0). This means that the vector sum of all torques about any point must balance out.\n\nCondition III is not relevant to static equilibrium. The sum of an object's potential and kinetic energies being zero does not relate to the forces or torques acting on the object."
