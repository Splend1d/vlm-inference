This means that the gene responsible for color blindness is located on the X chromosome, and it is recessive. A woman has two X chromosomes (XX), while a man has one X and one Y chromosome (XY). If a woman carries the recessive allele for color blindness on one of her X chromosomes, she may not display color blindness because her other X chromosome likely has the dominant allele for normal color vision. However, she can pass the recessive allele to her son.\n\nWhen a son inherits the X chromosome with the recessive allele from his mother and the Y chromosome from his father (which does not carry a corresponding gene for color vision), he will express the color blindness trait because there is no dominant allele on the Y chromosome to mask the recessive allele.\n\nTherefore, the defect transmitted by the woman represents a characteristic of her genotype (the genetic makeup) rather than her phenotype (the observable traits), as she displays normal color vision but carries the recessive allele for color blindness."
