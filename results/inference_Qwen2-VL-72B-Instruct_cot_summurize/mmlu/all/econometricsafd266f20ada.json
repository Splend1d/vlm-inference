It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude\n\nThe leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where volatility tends to increase more following negative returns (market downturns) than following positive returns (market upturns) of the same magnitude. Therefore, in a model that accounts for this leverage effect, the news impact curve would show a steeper rise for negative disturbances compared to positive ones."
