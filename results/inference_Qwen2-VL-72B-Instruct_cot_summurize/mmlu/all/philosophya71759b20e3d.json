According to this view, mental states can be understood solely through their behavioral manifestations and dispositions. This approach tends to downplay or even deny the existence of mental states as independent entities beyond observable behavior.\n\nCommon sense intuition, on the other hand, typically holds that mental states (such as beliefs, desires, and feelings) are real and have an existence separate from observable behavior. These mental states are believed to cause behavior.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Logical behaviorism would argue against the idea that mental states exist independently of behavior.\n- Common sense intuition supports the notion that mental states do exist and influence behavior.\n\nTherefore, the statement that logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states \"exist\" aligns well with the contrast between the two perspectives.\n\nThe final answer is:\nC. exist"
