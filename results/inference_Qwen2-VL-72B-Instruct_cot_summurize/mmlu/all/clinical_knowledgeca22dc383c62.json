They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords.\n\nWhen an endotracheal tube (ETT) is placed in a patient's trachea and the cuff is inflated, it seals off the airway to prevent leakage of gases and aspiration of fluids or foreign materials. The inflated cuff blocks the passage of air from the lungs to the larynx and mouth, which means that the patient cannot use their vocal cords to produce sound. Therefore, they are unable to speak."
