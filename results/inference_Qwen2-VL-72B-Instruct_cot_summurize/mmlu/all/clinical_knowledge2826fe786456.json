Using water may cause electrolyte imbalance.\n\nUsing water for bladder washout can lead to an electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyponatremia (low sodium levels), because water is hypotonic compared to the body's fluids. This can cause cells to swell and potentially lead to complications such as seizures or cerebral edema. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use isotonic solutions like normal saline for bladder washouts to maintain electrolyte balance."
