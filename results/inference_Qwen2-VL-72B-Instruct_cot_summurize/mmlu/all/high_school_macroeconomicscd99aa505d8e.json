The BoP consists of two main accounts: the current account and the capital account (which includes financial account in some frameworks).\n\nIf a country has a negative value on its current account, it means that the country is importing more than it is exporting or receiving less income from abroad than it is paying out. This deficit must be offset by an equivalent surplus in the capital account. The capital account records the net change in ownership of national assets, including foreign investments, loans, and other financial flows.\n\nTherefore, if there is a current account deficit, there must be a corresponding capital account surplus to balance the BoP. This could involve foreign investment flowing into the country, residents investing abroad, or changes in official reserves."
