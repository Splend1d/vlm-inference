Cohort study\n\nThe study described involves following a group of individuals (in this case, 500 women aged 40-54) over time to observe the development of a particular outcome (colorectal cancer). This is characteristic of a cohort study, where participants are selected based on their exposure status (vegetarian or non-vegetarian) and then followed prospectively to determine the incidence of disease.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Case series report: This type of study involves collecting data on a group of patients with a specific condition but does not involve comparison with a control group or follow-up over time.\n\nC. Case-control study: In this design, individuals with a disease (cases) are compared with those without the disease (controls) to identify factors that might be associated with the disease. The study described does not compare cases and controls; it follows a group over time.\n\nD. Cross-sectional study: This type of study assesses the prevalence of a disease or risk factor at a single point in time, rather than following participants over time as in a cohort study."
