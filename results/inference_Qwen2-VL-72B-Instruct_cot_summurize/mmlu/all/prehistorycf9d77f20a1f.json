The remaining options (A, B, and C) all have plausible percentages for the number of farmers in ancient Egypt.\n\nHowever, without specific historical data on the exact population size and the proportion of farmers during the time of the pharaohs, it is difficult to definitively choose between these options. Therefore, based on the given information alone, none of the options can be conclusively determined as correct. \n\nIf additional historical context or data were provided, it might help narrow down the choices further."
