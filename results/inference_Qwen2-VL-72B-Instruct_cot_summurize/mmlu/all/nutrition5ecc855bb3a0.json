No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\n"

Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nUrbanization can significantly impact hunger and malnutrition due to several factors:\n\n1. **Dependency on Purchased Food**: Urban residents often rely heavily on purchasing food from markets or stores rather than growing their own. This makes them more susceptible to fluctuations in food prices.\n\n2. **Food Price Sensitivity**: When food prices rise, urban poor are particularly vulnerable because they do not have the option of subsistence farming to supplement their diet. This can lead to reduced food intake and poorer quality diets, exacerbating malnutrition.\n\n3. **Access to Nutritious Food**: While urban areas may offer greater access to a variety of food products, the cost of nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, and animal-source proteins can be prohibitive for low-income urban dwellers.\n\n4. **Food Insecurity**: Urban poverty can lead to food insecurity, where individuals lack reliable access to sufficient quantities of affordable, nutritious food. This is a significant concern as urban populations grow.\n\nWhile urbanization can bring economic opportunities that might reduce poverty over time, the immediate effects on food security and nutrition can be challenging, especially for the urban poor. Therefore, addressing food price volatility and ensuring access to affordable, nutritious food is crucial in urban settings."
