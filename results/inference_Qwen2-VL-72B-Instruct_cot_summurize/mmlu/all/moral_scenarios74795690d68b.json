However, in this case, the purpose is recreational, which makes it less justifiable morally.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves cheating, which is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 involves speeding for a non-emergency reason, which is also morally questionable due to the potential danger and disregard for laws.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
