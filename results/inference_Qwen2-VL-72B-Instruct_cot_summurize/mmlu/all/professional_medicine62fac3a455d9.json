His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?\n\nA. Fructose intolerance\nB. Transient lactase deficiency\nC. Magnesium deficiency\nD. Regional enteritis\n"

Transient lactase deficiency\n\nThe scenario described suggests that the infant may be experiencing transient lactase deficiency, which can occur after an episode of gastroenteritis or dehydration. This condition leads to difficulty in digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products, resulting in symptoms such as watery diarrhea. The other options listed do not fit the clinical presentation as well:\n\n- A. Fructose intolerance typically presents with symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea but is less common and usually not associated with recent gastroenteritis.\n- C. Magnesium deficiency is rare in infants and would not typically present with isolated watery diarrhea without other signs of malnutrition or specific causes.\n- D. Regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that usually presents with more severe and persistent symptoms, including weight loss, abdominal pain, and sometimes blood in the stool, and is unlikely to develop suddenly after an episode of gastroenteritis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the infant's persistent watery diarrhea in this context is transient lactase deficiency."
