This results in a stronger acid because the conjugate base is more stable due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the central atom.\n\n2. **Bond Strength**: A stronger bond between the hydrogen and the central atom makes it harder for the hydrogen to leave as a proton, thus making the compound a weaker acid.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. H\u2082S**: Sulfur (S) has an electronegativity of about 2.58.\n- **B. HI**: Iodine (I) has an electronegativity of about 2.66.\n- **C. HBr**: Bromine (Br) has an electronegativity of about 2.96.\n- **D. H\u2082O**: Oxygen (O) has an electronegativity of about 3.44.\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- Oxygen (in H\u2082O) is the most electronegative, which means it will stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base the most effectively, making H\u2082O the strongest acid among the given options.\n- Sulfur (in H\u2082S) is the least electronegative, so it would make H\u2082S the weakest acid among these choices.\n\nTherefore, the strongest acid among the given options is:\n\n**D. H\u2082O**"
