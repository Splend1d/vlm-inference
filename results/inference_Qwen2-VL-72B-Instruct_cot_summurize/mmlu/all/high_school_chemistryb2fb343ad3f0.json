Among the given compounds, N2H4 (hydrazine) is the only one that is a volatile liquid at room temperature and can be easily separated by distillation due to its low boiling point. The other compounds (KCl, Fe(NO3)3, and MgSO4) are salts that do not have a defined boiling point in the same sense as organic liquids and would not be easily separable by distillation."
