The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\n\nExplanation:\nPrivity of contract refers to the principle that only parties to a contract can sue or be sued under it. In this scenario, the contract is between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard. The woman, although affected by the breach of contract, is not a party to the contract between the builder and the lumber yard. Therefore, she cannot sue the owner of the lumber yard directly for breach of contract due to lack of privity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no indication that the builder assigned their rights under the contract to the woman, which would be required for her to become an equitable assignee.\n\nOption B is incorrect because even if the contract between the builder and the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire, the woman still lacks standing to sue due to the absence of privity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because being an incidental beneficiary does not confer the right to sue on the woman; she must be a direct beneficiary or have privity of contract to have standing to sue."
