Glucose is then used to build other organic compounds, contributing significantly to the dry mass of the tree.\n\nD. **Endosperm located in the cotyledons of the acorn**: The endosperm provides initial nutrients for seedling growth, but it does not contribute significantly to the long-term dry mass of the mature tree.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air**."
