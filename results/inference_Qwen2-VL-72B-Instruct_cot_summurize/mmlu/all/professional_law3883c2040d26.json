The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded his deed. Some time later, the vintner purported to convey the vineyard to a farmer, for valuable consideration. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed. The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices. The applicable recording statute provides, \"Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. \" None of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein. Who owns the vineyard?\n\nA. The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer recorded.\nB. The friend and the wife, because the friend's deed would put the farmer on inquiry notice as to the wife's interest in the vineyard.\nC. The farmer, because the husband \u0080\u0094friend deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.\nD. The friend and the farmer, as tenants in common.\n"

                    "text": "To determine who owns the vineyard, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the impact of recording statutes.\n\n1. **Initial Ownership**: The vintner originally owned the vineyard in fee simple absolute.\n2. **First Sale**: The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common. This deed was not recorded.\n3. **Second Sale**: The husband then sold his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded this deed.\n4. **Third Sale**: The vintner, who still believed she owned the entire vineyard, sold it to a farmer. The farmer recorded her deed without knowledge of the previous transactions.\n\nGiven these facts and the recording statute:\n\n- **Recording Statute**: A conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith and for valuable consideration if the subsequent purchaser's deed is recorded first.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Friend's Deed**: The friend recorded his deed first. He owns his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard.\n- **Farmer's Deed**: The farmer recorded her deed after the friend but without knowledge of the previous transactions. According to the recording statute, her deed is valid against all prior unrecorded interests except those that would put her on inquiry notice.\n\nSince none of the grantees have taken possession in a way that would put anyone on inquiry notice, the farmer's deed is valid against the unrecorded interest of the wife.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe friend owns his undivided one-half interest, and the farmer owns the other half. Therefore, they own the vineyard as tenants in common.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. The friend and the farmer, as tenants in common."
