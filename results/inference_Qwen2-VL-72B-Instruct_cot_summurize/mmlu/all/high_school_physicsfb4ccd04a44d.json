The force of the man on the scale\n\nAccording to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In this case, the man's weight (the force exerted by gravity on the man) is the action. The reaction to this force is the force that the man exerts downward on the scale, which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to his weight."
