Brittany likes fish: \\( F \\)\n2. Brittany likes lizards: \\( L \\)\n3. Brittany does not like cats: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nThe sentence states that Brittany likes both fish and lizards, which can be represented as:\n\\[ F \\land L \\]\n\nAdditionally, it states that she does not like cats, which can be represented as:\n\\[ \\neg C \\]\n\nSince these two conditions must hold simultaneously, we combine them using the conjunction operator (\\( \\land \\)):\n\n\\[ (F \\land L) \\land \\neg C \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( F \\land L \\land \\neg C \\)\n   - This formula represents \"Brittany likes fish, and Brittany likes lizards, and Brittany does not like cats.\" It correctly captures all parts of the sentence.\n\nB. \\( (F \\land L) \\land \\neg C \\)\n   - This formula also represents \"Brittany likes fish and lizards, and Brittany does not like cats.\" It is equivalent to option A and correctly captures the sentence.\n\nC. \\( (F \\land L) \\lor \\neg C \\)\n   - This formula represents \"Brittany likes fish and lizards, or Brittany does not like cats.\" This is incorrect because it allows for the possibility that either condition could be true independently, which is not what the original sentence states.\n\nD. \\( C \\land (F \\land L) \\)\n   - This formula represents \"Brittany likes cats, and Brittany likes fish and lizards.\" This is incorrect because it suggests that Brittany likes cats, which contradicts the original sentence.\n\nBoth options A and B are correct representations of the sentence. However, since option B explicitly groups the conjunctions in a way that clearly separates the two conditions, it might be considered slightly more precise.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is:\n\nB. \\( (F \\land L) \\land \\neg C \\)"
