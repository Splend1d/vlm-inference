Positive Reinforcement: When someone agrees with us, it can feel validating and reinforcing. This positive feedback can strengthen our own beliefs and make us feel good about ourselves.\n\nB. Bolstering Sense of Rightness: Agreement from others can reinforce our confidence in our own opinions and decisions, making us feel more secure in our beliefs.\n\nC. Anticipation of Positive Interactions: Similarity in attitudes often leads to smoother and more enjoyable interactions. People who share our views are likely to understand and appreciate us better, leading to more harmonious relationships.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to why we might be attracted to people who are similar to us in attitudes."
