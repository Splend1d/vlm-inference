A list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness: This is essential in retributivism because it helps in determining the appropriate punishment based on the severity of the crime.\n\nB. A scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes: This is also crucial in retributivism as it ensures that the punishment fits the crime.\n\nC. Treating criminals humanely: This aligns with ethical considerations and is generally accepted in modern legal systems, including retributivist ones.\n\nD. The death penalty for the most serious crimes: While some forms of retributivism might include capital punishment, it is not universally required or endorsed by all retributivists. Nathanson's specific form of retributivism may not necessarily require the death penalty.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The death penalty for the most serious crimes."
