                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand Aristotle's view on essence and how it relates to individual entities.\n\n1. **Understanding Aristotle's View:**\n   - Aristotle believed that the essence or form of something is not separate from the individual instances of that thing. In other words, the essence is realized through the individual entities themselves.\n   - According to Aristotle, the essence does not exist independently in another realm like Plato's Forms do.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n   - **Option A:** \"would likewise be destroyed.\"\n     - This aligns with Aristotle's view that the essence is realized through individual instances. If all instances of a species were destroyed, there would be no individual instances left to realize the essence, so the essence itself would be destroyed.\n   \n   - **Option B:** \"would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\"\n     - This option introduces the idea of memory, which is not part of Aristotle's philosophy regarding essence. Essence, according to Aristotle, is not dependent on human memory but rather on the existence of individual instances.\n   \n   - **Option C:** \"would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\"\n     - This contradicts Aristotle's view. Plato believed in Forms that existed separately from individual instances, but Aristotle did not. For Aristotle, the essence is tied to the individual instances.\n   \n   - **Option D:** \"would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.\"\n     - This option suggests that there is no essence to begin with, which is not consistent with Aristotle's belief that essence is realized through individual instances. Aristotle did believe in essences, just not as separate entities.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct answer is **Option A** because it aligns with Aristotle's view that the essence is realized through individual instances, and if those instances are destroyed, the essence would also be destroyed.\n\nFinal Answer: **A. would likewise be destroyed.**"
