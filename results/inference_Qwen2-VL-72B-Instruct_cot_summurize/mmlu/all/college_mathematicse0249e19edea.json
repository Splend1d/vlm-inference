Since the fencing forms three sides of the rectangle (two widths and one length), we have:\n\n\\[2W + L = x\\]\n\nWe want to maximize the area \\(A = L \\times W\\).\n\nFrom the equation for the perimeter, we can express \\(L\\) in terms of \\(W\\) and \\(x\\):\n\n\\[L = x - 2W\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the area formula gives:\n\n\\[A = (x - 2W)W = xW - 2W^2\\]\n\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(W\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{dA}{dW} = x - 4W = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(W\\), we get:\n\n\\[4W = x\\]\n\\[W = \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(W\\) back into the equation for \\(L\\), we get:\n\n\\[L = x - 2\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) = x - \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{2}\\]\n\nNow, we can find the maximum area by substituting \\(W\\) and \\(L\\) back into the area formula:\n\n\\[A_{max} = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{8}\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard, in terms of \\(x\\), is \\(\\frac{x^2}{8}\\), which corresponds to option B."
