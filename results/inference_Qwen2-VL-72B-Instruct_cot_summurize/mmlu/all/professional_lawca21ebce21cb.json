She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay \u0080\u0094 it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n"

The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nIn legal terms, a statement made by an agent or servant of a party within the scope of their employment can be considered an admission by a party-opponent under the rules of evidence. This means that the statement is not considered hearsay and is admissible in court. In this scenario, the assistant manager's statement about knowing there was a mess on the floor could be seen as an admission that the store was aware of the hazardous condition, which is relevant to proving negligence. Therefore, the court would likely overrule the objection based on this principle."
