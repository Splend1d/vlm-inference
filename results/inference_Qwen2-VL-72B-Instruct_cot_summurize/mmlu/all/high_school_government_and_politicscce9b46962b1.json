They come with strings attached, meaning that the funds must be used for specific, predefined purposes. In this case, funding for Head Start early education programs is an example of a categorical grant because it is earmarked for a particular program (Head Start) aimed at providing comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families."
