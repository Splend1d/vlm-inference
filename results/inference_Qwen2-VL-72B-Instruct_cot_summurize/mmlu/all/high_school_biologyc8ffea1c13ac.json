All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\n\nThis aspect of cell structure best reveals the unity of all life because it is a fundamental characteristic shared by all living cells, from bacteria to complex multicellular organisms. The plasma membrane serves as a barrier that regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell, maintaining the internal environment necessary for cellular functions. This common feature underscores the basic similarities across diverse forms of life."
