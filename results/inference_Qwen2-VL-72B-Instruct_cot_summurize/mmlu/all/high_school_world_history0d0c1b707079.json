If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nHow would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?\n\nA. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\nB. Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.\nC. Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.\nD. Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.\n"

Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes was a prominent economist who advocated for government intervention in the economy to stabilize output and employment. He believed that during economic downturns, governments should increase spending or cut taxes to boost aggregate demand, which would help to reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth. This approach contrasts with the laissez-faire policies that were prevalent before Keynes' time, which generally opposed government intervention in the economy. Therefore, in response to Bismarck's concerns about worker insecurity and poverty, Keynes would likely support government measures to ensure economic stability and provide social safety nets for workers."
