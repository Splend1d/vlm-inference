In other words, we want to minimize the number of isolated nodes or disconnected parts.\n\n- A tree with \\( n \\) nodes has exactly \\( n - 1 \\) edges.\n- To form a single connected component with 10 nodes, we would need 9 edges (since a tree with 10 nodes requires 9 edges).\n\nGiven that we have only 6 edges, we cannot form a single connected component. Instead, we will have some nodes forming a connected component and the remaining nodes being isolated.\n\nLet's see how many edges we can use to connect as many nodes as possible:\n\n1. Start by forming a connected component using 5 edges. This will connect 6 nodes (since a tree with 6 nodes needs 5 edges).\n2. The remaining 4 nodes will each be isolated because we don't have enough edges to connect them to the existing component.\n\nThus, the minimum number of connected components is:\n\\[ m = 1 + 4 = 5 \\]\n\n### Maximum Number of Connected Components (M)\n\nThe maximum number of connected components occurs when we distribute the edges such that each connected component has the fewest possible nodes.\n\n- Each connected component must have at least one node.\n- Each connected component must have at least one edge connecting its nodes.\n\nWe can achieve this by creating several small connected components:\n\n1. Use 1 edge to create a connected component with 2 nodes.\n2. Use another 1 edge to create another connected component with 2 nodes.\n3. Use another 1 edge to create yet another connected component with 2 nodes.\n4. Use another 1 edge to create another connected component with 2 nodes.\n5. Use another 1 edge to create another connected component with 2 nodes.\n6. The last edge can connect two more nodes into a separate connected component.\n\nThis distribution uses all 6 edges and creates 6 connected components:\n\n\\[ M = 6 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum number of connected components \\( M \\) is 6, and the minimum number of connected components \\( m \\) is 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. M = 6, m = 5"
