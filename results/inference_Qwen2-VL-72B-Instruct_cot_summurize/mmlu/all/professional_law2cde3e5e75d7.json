Murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nIn jurisdictions that follow the common law for homicide offenses, the court would typically instruct the jury on murder and voluntary manslaughter in this scenario. The act of shooting and killing someone is considered murder unless there are mitigating circumstances that could reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter. In this case, the mitigating circumstance might be the provocation of finding one's spouse in an act of infidelity. Involuntary manslaughter generally involves unintentional killings due to negligence or recklessness, which does not seem to apply here as the shooting appears to have been intentional. Therefore, the correct instruction would include both murder and voluntary manslaughter."
