By notifying the attorney who issued the subpoena, Dr. Mayhem is informing them of the client's assertion of privilege and requesting to be released from the subpoena. This allows the attorney to address the issue with the court and potentially seek a waiver of the privilege or a court order compelling disclosure if necessary. It also respects the client's confidentiality while allowing the legal process to proceed appropriately."
