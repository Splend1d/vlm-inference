Muslims are required to perform five daily prayers: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). Each of these prayers consists of at least two rakats (units of prayer), except for Fajr which has two rakats and Isha which has four rakats.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is:\n- Fajr: 2 rakats x 1 = 2 times\n- Dhuhr: 2 rakats x 1 = 2 times\n- Asr: 2 rakats x 1 = 2 times\n- Maghrib: 2 rakats x 1 = 2 times\n- Isha: 4 rakats x 1 = 4 times\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 12 times. However, there are additional voluntary prayers that can be performed, such as Sunnah prayers and Taraweeh during Ramadan, which would increase the number of times the Fatihah is recited beyond this minimum. Thus, the correct answer is B. At least 17, acknowledging that the actual number could be higher depending on individual practice."
