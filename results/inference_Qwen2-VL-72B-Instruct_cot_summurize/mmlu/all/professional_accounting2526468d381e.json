Therefore, it should be subtracted from the book income.\n\n2. **Municipal Bond Interest Income ($7,500)**:\n   - Interest from municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax. Thus, this amount should also be subtracted from the book income.\n\nLet's perform the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the reported book income: $500,000.\n2. Subtract the state franchise tax refund: $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000.\n3. Subtract the municipal bond interest income: $450,000 - $7,500 = $442,500.\n\nTherefore, Vital Corp.'s taxable income for Year 2, as reconciled on its Schedule M-1 of Form 1120, is $442,500.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. $442,500"
