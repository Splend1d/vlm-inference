The sudden demise of the dinosaurs, and various other groups, by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body with Earth.\n\nCatastrophism is the theory that Earth has been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope. This contrasts with uniformitarianism, which posits that Earth's features have evolved gradually through long periods of time. The extinction of the dinosaurs due to an asteroid impact is a classic example of a catastrophic event."
