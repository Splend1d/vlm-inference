Authoritative parents are warm and nurturing while also setting clear expectations and boundaries for their children. This style of parenting has been associated with positive outcomes in children, including higher levels of self-esteem, independence, and social competence. Therefore, it is likely that independent and self-confident adolescents have parents who are authoritative."
