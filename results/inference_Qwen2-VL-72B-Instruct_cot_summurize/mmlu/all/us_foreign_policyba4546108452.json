This would be an 'empire of liberty'\n\nAfter the American Revolution in 1776, Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire primarily because they envisioned it as an \"empire of liberty.\" This concept was rooted in the idea that the new nation would be founded on principles of freedom and self-governance, contrasting sharply with the authoritarian empires of the time. The notion of an \"empire of liberty\" reflected the revolutionary ideals of independence, democracy, and individual rights, which were central to the founding of the United States."
