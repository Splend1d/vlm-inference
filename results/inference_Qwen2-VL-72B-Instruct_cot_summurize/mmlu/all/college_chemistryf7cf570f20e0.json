The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nIn thermodynamics, a spontaneous process is one that occurs naturally and without external intervention. According to the second law of thermodynamics, for a spontaneous process, the total entropy (the sum of the entropy changes in the system and its surroundings) must increase. This principle applies universally to all spontaneous processes, whether they are exothermic or endothermic, and regardless of whether work is involved."
