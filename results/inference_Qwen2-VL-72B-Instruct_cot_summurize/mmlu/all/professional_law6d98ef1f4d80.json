The defendant was arrested after allegedly trying to purchase several kilos of heroin from an undercover government agent. At trial, the undercover agent testified about the defendant's efforts to arrange the drug transaction. The defendant's defense, on the other hand, consisted entirely in attacking the undercover agent's credibility. During his summation, the prosecuting attorney, over defendant's objections, stated that he had produced the only witness who was willing to take the stand and testify to what occurred at the meeting when the undercover agent arrested the defendant. Based on the undercover agent's uncontradicted testimony, the prosecuting attorney urged the jury to convict the defendant. The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, argued that the judge erred in permitting the prosecutor's statement. The defendant's conviction should be\n\nA. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks constituted improper comment about the defendant's right to testify.\nB. reversed, because the prosecutor's remarks were not proper rebuttal to defense attacks on the undercover agent's credibility.\nC. affirmed, because it is immaterial; the probative value of the defendant's failure to testify is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. affirmed, because the prosecutor had the right to express the strength of the evidence he had pursued.\n"

This can be seen as an improper comment on the defendant's right to testify or not testify, which is protected under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The prosecutor's remark may have improperly influenced the jury by suggesting that the defendant's silence was an admission of guilt, which is not a permissible inference. Therefore, the appropriate course would be to reverse the conviction due to this prejudicial error."
