The statute contains express findings that, when combined, the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are supported by information presented to Congress during committee hearings on the legislation. A small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state. It has no customers from outside the state. It employs three workers, each of whom is paid less than the federal minimum wage. Must this dry cleaning store comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores?\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n"

Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. This includes not only direct commercial transactions but also activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. In this case, the federal statute extends minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores based on findings that the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. Therefore, even though the specific dry cleaning store in question may not engage directly in interstate commerce or have a substantial individual impact, it must comply with the statute due to the broader economic effects recognized by Congress."
