When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\n\nSecuritization theory posits that for an issue to be successfully securitized, it must go through a process where a securitizing actor convinces an audience of the urgency and existential nature of a threat, thereby justifying the need for extraordinary measures. If the audience is convinced by the speech act but does not grant the securitizing actor the special rights or powers needed to address the threat, the issue will fail to become securitized."
