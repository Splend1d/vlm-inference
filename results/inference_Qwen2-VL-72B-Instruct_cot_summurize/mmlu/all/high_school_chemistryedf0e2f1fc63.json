Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nIn a titration of a weak base with a strong acid, the pH will initially decrease slowly as the weak base is neutralized by the strong acid. As the equivalence point is approached, the rate of change in pH will increase rapidly due to the formation of a salt that is slightly acidic (since the conjugate acid of the weak base is stronger than water). At the equivalence point, the pH will be below 7 because the salt formed will hydrolyze to produce more hydrogen ions (H+) than hydroxide ions (OH-), making the solution acidic."
