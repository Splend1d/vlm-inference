Because American realism was not concerned with the predictions of what courts will do but more interested in the rights and duties of parties involved in litigation.\nB. Because American realists were preoccupied with the concept of justice and its application in American courts.\nC.

However, American realism is often characterized by its emphasis on the practical outcomes of legal decisions and the behavior of judges, which includes predicting court decisions.\n\nB. **Because American realists were preoccupied with the concept of justice and its application in American courts.**\n   - While American realists did consider justice, their primary focus was on how law operates in practice, emphasizing the role of judicial discretion and the influence of social factors on legal outcomes. This option does not fully capture the essence of American realism.\n\nC. **Because the American realists exposed the limitations of a doctrinal account of law without a proper empirical investigation of the way it functions thereby paving the way to a sociological approach to law.**\n   - This option highlights a key contribution of American realism: challenging traditional doctrinal approaches and advocating for an empirical, sociological understanding of law. It directly addresses the critique implied by Hart's remark, suggesting that American realism was more than just about court predictions.\n\nD. **Because the principal focus of the American realist 'school' was legal education.**\n   - While American realism influenced legal education, this option does not address the core issue of Hart's critique, which concerns the nature of law itself.\n\nGiven these analyses, the strongest reason for regarding Hart's remark as unfair is:\n\n**C. Because the American realists exposed the limitations of a doctrinal account of law without a proper empirical investigation of the way it functions thereby paving the way to a sociological approach to law.**\n\nThis option most effectively counters Hart's dismissal by highlighting the broader, empirical, and sociological contributions of American realism beyond mere court predictions."
