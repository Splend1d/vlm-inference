She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?\n\nA. Cervical culture\nB. Culdocentesis\nC. Laparoscopy\nD. Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration\n"

Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of severe lower abdominal pain, nausea, sexual activity without contraception, and recent menstruation, there is a possibility that she could be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. A serum \u03b2-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test can help determine if the patient is pregnant, which is crucial information in assessing her condition. If the \u03b2-hCG level is elevated, further imaging or other tests may be necessary to rule out an ectopic pregnancy or other causes of her symptoms.\n\nWhile the other options listed (cervical culture, culdocentesis, and laparoscopy) may also be relevant in certain situations, they are not the initial best step in this scenario. A cervical culture might be considered if pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is suspected, but it is not the first-line diagnostic test for the described symptoms. Culdocentesis and laparoscopy are invasive procedures typically reserved for more advanced stages of investigation or when other less invasive tests have indicated a need for them."
