He argues that while states have some rights to control their borders, these rights are limited. According to Carens, restrictions on free migration might be justified if they are necessary to preserve a distinct culture or way of life. This perspective emphasizes the importance of cultural preservation as a potential justification for limiting immigration. However, it's important to note that Carens generally advocates for more open borders and sees this justification as an exception rather than a rule."
