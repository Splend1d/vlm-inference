Review the ethical guidelines: Ensure that using a collection agency is not prohibited by the ethical guidelines of your professional organization or licensing board.\n\n2. Communicate with the client: Contact the client directly to discuss the outstanding fees and attempt to resolve the issue amicably. Clearly communicate the consequences of non-payment, including the possibility of using a collection agency.\n\n3. Provide a deadline: Set a specific date by which the client must pay the outstanding fees. This gives the client a clear timeframe to address the issue.\n\n4. Document all communications: Keep detailed records of all communications with the client regarding the outstanding fees, including any agreements made or attempts to resolve the issue.\n\n5. Consider alternatives: Explore other options for resolving the issue, such as setting up a payment plan or offering a discount for prompt payment.\n\nIf, after following these steps, the client still fails to pay the outstanding fees, you may then consider using a collection agency as a last resort. However, it is important to ensure that the collection agency you choose adheres to ethical standards and complies with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nD. Use a collection agency only as a \"last resort.\""
