Lot 1 consisted of a single- family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. On May 1, 1999, the boss moved into the house on lot 1. One year later, the co-worker and the boss executed and delivered the following deed instrument to a neighbor \". . . hereby grant to (the neighbor) the northerly 30 feet of lot 1, consisting of the paved driveway now existing, to be used for the ingress and egress of motor vehicles, but should (the neighbor) or his heirs and assigns use said property for any other purpose, all the rights, privileges, and immunities herein granted shall cease and determine. \" In consideration for the said deed, the neighbor paid the co-worker and the boss $2,000 (which they divided equally). The deed was never recorded by the neighbor. Because the boss didn't own a car, she never used the driveway. Similarly, the neighbor never used the driveway because he unexpectedly had his driver's license suspended shortly after executing the above instrument. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway. Immediately upon her taking possession of the premises, the daughter began to use the driveway on lot 1. Consequently, she objected to the professor's use of the driveway. After the daughter refused to permit the professor to use the driveway, he brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the driveway. The professor should\n\nA. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\nB. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor.\nC. lose, because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied.\nD. lose, because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the professor has the right to continue using the driveway, we need to analyze the legal principles involved, particularly those related to easements and the transfer of property rights.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Easement Creation:**\n   - The co-worker and the boss granted the neighbor an easement over the northern 30 feet of lot 1, specifically for the use of the driveway for ingress and egress of motor vehicles.\n   - This easement was created by deed, which is a formal legal document.\n\n2. **Recording of Easement:**\n   - The deed granting the easement was not recorded by the neighbor. However, the lack of recording does not necessarily invalidate the easement; it may affect its priority against subsequent purchasers who are not aware of it.\n\n3. **Transfer of Easement:**\n   - When the neighbor sold lot 2 to the professor, the deed did not mention the easement over the driveway on lot 1.\n   - Generally, an easement appurtenant (attached to the land) passes with the land unless explicitly excluded from the conveyance.\n\n4. **Statute of Frauds:**\n   - The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts, including those involving real estate, to be in writing to be enforceable.\n   - The original easement was properly documented by deed, satisfying the Statute of Frauds.\n\n5. **Abandonment of Easement:**\n   - Abandonment of an easement requires clear intent to abandon and overt acts consistent with that intent.\n   - The neighbor\u2019s non-use of the driveway due to a suspended driver's license does not constitute abandonment, especially since there was no intention to abandon the easement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven these points, the professor should have the right to continue using the driveway because the easement appurtenant to lot 2 passed with the sale of the property to the professor. The easement was validly created by deed, and although it was not recorded, it still exists and binds subsequent owners of lot 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor.**"
