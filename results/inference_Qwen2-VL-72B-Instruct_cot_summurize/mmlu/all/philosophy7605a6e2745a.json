However, Nussbaum's work often emphasizes the complexity and context-dependency of virtues, suggesting that virtues may not have a singular, fixed specification.\n\nB. **might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction.**\n   - A disjunction implies that there could be multiple valid specifications for a virtue depending on the situation or context. This aligns with Nussbaum's emphasis on the importance of context and the multifaceted nature of virtues.\n\nC. **is necessarily relative to a culture.**\n   - While Nussbaum acknowledges cultural influences on the understanding and practice of virtues, she does not claim that the specification of virtues is entirely relative to culture. She argues for universal human capabilities and virtues that transcend specific cultures.\n\nD. **can be settled in such a way as to be no longer revisable.**\n   - Nussbaum's approach to virtue ethics is dynamic and open to revision based on new insights and changing circumstances. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with her views to suggest that the specification of virtues can be definitively settled without the possibility of revision.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate statement about Nussbaum's view on the specification of particular virtues is:\n\n**B. might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction.**\n\nThis reflects her acknowledgment of the complexity and context-dependent nature of virtues."
