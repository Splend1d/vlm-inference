Their metabolic rates can vary significantly with changes in environmental temperature.\n\n2. **Endotherm**: Endotherms (also known as warm-blooded animals) maintain a relatively constant internal body temperature through metabolic processes, independent of external temperatures. Therefore, they show little change in their metabolic rate despite fluctuations in ambient temperature.\n\n3. **Thermophile**: Thermophiles are organisms that thrive in extremely hot environments. While they can tolerate high temperatures, this term does not specifically address how they respond to wild temperature fluctuations.\n\n4. **Ascospore**: Ascospores are reproductive cells produced by certain fungi. They do not directly relate to the regulation of metabolic rates in response to temperature changes.\n\nGiven the context and the need for an organism that maintains a stable metabolic rate regardless of external temperature fluctuations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**B. endotherm.**"
