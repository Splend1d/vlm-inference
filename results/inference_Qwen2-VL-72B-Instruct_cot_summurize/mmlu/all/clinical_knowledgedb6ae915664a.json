Dysphagia is an indication for surgery\n\nLarge goitres can cause various complications, including dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which may be an indication for surgical intervention. Stridor is typically caused by compression of the trachea rather than the oesophagus, and hoarseness would more likely be due to involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve rather than direct compression of the trachea. The size of the goitre does not necessarily correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis; other factors such as the function of the thyroid tissue within the goitre play a more significant role."
