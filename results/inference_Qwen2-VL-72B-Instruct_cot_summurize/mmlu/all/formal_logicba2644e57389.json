(\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy]\n- This states that for all x, if x is a child and y is a school, then x goes to y. However, this implies that every child goes to every school, which is not what the original statement means.\n\nB. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n- This states that for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that y is a child and y goes to x. This is incorrect because it talks about schools going to children, which is not what the original statement means.\n\nC. (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n- This states that for all x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. This correctly captures the meaning of the original statement.\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n- This states that for all x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that y is a child and y goes to x. This is similar to option B and is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nC. (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]"
