It also requires significant resources and expertise to ensure that the system meets all necessary requirements and integrates well with other systems.\n\nC. **Purchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program for managing the assets and related depreciation.**\n   - A stand-alone program might provide specialized functionality for fixed asset management but could create integration challenges with other enterprise systems, leading to data silos and inefficiencies.\n\nD. **Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.**\n   - Integrating the fixed asset management into the new enterprise-wide system ensures consistency and coherence across all business processes. This approach leverages existing infrastructure, promotes data integrity, and facilitates better reporting and analysis.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most strategic and efficient long-term solution would be:\n\n**D. Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.**\n\nThis approach not only maintains the integrity and security of the data but also streamlines operations by integrating fixed asset management within the broader enterprise system, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness."
