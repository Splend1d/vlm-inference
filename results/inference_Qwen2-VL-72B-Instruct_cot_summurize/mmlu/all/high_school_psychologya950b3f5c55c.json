PET\n\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) scans are particularly useful for studying brain function because they can show how active different parts of the brain are by measuring metabolic activity. This could help disprove the myth that people only use 10 percent of their brains, as PET scans can demonstrate widespread and varied patterns of brain activity during different tasks and at rest."
