For both sets X and Y, the middle value (when arranged in ascending order) is 50. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. **The sets have identical means.**\n   - The mean (average) of a set is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n     - Mean of X: \\(\\frac{10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90}{7} = \\frac{350}{7} = 50\\)\n     - Mean of Y: \\(\\frac{10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90}{7} = \\frac{350}{7} = 50\\)\n   - Both sets have the same mean, so this statement is also true.\n\nC. **The sets have identical ranges.**\n   - The range of a set is the difference between the largest and smallest values.\n     - Range of X: \\(90 - 10 = 80\\)\n     - Range of Y: \\(90 - 10 = 80\\)\n   - Both sets have the same range, so this statement is true as well.\n\nGiven that all statements A, B, and C are true, the correct answer is:\n\nD. **None of the above are false.**"
