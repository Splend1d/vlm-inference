When the central bank lowers interest rates or increases the money supply, it can lead to an increase in demand for bonds, which in turn can push down their yields (interest rates). However, the direct effect on bond prices is often the opposite: when yields fall due to increased demand, bond prices rise because they become more attractive investments relative to other assets with higher yields.\n\nConversely, if the central bank raises interest rates or tightens the money supply (contractionary monetary policy), this can lead to higher yields on new bonds issued, making existing bonds less attractive and potentially causing their prices to fall. Therefore, expansionary monetary policy is more likely to cause falling Treasury bond prices due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields."
