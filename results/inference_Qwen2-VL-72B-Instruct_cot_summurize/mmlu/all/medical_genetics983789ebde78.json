It involves using short DNA primers and a heat-stable DNA polymerase enzyme to amplify specific DNA sequences in a test tube. This process allows scientists to generate millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence, which can then be analyzed for various purposes, such as detecting genetic mutations, identifying pathogens, or studying gene expression."
