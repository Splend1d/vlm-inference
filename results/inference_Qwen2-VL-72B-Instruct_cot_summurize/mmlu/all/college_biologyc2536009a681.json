The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\n\nEvolution is defined as changes in the genetic composition of a population over time, specifically from one generation to the next. This change in allele frequencies is a fundamental aspect of evolutionary theory. Therefore, option A correctly describes a necessary condition for evolution to have occurred."
