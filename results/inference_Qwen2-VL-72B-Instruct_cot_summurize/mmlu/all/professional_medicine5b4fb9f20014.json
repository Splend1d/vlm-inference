A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB. Chance of a type II error\nC. Power of the study\nD. Sensitivity of the study\n"

Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (i.e., detecting an effect when there truly is one). A lower sample size means less precision in estimating the effect size, leading to a higher chance of failing to detect a true difference between the new drug and the standard treatment even if one exists. This corresponds to an increased risk of a type II error, which occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected.\n\nTo summarize:\n- **Type I error** (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n- **Type II error** (beta) is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n- **Power** is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (1 - beta).\n\nGiven the reduction in sample size, the power of the study decreases, thereby increasing the chance of a type II error. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Chance of a type II error"
