Without this capability, services wouldn't be able to communicate directly with the client web browser because they wouldn't have access to the established TCP connection.\n\n2. **It would be impossible for `okd` to run as a non-root user.**\n   - Running `okd` as a non-root user is not inherently dependent on file descriptor passing. The ability to run as a non-root user is more about permissions and security configurations rather than the mechanism of file descriptor passing.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Statement 1 is true because file descriptor passing is essential for services to inherit the TCP connection.\n- Statement 2 is false because running `okd` as a non-root user is not dependent on file descriptor passing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
