(Here, \\(G + H\\) is the internal direct product.)\n\nThe internal direct product of two groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), denoted as \\(G \\times H\\), consists of all ordered pairs \\((g, h)\\) where \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(h \\in H\\). The operation in \\(G \\times H\\) is defined component-wise. \n\nFor any finite groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), the order of their direct product \\(|G \\times H|\\) is indeed equal to the product of their orders, i.e., \\(|G \\times H| = |G||H|\\). This is because every element of \\(G \\times H\\) can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair \\((g, h)\\), and there are \\(|G|\\) choices for \\(g\\) and \\(|H|\\) choices for \\(h\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), then \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\).\n\nFirstly, note that \\(Z_m\\) and \\(Z_n\\) denote cyclic groups of orders \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), respectively. The direct sum \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) is equivalent to the direct product \\(Z_m \\times Z_n\\).\n\nGiven that \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), we know that \\(Z_m\\) has a subgroup of order \\(r\\) (denoted as \\(Z_r\\)) and \\(Z_n\\) has a subgroup of order \\(s\\) (denoted as \\(Z_s\\)). \n\nIn the direct product \\(Z_m \\times Z_n\\), the subgroup generated by the elements \\((r, 0)\\) and \\((0, s)\\) will have order \\(rs\\), which is the least common multiple of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). Since \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), this subgroup will be isomorphic to \\(Z_r \\times Z_s\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is also **True**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true, so the correct answer is:\n\n**A. True, True**"
