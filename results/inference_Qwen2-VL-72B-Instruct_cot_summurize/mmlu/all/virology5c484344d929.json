The commitment of the participants\n\nThe Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) is a long-term observational study that has been ongoing since 1984, focusing on the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM). The success of such a longitudinal study heavily relies on the continued participation and commitment of the individuals enrolled in the study. Without the dedication of the participants, it would be impossible to gather the extensive data necessary for meaningful research findings over such an extended period. While the brilliance of the principal investigator, the commitment of the staff, and the quality of the laboratories are all important factors, they are secondary to the sustained involvement of the participants themselves."
