The man's and the nephew's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The son, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that he had built on his property. In 2009, the man planted trees and shrubbery on his land along the boundary of the nephew's lot. In 2010, the nephew, in preparation for building a house on his lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The side of the excavation closest to the man \u0080\u0094 nephew boundary suddenly collapsed, and a quantity of the man's soil, trees, and shrubbery fell into the hole. The nephew hauled away the debris. In an appropriate action by the man against the nephew to recover for the damage to his land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The nephew, if he was conducting the excavation work non-negligently.\nB. The nephew, because he was under no duty to support the man's land in its improved state.\nC. The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\nD. The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n"

The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the nephew excavated his land, causing the collapse of the man's land and resulting in damage to the man's soil, trees, and shrubbery. Generally, a landowner has the right to have their land supported in its natural condition by adjacent land. This means that the nephew, by excavating his land, had a duty not to cause the collapse of the man's land. Since the man's land was in its natural state (unimproved), the nephew's actions violated this duty, making him liable for the damages caused to the man's land. Therefore, the judgment should be in favor of the man."
