Rheumatoid factor (RF) is actually present in about 70-80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nB. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy.\n- Oligoarthropathy refers to inflammation affecting four or fewer joints. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects multiple joints, so it is not considered an oligoarthropathy.\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding.\n- Anaemia is indeed a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis due to chronic inflammation and can be classified as anaemia of chronic disease.\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are a feature.\n- Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements at the distal interphalangeal joints, which are more commonly associated with osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding."
