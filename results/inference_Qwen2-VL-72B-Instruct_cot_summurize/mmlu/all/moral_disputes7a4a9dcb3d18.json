The question asks about Hursthouse's stance on the claim that an adequate moral theory should provide clear guidance that any intelligent person can follow.\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim is that any adequate moral theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done, which any intelligent person could follow.\n2. **Analyze the options**:\n   - A. She says the claim is very plausible.\n   - B. She says the claim is implausible.\n   - C. She says the claim is self-evident.\n   - D. She says the claim is true.\n\nGiven that Hursthouse is known for her work in virtue ethics, particularly her development of a form of ethical naturalism, it is important to consider how her views might align with this claim. Virtue ethics often emphasizes the role of character and virtues in guiding moral actions rather than providing explicit rules or guidelines.\n\n3. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - A. If she says the claim is very plausible, it suggests she agrees that moral theories should provide clear guidance.\n   - B. If she says the claim is implausible, it implies she disagrees with the necessity of clear guidance for intelligent people.\n   - C. If she says the claim is self-evident, it means she believes the claim is obviously true without needing further proof.\n   - D. If she says the claim is true, it indicates her agreement with the claim outright.\n\nConsidering Hursthouse's emphasis on virtues and practical wisdom over strict rules, it is more likely that she would find the claim less compelling because virtue ethics focuses more on developing good character traits and practical reasoning rather than providing straightforward rules.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**B. She says the claim is implausible.**"
