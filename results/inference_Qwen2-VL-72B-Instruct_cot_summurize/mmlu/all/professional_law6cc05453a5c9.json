Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n"

Negative evidence is generally inadmissible because it can be misleading and unreliable. The lack of prior accidents does not necessarily prove that the intersection is safe or that the city is not negligent in failing to provide adequate warnings. Therefore, such evidence should be excluded from the trial."
