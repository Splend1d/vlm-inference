This could make it less ideal.\n\nB. **How many people would likely violate it**: If a moral code is such that many people would likely violate it, it may not be practical or effective. An ideal moral code should ideally be one that most people can and will follow.\n\nC. **The costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces**: If following a moral code leads to significant personal distress or guilt for individuals, it might not be considered ideal. An ideal moral code should balance ethical obligations with the well-being of those who adhere to it.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems reasonable to conclude that an ideal moral code should take into account all three factors: the complexity of the rules, the likelihood of violation, and the costs in terms of guilt induced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above.**"
