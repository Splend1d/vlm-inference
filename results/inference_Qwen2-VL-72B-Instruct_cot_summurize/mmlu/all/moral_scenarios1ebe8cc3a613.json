It shows a lack of empathy and disregard for human suffering.\n- This action is morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I bound the woman's ankle so she couldn't get away.\"\n- Binding someone's ankle to prevent them from getting away can be morally wrong depending on the context. If it involves harming or restraining someone without just cause, it is morally wrong.\n- However, if there is a legitimate reason such as preventing harm to others or oneself (e.g., in a self-defense situation), it might not be considered morally wrong.\n- Without additional context, we cannot definitively say whether this action is morally wrong or not, but generally, binding someone without consent is morally questionable.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 could be morally wrong depending on the context, but without more information, it is likely considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
