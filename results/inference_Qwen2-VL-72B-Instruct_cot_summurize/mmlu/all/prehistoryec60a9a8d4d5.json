There is no historical evidence suggesting that the Egyptians colonized Crete or named it \"Minoa.\"\n\nB. **Early humans crossed a land bridge to Crete around 150,000 B.P. and gradually became Minoans.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. The Minoan civilization developed much later than 150,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of human habitation on Crete dates back to around 8000 BCE.\n\nC. **Crete was populated by Greeks and others, but Minoan culture was a local development.**\n   - This statement is partially correct. Crete was indeed populated by various groups over time, including early settlers who developed into the Minoan civilization. However, the term \"Greeks\" in this context might be misleading since the Minoans predate the Greek civilization.\n\nD. **Cretan culture was a mix of Egyptian and Mesopotamian elements.**\n   - This statement is not entirely accurate. While there were influences from other cultures, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Minoan civilization developed its own distinct culture and characteristics.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement regarding the origins of Minoan civilization is:\n\n**C. Crete was populated by Greeks and others, but Minoan culture was a local development.**\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the term \"Greeks\" might need clarification, as the Minoans were an earlier civilization before the classical Greek period."
