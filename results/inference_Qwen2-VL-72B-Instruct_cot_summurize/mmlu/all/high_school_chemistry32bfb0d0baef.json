Removing any of these electrons will result in similar ionization energies since they are all in the same orbital.\n\n4. **Sulfur (S)**:\n   - Electron configuration: \\( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4 \\)\n   - Ionization energies: The first electron removed will come from the \\( 3p \\) orbital, followed by the \\( 3s \\), then the \\( 2p \\), \\( 2s \\), and finally the \\( 1s \\) orbitals.\n   - The ionization energy for the \\( 3p \\) electrons is lower compared to the \\( 3s \\), \\( 2p \\), \\( 2s \\), and \\( 1s \\) electrons.\n\nGiven that the question specifies the peak representing electrons with the lowest ionization energy being three times higher than all other peaks, this suggests a significant difference in ionization energies between the outermost electrons and the rest. \n\n**Neon (Ne)** has all its valence electrons in the same orbital (\\( 2p \\)), making it unlikely to have a peak three times higher than others due to the similarity in ionization energies.\n\n**Carbon (C)** and **Nitrogen (N)** both have electrons in different orbitals but not a significant enough difference to create a peak three times higher than others.\n\n**Sulfur (S)** has electrons in multiple orbitals, including \\( 3p \\), \\( 3s \\), \\( 2p \\), etc., with the \\( 3p \\) electrons having significantly lower ionization energy compared to the inner electrons. This makes it plausible that the peak corresponding to the \\( 3p \\) electrons could be three times higher than those of the inner electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Sulfur"
