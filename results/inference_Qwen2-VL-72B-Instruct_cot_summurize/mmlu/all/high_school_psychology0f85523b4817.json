The scores on the WISC are typically distributed according to a normal distribution, also known as a bell curve. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the scores fall within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% fall within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% fall within three standard deviations.\n\nThe average (mean) score on the WISC is set at 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Therefore, one standard deviation below the mean would be 85 (100 - 15), and one standard deviation above the mean would be 115 (100 + 15). Two standard deviations below the mean would be 70 (100 - 2 * 15), and two standard deviations above the mean would be 130 (100 + 2 * 15).\n\nGiven this information, approximately 95% of the population scores between 70 and 130 on the WISC, which corresponds to two standard deviations from the mean.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. 95"
