It would report the total amount of the payment, which includes both the interest ($5,000) and the principal ($20,000), totaling $25,000.\n\n- The Permanent Fund: There is no indication that the Permanent Fund is involved in this transaction, so it would not report any expenditures related to this payment.\n\nTherefore, the correct reporting would be:\n- General Fund: $0\n- Debt Service Fund: $25,000\n- Permanent Fund: $0"
