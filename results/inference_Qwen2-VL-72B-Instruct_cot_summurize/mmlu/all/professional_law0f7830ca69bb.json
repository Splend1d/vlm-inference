                    "text": "To determine which option is correct, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Offer**: Calvin Poultry Co. offers to sell 20,000 pounds of chicken at 40 cents per pound under specified delivery terms.\n\n2. **Acceptance with Modification**: Chickenshop accepts the offer but adds a condition regarding the weight certification (\"per city scale weight certificate\").\n\nIn contract law, an acceptance that includes additional or different terms is generally considered a rejection of the original offer and a new offer (counteroffer) instead. This principle is often referred to as the \"mirror image rule,\" which requires that the acceptance must match the offer exactly for a contract to be formed.\n\nGiven this context:\n- Chickenshop's response does not exactly mirror Calvin's terms because it introduces a new condition about the weight certification.\n- Therefore, Chickenshop's response is not a simple acceptance but rather a counteroffer.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Chickenshop's reply constitutes a counteroffer and no contract was formed.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that Chickenshop's response did not fully accept Calvin's terms but instead proposed a modification, thereby creating a new offer (counteroffer). Since Calvin's original offer was not accepted as presented, no contract was formed on Calvin's terms."
