Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

                    "text": "To determine which option best supports Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment, we need to analyze each choice in relation to the context provided by the quote.\n\nA. **The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations**: This option directly implicates Western European capitalists because they were heavily involved in the transatlantic slave trade, which was a significant factor in the exploitation of African resources and populations. This aligns well with Rodney's argument about the draining of African wealth and the impossibility of developing the continent's resources due to external exploitation.\n\nB. **The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market**: While this indicates slave trade, it involves Arabian merchants rather than Western European capitalists. Therefore, it does not directly support Rodney's specific focus on Western European responsibility.\n\nC. **The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company**: Although this involves Western European colonial activity, it is more about territorial control and less directly tied to the economic exploitation and draining of African wealth that Rodney emphasizes.\n\nD. **The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia**: This suggests economic interaction but does not necessarily imply exploitation or underdevelopment caused by Western European capitalists. It could involve mutually beneficial trade relationships.\n\nGiven these analyses, the option that most directly supports Walter Rodney's assertion about Western European capitalist responsibility for African underdevelopment is:\n\n**A. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations**\n\nThis option clearly ties Western European capitalists to the exploitation and underdevelopment of Africa through the slave trade."
