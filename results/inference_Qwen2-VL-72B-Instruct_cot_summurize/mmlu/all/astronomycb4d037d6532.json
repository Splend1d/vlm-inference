They formed as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrated inwards.\n\nHot Jupiters are exoplanets that are similar in size to Jupiter but orbit very closely to their host stars, often with periods of only a few days. The leading theory for their formation is that they initially formed as gas giants beyond the frost line, where it was cold enough for ices to condense and form solid cores. These planets then migrated inward toward their stars through various processes such as gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk or other planets, eventually settling into their current close-in orbits. This migration scenario explains why hot Jupiters are not found in the same orbits where they likely formed."
