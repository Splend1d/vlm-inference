Thereafter, the property owner constructed a shopping center on the property and leased commercial buildings and parking facilities to various tenants. The shopping center, which was located near a public high school, attracted many teenagers who often loitered in the parking lot. The youths frequently harassed shoppers and damaged autos by breaking off windshield wipers and radio antennas. Customarily, the local police department patrolled the shopping center and drove by three or four times each day. This, however, did not prevent the teenagers from hanging out at the shopping center. One afternoon, a shopper was shopping at the center when an unidentified youth damaged her car by throwing a rock through the back window. The shopper brings an action against the property owner to recover for the damage to her auto. She will most likely\n\nA. prevail, unless the person who was responsible for damaging her car can be identified.\nB. prevail, if the damage to her car could have been prevented had the property owner taken reasonable security measures.\nC. not prevail, because the car was damaged by the malicious acts of an independent third person.\nD. not prevail, because the local police had the primary duty to provide security protection at the shopping area.\n"

If the property owner failed to take reasonable security measures that could have prevented the damage to the shopper's car, they may be held liable for negligence. The fact that the damage was caused by an independent third party does not necessarily absolve the property owner of responsibility if they were negligent in providing adequate security. The local police's presence does not shift the primary duty of security from the property owner to the police, especially since the police patrols were not sufficient to prevent the incidents."
