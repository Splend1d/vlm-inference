The man locked the door and quietly took the female's purse, emptied all of the money into his pockets, and removed the jewelry from her person. He was apprehended and charged with robbery. Can he be convicted of that crime?\n\nA. Yes, robbery is the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force.\nB. No, this was not robbery because there was no intimidation, and indeed no force, against an unconscious victim.\nC. Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\nD. No, this was not robbery because it occurred in a private home and not in a business establishment or on the street.\n"

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\n\nRobbery typically involves the unlawful taking of property directly from a person with the use of force or intimidation. However, in many jurisdictions, the definition of robbery can also include situations where the victim is incapacitated or unaware of the theft, such as being unconscious. In this scenario, since the man took advantage of the woman's incapacitated state to take her property, it could still be considered robbery under the law."
