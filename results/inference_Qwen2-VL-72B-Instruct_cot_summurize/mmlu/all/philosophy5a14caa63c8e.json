Hare, an influential British philosopher, is known for his work in moral philosophy, particularly his theory of prescriptive ethics. According to Hare, the logic of moral judgments involves two key features: universalizability and prescriptivity.\n\n1. **Universalizability**: This principle suggests that moral judgments should be applicable universally. In other words, if a certain action is considered morally right or wrong for one person, it should be considered the same for everyone in similar circumstances. This aligns with the idea that moral principles should not be arbitrary or subjective but should hold true for all people.\n\n2. **Prescriptivity**: This feature indicates that moral judgments are not merely descriptive statements about what people do or believe; they are prescriptions about what people ought to do. Moral judgments are thus normative, guiding behavior and actions according to certain standards of right and wrong.\n\nThese two features form the basis of Hare's view on the logic of moral judgments, emphasizing the importance of both the general applicability of moral rules and their directive nature in guiding human conduct."
