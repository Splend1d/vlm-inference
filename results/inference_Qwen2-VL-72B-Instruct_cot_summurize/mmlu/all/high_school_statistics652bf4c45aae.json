When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?\n\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n"

This indicates a positive relationship, meaning that as self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction tends to increase as well, although the relationship is not very strong.\n- To determine the proportion of variance explained by the linear model, we square the correlation coefficient: \\( r^2 = 0.30^2 = 0.09 \\). This means that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be attributed to self-efficacy.\n- Therefore, option D correctly interprets the correlation coefficient in terms of the proportion of variance explained by the linear model.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they imply causation or misinterpret the direction of the relationship based on the correlation coefficient alone. Correlation does not imply causation, and the direction of influence cannot be determined solely from the correlation value."
