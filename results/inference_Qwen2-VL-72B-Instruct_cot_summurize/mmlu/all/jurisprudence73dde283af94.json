This implies that for a command to be considered authoritative, it must have some form of consequence (sanction) attached to it if the command is not followed. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **All commands include some sanction.**\n   - This aligns with Austin's view because a command without any sanction would not be a true command according to his definition.\n\nB. **The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command.**\n   - This also aligns with Austin's view since he emphasizes that a command must have a sanction associated with it.\n\nC. **Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command.**\n   - This is consistent with Austin's argument because he posits that a command must have a sanction to be considered authoritative.\n\nD. **A command confers power to change one's legal status.**\n   - This statement does not directly relate to the concept of a sanction. While a command might indeed confer power to change one's legal status, this is not necessarily implied by the presence of a sanction. The focus on sanctions is more about the consequences of failing to obey rather than the power to change legal status.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument is:\n\n**D. A command confers power to change one's legal status.**\n\nThis statement does not directly address the core idea of a sanction being the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil."
