While some skeptical arguments might be seen as setting high standards, this does not necessarily capture the essence of all skeptical arguments.\n\nB. **Are based on linguistic confusions.**\n   - This implies that skeptical arguments arise from misunderstandings or misinterpretations of language. While language can play a role in skepticism, it is not the primary basis for all skeptical arguments.\n\nC. **Are logically self-refuting.**\n   - This means that skeptical arguments contain internal contradictions or flaws that undermine their own validity. Some skeptical arguments have been criticized for being self-defeating, but this is not universally true for all skeptical arguments.\n\nD. **Grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.**\n   - This suggests that skeptical arguments emerge naturally when we apply our everyday standards of evidence and reasoning consistently to all aspects of our beliefs. This aligns with Nagel's view that skepticism arises from the rigorous application of principles we already accept in other contexts.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting option according to Nagel's perspective is:\n\n**D. Grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.**"
