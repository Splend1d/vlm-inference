If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nWhat was the impact of European demand for Chinese goods?\n\nA. The Portuguese increased their international power and prestige.\nB. The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan.\nC. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.\nD. The British sought control of the Malacca Strait.\n"

While the Portuguese did engage in trade with Asia, including China, the passage does not specifically mention the Portuguese or their increased power and prestige.\n\n2. **Option B: The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan.**\n   - The passage indicates that the British were seeking expanded trading privileges with China but were rebuffed. There is no direct mention of the British shifting their focus to Japan as a result of this rejection.\n\n3. **Option C: The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.**\n   - This option aligns well with historical knowledge. During the period when European demand for Chinese goods was high, particularly during the 16th to 18th centuries, there was a significant flow of silver from Europe and the Americas to China in exchange for Chinese goods like silk, porcelain, and tea. This is a well-documented historical fact.\n\n4. **Option D: The British sought control of the Malacca Strait.**\n   - While the Malacca Strait was an important trade route, the passage does not provide any specific information about the British seeking control over it due to the demand for Chinese goods.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate and relevant impact of European demand for Chinese goods, as described in the passage and historical context, is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.**"
