A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve\n\nWhen there is a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve, it typically leads to higher prices (inflation) as well as lower unemployment because firms are hiring more workers to meet the increased demand for their products. This relationship is what the Phillips curve illustrates: as unemployment decreases, inflation tends to increase, and vice versa."
