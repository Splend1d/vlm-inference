'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.\nB. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.\nC. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\nD. None of the above\n"

Booth, K.\n\nThis definition by Ken Booth emphasizes a broader understanding of security that goes beyond traditional military concerns to include the well-being and freedom of individuals and groups. It aligns with the expanded scope of Security Studies in recent decades, which has incorporated non-traditional security threats such as economic instability, environmental degradation, and social injustice."
