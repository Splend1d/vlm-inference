According to their theories:\n\n- A. The ruling elite is indeed a minority group that holds the majority of power and fills all the top positions of political authority.\n- B. This elite often consists of individuals with specific skills and abilities that enable them to maintain their position.\n- C. There is also an element of circulation within this elite, where members move between various high-status positions, but they generally exclude others from entering these ranks.\n\nTherefore, all three points (A, B, and C) accurately describe aspects of the ruling elite as identified by Mosca and Pareto."
