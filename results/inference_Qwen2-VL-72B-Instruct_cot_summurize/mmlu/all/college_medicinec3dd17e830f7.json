Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.\n\nIncreasing the substrate concentration will decrease the impact of uncompetitive inhibitors because they bind to the enzyme-substrate complex, and with more substrate available, there is less chance for the inhibitor to bind. On the other hand, increasing the substrate concentration will increase the impact of noncompetitive inhibitors because they bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, and more substrate means more enzyme-substrate complexes, providing more opportunities for the inhibitor to bind."
