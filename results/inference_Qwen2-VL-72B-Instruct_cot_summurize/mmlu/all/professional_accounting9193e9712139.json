Nonaudit services to perform financial information systems design and implementation.\n\nAccording to auditing standards and regulations, auditors must maintain their independence from the entities they audit. Providing certain nonaudit services can impair this independence. Financial information systems design and implementation is one such service that is generally considered to be incompatible with maintaining auditor independence because it involves creating or modifying the very systems that the auditor will later need to audit. Therefore, an auditor cannot provide these services to an issuer client without impairing independence, regardless of whether preapproval from the audit committee is obtained."
