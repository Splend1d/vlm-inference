However, this explanation alone does not account for the interaction between the horse and the cart.\n\nB. **The forward force of the horse on the cart is greater than the backward force of the cart on the horse, providing a forward acceleration.**\n   - According to Newton's third law, the force exerted by the horse on the cart is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the cart on the horse. This means the forces cancel each other out when considering the horse and cart as separate entities. However, when considering them as a single system, the net external force (the friction force) causes the acceleration.\n\nC. **The force of the horse\u2019s muscles on the rest of the horse-cart system provides the necessary acceleration.**\n   - This option implies that the internal force generated by the horse's muscles directly accelerates the entire system. While the muscles generate the force, it is ultimately the interaction with the ground through friction that translates into motion.\n\nD. **The upward normal force of the ground on the horse is greater than the horse\u2019s weight, providing an upward acceleration.**\n   - This option is incorrect because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface and acts vertically. It does not contribute to horizontal acceleration.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The forward force of the horse on the cart is greater than the backward force of the cart on the horse, providing a forward acceleration.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies the interaction between the horse and the cart, where the net external force (friction) causes the system to accelerate forward."
