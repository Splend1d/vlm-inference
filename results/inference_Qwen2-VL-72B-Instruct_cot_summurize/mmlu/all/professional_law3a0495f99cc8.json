The title was put in the woman's name and the man made the loan payments. They orally agreed that it was a shared ownership, with equal rights. After several months, their relationship deteriorated. They argued over ownership and use of the car. One day, the man attempted to leave with the car, but the woman climbed in and kept arguing as he was driving away. He then crashed into a pole and destroyed the car just to spite her, saying that if he couldn't have it no one would have it. The authorities arrested the man for auto larceny (stealing a car from the owner) and criminal mischief (damaging property of another or property shared with another). Assuming the accuracy of the foregoing facts beyond a reasonable doubt, which crime or crimes alleged can likely result in a sustainable conviction?\n\nA. He can be convicted of larceny but he cannot be convicted of criminal mischief.\nB. He cannot be convicted of any crime.\nC. He can be convicted of criminal mischief only.\nD. He can be convicted of both larceny and criminal mischief.\n"

In this case:\n- The car was titled in the woman's name.\n- The man and woman had an oral agreement about shared ownership and equal rights.\n- The man was making the loan payments.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The man had some form of legal interest in the car due to his financial contributions and the oral agreement.\n- The car was not solely owned by the woman; they had a shared ownership arrangement.\n- The man did not take the car without the woman's knowledge; she was present and actively opposing him.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the man can be convicted of auto larceny because he had a legitimate claim to the car and did not act without the woman\u2019s knowledge or consent.\n\n### Criminal Mischief (Damaging Property of Another or Property Shared with Another)\nCriminal mischief involves intentionally damaging or destroying property belonging to someone else or shared property. In this case:\n- The car was shared property according to their oral agreement.\n- The man intentionally crashed the car to spite the woman.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The man's actions clearly demonstrate intent to damage the shared property.\n- The shared ownership does not negate the fact that the car was also the woman's property.\n\nTherefore, the man can likely be convicted of criminal mischief because he intentionally damaged property that was shared between them.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis above:\n\n**The correct answer is C. He can be convicted of criminal mischief only.**"
