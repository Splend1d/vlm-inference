Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\n\nThis describes how the greenhouse effect works: greenhouse gases allow sunlight (visible light) to pass through and warm the Earth's surface, but they also trap some of the infrared radiation emitted by the warmed surface, leading to an increase in temperature. This natural process helps keep the Earth warm enough to support life."
