Lack of small intestinal lactase\n\nThis condition is known as lactose intolerance, which occurs when there is an insufficient amount of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine to break down lactose (the sugar found in milk and dairy products). When lactose is not properly digested, it can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is common among people of various ethnic backgrounds, including those from Sudan."
