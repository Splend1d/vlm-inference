By measuring the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes estimated the size of the Earth by comparing the angles of the Sun's rays at two different locations: Alexandria and Syene (modern-day Aswan, Egypt). He knew that on the summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead at Syene, while in Alexandria, about 500 miles to the north, it cast a slight shadow. By measuring the angle of this shadow and knowing the distance between the two cities, he could calculate the circumference of the Earth."
