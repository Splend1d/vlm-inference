This action increases the money supply and lowers interest rates, making it easier for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, thereby stimulating economic growth. Decreasing taxes and increasing government spending are fiscal policy measures typically undertaken by the government rather than the Fed. Increasing the discount rate is a contractionary monetary policy measure that would not help counter a recession."
