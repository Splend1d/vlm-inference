                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the probabilities involved and how they affect the expected number of rolls in a non-leap year (which has 365 days).\n\nFirst, let's identify the outcomes when rolling a six-sided die:\n\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5 (3 outcomes)\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6 (2 outcomes)\n- The number 1, which results in a re-roll (1 outcome)\n\nThe probability of rolling a prime number is \\(P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and the probability of rolling a composite number is \\(P(\\text{composite}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). When a 1 is rolled, the roll is discarded and repeated, so we don't directly count it in our initial calculation but consider its effect on the expected number of rolls.\n\nLet's denote \\(E\\) as the expected number of rolls per day. On any given roll, there's a \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) chance of rolling a 1 and needing to roll again, and a \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) chance of rolling something else (either a prime or a composite number, which ends the decision process for that day). Therefore, the expected number of rolls per day can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{1}{6}(1 + E) + \\frac{5}{6}(1)\\]\n\nThis equation accounts for the fact that if a 1 is rolled (with probability \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)), an additional roll is needed (hence the \\(1 + E\\)) and if not (with probability \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\)), only one roll is made.\n\nSolving for \\(E\\):\n\n\\[E = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}E + \\frac{5}{6}\\]\n\\[E - \\frac{1}{6}E = 1\\]\n\\[\\frac{5}{6}E = 1\\]\n\\[E = \\frac{6}{5}\\]\n\nSo, the expected number of rolls per day is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\).\n\nFor a non-leap year with 365 days, the expected total number of rolls is:\n\n\\[365 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = 73 \\times 6 = 438\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 438."
