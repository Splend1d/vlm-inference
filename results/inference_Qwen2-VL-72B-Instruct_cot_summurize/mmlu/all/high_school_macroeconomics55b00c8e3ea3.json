Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nThese actions will all contribute to an increase in the money supply:\n\n1. **Lowering reserve requirements**: This allows banks to lend out more money, increasing the money supply as loans create new deposits.\n2. **Lowering the discount rate**: This makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve, encouraging them to borrow more and lend more, thus increasing the money supply.\n3. **Buying bonds**: When the Fed buys bonds, it injects money into the economy by paying for those bonds with newly created reserves, which increases the money supply."
