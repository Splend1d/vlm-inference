The isotropic hyperfine coupling constant \\( A \\) for deuterium is typically much smaller than that for hydrogen.\n\nIn benzene radical anion (C6H6\u2022-), the hyperfine splitting constant for hydrogen is around 0.91 mT (or 9.1 G). Since deuterium has a smaller magnetic moment, the hyperfine splitting constant for deuterium will be significantly smaller.\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. 0.375 mT\nB. 3.75 G\nC. 2.35 mT\nD. 0.58 G\n\nWe can estimate the hyperfine splitting constant for deuterium by considering that it is typically about one-fifth to one-tenth of the corresponding value for hydrogen. Therefore, the hyperfine splitting constant for deuterium in C6D6\u2022- would be approximately 0.182 mT to 0.091 mT.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest value to this range is:\n\nD. 0.58 G\n\nTherefore, the predicted hyperfine value for the EPR spectrum of fully deuteriated benzene radical anion C6D6\u2022- is:\n\nD. 0.58 G"
