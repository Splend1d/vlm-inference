This means the person is between 16 and 18 inclusive.\n\n2. **Expression II: (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))**\n\n   This expression checks if the age is greater than or equal to 16 and not greater than or equal to 18. This means the person is exactly 16 or 17.\n\n3. **Expression III: (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))**\n\n   This expression checks if the age is less than 18 and not less than 16. This means the person is exactly 16 or 17.\n\nNow, let's summarize the conditions:\n- Expression I covers ages 16, 17, and 18.\n- Expression II covers ages 16 and 17.\n- Expression III also covers ages 16 and 17.\n\nThe requirement is that the person is old enough to drive (at least 16) but not old enough to vote (less than 18). Therefore, the correct ages are 16 and 17.\n\nBoth Expressions II and III correctly identify these ages, while Expression I includes age 18, which is not valid according to the given criteria.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III only**"
