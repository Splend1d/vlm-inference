The following day, the card shop sent the following fax to the printing company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated Christmas cards, not Thanksgiving cards. \"On October 15, the printing company sent the following fax to the card shop: \"Will ship 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards by November 1. Please ship the Thanksgiving cards back to our warehouse and bill us for the shipping charges. \" This fax was received by the card shop, but the card shop did not respond to it or ship the Thanksgiving cards back to the printing company. On October 25, the printing company attempted to deliver 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards to the card shop, but the latter refused to accept. Did the card shop properly reject the October 25 delivery?\n\nA. No, because under the UCC a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without consideration.\nB. No, because the printing company cured the October 10 defective shipment by its tender of conforming goods on October 25.\nC. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted a present breach of contract.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the card shop properly rejected the October 25 delivery, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Initial Order**: On September 15, the card shop ordered 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards with a delivery date of November 1.\n2. **Defective Shipment**: On October 10, the printing company mistakenly shipped 100 dozen assorted Thanksgiving cards instead of Christmas cards.\n3. **Rejection Notice**: On October 13, the card shop informed the printing company that the shipment was rejected because it was not what was ordered.\n4. **Printing Company's Response**: On October 15, the printing company acknowledged the mistake and offered to ship the correct Christmas cards by November 1 and asked the card shop to return the Thanksgiving cards at their expense.\n5. **Second Attempt**: On October 25, the printing company attempted to deliver the correct Christmas cards, but the card shop refused to accept them.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Anticipatory Breach vs. Present Breach**:\n  - An **anticipatory breach** occurs when one party indicates they will not perform as agreed before the performance is due.\n  - A **present breach** occurs when one party fails to perform as agreed when the performance is due.\n\nIn this case, the printing company's initial shipment of Thanksgiving cards on October 10 was a clear failure to perform as agreed (a present breach), not an indication that they would fail to perform in the future (an anticipatory breach).\n\n- **Cure Under UCC**:\n  - Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a seller has the opportunity to cure a defective delivery if they do so within a reasonable time and before the buyer has accepted the goods or taken steps inconsistent with the seller\u2019s right to cure.\n  - The printing company attempted to cure the defective delivery by offering to send the correct Christmas cards by November 1, which was within the original delivery timeframe specified by the card shop.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven that the printing company attempted to cure the defective shipment by offering to deliver the correct Christmas cards by the original deadline (November 1) and made a second attempt on October 25, the card shop's rejection of the October 25 delivery was improper. The printing company had taken reasonable steps to rectify the initial error and fulfill the contract terms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the printing company cured the October 10 defective shipment by its tender of conforming goods on October 25.**"
