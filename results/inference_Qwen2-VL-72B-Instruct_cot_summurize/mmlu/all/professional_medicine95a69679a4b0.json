Metabolism\n\nCarbamazepine is known to induce liver enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which can accelerate the metabolism of other drugs and substances, including vitamin D. This increased metabolic rate can lead to lower levels of active vitamin D in the body, potentially contributing to bone health issues such as osteoporosis. Therefore, increasing vitamin D intake helps to compensate for its faster metabolism and maintain adequate levels necessary for bone health."
