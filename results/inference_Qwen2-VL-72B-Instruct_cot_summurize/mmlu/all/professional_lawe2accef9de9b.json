                    "text": "Needing a new supply of basketballs for the upcoming season, a basketball coach placed an order with a sporting goods store to purchase 25 regulation basketballs. Since the season was scheduled to begin on November 1, the coach stated that he needed the basketballs delivered no later than October 15. The sporting goods store said it would deliver the basketballs by that date. On October 10, one of the sporting goods store's employees was moving items in the warehouse and accidentally destroyed a container of basketballs. As a result, the owner of the sporting goods store telephoned the coach on October 11 and said, \"We had an accident in our warehouse yesterday, and as a result we do not have enough basketballs to fill all of our orders. Therefore, I won't be able to deliver your basketballs on October 15. However, I have contacted our supplier to see if they can rush a delivery of basketballs to us. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the basketballs you ordered by October 20. \" The coach replied, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by until then. \" When the coach failed to receive the basketballs on October 20, he sent the following e-mail to the sporting goods store:\"I must have the basketballs no later than October 23. \" The e-mail was received and read the same day by the owner of the sporting goods store. If the sporting goods store fails to deliver the basketballs to the coach on October 23, will the coach be entitled to cancel the contract?\n\nA. Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.\nB. Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.\nC. No, because the coach's October 11 statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.\nD. No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11 statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the coach is entitled to cancel the contract if the sporting goods store fails to deliver the basketballs by October 23, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the communications between the two parties.\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The coach ordered 25 regulation basketballs from the sporting goods store with a delivery deadline of October 15.\n2. **Accident and Delay Notice**: On October 11, the sporting goods store informed the coach about the accident and inability to meet the original delivery date but promised to try to deliver the basketballs by October 20.\n3. **Coach's Response**: The coach accepted the delay and indicated that he could wait until October 20.\n4. **Failure to Deliver by October 20**: The sporting goods store did not deliver the basketballs by October 20.\n5. **Coach's New Deadline**: The coach sent an email on October 20 stating that he needed the basketballs no later than October 23.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: Yes, provided both parties are viewed as being merchants.**\n- This option suggests that the coach's entitlement to cancel depends on both parties being merchants. However, the nature of the parties (whether they are merchants or not) does not directly affect the analysis of the specific communications and deadlines set forth in this scenario.\n\n**Option B: Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.**\n- This option implies that the coach's notice on October 20 giving the store until October 23 to deliver the basketballs was reasonable. Given that the store had already failed to deliver by October 20, a three-day extension might be considered reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n**Option C: No, because the coach's October 11 statement effectuated a waiver of any condition of timely delivery.**\n- This option suggests that the coach's acceptance of the delayed delivery on October 11 waives any subsequent requirement for timely delivery. However, the coach explicitly set a new deadline of October 23 after the failure to deliver by October 20, indicating that the initial waiver did not extend indefinitely.\n\n**Option D: No, because the sporting goods store, by its October 11 statement, did not promise to deliver the basketballs by October 20.**\n- This option focuses on the store's communication on October 11, where they did not guarantee delivery by October 20 but only expressed hope. However, the coach's subsequent email setting a new deadline of October 23 indicates that the store was given another chance to fulfill the order within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nConsidering the sequence of events and the communications, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Option B: Yes, provided that the three-day notice afforded the sporting goods store a reasonable time in which to perform.**\n\nThis option aligns with the coach's reasonable extension of the deadline and the store's failure to meet that extended deadline."
