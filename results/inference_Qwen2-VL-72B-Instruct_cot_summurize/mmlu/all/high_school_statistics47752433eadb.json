In this case, the interval is given as (6, 12) years. This means that based on the sample data, we have 90% confidence that the actual difference in the mean life expectancy between model A and model B refrigerators falls somewhere between 6 and 12 years.\n\nLet's analyze the other options:\n\nA. The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.\n- This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The confidence interval only tells us about the difference in life expectancy, not the ratio of the life expectancies.\n\nB. The mean life expectancy of one model is 6 years, while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12 years.\n- This is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide specific values for the mean life expectancies of each model; it only gives the range of the difference between them.\n\nC. The probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90.\n- This is also incorrect. The confidence interval does not give the probability that the life expectancies are different; rather, it gives the level of confidence in the interval estimate of the difference.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion based on the provided confidence interval is option D."
