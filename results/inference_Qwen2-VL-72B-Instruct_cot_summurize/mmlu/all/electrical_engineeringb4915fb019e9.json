This allows the processor to multiplex the address and data buses, which helps to reduce the number of pins required on the chip. When the ALE signal is high, the data bus is configured as an address bus, and when it is low, the data bus is configured as a data bus. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Enable the data bus to be used as low order address bus."
