This would be highly relevant and admissible.\n\nC. **The judge, though not convicted, embezzled money from a former employer before being elected to the bench.**\n   - Allegations of embezzlement, even without a conviction, might still be relevant to showing a pattern of dishonest behavior, potentially supporting the claim that the judge is corrupt.\n\nD. **The judge was convicted for a felony assault 12 years earlier.**\n   - A conviction for felony assault does not directly relate to the claim that the judge is corrupt or dishonest. Assault is a violent crime and does not inherently imply corruption or dishonesty.\n\nGiven this analysis, the evidence that the club president may not properly introduce to support his plea of truth is:\n\n**D. The judge was convicted for a felony assault 12 years earlier.**\n\nThis conviction is unrelated to the specific claim about the judge's integrity and honesty in judicial matters."
