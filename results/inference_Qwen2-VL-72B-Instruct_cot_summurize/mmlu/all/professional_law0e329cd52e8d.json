As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water. Within a short time, the driver, unable to escape, drowned in his car, which rapidly filled with water. In a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department, the estate will most probably\n\nA. prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.\nB. prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.\nC. not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.\nD. not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the most likely outcome in this wrongful death action, we need to analyze the legal principles involved, particularly those related to sovereign immunity and liability for negligence.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Sovereign Immunity**:\n   - Sovereign immunity generally protects governments from being sued without their consent. However, there are exceptions where immunity does not apply, such as when the government is performing a proprietary function rather than a governmental one.\n\n2. **Proprietary vs. Governmental Functions**:\n   - Proprietary functions are those that could be performed by private entities (e.g., running a business). Governmental functions are those inherent to the operation of government (e.g., police protection).\n   - Repairing a water main can be considered a governmental function since it involves maintaining public infrastructure.\n\n3. **Negligence of Independent Contractors**:\n   - Generally, a principal (in this case, the municipal water department) is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor unless certain conditions are met, such as the contractor performing inherently dangerous work or the principal retaining control over the details of the work.\n\n### Application to the Scenario:\n\n- The municipal water department hired a construction company to repair a water main break, which is a governmental function.\n- The construction company failed to erect a proper barrier around the hole, leading to the accident.\n- The driver's estate is bringing a wrongful death action against the municipal water department.\n\n### Options Analysis:\n\nA. **Prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.**\n   - This option suggests that the repair work is proprietary. However, repairing a water main is typically considered a governmental function, not proprietary.\n\nB. **Prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.**\n   - Strict liability applies in cases where the harm results from inherently dangerous activities. While repairing a water main might involve some risks, it is not inherently dangerous in the same way as, say, handling explosives. Therefore, strict liability may not apply here.\n\nC. **Not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.**\n   - This option correctly identifies that the municipal water department is not automatically liable for the negligence of an independent contractor. However, if the department retained control over the details of the work or if the contractor was performing inherently dangerous work, the department might still be liable.\n\nD. **Not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.**\n   - This option correctly identifies that sovereign immunity applies to governmental functions. Since repairing a water main is a governmental function, the municipal water department would likely be protected by sovereign immunity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis, the most probable outcome is that the driver's estate will **not prevail** due to sovereign immunity attaching to the governmental function of repairing the water main.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**D. not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.**"
