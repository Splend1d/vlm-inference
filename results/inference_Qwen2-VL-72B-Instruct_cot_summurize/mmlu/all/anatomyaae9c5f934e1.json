The external intercostal muscles help to expand the rib cage, while the diaphragm contracts and flattens, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity, which in turn decreases the pressure inside the lungs, allowing air to flow in. The internal intercostal muscles are more active during forced expiration rather than during quiet inspiration."
