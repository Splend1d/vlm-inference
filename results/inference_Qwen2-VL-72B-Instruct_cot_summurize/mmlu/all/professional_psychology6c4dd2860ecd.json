Job satisfaction, building resilience, building self-esteem and social skills, addressing risk factors, and encouraging healthy behavior\n\nPromoting and enhancing health involves a multifaceted approach that includes not just physical health but also mental and emotional well-being. This includes encouraging healthy behaviors, such as regular exercise and nutritious eating, while also addressing underlying issues like job satisfaction, resilience, self-esteem, and social skills. Additionally, it's important to address risk factors that can contribute to poor health outcomes. Targeting specific problem groups and advocating for health can be part of this broader strategy, but they should be complemented by efforts to improve overall well-being and empower individuals to make healthier choices."
