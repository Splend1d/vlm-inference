Research that improves the productivity of labor and capital\n\nImprovements in productivity, whether through technological advancements or better processes, can lead to an increase in the economy's potential output without causing inflation. This results in a rightward shift of the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve, indicating that the economy can produce more at each price level.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options do not shift the LRAS curve to the right:\n\nA. Devoting more resources to nondurable consumption goods rather than durable capital goods would likely decrease investment in productive capacity, which could reduce future output potential and thus not shift the LRAS curve to the right.\n\nC. More restrictive trade policies typically limit access to cheaper inputs and technologies from abroad, which can reduce efficiency and productivity, leading to a leftward shift of the LRAS curve rather than a rightward one.\n\nD. Annual limits to immigration of foreign citizens can reduce the labor force, potentially decreasing the economy's productive capacity, which would also result in a leftward shift of the LRAS curve."
