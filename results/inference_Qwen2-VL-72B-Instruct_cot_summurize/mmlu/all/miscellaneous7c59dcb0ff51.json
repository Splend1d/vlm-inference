This would be:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ movies/month} \\times 12 \\text{ months/year} = 60 \\text{ movies/year}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of Movies Watched**: Multiply the average number of movies watched per person by the total population:\n   \\[\n   60 \\text{ movies/year/person} \\times 330,000,000 \\text{ people} = 19,800,000,000 \\text{ movies/year}\n   \\]\n\nGiven these assumptions, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 20,000,000,000"
