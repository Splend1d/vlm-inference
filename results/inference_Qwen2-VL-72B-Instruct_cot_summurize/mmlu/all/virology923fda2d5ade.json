Three students were unable to take the test on the scheduled date and were given a different form of the exam 1 week later.

In contrast, the mean can be influenced by extreme scores, and the mode may not accurately represent the center of the distribution if it is skewed. The standard deviation measures dispersion rather than central tendency. Therefore, the median is the best choice for estimating the central tendency of the distribution of biochemistry test scores."
