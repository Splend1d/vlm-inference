These laws generally require that schools obtain written consent from both parents before releasing information about their child, especially if there is a dispute between the parents. Additionally, ethical guidelines for psychologists typically emphasize the importance of confidentiality and obtaining informed consent before sharing test results. Without proper authorization or a court order, providing test results to one parent without the other's consent would be a violation of these legal and ethical standards."
