                    "text": "To determine which nineteenth-century political philosophy Herbert Spencer was advocating for, let's analyze the key points in the passage:\n\n1. **Government's Role**: Spencer argues that the government should only protect individuals and their freedoms, not provide relief or assistance beyond this scope. He states that enforcing laws and ensuring freedom without infringing on others' rights is the proper role of the government.\n\n2. **Individual Responsibility**: Spencer emphasizes individual responsibility over collective or governmental intervention. He suggests that hardships such as poverty, distress, and starvation are natural outcomes of personal incapability, imprudence, or idleness.\n\n3. **Natural Selection**: Spencer uses the concept of \"survival of the fittest\" to justify these outcomes, implying that such hardships contribute to the overall benefit of society by allowing stronger individuals to succeed while weaker ones face consequences.\n\nGiven these points, we can evaluate each option:\n\n- **Conservatism**: Typically supports traditional values and institutions, often advocating for limited government intervention but not necessarily emphasizing individualism to the extent described by Spencer.\n  \n- **Anarchism**: Advocates for the abolition of all forms of government and organized authority, which is not explicitly supported by Spencer since he acknowledges a role for government in protecting individual freedoms.\n\n- **Liberalism**: Generally supports individual liberty and minimal government interference in economic affairs, aligning closely with Spencer's emphasis on individual responsibility and limited government roles.\n\n- **Socialism**: Advocates for significant government intervention to redistribute wealth and resources, which directly contradicts Spencer's views.\n\nBased on the analysis, Spencer's advocacy for minimal government intervention and strong emphasis on individual responsibility aligns most closely with **Liberalism**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Liberalism"
