Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law\n\nIn the context of international law, states cannot rely on their domestic laws as an excuse for violating their international obligations. According to the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept), once a state has entered into an international treaty or agreement, it is bound by its terms and must comply with them, regardless of any conflicting domestic laws. This principle is enshrined in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that \"Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\" Therefore, obligations under international law prevail over domestic law."
