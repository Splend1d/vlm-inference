Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n\nCreatine supplements have been shown to enhance muscle strength and power, particularly in high-intensity, short-duration exercises. It helps in replenishing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is crucial for energy production during intense physical activity. \n\nRegarding the other options:\n- A. Increasing protein intake above recommended levels may not necessarily lead to additional muscle growth or strength increases beyond what is achieved with adequate protein intake.\n- C. While amino acid supplements might have some benefits, their effectiveness in increasing muscle strength and power is less clear compared to creatine.\n- D. Muscle damage is typically associated with eccentric contractions (lengthening contractions) rather than shortening contractions."
