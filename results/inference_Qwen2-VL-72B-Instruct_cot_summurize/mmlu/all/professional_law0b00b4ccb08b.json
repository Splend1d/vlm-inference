Close to the top of the mountain, the friend fell off of his ski lift, and sustained injuries. The young man then decided he had had enough of skiing, but his friend called out, \"...you have to help! You have to call someone! I cant walk and it is your fault I am up here!\" The man did not respond and went home. His friend froze to death with no help ever coming to him. The people on the lift behind them both heard and saw everything, and the prosecutors office investigated the incident as a possible negligent homicide. What is the most likely decision of the prosecutor?\n\nA. The prosecutor will not file charges because the two men were not related to each other in a way that might create a duty, nor was there a special relationship that would create a duty.\nB. The prosecutor will not file charges because the man broke no laws when he walked away and it does not matter what the relationship was between them.\nC. The prosecutor will file charges because there are eyewitnesses who will testify to the young man's callous behavior to his friend.\nD. The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.\n"

In many jurisdictions, there is generally no legal duty to rescue unless there is a special relationship or specific circumstances that create such a duty. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The prosecutor will not file charges because the two men were not related to each other in a way that might create a duty, nor was there a special relationship that would create a duty.**\n   - This option suggests that there was no special relationship (such as family, employer-employee, or doctor-patient) that would impose a legal duty to rescue. If this is true, the young man may not be criminally liable simply for walking away.\n\nB. **The prosecutor will not file charges because the man broke no laws when he walked away and it does not matter what the relationship was between them.**\n   - This option emphasizes that the absence of a specific law requiring one person to rescue another means that the young man cannot be charged. This aligns with the general principle that there is no duty to rescue unless a special relationship exists or the situation involves certain circumstances (e.g., creating the peril).\n\nC. **The prosecutor will file charges because there are eyewitnesses who will testify to the young man's callous behavior to his friend.**\n   - While eyewitness testimony can provide evidence, it does not necessarily establish a legal duty to rescue. The presence of witnesses alone does not change the fundamental legal principles regarding the duty to rescue.\n\nD. **The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.**\n   - This option implies that the friendship itself created a special relationship imposing a legal duty to rescue. However, friendships typically do not constitute a special relationship that imposes such a duty under the law.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely decision of the prosecutor would be:\n\n**A. The prosecutor will not file charges because the two men were not related to each other in a way that might create a duty, nor was there a special relationship that would create a duty.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the general legal principle that there is no duty to rescue absent a special relationship or specific circumstances that create such a duty."
