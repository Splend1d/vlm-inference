According to this theory, when Susan's physiological responses (elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate, and higher body temperature) occurred, they led to her feeling either angry or amorous, depending on the context. The theory suggests that emotions arise from our awareness of these bodily changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. James-Lange theory"
