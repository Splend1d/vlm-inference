Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries. An independent candidate, who desires to be listed on the ballot for the office of governor, challenges the constitutionality of this election law. The court will most likely declare this statute\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.\nB. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.\nD. constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.\n"

While these requirements differ, they do not necessarily violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state has a legitimate interest in regulating elections and ensuring that candidates meet certain thresholds to appear on the ballot, which can include obtaining signatures through a nominating petition. As long as the requirements are applied uniformly and do not discriminate based on irrelevant criteria, they are generally considered constitutional. Therefore, the court would likely find the statute constitutional under the equal protection clause."
