To test this, he designed an experiment in which patients who required this type of surgery were randomly assigned to the standard technique or the new technique.

A t-test for a difference in means.\n\nThis is because you are comparing the mean recovery times between two independent groups (patients treated with the standard technique and those treated with the new technique). The appropriate statistical test to compare the means of two independent groups is a t-test for a difference in means. This test helps determine whether the observed difference in recovery times between the two groups is statistically significant."
