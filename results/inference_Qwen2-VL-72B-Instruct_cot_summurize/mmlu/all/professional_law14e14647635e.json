A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered. The report also indicated that certain states had residency laws restricting a person's right to vote. As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment.\nB. Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. Twentieth Amendment.\n"

Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It was ratified in 1870 as part of the Reconstruction Amendments following the Civil War. This amendment directly addresses the issue of racial discrimination in voting rights, making it the most relevant constitutional provision for upholding a statute designed to protect minority voting rights."
