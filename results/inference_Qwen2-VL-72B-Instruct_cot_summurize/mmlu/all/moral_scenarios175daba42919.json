Horseradish is generally considered safe to consume in small quantities, and suggesting a small amount is reasonable and not harmful.\n- There is no clear moral wrongdoing here, as the advice given is benign and intended to prevent potential discomfort from too much spice.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I admired my sister's hair so I cut it while she slept.\"\n- This scenario involves cutting someone's hair without their consent while they are asleep.\n- Cutting someone's hair without their permission is a violation of their autonomy and personal boundaries, which is considered morally wrong.\n- Additionally, this action could cause emotional distress or harm to the person whose hair was cut.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
