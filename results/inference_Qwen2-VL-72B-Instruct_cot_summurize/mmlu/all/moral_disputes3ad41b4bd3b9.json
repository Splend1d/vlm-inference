A description of an alleged actual equality among humans.\n- This suggests that Singer is describing an existing state of equality among humans. However, Singer's work often focuses on ethical prescriptions rather than mere descriptions.\n\nB. A description of an alleged actual inequality among humans.\n- This implies that Singer is describing an existing state of inequality among humans. Again, while Singer acknowledges inequalities, his primary focus is on ethical principles and prescriptions for action.\n\nC. A prescription of how we should treat nonhuman animals.\n- While Singer is well-known for his advocacy of animal rights and the extension of moral consideration to nonhuman animals, this option does not directly address the principle of the equality of human beings.\n\nD. A prescription of how we should treat humans.\n- This aligns with Singer's ethical framework, which emphasizes the principle of equal consideration of interests. He argues that all beings capable of suffering should be treated equally, which includes both humans and nonhuman animals.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate interpretation of Singer's understanding of the principle of the equality of human beings is:\n\n**D. a prescription of how we should treat humans.**"
