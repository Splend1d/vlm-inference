Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. \u03b11-Adrenergic agonist\nB. \u03b12-Adrenergic agonist\nC. \u03b11-Adrenergic antagonist\nD. \u03b22-Adrenergic agonist\n"

These medications relax smooth muscle in the airways, thereby relieving bronchoconstriction and improving breathing. This is particularly important in cases of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions where bronchoconstriction can be a significant component of the reaction. Common examples of \u03b22-adrenergic agonists include albuterol (salbutamol) and terbutaline."
