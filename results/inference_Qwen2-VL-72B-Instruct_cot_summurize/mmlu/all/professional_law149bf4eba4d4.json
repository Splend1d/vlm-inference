He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?\n\nA. The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.\nB. The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.\nC. The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.\nD. The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n"

The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n\nIn this scenario, the original easement of necessity was granted due to the lack of alternative access routes to the highway. However, with the opening of a new access route through public improvements, the necessity for the easement no longer exists. Courts generally consider the principle of equity, which seeks fairness and justice in resolving disputes. Given that there is now an alternative route available, the court is likely to rule that the equities favor the termination of the easement, as the original reason for granting it (necessity) has been negated by the availability of a new access route."
