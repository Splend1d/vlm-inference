The labor-leisure trade-off favors the income effect or more leisure at higher wage rates.\n\nThe backward bending supply curve in labor economics suggests that as wages increase beyond a certain point, individuals may choose to work fewer hours because the additional income from working more is less valuable to them than the leisure time they would give up. This reflects the income effect overpowering the substitution effect."
