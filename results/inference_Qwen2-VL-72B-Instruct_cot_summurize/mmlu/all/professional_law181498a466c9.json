The act further prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. Congress claimed that the statute was passed because it might help deter illicit sexual relationships. The law is most likely\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a regulation of interstate commerce.\nB. constitutional, because it is a measure promoting the general welfare.\nC. unconstitutional, because the law deprives the manufacturers of contraceptives of their property interest without just compensation.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the right of privacy of contraceptive users.\n"

Connecticut (1965), which established the right to marital privacy and struck down a state law that banned the use of contraceptives by married couples. The Court held that there is a constitutional right to privacy that protects individuals' decisions regarding contraception. Therefore, a federal statute that prohibits the sale and use of contraceptive devices by married persons would similarly be considered unconstitutional as it infringes upon this fundamental right to privacy."
