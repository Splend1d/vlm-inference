She has a fee simple.\n\nUnder modern real estate laws and practice in most states today, when a property is conveyed in fee simple, it is transferred with the highest possible interest in the property. This means that the recipient (in this case, the niece) obtains full ownership rights, including the right to sell, lease, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of the property as she sees fit.\n\nThe earlier conveyance to the wife's cousin with the provision \"to cousin and the heirs of his body\" would typically create a life estate for the cousin during his lifetime, with a remainder interest passing to his heirs upon his death. However, since the property was subsequently conveyed in fee simple to the niece, this later conveyance supersedes the previous one, giving the niece full ownership of the property."
