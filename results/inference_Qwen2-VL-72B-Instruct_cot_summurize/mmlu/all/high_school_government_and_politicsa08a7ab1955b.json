Those elections saw major shifts in party alignment that would last for decades.\n\nCritical elections are identified by political scientists as elections that mark significant changes in the political landscape, often leading to long-term shifts in party dominance and voter coalitions. The elections of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and Richard Nixon in 1968, as well as the midterm election of 1994, are considered critical because they each resulted in substantial realignments within the American political system that had lasting effects on party politics and governance."
