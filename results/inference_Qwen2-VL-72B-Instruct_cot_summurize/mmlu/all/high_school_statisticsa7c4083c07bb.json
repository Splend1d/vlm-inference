They found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a much lower incidence of depression. In an American newspaper article about this study, which of the following statements should not be made?\n\nA. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't.\nB. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't.\nC. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship.\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n"
