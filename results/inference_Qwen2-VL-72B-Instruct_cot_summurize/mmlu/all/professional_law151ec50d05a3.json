Common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The purchase price was $50,000, of which the sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000. The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?\n\nA. The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.\nB. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\nC. Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\nD.

Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, upon the death of one joint tenant, their interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s), regardless of any provisions in a will. Therefore, when the brother died, his interest in the land passed to the sister, making her the sole owner of the property. The fact that the sister had mortgaged her interest and later paid off the mortgage does not affect this outcome. The mortgage being released simply means that there are no encumbrances on the sister's ownership of the land."
