If the arm is raised above heart level, the blood pressure reading will be lower (underestimated) due to the effect of gravity on blood flow. Conversely, if the arm is below heart level, the blood pressure reading will be higher (overestimated). This is why it's standard practice to measure blood pressure with the arm supported and at the level of the heart."
