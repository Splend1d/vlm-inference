It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment\nC. The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n"

It focuses more on economic and power dynamics.\n\nC. **The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism**:\n   - This option aligns well with the idea that foreign investment can lead to increased global interconnectedness and cultural exchange through consumer goods and services. However, the passage emphasizes the need for investment to be aligned with the national plans of the recipient country, suggesting a more controlled form of globalization.\n\nD. **The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies**:\n   - This option is plausible because foreign investment, when managed according to a national plan, could potentially stabilize economies and reduce political unrest by providing economic benefits and reducing poverty.\n\nGiven the context of the passage, which stresses the importance of foreign investment being aligned with national plans to prevent neo-colonialism and promote the interests of the recipient country, the most direct result would likely be related to economic stability and reduced unrest.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies**"
