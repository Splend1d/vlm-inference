The ability to draw shapes.\n\nThe frontal lobe of the brain's cortex is primarily involved in motor function, problem-solving, spatial reasoning, memory, language, and decision making. It plays a key role in the ability to draw shapes as it controls voluntary movements and spatial awareness. The other options listed are associated with different parts of the brain:\n\n- A. The sleep/wake cycle is regulated by the hypothalamus and other structures in the brainstem.\n- C. Understanding others' speech is primarily a function of the temporal lobe, particularly Wernicke's area.\n- D. Visual perception is mainly processed in the occipital lobe."
