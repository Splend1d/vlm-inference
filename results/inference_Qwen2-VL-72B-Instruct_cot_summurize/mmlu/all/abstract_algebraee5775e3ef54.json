In other words, it is a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) from a set to itself.\n- Since every permutation maps each element of the set to exactly one other element without any repetitions, it is indeed a one-to-one function.\n- Therefore, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n- A permutation is specifically defined as a bijection on a finite set, meaning it must be both one-to-one and onto (surjective).\n- While being one-to-one is necessary for a function to potentially be a permutation, it is not sufficient. The function must also map every element of the domain to every element of the codomain (i.e., it must be surjective).\n- Therefore, **Statement 2** is false because not every one-to-one function is a permutation; it must also be onto.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
