                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid flowing through a pipe. This principle states that the volume flow rate (Q) remains constant throughout the pipe. The volume flow rate is given by:\n\n\\[ Q = A \\cdot v \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and \\( v \\) is the flow velocity.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cross-sectional areas at both points in the pipe. The cross-sectional area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nFor the first point:\n- Diameter \\( d_1 = 2 \\text{ cm} = 0.02 \\text{ m} \\)\n- Radius \\( r_1 = \\frac{d_1}{2} = 0.01 \\text{ m} \\)\n\nThe cross-sectional area \\( A_1 \\) is:\n\\[ A_1 = \\pi (0.01)^2 = \\pi \\times 0.0001 = 0.000314 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\nFor the second point:\n- Diameter \\( d_2 = 3 \\text{ cm} = 0.03 \\text{ m} \\)\n- Radius \\( r_2 = \\frac{d_2}{2} = 0.015 \\text{ m} \\)\n\nThe cross-sectional area \\( A_2 \\) is:\n\\[ A_2 = \\pi (0.015)^2 = \\pi \\times 0.000225 = 0.0007065 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the flow rate \\( Q \\) is constant, we have:\n\\[ A_1 \\cdot v_1 = A_2 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\nWe know \\( v_1 = 18 \\text{ m/s} \\), so we can solve for \\( v_2 \\):\n\\[ 0.000314 \\cdot 18 = 0.0007065 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\\[ 0.005652 = 0.0007065 \\cdot v_2 \\]\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{0.005652}{0.0007065} \\approx 8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow speed at the second point is approximately 8 m/s.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 8 m/s"
