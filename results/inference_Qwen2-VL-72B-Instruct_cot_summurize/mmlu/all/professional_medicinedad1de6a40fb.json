They often present with a painful, swollen area that may have one or more midline pores or pits from which hair may emerge. The presence of a low-grade fever and erythema further supports the diagnosis of an infection, which is common with pilonidal abscesses.\n\nAnocutaneous fistula (option A) usually involves a connection between the anus and the skin surface, often causing drainage rather than a fluctuant mass.\n\nCoccygodynia (option B) refers to pain in the coccyx region but does not typically present with the described physical findings of a fluctuant mass and midline pores.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (option C) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting apocrine glands, commonly found in areas like the armpits and groin, and while it can cause painful nodules and abscesses, it is less likely to present with the specific midline pores described in the case.\n\nTherefore, given the history and physical examination findings, a pilonidal abscess is the most appropriate diagnosis."
