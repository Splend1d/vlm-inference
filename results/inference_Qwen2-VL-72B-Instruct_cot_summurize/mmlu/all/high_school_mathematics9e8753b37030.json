Thus,\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 + 2(n - 1)\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the sum formula gives us:\n\n\\[240 = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_1 + 2(n - 1))\\]\n\\[240 = n(a_1 + a_1 + 2n - 2)\\]\n\\[240 = n(2a_1 + 2n - 2)\\]\n\\[240 = 2n(a_1 + n - 1)\\]\n\\[120 = n(a_1 + n - 1)\\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for \\(n\\) and \\(a_1\\) such that their product equals 120 and \\(a_1 + n - 1\\) is also an integer. Since \\(a_1\\) is an odd integer, \\(a_1 + n - 1\\) must be even for their product to be divisible by 2.\n\nLet's factorize 120 to see its possible pairs of factors:\n\n\\[120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\]\n\nThe pairs of factors of 120 are: (1, 120), (2, 60), (3, 40), (4, 30), (5, 24), (6, 20), (8, 15), (10, 12).\n\nWe're looking for pairs where both numbers are positive integers, and the second number minus one is also an integer (since \\(a_1\\) is an odd integer, \\(a_1 + n - 1\\) must be even, which means \\(n - 1\\) must be odd, making \\(n\\) even).\n\nFrom the list above, the valid pairs (considering \\(n\\) must be even) are: (2, 60), (4, 30), (6, 20), (8, 15), (10, 12).\n\nTherefore, there are 5 valid sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4."
