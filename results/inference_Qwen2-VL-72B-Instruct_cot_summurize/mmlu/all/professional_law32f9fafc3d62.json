At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\nB. No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.\nC. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\nD. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the mother is likely to prevail in her action against the doctor for intentional infliction of emotional distress, we need to consider several legal principles related to this type of tort claim.\n\n1. **Outrageous Conduct**: The defendant's conduct must be so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\n\n2. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: The plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, causing severe emotional distress to the plaintiff.\n\n3. **Direct Victim vs. Bystander**: Generally, courts require that the plaintiff be either a direct victim of the outrageous conduct or a bystander who witnessed the conduct contemporaneously.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the mother's contributory negligence in leaving the child alone with the doctor would bar her recovery. However, contributory negligence is not typically a defense in cases of intentional torts like IIED, where the focus is on the defendant's conduct rather than the plaintiff's actions.\n\n- **Option B**: This option states that the mother cannot prevail because she was neither the direct victim nor a contemporaneous witness. Traditionally, courts have been reluctant to allow recovery for IIED if the plaintiff did not directly experience the outrageous conduct or witness it at the time. However, there are exceptions, particularly in cases involving family members and children.\n\n- **Option C**: This option asserts that the doctor's conduct was outrageous. While this is true, it does not address whether the mother can recover for her emotional distress under the circumstances described.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. This aligns with the principle that if the defendant's outrageous conduct foreseeably causes severe emotional distress to a close family member (such as a parent), the plaintiff may recover even if they were not present or a direct victim.\n\nConsidering the specific facts and the principles of law, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct.**\n\nThis option acknowledges that the doctor's outrageous conduct could reasonably be expected to cause severe emotional distress to the mother upon learning about the abuse of her child, even though she was not present during the incident."
