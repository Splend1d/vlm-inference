Visiting a shrine built on the shore of a lake could also be a practice for some Hindus, but it is not as central to their religious beliefs as bathing in the Ganges. Praying five times a day is a practice associated with Islam, and making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem is associated with Judaism and Christianity."
