On October 31, the owner entered into a written contract with a worker that provided that the worker would be employed for the months of November and December to work at the retail store for $2,000 per month. At the end of November, the owner noticed that business had not increased as much as he had expected. The owner informed the worker that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, he would be fired. Reluctantly, on December 1, the worker orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 for the month of December. Which of the following statements regarding the December 1 agreement between the owner and the worked is most accurate?\n\nA. It effectuated a valid reformation of their original written contract.\nB. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\nC. It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n"

It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the original written contract between the owner and the worker established specific terms of employment, including the salary for the months of November and December. When the owner proposed a salary reduction due to lower-than-expected business, the worker orally consented to the change. This oral agreement to modify the salary for the month of December constitutes a valid modification of the original written contract. A modification can be made through oral agreement if both parties consent to the new terms, even though the original contract was in writing. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
