The complementary probability of an event occurring is the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nGiven:\n- Probability of rain (P(Rain)) = 70%\n\nThe probability of no rain (P(No Rain)) is the complement of the probability of rain. It can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P(No Rain) = 1 - P(Rain) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value:\n\n\\[ P(No Rain) = 1 - 0.70 \\]\n\\[ P(No Rain) = 0.30 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percent chance that it will not rain on that same day is 30%.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 30%."
