Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.\n\nSelf-efficacy is built through mastery experiences, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. Avoiding tasks due to lack of proficiency does not provide opportunities for mastery or learning, which are crucial for building self-efficacy. Instead, facing challenges and gradually improving skills through practice and perseverance are more effective strategies."
