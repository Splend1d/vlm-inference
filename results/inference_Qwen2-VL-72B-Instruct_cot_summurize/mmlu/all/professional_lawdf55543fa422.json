The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?\n\nA. It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.\nB. It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\nC. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\nD. It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a contract between a woman and a gymnasium for prenatal and postnatal exercise classes. The woman has been involved in an accident and, as per her doctor's advice, must cease all strenuous activities, including the exercise classes. The question revolves around whether the woman is still obligated to pay the second installment of $500 despite her inability to attend the classes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.**\n   - Impossibility of performance refers to situations where unforeseen events make it objectively impossible for one party to fulfill their contractual obligations. In this case, the woman's accident and subsequent doctor's advice render her physically unable to attend the classes. This could potentially excuse her from making further payments if the contract allows for such circumstances.\n\nB. **It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.**\n   - Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines the fundamental reason for entering into the contract. Here, the woman's primary reason for enrolling in the program (to participate in prenatal and postnatal exercises) has been thwarted by her accident. If the contract includes provisions for frustration of purpose, this could excuse her from further payments.\n\nC. **It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.**\n   - While the contract specifies that fees are non-refundable, this does not necessarily mean that the woman is still obligated to pay for services she cannot use. Non-refundability clauses typically address refunds for already paid amounts, not future payments. Therefore, this clause alone does not resolve the issue of ongoing obligations.\n\nD. **It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.**\n   - A condition precedent requires certain conditions to be met before a party\u2019s obligation arises. However, in this context, the woman's obligation to pay the second installment is not contingent on her ability to attend classes; it is a separate obligation. Thus, this argument does not directly address the issue of her inability to perform due to the accident.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate description of the woman's duty to pay the second installment fee is:\n\n**A. It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.**\n\nThis option best captures the situation where the woman's accident makes it objectively impossible for her to continue with the exercise classes, thereby potentially excusing her from making further payments."
