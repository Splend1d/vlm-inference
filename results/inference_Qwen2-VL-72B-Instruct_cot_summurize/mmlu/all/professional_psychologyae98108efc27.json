The task is to identify the primary concern among the given options.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Patients beginning with a group, finding additional sources of support, tend to terminate the individual therapy prematurely**:\n   - This suggests that patients might drop out of individual therapy early if they find sufficient support in the group setting. While this could be a concern, it doesn't directly address the core issue of concurrent therapies potentially conflicting or undermining each other.\n\nB. **Patients wait until they are in their individual sessions before reacting to what occurred in the group**:\n   - This implies that patients might delay processing group experiences until individual sessions. While this could affect the flow of therapy, it doesn't necessarily highlight a significant conflict between the two types of therapy.\n\nC. **Screening procedures for patients may be ignored because a therapist is recommending the group experience**:\n   - This option suggests a procedural concern rather than a direct conflict between individual and group therapy. It focuses on the potential neglect of screening processes rather than the interaction between the two therapies.\n\nD. **Patients use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions for behavior change**:\n   - This option highlights a direct conflict where patients might leverage the advice from one therapist to contradict suggestions made by group members. This can create confusion and undermine the effectiveness of both therapies, making it a significant concern for therapists.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant concern for therapists regarding concurrent individual and group therapy is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Patients use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions for behavior change.**"
