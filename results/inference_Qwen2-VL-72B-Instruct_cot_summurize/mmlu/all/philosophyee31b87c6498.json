Gauthier, particularly in his work \"Morals by Agreement,\" argues that practical rationality is fundamentally about making decisions that are mutually beneficial and justifiable to all parties involved.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Moral justification**: This suggests that practical rationality is grounded in moral principles. While Gauthier does discuss morality, he focuses more on the practical aspects of rational decision-making rather than purely moral justifications.\n\nB. **Deliberative justification**: This implies that practical rationality involves careful consideration and reasoning about the best course of action. Gauthier emphasizes the importance of rational deliberation in reaching agreements that are mutually beneficial.\n\nC. **Epistemic justification**: This would mean that practical rationality is based on knowledge and evidence. While knowledge is important, Gauthier's focus is more on the process of rational agreement rather than just epistemic justification.\n\nD. **An illusion**: This suggests that practical rationality is not real or meaningful. Gauthier does not view practical rationality as an illusion; instead, he presents it as a coherent and significant concept.\n\nGiven Gauthier's emphasis on rational deliberation and mutual benefit in his arguments, the most fitting option is:\n\n**B. Deliberative justification**\n\nThus, Gauthier claims that there is nothing for practical rationality to be besides deliberative justification."
