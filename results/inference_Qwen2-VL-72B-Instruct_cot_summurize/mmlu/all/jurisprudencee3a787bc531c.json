Principles describe rights, policies describe goals.\n\nIn Ronald Dworkin's legal theory, he distinguishes between principles and policies in the context of legal interpretation. According to Dworkin, principles are moral standards that judges should use to decide cases when the law is not clear or when there are conflicting statutes or precedents. These principles often relate to fundamental rights and justice. On the other hand, policies refer to broader social goals or objectives that the law aims to achieve, such as economic efficiency or public safety. Policies are more about the practical outcomes desired by society rather than the moral rights of individuals."
