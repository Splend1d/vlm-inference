Describe development as a process of growth (gain) and decline (loss)\n\nBaltes's Selective Optimization with Compensation theory is a lifespan developmental theory that emphasizes the dynamic interplay between gains and losses throughout the lifespan. It suggests that individuals adapt to changes by selectively investing in certain areas while compensating for declines in others. This theory acknowledges both growth and decline as integral parts of the developmental process."
