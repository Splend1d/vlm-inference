In this case, r = 0.1.\n\nWhen a bank receives new deposits, it must set aside a portion of those deposits as required reserves. The remaining funds can be lent out or used for other purposes.\n\nThe formula to calculate the maximum amount a bank can lend is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum Loan} = \\frac{\\text{Deposits}}{\\text{Reserve Ratio}} - \\text{Deposits} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Deposits = $200\n- Reserve Ratio = 0.1\n\nFirst, calculate the required reserves:\n\\[ \\text{Required Reserves} = \\text{Deposits} \\times \\text{Reserve Ratio} = 200 \\times 0.1 = 20 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the maximum loan amount:\n\\[ \\text{Maximum Loan} = \\frac{200}{0.1} - 200 = 2000 - 200 = 1800 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount the bank can lend is $1800.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nC. $2,000"
