The defendant claimed he acted in self-defense after the man drew a knife on him and made menacing gestures with it. The defendant called a witness to the stand to testify that the defendant had a reputation in the community for being a peaceful person. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness if he had heard that the defendant had often engaged in fights and brawls. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the question\n\nA. proper, because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\nB. proper, because it is relevant to prove the defendant's violent propensities.\nC. not proper, because it puts into evidence separate and unrelated offenses.\nD. not proper, because character cannot be proved by generalities.\n"

However, introducing evidence of specific instances of conduct (such as past fights and brawls) to prove a person's character is typically not allowed unless it is directly related to the incident in question. This is to prevent the jury from making decisions based on a defendant's past behavior rather than the facts of the current case. Therefore, the trial judge should rule that the question is not proper because it introduces separate and unrelated offenses."
