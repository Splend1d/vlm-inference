The customer pointed the gun at the owner and said, \"This is a robbery. . . hand over all your money. \"Knowing the gun was unloaded, the owner refused to comply.

Attempted robbery involves the intention to commit robbery coupled with some overt act towards its commission, even if the crime is not completed."
