This is assumption (i).\n\n2. **Consistency**:\n   - For the OLS estimator to be consistent, it must converge in probability to the true parameter values as the sample size increases. This requires that the error terms have finite variance and are uncorrelated with the regressors. Assumption (ii) states that the variance of \\( u_t \\) is constant (\\( \\text{Var}(u_t) = \\sigma^2 \\)), and assumption (iii) states that the error terms are uncorrelated over time (\\( \\text{Cov}(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 \\) for all \\( j \\)).\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - The OLS estimator is efficient under the Gauss-Markov theorem, which requires that the error terms are uncorrelated and homoscedastic (constant variance). Additionally, the errors should be normally distributed for the OLS estimator to be the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). This is assumption (iv): \\( u_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\).\n\nGiven these points, we need assumptions (i), (ii), and (iii) for unbiasedness and consistency, and assumption (iv) for efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
