This formula is known as the product formula for subgroups in group theory. It states that if \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) are subgroups of a group \\( G \\), then the number of elements in the set \\( HK \\) (the product of the two subgroups) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ |HK| = \\frac{|H||K|}{|H \\cap K|} \\]\n\nThis formula holds because every element in \\( HK \\) can be uniquely written as \\( hk \\) where \\( h \\in H \\) and \\( k \\in K \\). The denominator \\( |H \\cap K| \\) accounts for the overlap between \\( H \\) and \\( K \\).\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to \\( D_p \\).\"\n\nThis statement is also true. According to the classification of groups of order \\( 2p \\) where \\( p \\) is an odd prime, there are only two possibilities:\n\n1. **Cyclic Group**: There exists a single generator for the entire group.\n2. **Dihedral Group**: The group is isomorphic to \\( D_p \\), which represents the symmetries of a regular \\( p \\)-gon.\n\nThese results follow from the Sylow theorems and the structure of groups of small orders.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
