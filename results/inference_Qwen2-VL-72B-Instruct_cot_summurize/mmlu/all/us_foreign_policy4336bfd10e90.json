Increased spending during wars, with demobilization bringing spending down but not back to prewar levels.\n\nThis pattern reflects the historical trend in U.S. defense spending, where there is typically a surge in military expenditures during times of conflict, followed by a reduction in spending as forces are demobilized and the country transitions to peacetime footing. However, post-war spending often remains higher than pre-war levels due to ongoing security needs, technological advancements, and geopolitical considerations."
