More consumer choices, greater price elasticity of demand, more competitors.\n\nWhen there are relatively low or nonexistent barriers to entry in a market, it becomes easier for new firms to enter and compete. This typically leads to:\n\n1. **More Consumer Choices**: As more firms enter the market, consumers have a wider variety of products or services to choose from.\n2. **Greater Price Elasticity of Demand**: With more competitors, each firm has less control over pricing, leading to increased competition on price. Consumers can easily switch between similar products offered by different firms if prices change, making demand more sensitive to price changes.\n3. **More Competitors**: The ease of entry means that the number of firms in the market increases, intensifying competition.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately describes the situation where there are low or nonexistent barriers to entry."
