As the cloud shrank its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy.\n\nWhen the solar nebula began to collapse, the gravitational force caused the material within it to move towards the center. This movement increased the kinetic energy of the particles, which in turn led to collisions and friction. The kinetic energy was then converted into thermal energy, causing the temperature of the nebula to rise. This process is known as gravitational contraction and is a fundamental mechanism in the formation of stars and planets."
