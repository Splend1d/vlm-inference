The strength of an oxo acid increases with the electronegativity of the central atom and the number of oxygen atoms attached to it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the given options:\n\nA. HBrO - Bromine (Br) has an electronegativity of 2.96.\nB. HClO - Chlorine (Cl) has an electronegativity of 3.16.\nC. HIO - Iodine (I) has an electronegativity of 2.66.\nD. HClO3 - Chlorine (Cl) has an electronegativity of 3.16, but this time with three oxygen atoms attached.\n\nGiven that chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and iodine, and considering that HClO3 has three oxygen atoms attached to the chlorine, making it even stronger due to the inductive effect of multiple oxygen atoms, the strongest acid among the given options is:\n\nD. HClO3"
