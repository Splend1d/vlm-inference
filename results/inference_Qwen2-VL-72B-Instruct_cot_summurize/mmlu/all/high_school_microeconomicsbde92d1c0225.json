It typically slopes downward, indicating that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This relationship is based on the principle of diminishing marginal utility, which suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the additional satisfaction (utility) gained from each successive unit decreases. As a result, consumers are willing to pay less for each additional unit, leading to a downward-sloping demand curve."
