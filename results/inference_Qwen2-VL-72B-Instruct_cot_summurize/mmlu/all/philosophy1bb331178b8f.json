Instead, it is derived from our own rational will. Kant argues that the moral law is an expression of our autonomy and rationality, which allows us to determine what actions are right or wrong based on reason alone. This concept is known as the categorical imperative, which states that we should act only according to maxims that we can will to become universal laws."
