This is indicative of being woken up during slow-wave sleep (SWS), also known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 3 or delta sleep.\n\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain wave activity. During SWS, the EEG typically shows high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. delta waves."
