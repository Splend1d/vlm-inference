In most ordinary moral standards, especially in emergencies, saving a living being is considered more important than saving property or valuables.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
