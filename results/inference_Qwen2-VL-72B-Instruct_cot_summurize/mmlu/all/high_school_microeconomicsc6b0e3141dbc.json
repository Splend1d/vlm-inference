This leads to overproduction from the perspective of social welfare because the market does not account for the external costs.\n\nTo achieve the socially optimal quantity of output, which is less than the market equilibrium quantity due to the negative externality, the government might intervene by:\n\n- **Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced**: This directly restricts the amount of the good that can be produced, thereby reducing the negative externality and aligning production with the socially optimal level.\n  \nOther options are less likely to address the issue effectively:\n- **Free market capitalism** typically does not correct for negative externalities without intervention, as the market fails to account for these costs.\n- **Government purchases of the good** would not necessarily reduce the negative externality unless accompanied by other measures.\n- **Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced** would likely exacerbate the problem by forcing more production, increasing the negative externality."
