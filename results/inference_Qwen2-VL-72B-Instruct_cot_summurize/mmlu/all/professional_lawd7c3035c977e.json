The gang leader, who was present but did not participate in the act of robbery itself, later receives the stolen watch from the gang member.\n\nGiven these details, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Accessory after the fact to robbery**: This would apply if the gang leader helped the gang member evade capture or hide evidence after the crime had been committed. However, the gang leader simply received the stolen watch without any indication that he assisted in evading law enforcement or concealing evidence.\n\nB. **Accomplice to robbery**: To be an accomplice, the gang leader would need to have actively participated in planning or executing the robbery. There is no information suggesting that the gang leader was involved in the planning or execution of the robbery.\n\nC. **Conspiracy to commit robbery**: Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a crime. There is no evidence that the gang leader and the gang member had agreed beforehand to commit the robbery.\n\nD. **Receiving stolen property**: This crime involves knowingly receiving property that has been obtained through theft. Since the gang leader knew or should have known that the watch was stolen (given the context), and he accepted it, this fits the definition of receiving stolen property.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Receiving stolen property.**"
