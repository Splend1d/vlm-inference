The passage does not mention capitalist enemies or attribute the need for perestroika to external factors. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. The passage states that \"Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society.\" This clearly indicates that Gorbachev believed the problems requiring perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society. Thus, this option is correct.\n\nC. The passage does not suggest that a socialist society cannot work; rather, it emphasizes the need for restructuring within the existing socialist framework. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. The passage does not discuss the coexistence of socialism and capitalism. It focuses on the internal issues within the socialist society that necessitate perestroika. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society"
