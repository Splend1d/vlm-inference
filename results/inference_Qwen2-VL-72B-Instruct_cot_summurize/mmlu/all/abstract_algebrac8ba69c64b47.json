This means \\( W \\) is the trivial vector space containing only the zero vector. \n\nGiven \\( \\dim(V) < \\dim(W) \\), we have \\( \\dim(V) < 0 \\), which is not possible since dimensions of vector spaces are non-negative integers. Therefore, this statement is based on an impossible condition (negative dimension).\n\nSince the premise of the statement is impossible, the statement itself cannot be evaluated in terms of being true or false. However, if we consider the logical structure, any statement derived from an impossible premise is vacuously true. Thus, we can consider this statement as vacuously true.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"Let \\( \\dim(V) = n \\) and suppose that \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\) is linear. If \\( T \\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\"\n\nFor a linear transformation \\( T: V \\rightarrow V \\) to be a bijection, it must be both injective and surjective. Since \\( V \\) has finite dimension \\( n \\), and \\( T \\) is injective, it implies that \\( T \\) maps distinct vectors in \\( V \\) to distinct vectors in \\( V \\). For a finite-dimensional vector space, an injective linear transformation between two spaces of the same dimension is also surjective. Hence, if \\( T \\) is injective, it must also be surjective, making it a bijection.\n\nTherefore, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Statement 1 is vacuously true due to the impossible premise.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA.
