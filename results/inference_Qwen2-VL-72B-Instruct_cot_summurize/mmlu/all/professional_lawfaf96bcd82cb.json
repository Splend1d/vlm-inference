He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which claim would least aid the law student in his defense against a charge of larceny, we need to analyze each option in the context of the elements required to establish larceny.\n\nLarceny typically involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.**\n   - This claim suggests that the law student took the book as collateral for unpaid wages. While this might be seen as a form of theft, it could potentially be argued that the act was motivated by a legitimate grievance rather than pure malice or greed. However, it still involves taking something without permission, so it doesn't fully exonerate him from larceny charges.\n\nB. **He intended to return the book after reading it.**\n   - This claim directly addresses the element of intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. If true, it would significantly undermine the prosecution's case because larceny requires the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Therefore, this claim would strongly aid his defense.\n\nC. **The law firm had given him possession of the book.**\n   - Possession implies that the law firm had given the law student the right to control and use the book temporarily. If true, this would mean that the law student did not unlawfully take the book, thus negating a key element of larceny. This claim would also strongly aid his defense.\n\nD. **The law firm had given him custody of the book.**\n   - Custody implies that the law firm entrusted the law student with the book for a specific purpose or duration. Similar to possession, if true, this would mean that the law student did not unlawfully take the book, thus negating a key element of larceny. This claim would also strongly aid his defense.\n\nGiven these analyses, the claim that would least aid the law student in his defense is:\n\n**A. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.**\n\nThis claim does not address the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, which is a critical element of larceny. Instead, it introduces a different motive (unpaid wages) but does not negate the unlawful taking aspect of the crime."
