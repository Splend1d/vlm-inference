The city manual requires that newcomers pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. Newcomer refuses to pay a higher contribution than other employees, whereupon she is terminated. Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\n\nA. No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context.\nB. No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\nC. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n"

Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\n\nIn the context of equal protection law, a \"class-of-one\" theory allows individuals to challenge discriminatory treatment even if they do not belong to a recognized protected class. This theory was established by the Supreme Court in the case of Village of Willowbrook v. Olech (2000), where it was held that a plaintiff could bring an equal protection claim based on the government's arbitrary and irrational treatment of them as compared to others similarly situated.\n\nIn this scenario, the newcomer can argue that she is being treated differently from other employees without any rational basis, which would constitute discrimination under the class-of-one theory. Therefore, she has grounds to make an equal protection argument to fight for her job."
