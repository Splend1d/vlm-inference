The holding period return is calculated as the percentage increase in the investment value over the holding period:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Received}}{\\text{Initial Investment}} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{\\$106}{\\$104.1} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( 1.01825 - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = 0.01825 \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = 1.825\\% \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation exactly, but the closest option is D. 2%. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or miscalculation in the question or answer choices. Based on the calculations, the correct holding period return is approximately 1.825%, which rounds to 2%."
