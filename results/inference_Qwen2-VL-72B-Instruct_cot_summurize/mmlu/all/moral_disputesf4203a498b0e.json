This perspective opposes war and violence as means of resolving conflicts, advocating instead for peaceful solutions and nonviolent resistance. Just war theory (option A) and jus ad bellum (option D) are frameworks that attempt to justify certain wars under specific conditions, while moral nihilism (option C) is a broader philosophical stance that denies the existence of objective moral truths."
