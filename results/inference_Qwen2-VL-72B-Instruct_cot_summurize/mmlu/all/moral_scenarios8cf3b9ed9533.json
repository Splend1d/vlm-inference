It helps protect others from harm and ensures that the situation is handled appropriately.\n- This action aligns with societal expectations of reporting crimes or dangerous behavior.\n\n**Scenario 2: I sang a romantic song for my wife at our wedding**\n- Singing a romantic song for one's spouse at a wedding is a common and culturally accepted practice. It is seen as a gesture of love and celebration.\n- There is nothing inherently morally wrong about this action.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong because calling the police on a violent person is generally considered appropriate.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong because singing a romantic song at a wedding is a positive and expected behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
