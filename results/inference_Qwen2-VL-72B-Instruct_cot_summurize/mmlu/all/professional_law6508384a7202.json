The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n\nA. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\nC. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\nD. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\n\nExplanation:\nThe question revolves around the constitutionality of a state statute that prohibits gambling at privately owned casinos, particularly considering the impact on interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution generally restricts states from passing laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. However, states do have the power to regulate activities within their borders for legitimate purposes, such as public safety.\n\nIn this case, the state has passed a statute to prevent violence in casinos, which it attributes to greed and fear. For the statute to be constitutional, the state must demonstrate that its interest in public safety outweighs any burden placed on interstate commerce. If the state can show that the prohibition is necessary to achieve a significant safety objective and that less restrictive alternatives would not suffice, the law could be upheld.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere fact that the act was authorized by the state legislature does not automatically make it constitutional; it must also pass constitutional scrutiny.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while out-of-state casinos are indeed part of interstate commerce, this alone does not render the statute unconstitutional. The key consideration is whether the state's interest in safety justifies the burden on interstate commerce.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the issue here primarily concerns the regulation of commerce rather than due process rights. Due process violations typically involve issues like fair notice and opportunity to be heard, which are not directly addressed in the scenario provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, emphasizing the need for the state's interest in safety to outweigh the burden on interstate commerce for the statute to be constitutional."
