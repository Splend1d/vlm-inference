If they were fully informed and understood the risks, this action is not inherently wrong. However, if they were misled or not adequately informed, it could be considered irresponsible or unethical.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- \"My partner stopped to stroke a cat on the street and I stopped walking, waiting for her to catch up.\"\n- This scenario involves stopping to wait for a partner who is petting a cat.\n- This action is generally seen as considerate and caring, and there is no inherent moral wrongdoing involved.\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 could potentially involve a morally wrong action depending on the circumstances (whether the person was fully informed), while Scenario 2 clearly does not involve any moral wrongdoing, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
