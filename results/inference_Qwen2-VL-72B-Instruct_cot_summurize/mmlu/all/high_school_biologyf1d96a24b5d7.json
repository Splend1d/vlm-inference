By increasing genetic variation of the bacteria\n\nViral transduction contributes to bacterial evolution primarily by increasing genetic variation within bacterial populations. This occurs when viruses, during their replication cycle, accidentally package bacterial DNA into their viral particles and transfer it to other bacterial cells. This horizontal gene transfer can introduce new traits or genes into the recipient bacteria, potentially providing them with evolutionary advantages such as antibiotic resistance or improved survival strategies. While this process doesn't directly create new species of bacteria or make them more resistant to predators in a general sense, it does enhance the genetic diversity that can lead to the emergence of new traits and adaptations over time."
