Required the United States and Russia to dismantle a significant number of their nuclear weapons\n\nThe Moscow Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Moscow or the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), was signed by the United States and Russia in 2002. It required both countries to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the year 2012. This treaty was aimed at reducing the overall number of nuclear weapons held by the two nations, contributing to global nuclear disarmament efforts."
