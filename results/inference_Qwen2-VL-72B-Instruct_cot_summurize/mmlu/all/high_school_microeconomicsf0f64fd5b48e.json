If the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic\n\nWhen demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers will continue to purchase the same quantity regardless of the price increase caused by the excise tax. This means that consumers will bear the full burden of the tax because they cannot reduce their consumption in response to higher prices. On the other hand, if the supply curve is price elastic, producers can adjust their production levels more easily in response to changes in price, which means they can pass on the cost of the tax to consumers without significantly reducing their output."
