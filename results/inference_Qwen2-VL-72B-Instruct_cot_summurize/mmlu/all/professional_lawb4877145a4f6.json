Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

This means that if a subsequent purchaser records their deed before the prior deed is recorded, they have priority, provided they were unaware of the prior deed at the time of purchase.\n\n2. **Friend\u2019s Status**: The friend is considered a subsequent donee (receiver of a gift) rather than a purchaser for value. However, the recording act does not explicitly differentiate between purchasers for value and donees; it simply requires that the subsequent party must be without notice and record first to have priority.\n\n3. **Cousin\u2019s Failure to Record**: The cousin did not record her deed initially and only did so after learning about the friend\u2019s deed and possession. This delay in recording puts her at a disadvantage under the recording act.\n\n4. **Friend\u2019s Recording**: Although the friend did not record his deed immediately, he did record it after being sued by the cousin. Since the recording act prioritizes the first to record among those without notice, the friend\u2019s recording would give him priority over the cousin\u2019s unrecorded deed.\n\n5. **Possession**: While possession can be a factor in some jurisdictions, the recording act here specifically focuses on the timing and recording of deeds. Therefore, the fact that the friend took possession after the man vacated the land is less relevant compared to the recording issue.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely decision is:\n\n**C. For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the principle that the first to record without notice has priority, even if both parties received the property through gifts rather than purchases for value."
