It is part of the income from continuing operations and is therefore subject to intraperiod income tax allocation.\n\nGiven this analysis, all options except for \"Operating income\" (Option D) are explicitly mentioned as separate components in the income statement that are subject to intraperiod income tax allocation. However, operating income itself is part of the broader category of income from continuing operations, which is subject to intraperiod income tax allocation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Operating income.**"
