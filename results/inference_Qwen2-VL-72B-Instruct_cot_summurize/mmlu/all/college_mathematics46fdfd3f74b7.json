It is possible to place a linear order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C such that (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) is not an ordered field.\n\nThis statement is true. The complex numbers cannot be made into an ordered field because there is no way to define a linear order on them that respects the field operations. Specifically, if you try to define an order on the complex numbers, you will run into contradictions with the multiplication operation. For example, if i > 0, then i^2 = -1 should also be greater than 0, but it isn't. Similarly, if i < 0, then -i > 0, but (-i)^2 = -1, which again leads to a contradiction.\n\nB. It is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which makes (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field.\n\nThis statement is false. As explained above, it is impossible to define a linear order on the complex numbers that respects the field operations and makes them an ordered field.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Neither (a) nor (b)."
