Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique.\nB. The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'.\nC. Game theory and deterrence theory as an intellectual development resulted in the trade-off between policy relevance/utility and theoretical abstraction/sophistication.\nD. None of the above. The influence of deterrence theory was illusory. The build-up of nuclear weapons and first strike orientated policy was driven by the internal logic of maximizing firepower. Theory served as the smokescreen that belied the intent.\n"

This option suggests that these theories became influential due to their normative theorization and the accompanying technological pessimism that encouraged critique. While this captures some aspects of the intellectual development, it doesn't fully address the specific impact on policy and strategic thinking.\n\nB. This option highlights that the theories created their own reality through concepts like \"secure second strike capability,\" \"extended deterrence,\" and \"escalation dominance.\" This is a strong point as these terms became central to strategic discussions during the Cold War era.\n\nC. This option discusses the trade-off between policy relevance and theoretical abstraction. While this is true, it doesn't fully capture the essence of how these theories shaped the strategic landscape.\n\nD. This option argues that the influence of deterrence theory was illusory and that the buildup of nuclear weapons was driven by maximizing firepower rather than theoretical considerations. This perspective is somewhat valid but oversimplifies the complex interplay between theory and practice.\n\nGiven the analysis, Option B best encapsulates the intellectual development by highlighting how game theory and deterrence theory created new strategic realities and terminologies that became integral to security studies during the 'golden age.'\n\nFinal answer: B. The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'."
