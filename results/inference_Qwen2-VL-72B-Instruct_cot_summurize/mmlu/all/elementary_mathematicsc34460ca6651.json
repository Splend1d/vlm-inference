Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and see how many times it divides into 48.\n   - \\(48 \u00f7 2 = 24\\)\n   - \\(24 \u00f7 2 = 12\\)\n   - \\(12 \u00f7 2 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6 \u00f7 2 = 3\\)\n\nSo, 2 divides into 48 four times, giving us \\(2^4\\).\n\n2. Now, we have 3 left, which is also a prime number.\n   - Since 3 is already a prime number, we don't need to divide it further.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 48 is \\(2^4 \\times 3\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(2^4 \\cdot 3\\)"
