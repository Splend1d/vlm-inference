He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Bed rest\nB. Regular activity\nC. X-rays of the spine\nD. MRI of the spine\n"

Regular activity\n\nBed rest (Option A) is generally not recommended for acute low back pain as it can lead to deconditioning and prolong recovery. Imaging studies such as X-rays (Option C) or MRI (Option D) are typically not indicated in the initial management of uncomplicated acute low back pain without red flags such as neurological deficits, severe or progressive symptoms, or a history of cancer, osteoporosis, or immunosuppression.\n\nRegular activity (Option B) is encouraged to maintain mobility and prevent muscle atrophy. Physical therapy may also be beneficial to help manage pain and improve function. If the pain persists beyond a few weeks or if there are signs of nerve involvement, further evaluation might be warranted."
