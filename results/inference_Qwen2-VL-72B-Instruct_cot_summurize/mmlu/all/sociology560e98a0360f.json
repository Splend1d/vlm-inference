Increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins.\n\nThis is the most likely reason for the decline in the general fertility rate between 1964 and 2000. As people marry later and start having children later, they tend to have fewer children overall. This trend has been observed in many countries around the world and is often attributed to factors such as increased education and career opportunities for women, greater access to contraception, and changing social norms regarding family size and childbearing."
