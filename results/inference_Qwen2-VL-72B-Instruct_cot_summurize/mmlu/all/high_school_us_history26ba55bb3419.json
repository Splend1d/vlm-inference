But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nSamoset and Squanto can most directly be compared to whom?\n\nA.

This role is similar to that of Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who served as an interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Like Samoset and Squanto, Sacagawea played a crucial part in facilitating communication and understanding between Native American tribes and European explorers."
