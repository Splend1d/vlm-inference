Improve the optimisation algorithm being used for error minimisation.\n\nWhile improving the optimization algorithm can help in finding better solutions during training, it does not directly address the issue of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise and details in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. To reduce overfitting, common strategies include increasing the amount of training data (A), decreasing the model complexity (C), or reducing the noise in the training data (D). Improving the optimization algorithm might lead to faster convergence or better local minima but does not inherently prevent the model from overfitting."
