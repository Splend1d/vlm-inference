Killing in self-defense could be seen as preserving one's own dignity by protecting oneself from harm.\n\nB. **The principle of equality**: This principle typically involves treating all people equally under the law or morally. Killing in self-defense might not directly relate to this principle unless it is applied uniformly across similar situations.\n\nC. **A consequentialist theory of punishment**: Consequentialism focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions. In self-defense, the primary outcome is often the preservation of one's life, which could be seen as a positive consequence justifying the action.\n\nD. **Equality retributivism**: This theory holds that punishment should be equal to the crime committed. Self-defense is generally not considered a crime, so this option doesn't seem relevant.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting option is:\n\n**C. A consequentialist theory of punishment.**\n\nKilling in self-defense can be justified within a consequentialist framework because it aims to prevent greater harm (one's own death) and thus has a positive overall outcome."
