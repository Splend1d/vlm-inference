Be advised that this offer will remain open until October 1. \"On September 30, the retailer mailed the following letter, which was received by the manufacturer on October 1: \"Your offer is hereby accepted, but request delivery of 100 drinking fountains in October and 100 in November. \"However, on September 29, the manufacturer sent a fax to the retailer revoking its offer, which was received the same day. This revocation is\n\nA. valid, because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer.\nB. valid, because there was no consideration to support an option contract.\nC. not valid, because the retailer had 90 days in which to accept.\nD. not valid, because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1.\n"

In this case, the manufacturer assured that the offer would remain open until October 1. Therefore, the manufacturer cannot revoke the offer before that date, making the revocation on September 29 invalid. The retailer's acceptance on September 30, even though it contained a modification (requesting different delivery dates), was still within the period during which the offer was supposed to be irrevocable."
