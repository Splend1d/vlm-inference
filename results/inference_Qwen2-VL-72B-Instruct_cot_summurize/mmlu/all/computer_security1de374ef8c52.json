Key exchange\n\nPublic key encryption (also known as asymmetric cryptography) is advantageous over symmetric key cryptography primarily due to its ability to securely exchange keys without the need for a pre-shared secret. In public key cryptography, each party has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely shared, while the private key must be kept secret.\n\nWhen two parties want to communicate securely using public key cryptography, they can exchange their public keys without worrying about eavesdropping. Messages encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, ensuring secure communication.\n\nIn contrast, symmetric key cryptography requires both parties to have a shared secret key in advance, which can be challenging and risky to exchange over an insecure channel. Public key cryptography simplifies this process by eliminating the need for a pre-shared secret key."
