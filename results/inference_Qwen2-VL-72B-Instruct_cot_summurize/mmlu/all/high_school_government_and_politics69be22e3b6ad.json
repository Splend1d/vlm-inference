State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThis option best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause (which prohibits the government from establishing an official religion) and the free-exercise clause (which protects individuals' rights to practice their religion freely). The Supreme Court has ruled that state-sponsored prayer during school hours violates the establishment clause, while allowing for voluntary prayer by student groups outside of school hours, which respects the free exercise of religion without government endorsement or coercion."
