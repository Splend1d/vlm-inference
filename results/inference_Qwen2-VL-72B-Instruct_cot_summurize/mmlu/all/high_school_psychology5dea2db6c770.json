Eskimos have many words relating to snow\n\nThe Whorfian hypothesis, also known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis, suggests that the structure of a language can influence the thoughts and behaviors of its speakers. This means that the language someone speaks can shape how they perceive and understand the world around them.\n\nIn the case of option A, the hypothesis would help explain why Eskimos (or Inuit people) have many words for snow. The idea is that because snow plays such an important role in their environment and daily life, their language has evolved to include numerous terms to describe the various types and conditions of snow. This reflects the close relationship between language and the cultural context in which it is used."
