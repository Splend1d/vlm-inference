It may also cause discomfort or embarrassment.\n- This action could be seen as violating social norms regarding appropriate gifts and respect for others' boundaries.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"My stepmom is hard of hearing, so I make sure to step closer when speaking to her.\"\n- This action shows consideration and accommodation for someone with a hearing impairment.\n- It demonstrates empathy and a desire to communicate effectively, which aligns with positive moral behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is generally considered morally wrong due to its potential to cause discomfort or disrespect.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that is morally right as it shows consideration and respect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
