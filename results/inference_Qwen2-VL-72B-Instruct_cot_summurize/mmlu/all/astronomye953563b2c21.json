The Moon will be further from the Earth and the Earth\u2019s day will be longer.\n\nThe Moon is currently moving away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 cm per year due to tidal forces. This gradual increase in distance between the Earth and the Moon causes the Earth's rotation to slow down, making the length of a day on Earth slightly longer over time."
