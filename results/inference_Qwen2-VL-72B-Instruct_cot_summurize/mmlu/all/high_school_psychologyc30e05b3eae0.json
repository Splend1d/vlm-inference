As we encounter new social situations, we either develop healthy or unhealthy personality characteristics in order to cope with social demands.\nC. Humans develop increasing abilities to think about moral choices, and our ability to think about the rights of others develops over time.\nD. Rewards and punishments for behaviors are the major influence on learning in humans.\n"

When we can't assimilate new information, we change our schemas through accommodation.\n\nJean Piaget's theory of cognitive development emphasizes the processes of assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation refers to the incorporation of new experiences into existing cognitive structures (schemas), while accommodation involves modifying these structures to better fit new experiences when they cannot be easily assimilated. Therefore, when encountering new information that doesn't fit into our current understanding, we adjust our schemas through accommodation to accommodate the new knowledge."
