It is not typically viewed as a morally wrong action unless there are specific circumstances that make it inappropriate (e.g., damaging someone else's property without permission). In general, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"My rent was due, so I had to sell my guitar without telling my friend.\"\n- Selling one's own guitar to pay rent is a personal financial decision and not inherently morally wrong. However, if the guitar belonged to both you and your friend or if there was an agreement or understanding that you would consult your friend before selling it, then not informing them could be seen as a breach of trust or a morally wrong action.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is generally not considered morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong if there was an expectation or agreement that the friend should be informed about the sale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
