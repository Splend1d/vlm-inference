This rule exists to prevent unfair prejudice against the defendant and to ensure that the current charges are judged on their own merits rather than on the basis of past behavior.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions where such evidence might be admitted for specific purposes other than proving disposition, such as demonstrating motive, intent, identity, preparation, plan, knowledge, absence of mistake, or accident. In this scenario, the prosecution would need to argue that the evidence serves one of these specific purposes rather than merely showing a propensity to commit the crime.\n\nTherefore, unless the prosecution can establish a valid reason under these exceptions, the judge should find the evidence inadmissible based on the general rule against using past crimes to prove disposition."
