                    "text": "To determine which option correctly addresses the controversial theory that people from present-day Europe colonized North America at the end of the Pleistocene, let's analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **supported by genetic evidence that establishes close connections between the oldest skeletons in the Americas and the European genome.**\n   - This option suggests that there is genetic evidence linking the oldest skeletons found in the Americas to the European genome. However, current scientific consensus does not support this claim. The genetic evidence points to a different origin for the first inhabitants of the Americas.\n\nB. **refuted by genetic evidence from the oldest skeletons in the Americas that establishes close connections between modern Native Americans and the native people of central Siberia.**\n   - This option aligns with the widely accepted theory that the first inhabitants of the Americas migrated from Asia via the Bering Land Bridge. Genetic evidence supports a connection between modern Native Americans and the native people of central Siberia, thus refuting the idea of a European origin.\n\nC. **proven by genetic evidence that establishes close connections between the oldest skeletons in the Americas and Norse explorers who arrived in northeastern Canada around A.D. 1000.**\n   - While it is true that Norse explorers did reach North America around A.D. 1000 (e.g., the Vinland saga), this is well after the end of the Pleistocene period. Therefore, this option does not address the colonization during the Pleistocene.\n\nD. **refuted by the complete absence of documents that record a migration of Europeans into the Americas.**\n   - The absence of historical documents alone is not sufficient to refute a theory. Historical records may be incomplete or lost, and other forms of evidence such as archaeological and genetic data are crucial.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**B. refuted by genetic evidence from the oldest skeletons in the Americas that establishes close connections between modern Native Americans and the native people of central Siberia.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the genetic evidence that contradicts the theory of European colonization at the end of the Pleistocene."
