He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nWhich of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\nA. It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.\nB. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.\nC. It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.\nD. It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\n"

The proclamation was a war measure aimed at weakening the Confederacy and did not immediately free any slaves in areas still held by Confederate forces."
