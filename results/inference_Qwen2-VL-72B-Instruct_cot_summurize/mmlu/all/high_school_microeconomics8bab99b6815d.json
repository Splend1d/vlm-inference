Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nCollusion among large firms typically leads to reduced competition, which allows them to set prices higher than they would be in a competitive market. This results in lower output and higher prices, reducing consumer surplus. The goal of antitrust laws and regulations is to prevent such practices to protect consumers and maintain fair competition."
