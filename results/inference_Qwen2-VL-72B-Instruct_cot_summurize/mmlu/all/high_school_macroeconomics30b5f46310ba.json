Lower taxes put more money in consumers' pockets, which can lead to increased consumer spending. Increased government spending also directly adds to aggregate demand. Both of these actions can lead to an increase in real GDP as more goods and services are demanded and produced.\n\nHowever, this increased demand can also lead to higher prices if the supply does not increase proportionally, resulting in inflation. Therefore, both real GDP and the price level are likely to rise under such a policy."
