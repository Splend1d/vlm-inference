Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\nD.

The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nIn federal civil litigation, Rule 33(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure generally limits each party to no more than 25 interrogatories, including all subparts. If a party wishes to serve more than this limit, they must obtain either the court's permission or an agreement from the opposing party. Since the plaintiff served 25 interrogatories, which is at the limit allowed, any additional interrogatories would require such permission or agreement. Therefore, the defendant could likely succeed in obtaining a protective order on the grounds that the interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties."
