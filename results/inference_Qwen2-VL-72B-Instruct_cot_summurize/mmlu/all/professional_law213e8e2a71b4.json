At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n"

Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal proceedings, when it comes to character evidence, there is a preference for reputation evidence over opinion evidence. Reputation evidence refers to what people generally believe about someone's character based on their community standing or general reputation. Opinion evidence, on the other hand, is based on an individual's personal belief about another person's character.\n\nIn this scenario, the witness's testimony regarding the engineer's reputation among his neighbors is admissible because it reflects the general perception of the engineer's truthfulness within the community. This type of evidence is considered more reliable and objective compared to an individual's subjective opinion.\n\nHowever, the witness's personal opinion about the engineer being truthful is not admissible because it is based on the witness's own subjective judgment rather than the community's general perception. Additionally, the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments would be considered hearsay, which is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nTherefore, only the portion of the witness's testimony concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible."
