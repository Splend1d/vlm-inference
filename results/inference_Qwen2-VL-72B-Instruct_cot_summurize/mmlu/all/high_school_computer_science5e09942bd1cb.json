The specification should be modified to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values.\n\nThis approach ensures clarity and avoids ambiguity in the requirements, which can lead to more robust and maintainable code. By modifying the specification, you provide clear guidance on how the method should behave in all scenarios, including those where multiple values in the array are larger than the given item. This allows developers to implement the method according to well-defined expectations, ensuring that the software meets the intended functionality and behaves consistently across different use cases."
