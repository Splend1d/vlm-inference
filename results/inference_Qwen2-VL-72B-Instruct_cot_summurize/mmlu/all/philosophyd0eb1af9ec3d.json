Knowing the underlying principles enables individuals to make just and virtuous decisions even when faced with novel circumstances.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. This option suggests that knowing examples alone is sufficient for living a worthwhile life, which contradicts Socrates' emphasis on understanding the essence of justice and virtue.\n\nC. This option implies that the essence of justice or virtue can be determined by collecting opinions and treating them equally, which does not align with Socratic philosophy. Socrates sought objective truths about justice and virtue through critical examination and dialogue, not by aggregating subjective opinions.\n\nD. While this option touches on the universality of justice and virtue, it does not directly address why understanding the essence of these concepts is necessary for applying them in various situations.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation according to Socratic philosophy is option B."
