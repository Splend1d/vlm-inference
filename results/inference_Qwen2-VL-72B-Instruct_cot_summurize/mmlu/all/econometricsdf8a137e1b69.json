                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. **Mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability**: This statement is not necessarily true. While mean squared error (MSE) can be a useful metric for assessing forecast accuracy, it does not directly correlate with trading rule profitability. Profitability depends on various factors including transaction costs, market conditions, and the specific trading strategy employed.\n\nB. **Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function**: This statement is incorrect. The mean absolute error (MAE) uses an absolute loss function, which means that all errors are treated equally regardless of their magnitude. A quadratic loss function, on the other hand, is used by the mean squared error (MSE), where larger errors are penalized more heavily.\n\nC. **Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts**: This statement is generally true. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is often used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts in terms of percentage errors, making it particularly useful when comparing forecasts across different scales or magnitudes, such as asset returns.\n\nD. **Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors**: This statement is true. The mean squared error (MSE) squares the difference between the forecasted values and the actual values. Squaring these differences means that larger errors are penalized more heavily compared to smaller errors.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors**"
