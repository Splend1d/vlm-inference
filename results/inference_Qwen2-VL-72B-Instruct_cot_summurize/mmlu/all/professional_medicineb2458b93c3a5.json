The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

A positive PPD skin test indicates exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can lead to tuberculosis (TB) infection. A chest x-ray is used to look for signs of TB disease in the lungs, such as cavities or areas of inflammation. If the chest x-ray is negative, it is likely that the child has latent TB infection (LTBI), which means that she has been exposed to TB but does not have active TB disease. In this case, treatment with antibiotics can prevent the development of active TB disease in the future. If the chest x-ray is positive, it suggests that the child may have active TB disease and further evaluation and treatment will be necessary."
