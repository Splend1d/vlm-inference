When the catheter is blocked.\n\nA bladder washout, also known as an irrigation or flush, is typically performed when a catheter becomes blocked or clogged with sediment, blood clots, or other substances that can impede the flow of urine. This procedure helps to clear the blockage and restore proper drainage through the catheter. It's important to follow medical advice and instructions carefully when performing such procedures at home."
