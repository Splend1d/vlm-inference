To form a perfect square, each of these primes must appear an even number of times in the factorization of the number. The smallest such combination would be \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 25 = 36 \\times 25 = 900\\).\n\nTherefore, the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors is 900.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 900."
