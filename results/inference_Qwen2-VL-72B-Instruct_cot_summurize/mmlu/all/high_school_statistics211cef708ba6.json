Census\n\nA census is the most appropriate technique for gathering the needed data in this scenario because it involves collecting information from every member of a defined group, which in this case would be all the male and female students taking AP Statistics at your high school. This ensures that the data collected is comprehensive and representative of the entire population being studied, allowing for a direct comparison between the two groups without the potential biases or errors that can occur with sampling methods."
