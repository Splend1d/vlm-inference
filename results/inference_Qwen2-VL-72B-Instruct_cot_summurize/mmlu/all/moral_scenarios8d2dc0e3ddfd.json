Public figures often expect to be photographed in public settings.\n- There is no harm being done to Elton John by taking a photo, and such actions are common in everyday life.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I reported another guard who is sneaking in narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners.\"\n\n- Reporting illegal activities, especially those that involve harming others (such as selling drugs in a prison), is generally considered morally right.\n- This action helps prevent harm to prisoners and maintains the integrity of the prison system.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
