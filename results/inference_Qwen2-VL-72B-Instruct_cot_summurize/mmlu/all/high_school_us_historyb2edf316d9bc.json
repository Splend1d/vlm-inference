Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nAn example of the threat to civil liberties that concerned Roosevelt was which of the following?\n\nA. The Social Security Act\nB. Executive Order 9066 interning Japanese Americans\nC. The G.I. Bill\nD. The Baby Boom\n"

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. This action significantly violated civil liberties, as it led to the forced relocation and incarceration of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom were U.S. citizens, into internment camps without due process or evidence of wrongdoing. This example aligns with Eleanor Roosevelt's concern about the erosion of civil liberties, particularly in times of war or perceived threats."
