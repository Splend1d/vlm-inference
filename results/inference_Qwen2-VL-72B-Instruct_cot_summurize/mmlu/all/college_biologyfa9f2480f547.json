                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure\n\nHere's why: During the cardiac cycle, when the ventricles contract (systole), they pump blood into the arteries, which are less compliant than veins. This sudden influx of blood into the arterial system causes a significant increase in arterial pressure. On the other hand, the venous system is much more compliant and can accommodate changes in volume with minimal changes in pressure. Therefore, the transfer of blood from the venous to the arterial side results in a large increase in arterial pressure and little effect on venous pressure."
