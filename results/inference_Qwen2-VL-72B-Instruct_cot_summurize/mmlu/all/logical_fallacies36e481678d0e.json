This fallacy occurs when an argument is made that a particular belief or action is correct simply because many people hold that belief or engage in that action. The reasoning behind this fallacy is that if many people believe something or do something, then it must be right or good. However, this is not necessarily true, and popularity does not equate to correctness or validity."
