Crystallized intelligence\n\nJeopardy! is a quiz show that tests a player's knowledge across various subjects, including history, literature, science, and current events. This type of intelligence is referred to as crystallized intelligence, which involves accumulated knowledge and skills that have been learned over time through education and experience. It includes vocabulary, general information, and problem-solving abilities that rely on acquired knowledge.\n\nWhile fluid intelligence (the ability to reason and solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge) and general intelligence (a broad cognitive ability that encompasses various intellectual functions) are also important, the primary focus of Jeopardy! is on demonstrating crystallized intelligence. IQ tests can measure both fluid and crystallized intelligence, but they are not specifically designed for the type of knowledge-based competition seen in Jeopardy!."
