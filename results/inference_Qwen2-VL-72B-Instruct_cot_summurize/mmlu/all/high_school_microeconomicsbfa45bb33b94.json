Since the market only accounts for the private benefit in its pricing mechanism, the MSB exceeds the marginal social cost (MSC) at the market quantity. This leads to an underproduction of the good from society's perspective, as the optimal quantity would be where MSB equals MSC, not where the private benefit equals the private cost."
