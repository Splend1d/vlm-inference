It works by sending ICMP echo request packets to each IP address in a specified range and waiting for a response. If a response is received, the system is considered to be \"live\" or active on the network.\nPing sweeps can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:\n\n  * Network mapping: A ping sweep can help you create a map of all the devices on a network, which can be useful for network administration and troubleshooting.\n  * Security assessments: A ping sweep can help you identify potential targets for further security testing, such as vulnerability scanning or penetration testing.\n  * Network monitoring: A ping sweep can be used to monitor the status of devices on a network over time, allowing you to detect changes or issues that may need to be addressed.\n\nIt's worth noting that ping sweeps can also be used for malicious purposes, such as identifying potential targets for attacks. For this reason, it's important to use ping sweeps responsibly and only for legitimate purposes."
