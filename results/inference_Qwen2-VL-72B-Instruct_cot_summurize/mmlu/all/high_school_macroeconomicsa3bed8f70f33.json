Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.\n\nA protective tariff on imported steel increases the price of imported steel, making it less competitive compared to domestically produced steel. This leads to an increase in demand for domestic steel, benefiting domestic steel producers. However, it also means that domestic consumers pay more for steel, effectively transferring income from consumers to producers."
