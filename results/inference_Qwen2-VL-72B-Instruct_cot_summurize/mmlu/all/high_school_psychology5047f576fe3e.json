In this case, there could be many confounding variables that differ between morning and afternoon classes, such as differences in student alertness, teacher energy levels, classroom temperature, or even the content covered in each class session. These variables could impact student achievement independently of the time of day the class is held, making it difficult to attribute any observed differences solely to the timing of the class."
