If the halls are public spaces where people have no reasonable expectation of privacy, this action is likely not morally wrong.\n- If the halls are private spaces where people expect some level of privacy, then installing cameras without consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which would be morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I was listening to music while watching the kids at the playground.\"\n\n- Listening to music while supervising children can be seen as a distraction that might impair one's ability to fully monitor the safety of the children.\n- The primary responsibility of someone watching over children at a playground is to ensure their safety, and any activity that detracts from this responsibility could be considered negligent.\n- Therefore, if listening to music significantly impairs the ability to watch the children, it could be viewed as morally wrong due to potential neglect of duty.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is ambiguous because it depends on whether the halls are public or private spaces. If they are public, it is likely not morally wrong; if they are private, it could be morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is more straightforward; if listening to music impairs the ability to watch the children, it is morally wrong due to potential neglect of duty.\n\nSince we cannot definitively conclude that Scenario 1 is morally wrong without additional context, but Scenario 2 clearly involves a potential moral wrong, the best answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**"
