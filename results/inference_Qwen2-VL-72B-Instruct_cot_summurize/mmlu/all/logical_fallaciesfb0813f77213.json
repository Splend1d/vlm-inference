It does not guarantee the truth of the premises themselves.\n\nC. \"A materially true conclusion may arise from a formally valid syllogism.\"\n- This statement is true because if the premises of a formally valid syllogism are true, then the conclusion will necessarily be true as well.\n\nD. \"The formal validity of a syllogism does not guarantee it is materially true.\"\n- This statement is true because formal validity pertains to the logical structure of the argument, not the factual accuracy of its content.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is **not** true is:\n\nB.
