This means that for a person to have sickle-cell disease, they must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). If both parents are carriers, they each have one normal gene and one mutated gene.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The normal gene as \\( A \\)\n- The mutated gene as \\( a \\)\n\nBoth parents are carriers, so their genotype is \\( Aa \\).\n\nWhen these parents reproduce, the possible genotypes for their offspring can be determined using a Punnett square:\n\n```\n     |   A    |   a\n-----|-------|------\n  A  | AA    |  Aa\n-----|-------|------\n  a  | Aa    |  aa\n```\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we see four possible combinations:\n1. AA (normal, does not have sickle-cell disease)\n2. Aa (carrier, does not have sickle-cell disease)\n3. Aa (carrier, does not have sickle-cell disease)\n4. aa (has sickle-cell disease)\n\nOut of these four combinations:\n- Two combinations result in the child being a carrier (Aa) but not having sickle-cell disease.\n- One combination results in the child having sickle-cell disease (aa).\n- One combination results in the child being completely normal (AA).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease (aa) is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} = 25\\% \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 25%"
