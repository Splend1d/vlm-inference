Palisade mesophyll\n\nThe palisade mesophyll cells are typically located just below the upper epidermis of the leaf and contain a high concentration of chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis. These cells are well-adapted for efficient light absorption and gas exchange, making them the site of the highest rate of oxygen production in an actively photosynthesizing plant."
