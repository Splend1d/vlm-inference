                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how an ideal pulley system works and how it relates to the force applied and the distance moved.\n\nAn ideal pulley system is frictionless and massless, meaning that the only forces acting on the system are the weight of the object being lifted and the force applied to lift it. The mechanical advantage (MA) of a pulley system is the ratio of the output force (the weight of the object) to the input force (the force applied to the rope).\n\nGiven:\n- Weight of the crate = 100 N\n- Force applied to the rope = 25 N\n\nThe mechanical advantage (MA) can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{MA} = \\frac{\\text{Weight of the crate}}{\\text{Force applied}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ N}}{25 \\text{ N}} = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that for every unit of distance the rope is pulled, the crate will rise 1/4 of that distance because the force is distributed over four segments of the rope in an ideal pulley system.\n\nIf the rope is pulled down 1 meter, then the crate will rise:\n\\[ \\frac{1 \\text{ m}}{4} = 0.25 \\text{ m} = 25 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 25 cm"
