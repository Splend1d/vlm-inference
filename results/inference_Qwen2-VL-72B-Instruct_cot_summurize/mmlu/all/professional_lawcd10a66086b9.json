If you will promise to mow my lawn by Saturday, I will pay you $50. \" On Friday, the gardener arrived at the man's home just as the man was leaving for work and began to mow the man's lawn. The man said nothing to the gardener but drove off as he saw the gardener unloading his lawn mower. When the man arrived home from work that evening, he noticed that only half of his lawn had been mowed. He then found a note from the gardener slipped into his mailbox. The note said:\"Sorry, but I ran out of gas to power the lawn mower and did not have time to buy more gas to finish the job. I'm taking the weekend off, but I will be back Monday morning to finish the job. \"If the man brings suit against the gardener for breach of contract, who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The gardener, because he never accepted the offer made by the man.\nB. The gardener, because he offered to cure the defective performance by finishing the job on Monday morning.\nC. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.\nD. The man, because under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the gardener's part performance was evidence of his intent to honor the entire contract.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a contract between a man and a gardener regarding the mowing of a lawn. To determine who is likely to prevail in a lawsuit for breach of contract, we need to analyze the elements of contract law, specifically focusing on acceptance, performance, and breach.\n\n1. **Acceptance**: The gardener's arrival at the man's home with a lawn mower and beginning to mow the lawn can be seen as an acceptance of the man's offer. This is because the gardener's actions demonstrate an intention to fulfill the terms of the agreement.\n\n2. **Performance**: The gardener partially performed the task by mowing half of the lawn. However, the contract required the entire lawn to be mowed by Saturday.\n\n3. **Breach**: The gardener failed to complete the job by the agreed-upon deadline (Saturday), which constitutes a breach of contract.\n\n4. **Cure of Defective Performance**: The gardener offered to complete the job on Monday, after the deadline specified in the contract. This offer does not remedy the breach since it was not within the timeframe agreed upon.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the gardener never accepted the offer. However, the gardener's actions indicate acceptance through partial performance.\n  \n- **Option B** claims that the gardener's offer to finish the job on Monday cures the defective performance. This is incorrect because the contract required completion by Saturday, and the offer to complete the job later does not rectify the breach.\n\n- **Option C** states that the man is likely to prevail because the gardener's part performance implies acceptance and a promise to render complete performance. This is accurate because the gardener's actions show acceptance, and the failure to complete the job by the agreed deadline constitutes a breach.\n\n- **Option D** mentions the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which generally applies when one party relies on the other's representations or conduct to their detriment. In this case, there is no clear indication that the man relied on the gardener\u2019s partial performance to his detriment in a way that would invoke equitable estoppel.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the gardener's actions constituted acceptance and that the failure to complete the job by the agreed deadline amounts to a breach of contract."
