Ensure that there is no autocorrelation in the test regression residuals.\n\nThe augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is an extension of the standard Dickey-Fuller test used for testing the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series sample. The augmentation involves adding lagged differences of the variable as additional explanatory variables in the test regression to correct for any serial correlation (autocorrelation) in the residuals. This helps to ensure that the test statistic is correctly estimated and that the test has appropriate size and power."
