A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\n\nThis statement is not true because the number of neutrons in an atom can vary, leading to different isotopes of the same element, while the number of protons defines the element itself. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, but there is no requirement for the number of neutrons to be equal to the number of protons."
