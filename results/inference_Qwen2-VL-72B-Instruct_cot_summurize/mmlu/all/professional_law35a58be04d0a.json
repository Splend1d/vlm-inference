After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, prior to determination of compensation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of its property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, which is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, does not mandate that compensation must be paid before the condemnation takes place. It allows for the condemnation to occur first, with the compensation to be determined later, provided there is a mechanism in place to ensure just compensation will be paid. This aligns with the state court's order allowing possession of the land to be surrendered upon deposit of a sum deemed adequate to cover potential damages, thus ensuring that the timber company will receive compensation if it is found to be due."
