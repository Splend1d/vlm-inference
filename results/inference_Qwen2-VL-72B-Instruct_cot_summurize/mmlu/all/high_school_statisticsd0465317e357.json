This area represents the proportion of employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find that:\n- The area to the left of z = -2 is approximately 0.0228.\n- The area to the left of z = 2 is approximately 0.9772.\n\nThe area between z = -2 and z = 2 is:\n\\[ P(-2 < Z < 2) = P(Z < 2) - P(Z < -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 \\]\n\nThis means about 95.44% of the employees have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nTo find the number of employees within this range:\n\\[ \\text{Number of employees} = 0.9544 \\times 400 \\approx 381.76 \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of an employee, we round to the nearest whole number, which gives us approximately 382 employees.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is D. 390."
