Hundreds of tourists poured into the area to work on the large block of ice. They made a gigantic ice palace for a variety of Disney princesses. To handle the needs of a great number of tourists, food vendors came from all over and set up their carts. To solve the problem of congestion, safety, and insufficient security, the town passed an ordinance restricting all street vendors to a specified parking lot area. The food vendors and others were losing money under the regulation. Would a commerce clause challenge to the parking lot requirement be successful by the food stand owners?\n\nA. No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\nB. No, because the food stands do not have a significant commerce clause claim in that they are still able to sell food, and what they do does not affect interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because the local interest is favored in a discriminatory manner against all of the food cart owners from other states.\n"

No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\n\nThe ordinance restricting street vendors to a specified parking lot area is likely to be seen as a reasonable measure aimed at addressing issues of congestion, safety, and security. These are legitimate interests of the local government. The regulation appears to be even-handed, applying equally to all vendors regardless of their origin, and its primary purpose is to manage public safety rather than to discriminate against interstate commerce. Therefore, a commerce clause challenge would likely fail because the impact on commerce is incidental to the primary goal of ensuring public safety and order."
