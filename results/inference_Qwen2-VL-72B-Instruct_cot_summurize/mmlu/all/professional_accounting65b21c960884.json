Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.\n\nInherent risk refers to the susceptibility of an assertion to a misstatement, assuming there were no related controls. Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement that could occur in an assertion will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the entity's internal control. Both inherent risk and control risk are characteristics of the client's business environment and internal control system and exist independently of the audit process. The auditor assesses these risks to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures needed. Detection risk, on the other hand, is the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement if one exists and is influenced by the design and execution of the audit itself."
