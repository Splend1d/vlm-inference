                    "text": "In recent years there has been much publicity regarding juries approving excessively high multi- million dollar damage awards in personal injury actions. As a result, Congress enacted a statute that limited recovery in personal injury actions filed in state court(s) to $400,000, and punitive action recovery to a maximum of $750,000. A man was injured in an automobile accident when a car driven by a woman drove through a red light and struck his vehicle. The man was paralyzed from the accident and became a paraplegic. The man brought a personal injury action against the woman in state court. The jury returned a verdict on the man's behalf and awarded him $1,000,000 in damages. After the jury verdict, the woman filed an appeal challenging the amount of the award, claiming that it was excessive and violated the federal guidelines set forth in the statute. The man has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The statute should be ruled\n\nA. unconstitutional, because Congress cannot enact legislation involving local matters, such as automobile accidents, unless it involves interstate commerce.\nB. unconstitutional, because a limitation on damage awards in tort actions would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states by operation of the Fifth Amendment.\nC. constitutional, because under Article III, Congress has plenary power to regulate the jurisdiction and scope ofjudicial review of federal and lower state courts.\nD. constitutional, because under the supremacy clause, when there is a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law preempts and takes precedence over the conflicting state law.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. unconstitutional, because Congress cannot enact legislation involving local matters, such as automobile accidents, unless it involves interstate commerce.\n\nExplanation:\nCongress has the authority to legislate under its enumerated powers, which include regulating interstate commerce. However, personal injury actions typically involve local matters and do not inherently relate to interstate commerce unless they can be shown to have a substantial effect on it. In this case, the statute limiting recovery in personal injury actions appears to be a regulation of local matters rather than one that directly affects interstate commerce. Therefore, the statute would likely be deemed unconstitutional for exceeding Congress's enumerated powers.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state governments, not to Congress. Congress is subject to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but the issue here is about the scope of Congress's legislative power, not about equal protection.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Article III of the Constitution deals with the judicial power of the United States and does not grant Congress plenary power to regulate the jurisdiction and scope of judicial review of federal and lower state courts in the manner described.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution provides that federal law preempts conflicting state law, but it does not address whether Congress had the authority to enact the statute in the first place. The question at hand is about the constitutionality of Congress's power to enact such legislation, not about the application of the Supremacy Clause."
