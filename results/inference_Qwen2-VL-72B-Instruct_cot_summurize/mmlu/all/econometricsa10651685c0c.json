Parameter estimates may be biased\n\nWhen using non-stationary data in levels form, the primary issue is that it can lead to spurious regressions where the regression $R^2$ may be spuriously high (Option A), test statistics may not follow their standard distributions (Option B), and statistical inferences may be invalid (Option C). However, parameter estimates themselves are not necessarily biased due to non-stationarity; rather, the problem lies in the interpretation and reliability of these estimates and the associated statistical tests."
