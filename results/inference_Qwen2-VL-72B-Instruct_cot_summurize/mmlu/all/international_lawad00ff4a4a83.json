Qualified rights are those that can be limited or restricted under certain circumstances, as opposed to absolute rights, which cannot be limited.\n\nLet's analyze each article:\n\nA. **Article 3** - This is the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is considered an absolute right because it cannot be derogated from under any circumstances.\n\nB. **Article 8** - This is the right to respect for private and family life. It is a qualified right because it can be limited in the interests of national security, public safety, etc., as specified in the article itself.\n\nC. **Article 9** - This is the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. It is also a qualified right because it can be limited in certain circumstances, such as when necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals.\n\nD. **Article 11** - This is the right to freedom of assembly and association. It is a qualified right because it can be limited in the interests of national security, public safety, etc.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only article listed that is not a qualified right is:\n\nA. Article 3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Article 3."
