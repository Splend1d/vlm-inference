To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe passages above are best understood in the context of which of the following practices?\n\nA. Legalization of slavery in overseas colonies\nB. Exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples\nC. Western missionary efforts in colonized territories\nD. Mobilization of military resources from colonial possessions\n"

William Bentinck discusses the decision-making process regarding the practice of sati in India, highlighting the responsibility and consequences of colonial governance. George Simpson talks about ruling Indians with strict measures to maintain control and dependency, emphasizing the use of administrative power to manage native populations."
