To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by\n\nA. the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\nB. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\nC. the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\nD. the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n"

Although this deed was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt, its form was absolute, meaning it conveyed all rights and interests in the property to the friend.\n\n2. **Escrow Instructions**: The investor delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver it to the friend if the investor failed to pay the promissory note at maturity. This arrangement was designed to avoid judicial foreclosure and eliminate the right to redeem.\n\n3. **Failure to Pay**: The investor failed to pay the note when it came due, and the nephew delivered the deed to the friend as per the escrow instructions. The friend then recorded the deed.\n\n4. **Right of Redemption**: The investor's argument that he retains a right of redemption is not supported by the terms of the deed absolute or the escrow instructions. A deed absolute, once delivered and recorded, typically transfers full ownership to the grantee, extinguishing any right of redemption unless explicitly provided otherwise.\n\n5. **Legal Precedent**: Generally, courts interpret deeds according to their plain language. Since the deed was absolute in form and no specific provisions were made to retain a right of redemption, the deed would likely be considered an outright conveyance.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment granting the relief sought by the friend, as the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor."
