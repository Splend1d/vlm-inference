They had relied on a business attorney in establishing the business. After the business failed, the plaintiff and the defendant disagreed about their respective obligations. At trial, both have hired new counsel. The plaintiff calls the business attorney to testify to representations the defendant made in meetings she had with the plaintiff and the business attorney. The defendant objects to the business attorney's testimony, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Should the court uphold the defendant's privilege claim?\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n"

No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\nIn situations where multiple clients consult an attorney together, the attorney-client privilege generally extends to all parties involved in the joint consultation. This means that any communications made during those meetings are protected by the privilege unless all parties agree to waive it. In this case, since the plaintiff is calling the business attorney to testify about representations made by the defendant during joint meetings, the privilege would not apply unless the defendant consents to its waiver. Therefore, the court should not uphold the defendant's privilege claim if the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly."
