The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have \"caught the same bug.\" Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?\n\nA. Administer the meningococcal vaccine\nB. Prescribe doxycycline\nC. Prescribe penicillin\nD. Prescribe rifampin\n"

Prescribe rifampin\n\nRifampin is commonly used as prophylaxis against Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningococcal meningitis. Given the patient's close contact with an individual diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, rifampin can help prevent the spread of the infection. It is important to note that the patient should also be monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of meningitis and advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop. Additionally, discussing the need for meningococcal vaccination with the patient and her family would be prudent, although it is not an immediate intervention for post-exposure prophylaxis."
