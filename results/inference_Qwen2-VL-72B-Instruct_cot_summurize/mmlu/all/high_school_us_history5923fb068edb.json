Instead, it created a loose confederation with a weak central government.\n\nB. **Did not include a mechanism for their own amendment**: While this is true, it is not considered a major weakness in the context of the passage provided. The passage emphasizes the need for unity and strength rather than focusing on the amendment process.\n\nC. **Made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties**: This is a significant weakness of the Articles of Confederation. The central government lacked the authority to levy taxes directly on individuals or states, which hindered its ability to fund operations and pay off debts.\n\nD. **Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states**: Although this is also a weakness, the passage focuses more on the need for unity and strength to maintain and defend common liberties, which aligns more closely with financial issues.\n\nGiven the emphasis on the need for unity and strength in the passage, the most relevant weakness highlighted here is the inability to raise funds effectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. Made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties"
