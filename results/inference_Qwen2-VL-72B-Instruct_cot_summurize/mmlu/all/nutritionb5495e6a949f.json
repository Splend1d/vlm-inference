                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach.\n\nLet's briefly analyze each option:\n\nA. Acid secretion occurs in response to secretion of the hormone, carbonic anhydrase - This is incorrect. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the production of bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions (H+), which contribute to acid secretion, but it is not a hormone that stimulates acid secretion. The hormone that primarily stimulates acid secretion is gastrin.\n\nB. Glands called Peyer's patches are responsible for acid secretion - This is incorrect. Peyer's patches are lymphoid aggregates found in the small intestine, particularly in the ileum, and they are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They are not involved in acid secretion. The glands responsible for acid secretion in the stomach are the parietal cells.\n\nC. The vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion after a meal has been consumed - This is incorrect. The vagus nerve actually stimulates acid secretion in the stomach as part of the cephalic phase of digestion. It releases acetylcholine, which stimulates the parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid.\n\nD. Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach - This is correct. Pepsinogen is converted into pepsin, an enzyme that breaks down proteins, while gastric lipase helps in the initial breakdown of fats in the stomach. Both are secreted by the chief cells in the stomach lining."
