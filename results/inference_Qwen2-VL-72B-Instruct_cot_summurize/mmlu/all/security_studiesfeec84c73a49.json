Veterans of armed conflict may be rewarded by gaining powerful offices, often in political positions and in state institutions. This means that excluding women from military service can prevent them from accessing these influential roles, thereby perpetuating gender inequality in leadership positions.\n\nB. Participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism, and courage. By being excluded from such activities, women may be denied opportunities to demonstrate these qualities, which can reinforce stereotypes about their capabilities and societal roles.\n\nC. The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways. These rationales often reflect broader societal biases and can spill over into other areas of life, further marginalizing women.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to why feminist scholars might consider the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat as an important issue to address."
