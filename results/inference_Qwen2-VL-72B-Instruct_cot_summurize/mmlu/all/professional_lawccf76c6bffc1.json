Adjoining the quarry to the west is a 10-acre ranch, owned by a librarian. In order to gain access to the highway, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the ranch using the road along the ranch's southernmost boundary. The teacher has recently purchased a 12-acre farm, which abuts the ranch, but is not appurtenant to the quarry. Directly north of the farm is the ranch and directly west is the highway. The teacher has begun constructing a farmhouse on the farm and is using the existing easement (across the ranch) to gain access to the 1 2acre farm. The teacher has never received permission from the librarian to use the road across the ranch to gain access to the farm. In an appropriate action by the librarian to enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the teacher is making use of the servient tenement beyond the scope and extent of the easement as it was originally created.\nB. succeed, because the teacher has no right to use the servient tenement in connection with a tract of land that is not part of the dominant tenement.\nC. not succeed, because the teacher has an easement by necessity.\nD. not succeed, because the teacher has a right to use the easement in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of the owner of the servient tenement.\n"

The scope and extent of the easement are defined at the time it is created and cannot be expanded without the consent of the owner of the servient tenement.\n\nIn this scenario, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the librarian's ranch to access the highway, specifically for the purpose of accessing the teacher's own quarry. The easement was created for the benefit of the quarry property, which is the dominant tenement. When the teacher began using the easement to access the newly purchased farm, which is a separate and distinct piece of property from the quarry, this constitutes an unauthorized expansion of the original easement. The farm is not part of the dominant tenement for which the easement was originally created.\n\nTherefore, the librarian would most likely succeed in an action to enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm, as the teacher has no right to use the servient tenement in connection with a tract of land that is not part of the dominant tenement."
