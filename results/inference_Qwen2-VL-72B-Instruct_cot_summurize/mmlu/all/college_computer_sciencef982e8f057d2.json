A reentrant program is one that can be interrupted and resumed multiple times without affecting its operation or causing errors. This property allows multiple users to use the same copy of the program simultaneously, each with their own set of data, without interfering with each other.\n\n- **Reentrancy** (III) ensures that the program can safely handle concurrent access from multiple users.\n- **Being a macro** (I) refers to a programming construct that expands into a larger piece of code during compilation, which does not relate directly to sharing among users.\n- **Recursiveness** (II) means a program calls itself repeatedly, which is unrelated to the ability to share a program among multiple users.\n\nTherefore, the essential requirement for sharing a single copy of a program among several users in a multiprogrammed system is that the program must be reentrant."
