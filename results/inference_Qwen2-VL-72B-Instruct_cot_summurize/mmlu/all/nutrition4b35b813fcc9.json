In positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nPositive nitrogen balance indicates that the body is retaining more nitrogen than it is excreting, which typically occurs during growth, pregnancy, and recovery from illness or injury. This retention suggests an increase in protein synthesis or storage within the body."
