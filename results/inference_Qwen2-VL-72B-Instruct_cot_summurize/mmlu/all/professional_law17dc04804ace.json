The policy contains a clause providing that double indemnity is payable in the event that death of the insured \"results directly, and independently of all other causes, from bodily injury effected solely through external violent and accidental means. \"The plaintiff's wife met her death in the silage shed of her farm. The death resulted from wounds caused by the discharge of a double-barreled shotgun. The plaintiff was arrested and prosecuted for the murder of his wife. After a lengthy trial, the plaintiff was acquitted of the charge. After the insurance company refused to pay the plaintiff's insurance claim, the plaintiff instituted this civil action. The complaint sets forth the policy, alleges the facts surrounding the death of the insured, avers that the death was within the policy provisions for double indemnity payment, and demands judgment accordingly. At trial, the insurance company's attorney proposes to introduce excerpts from the plaintiff's murder trial. The plaintiff's attorney objects to the introduction of such evidence. The trial judge should rule the proffered evidence\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as former testimony.\nC. inadmissible, because of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because of double jeopardy.\n"

In this case, the excerpts from the plaintiff's murder trial could be considered admissible as former testimony if they meet the criteria for such evidence. This typically requires that the witness who provided the testimony is unavailable for the current trial and that the testimony was given under oath in a prior proceeding involving the same parties or substantially similar issues. If these conditions are met, the excerpts may be admitted to provide context or support the insurance company's defense."
