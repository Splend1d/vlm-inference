In this context, a person who has been sunbathing likely feels cooler when entering the pool because their body has adapted to the higher temperature of the sun and the pool water feels relatively cooler by comparison. Conversely, a person who has been inside in air conditioning might find the same pool water to be warmer because their body has adapted to the lower indoor temperature, making the pool water feel relatively warmer."
