In this case, the presence of a few large contributions ($10,000) could skew the mean, making it an unreliable measure of central tendency for the typical contribution. The mode, which is the most frequent value ($60), might not be representative of the overall contribution pattern since there are significant contributions at higher amounts. A histogram can show the distribution of contributions but does not provide a single measure of central tendency. ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare means across multiple groups, which is not applicable here as we are looking at a single group of contributors. Therefore, the median would provide the most useful information to the radio station about the typical contribution amount."
