The total number of eggs used was 231, and 46 of those were brown. Therefore, the equation to solve for w, the number of white eggs, is:\n\n\\[ w = 231 - 46 \\]\n\nThis equation is not listed among the options provided. However, if we rearrange option B to solve for w, it becomes:\n\n\\[ w = 231 - 46 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( 46 + w = 231 \\)\n\nWhen rearranged to solve for w, it matches the equation needed to find the number of white eggs."
