Convergent evolution (option D) typically refers to the independent development of similar features in species of different lineages, which does not explain the high degree of genetic similarity observed between humans and chimpanzees. Options B and C are not supported by scientific evidence; current evolutionary theory indicates that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor rather than one evolving directly from the other."
