If the decrease in taxes stimulates enough private consumption to offset the reduction in government spending, this might not lead to a significant decrease in real GDP.\n\nB. **The government increases spending with no increase in taxes.**\n   - Increasing government spending directly boosts aggregate demand.\n   - This would generally lead to an increase in real GDP, not a decrease.\n\nC. **The government decreases spending with no change in taxes.**\n   - Decreasing government spending reduces aggregate demand directly.\n   - There is no compensating increase in private consumption due to unchanged taxes.\n   - This would likely result in a decrease in real GDP.\n\nD. **The government holds spending constant while increasing taxes.**\n   - Increasing taxes reduces disposable income for households, leading to decreased consumption.\n   - This also reduces aggregate demand.\n   - However, since government spending remains constant, the decrease in real GDP might be less severe compared to a direct cut in government spending.\n\nGiven these analyses, the option that is most likely to create the greatest decrease in real GDP is:\n\n**C. The government decreases spending with no change in taxes.**\n\nThis option directly reduces government spending without any compensatory increase in private consumption, leading to a straightforward decrease in aggregate demand and real GDP."
