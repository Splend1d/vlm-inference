                    "text": "Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of function of the UBE3A gene, which is located on chromosome 15. This can occur through several mechanisms, including:\n\n- Deletion of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene\n- Imprinting defects that silence the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene\n- Uniparental disomy (UPD) where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from one parent (usually the father), leading to the absence of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene\n\nGiven these causes, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Maternal UPD 15**: This would mean both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the mother. Since Angelman syndrome typically requires the loss of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene, this scenario would not usually lead to Angelman syndrome.\n\nB. **Paternal UPD 15**: This would mean both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father. In this case, there would be no maternal copy of the UBE3A gene, which could lead to Angelman syndrome.\n\nC. **Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15**: This would not affect the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene and thus would not typically cause Angelman syndrome.\n\nD. **A mutation in the SNRPN promoter**: The SNRPN gene is involved in imprinting control, but mutations in its promoter would more likely affect Prader-Willi syndrome rather than Angelman syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Paternal UPD 15**"
