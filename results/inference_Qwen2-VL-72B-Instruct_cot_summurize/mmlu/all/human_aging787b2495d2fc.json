It represents the longest possible lifespan for members of that species.\n\nLife expectancy at birth (LEAB) and life expectancy at a specified age (LEASA) are statistical measures based on current mortality rates and do not necessarily reflect the maximum potential lifespan. LEAB is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, while LEASA is the average remaining years of life for someone who has already reached a certain age.\n\nTherefore, life span is always the longest because it represents the theoretical maximum lifespan, whereas life expectancy values are averages that can be influenced by various factors such as health, environment, and lifestyle."
