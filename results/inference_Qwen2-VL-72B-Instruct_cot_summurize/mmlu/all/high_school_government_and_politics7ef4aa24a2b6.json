Bakke was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning affirmative action and the use of racial quotas in college admissions. The case involved Allan Bakke, a white applicant who was denied admission to the medical school at the University of California, Davis, while minority applicants with lower test scores were admitted under a special program designed to increase minority enrollment. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of a rigid racial quota system was unconstitutional but affirmed that race could be considered as one factor in a holistic admissions process."
