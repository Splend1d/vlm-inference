They will be unable to breathe without life support.\n\nDamage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6) can affect the nerves that control the diaphragm, which is the primary muscle used for breathing. This can result in paralysis of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe on their own. Therefore, they would require mechanical ventilation or other forms of life support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation."
