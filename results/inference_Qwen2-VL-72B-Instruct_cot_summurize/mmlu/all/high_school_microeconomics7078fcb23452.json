This characteristic leads to a more elastic long-run supply curve because if the price increases, new firms will enter the market to take advantage of the higher profits, increasing the overall supply. Conversely, if the price decreases, some firms may exit the market, reducing the supply. This responsiveness of supply to changes in price indicates elasticity."
