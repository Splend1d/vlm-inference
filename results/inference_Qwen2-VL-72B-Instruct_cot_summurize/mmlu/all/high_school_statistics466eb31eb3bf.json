For the second exam, every student studied exactly 10 hours, regardless of how much they studied for the first exam.\n\nSince the amount of time studied for the second exam is constant (10 hours) and does not vary based on the amount of time studied for the first exam, there is no linear relationship between the study times for the two exams. Therefore, the correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, would be 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0"
