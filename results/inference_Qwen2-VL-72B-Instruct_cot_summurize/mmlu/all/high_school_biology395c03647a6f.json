This process involves the gradual return of vegetation and the eventual re-establishment of an ecosystem similar to the one that existed before the disturbance. The initial stages may involve hardy pioneer species such as grasses, followed by shrubs and eventually trees. Over time, the diversity of species can increase as the ecosystem recovers."
