To determine which affidavit would provide the strongest basis for securing a new trial, we need to consider the nature and impact of each potential juror misconduct.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.**\n   - Misunderstanding the judge's instructions can be significant, but it must be shown that this misunderstanding directly affected the juror's decision-making process. Without evidence that the misunderstanding led to an unfair verdict, this alone may not be sufficient grounds for a new trial.\n\nB. **A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.**\n   - This is a clear case of juror misconduct because it involves the juror obtaining extraneous information that was not presented in court. This type of misconduct can significantly influence a juror\u2019s judgment and is generally considered a strong basis for a new trial.\n\nC. **A juror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.**\n   - While falling asleep during part of the trial is concerning, it needs to be established whether this impacted the juror's ability to fairly evaluate the evidence. If the juror missed critical information that could have influenced their decision, this might support a motion for a new trial. However, without further context, it is less compelling compared to other forms of misconduct.\n\nD. **A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.**\n   - Personal bias or animosity towards the defendant is a serious issue as it directly impacts the juror's impartiality. If a juror admits to having a personal bias against the defendant, this is a strong ground for a new trial because it undermines the fairness of the trial.\n\nGiven these considerations, the affidavit that contains the fact that \"a juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes\" (Option B) provides the strongest basis for securing a new trial. This misconduct involves the juror obtaining and considering information outside of the courtroom, which can heavily influence their decision and is a clear violation of court rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**B. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.**"
