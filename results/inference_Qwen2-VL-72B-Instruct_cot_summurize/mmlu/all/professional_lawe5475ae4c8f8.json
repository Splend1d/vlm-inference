The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nExplanation:\n- In a unilateral contract, acceptance occurs through performance rather than through a promise to perform. The homeowner offered to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaced the tiles, which is a unilateral contract because the homeowner's obligation to pay arises only upon completion of the roofer's performance (replacing the tiles).\n- The roofer began performance by purchasing the materials and equipment and unloading them at the homeowner's house. This act constitutes an acceptance of the homeowner's offer under the terms of a unilateral contract.\n- Therefore, the homeowner cannot revoke the offer once the roofer has begun performance, and the roofer has a valid claim for breach of contract if the homeowner refuses to pay after the work is done or partially done."
