It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Over time, various deep learning models have been developed to achieve high accuracy on this dataset. By 2020, several state-of-the-art models had indeed achieved accuracies greater than 98%. For example, models like EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown remarkable performance on CIFAR-10.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n**Statement 2: The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.**\n\nResNets (Residual Networks) were introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their paper \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\" published in 2015. The original ResNets used the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer rather than the Adam optimizer. Adam was introduced earlier in 2014 by Diederik Kingma and Jimmy Ba, but it was not used in the original ResNet paper.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is True**.\n\nGiven that both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. True, True**"
