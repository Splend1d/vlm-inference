Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen an object slides down a rough incline, there is friction between the object and the surface of the incline. This friction does negative work on the object, converting some of its initial gravitational potential energy into thermal energy (heat). As a result, not all of the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline will be less than the initial gravitational potential energy."
