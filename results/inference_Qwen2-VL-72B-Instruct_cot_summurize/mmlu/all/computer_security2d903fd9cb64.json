A direct leak creates a denial of service by failing to free memory, while a channel frees memory as a side effect\nB. A direct leak is one that is intentional, rather than by unintentional\nC. A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage\nD.

On the other hand, a side channel leak occurs through indirect means, such as by measuring other system features like timing, power usage, or space usage, which can reveal sensitive information without directly accessing it. Therefore, option C correctly describes the difference between a direct leak and a side channel."
