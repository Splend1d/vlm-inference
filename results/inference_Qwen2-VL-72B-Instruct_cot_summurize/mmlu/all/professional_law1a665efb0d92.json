The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n"

This could imply that the manufacturer recognized the potential defectiveness of the original helmet, which might have contributed to the player's injury. However, it's important to note that the admissibility of such evidence can depend on various factors and the specific rules of evidence applicable in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place."
