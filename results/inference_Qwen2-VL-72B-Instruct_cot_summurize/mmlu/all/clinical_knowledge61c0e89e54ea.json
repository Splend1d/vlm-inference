Prolactin is involved in lactation and is not directly related to Addison's disease.\n\nB. **Leads to generalized pigmentation**\n   - This is correct. One of the hallmark symptoms of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), which occurs because the body produces more melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in response to low cortisol levels.\n\nC. **It is a recognized cause of hypertension**\n   - This is incorrect. Addison's disease typically leads to hypotension (low blood pressure), not hypertension, due to the deficiency of aldosterone, which regulates blood pressure.\n\nD. **Diabetes is a complication**\n   - This is incorrect. While diabetes can be a separate condition that may coexist with Addison's disease, it is not a direct complication of Addison's disease itself. Addison's disease affects the adrenal glands, whereas diabetes involves the pancreas and insulin production.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Leads to generalized pigmentation**"
