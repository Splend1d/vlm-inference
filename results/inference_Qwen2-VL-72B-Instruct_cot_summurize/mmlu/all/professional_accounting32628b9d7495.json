A risk-averse investor prefers lower risk for a given level of return or higher return for a given level of risk.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\n1. **(2,2)**: This pair has a risk of 2 standard deviations and a return of 2%.\n2. **(2,3)**: This pair has a risk of 2 standard deviations and a return of 3%.\n3. **(4,2)**: This pair has a risk of 4 standard deviations and a return of 2%.\n\nGiven that a risk-averse investor prefers lower risk for a given level of return, let's compare the pairs step by step:\n\n- **(2,2) vs. (2,3)**: Both have the same risk (2 standard deviations), but (2,3) offers a higher return (3%) compared to (2,2) (2%). Therefore, (2,3) is more favorable than (2,2).\n- **(2,2) vs. (4,2)**: Both have the same return (2%), but (4,2) has a higher risk (4 standard deviations) compared to (2,2) (2 standard deviations). Therefore, (2,2) is more favorable than (4,2).\n\nSo, the order from least to most favorable is:\n1. (2,3) - lowest risk for the highest return among the options.\n2. (2,2) - lower risk than (4,2) but lower return than (2,3).\n3. (4,2) - highest risk and equal return to (2,2), making it the least favorable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)**"
