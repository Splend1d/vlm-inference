The proliferation of Enlightenment ideals.\n\nThe document provided is from the Cahiers of the Third Estate of Versailles, 1789, which outlines various grievances and demands of the French people leading up to the French Revolution. The complaints listed in the document focus on issues such as the lack of fair laws (Article 3), the need for personal liberty and property rights (Article 11), the introduction of the jury system to ensure fair trials (Article 12), the abolition of unequal penalties and the protection of individuals from collective punishment (Article 17), and the requirement for taxes to be approved by the people's representatives (Article 21).\n\nWhile the Enlightenment ideals certainly influenced the French Revolution and the thinking behind these articles, the document itself does not directly address the proliferation of Enlightenment ideals as a problem causing the revolution. Instead, it focuses on specific grievances related to financial problems, legal inequities, and social and political inequalities. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
