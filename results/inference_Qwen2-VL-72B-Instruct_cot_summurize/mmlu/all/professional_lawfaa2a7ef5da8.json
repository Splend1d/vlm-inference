The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the interest the daughter has in the property, we need to analyze the nature of the ownership arrangement between the co-worker and the boss.\n\n1. **Nature of Ownership:**\n   - The property was devised to both the co-worker and the boss \"as their community property.\" Community property typically refers to property acquired during marriage, which is jointly owned by both spouses. However, since neither the co-worker nor the boss was married, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misapplication of the term \"community property\" here. \n\n2. **Joint Tenancy vs. Tenancy in Common:**\n   - If the property was intended to be held jointly, it would likely be a joint tenancy, where each party holds an undivided interest in the whole property, and upon the death of one tenant, their interest passes to the surviving tenant(s) by right of survivorship.\n   - If the property was intended to be held separately, it would be a tenancy in common, where each party holds a distinct share of the property, and upon the death of one tenant, their share passes to their heirs.\n\nGiven the context provided:\n- The co-worker's attorney claims that the co-worker now owns the entire property by right of survivorship, suggesting a joint tenancy.\n- The daughter seeks to collect half of the expenses, implying she believes she has an interest in the property.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- If the property was indeed held as a joint tenancy, the co-worker would acquire the entire property upon the boss's death by right of survivorship, and the daughter would have no interest.\n- If the property was held as a tenancy in common, the boss's share would pass to her heirs (in this case, her daughter), giving the daughter an undivided one-half interest in the property.\n\nSince the devise specified \"as their community property,\" which is not applicable here due to the lack of a marital relationship, and considering the co-worker's attorney's advice about survivorship, it is reasonable to infer that the intent was likely a joint tenancy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship."
