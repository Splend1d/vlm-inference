At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case. The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion. Should the court admit the expert's testimony?\n\nA.

Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\n\nExpert testimony is often admissible in legal proceedings when it helps clarify complex technical or scientific matters that may be beyond the understanding of the average juror. In this case, the expert's testimony regarding the design and functionality of the lawn mower's blade is likely to assist the jury in understanding whether the blade could have flown off due to a design defect. As long as the expert's methods are reliable and their testimony is relevant to the case, the court should admit the testimony."
