                    "text": "To evaluate the given expression, we need to calculate the ceiling of the square root of each integer from 5 to 29 and then sum these values.\n\nThe ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. Therefore, for any integer \\(n\\), if \\(n^2\\) is less than the number but \\((n+1)^2\\) is greater than or equal to the number, then the ceiling of the square root of that number will be \\(n+1\\).\n\nLet's break down the range:\n\n- For numbers between 5 and 8 (inclusive), their square roots are between 2 and 3. Thus, \\(\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 3\\) for \\(n = 5, 6, 7, 8\\).\n- For numbers between 9 and 15 (inclusive), their square roots are between 3 and 4. Thus, \\(\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4\\) for \\(n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\).\n- For numbers between 16 and 24 (inclusive), their square roots are between 4 and 5. Thus, \\(\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5\\) for \\(n = 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\).\n- For numbers between 25 and 29 (inclusive), their square roots are between 5 and 6. Thus, \\(\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 6\\) for \\(n = 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\\).\n\nNow, let's sum these values:\n\n- For \\(n = 5, 6, 7, 8\\), we have \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n- For \\(n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\), we have \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n- For \\(n = 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\), we have \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\).\n- For \\(n = 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\\), we have \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\nAdding these sums together: \\(12 + 28 + 45 + 30 = 115\\).\n\nHowever, it seems there was a miscalculation in the final step. Let's correct this:\n\n- For \\(n = 5, 6, 7, 8\\), we have \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n- For \\(n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\), we have \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n- For \\(n = 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\), we have \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\).\n- For \\(n = 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\\), we have \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\nAdding these correctly: \\(12 + 28 + 45 + 30 = 115\\).\n\nIt appears there was an oversight in the initial calculation process. The correct total should be recalculated based on the accurate counts provided above:\n\n- For \\(n = 5, 6, 7, 8\\), we have \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n- For \\(n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\), we have \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\).\n- For \\(n = 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\), we have \\(9 \\times 5 = 45\\).\n- For \\(n = 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\\), we have \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\nSumming these values gives us \\(12 + 28 + 45 + 30 = 115\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided (A. 112, B. 111, C. 2006, D. 110). It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided do not match the calculated result. Based on the calculations, the sum is actually 115, which is not one of the provided choices."
