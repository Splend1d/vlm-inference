Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether Harriet is likely to prevail in her action to allow the distribution of the income from the trust to be paid to Grace, we need to analyze the relevant legal principles and the specific terms of Walter's will.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Rule Against Perpetuities:**\n   - The Rule Against Perpetuities generally states that interests in property must vest, if at all, within a period not exceeding the lifetime of some person alive at the creation of the interest plus 21 years.\n   - In this case, the trust provides for income payments to Stan for his life, then to any widow of Stan, and finally to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares.\n\n2. **Life-in-Being Requirement:**\n   - For an interest to vest within the perpetuity period, there must be a life-in-being at the time the interest is created.\n   - Walter's will was executed in 1997, and Grace was born in 2001. Therefore, Grace was not a life-in-being when the trust was created.\n\n3. **Application of the Rule Against Perpetuities:**\n   - Since Grace was not a life-in-being at the time Walter's will was executed, the provision for income payments to the living children of Harriet violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n   - This means that the interest intended for Grace does not vest within the perpetuity period and is therefore invalid.\n\n4. **Other Considerations:**\n   - The fact that both Stan and Morgana are deceased does not change the validity of the trust provisions regarding future beneficiaries.\n   - Walter's intent, while important, cannot override the legal requirements imposed by the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.**\n\nHarriet is unlikely to prevail in her action because the provisions intended for Grace violate the Rule Against Perpetuities."
