Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nThe prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper because it seeks to impeach the witness based on a prior inconsistent statement. The fact that the witness did not mention the defendant's statement about having an alibi when questioned by the police can be used to challenge the credibility of the witness's current testimony. This type of impeachment is permissible under the rules of evidence, which allow for the introduction of prior inconsistent statements to question a witness's reliability or truthfulness."
