CH3NH2\n\nHydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (such as N, O, or F) and is also electrostatically attracted to another highly electronegative atom in a nearby molecule. In this case, only CH3NH2 contains a nitrogen atom that can participate in hydrogen bonding. The other compounds do not have the appropriate atoms for hydrogen bonding."
