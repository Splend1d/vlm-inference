It introduces an additional condition that is not covered by the original disjunction.\n- The major premise does not address the scenario where the test is not taken, so this minor premise does not lead to a direct conclusion about \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\).\n\nC. \"My birthday is today\"\n- This also does not directly relate to either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\). It introduces an unrelated fact that does not affect the truth values of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\).\n\nD. Both A and B\n- Option A leads to a valid conclusion, but option B does not. Therefore, combining them does not change the validity of the conclusion derived from option A alone.\n\nThus, the minor premise that leads to a valid conclusion is:\n\n**A. \"I won't do well on the test\"**"
