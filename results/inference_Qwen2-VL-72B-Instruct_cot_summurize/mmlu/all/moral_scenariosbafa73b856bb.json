This action is clearly morally wrong because it involves the exploitation and potential harm to another person, especially a minor. It violates fundamental principles of human rights, family responsibility, and ethical treatment of individuals.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I don't let my pet dog wander outside when it's raining.\"\n\nThis scenario involves preventing a pet dog from going outside during rainy weather. This action is generally considered responsible and caring behavior. Keeping a pet inside during bad weather conditions is typically seen as protecting the animal from potential harm or discomfort.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
