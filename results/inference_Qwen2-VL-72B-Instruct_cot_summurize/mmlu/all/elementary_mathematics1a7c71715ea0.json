This statement is incorrect because 5 is an odd number, not an even number.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because the product of two even numbers (4 x 4) is always even.\n- C. This statement is incorrect because 2 is an even number, not an odd number.\n- D. This statement is correct because the product of two odd numbers (5 x 3) is always odd."
