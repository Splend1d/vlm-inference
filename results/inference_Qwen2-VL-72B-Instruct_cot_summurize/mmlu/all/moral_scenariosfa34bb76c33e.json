This action violates personal privacy and autonomy.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving the new teacher a classroom of 15 children is not inherently morally wrong. It is a common practice in educational settings and does not involve any obvious moral transgression unless there are additional context-specific issues that are not provided here."
