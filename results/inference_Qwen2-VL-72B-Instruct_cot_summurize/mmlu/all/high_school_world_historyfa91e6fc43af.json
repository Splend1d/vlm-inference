To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism the first passage undermines, let's analyze the content of the passage and each option:\n\n**First Passage Analysis:**\n- The passage discusses the dilemma faced by William Bentinck regarding the practice of sati (widow burning) in India.\n- It highlights the conflict between preventing a cruel practice and maintaining the safety of the British Empire in India.\n- Bentinck ultimately favors an open and general prohibition of sati.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. **That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices**\n   - This statement is supported by the passage, as Bentinck considers prohibiting sati, a traditional Indian practice.\n\nB. **That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits**\n   - While profit motives are not explicitly discussed in the passage, it does not directly address or contradict this assumption.\n\nC. **That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations**\n   - The passage suggests that Bentinck is grappling with the decision to interfere with a local practice, indicating that there was not always a uniform eagerness to impose cultural norms.\n\nD. **That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects**\n   - The passage does not mention armed force; it focuses on the moral and political considerations of prohibiting sati.\n\nGiven this analysis, the passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.\n\n**Final Answer: C. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations**"
