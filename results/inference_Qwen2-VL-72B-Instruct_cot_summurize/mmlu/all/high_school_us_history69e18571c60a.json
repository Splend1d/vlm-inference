What the event will be is also beyond the reach of my foresight. We have errors to correct. We have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation. Experience has taught us that men will not adopt and carry into execution measures the best calculated for their own good without the intervention of a coercive power. I do not conceive that we can exist long as a nation without having lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the whole Union in as energetic a manner as the authority of the state governments extends over the several states. . . .\n\"What astonishing changes a few years are capable of producing. I am told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical form of government without horror. . . . What a triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves, and that systems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal and fallacious. . . .\"\n\u2014George Washington, letter to John Jay, August 1, 1786\nThe sentiments in the letter by George Washington, above, reflect which of the following continuities in American history?\n\nA. Debates about the proper balance between liberty and order.\nB. Debates about reconciling republicanism with the institution of slavery.\nC. Debates about the relationship among the three branches of government.\nD. Debates about the use of the military in subduing domestic disturbances.\n"

Debates about the proper balance between liberty and order.\n\nThe letter by George Washington reflects concerns about the ability of the United States to maintain order and govern itself effectively under the Articles of Confederation, which he believes may require a stronger central authority. This theme of balancing liberty (the freedom and autonomy of the states) with order (a strong central government to ensure stability and unity) is a continuity in American history."
