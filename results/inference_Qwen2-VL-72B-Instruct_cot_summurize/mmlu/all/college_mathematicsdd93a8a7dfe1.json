However, for a polygon to be convex, it must also satisfy that no internal angle is greater than or equal to \\(180^\\circ\\), which means all angles are strictly less than \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Acute Angles in Convex Polygons**: An acute angle is defined as an angle less than \\(90^\\circ\\). In a convex polygon, having more than three acute angles would force at least one of the remaining angles to be obtuse (greater than \\(90^\\circ\\) but less than \\(180^\\circ\\)) to ensure the polygon remains convex and satisfies the sum of its interior angles.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A: 1 acute angle**  \n  If there is only 1 acute angle, the rest would have to be obtuse or right angles to maintain the sum of the interior angles and keep the polygon convex. This is possible.\n\n- **Option B: 2 acute angles**  \n  With 2 acute angles, the remaining 8 angles would have to be obtuse or right angles to maintain the sum of the interior angles and keep the polygon convex. This is also possible.\n\n- **Option C: 3 acute angles**  \n  With 3 acute angles, the remaining 7 angles would have to be obtuse or right angles to maintain the sum of the interior angles and keep the polygon convex. This is still possible because even with 3 acute angles, the remaining angles can be arranged such that they do not exceed \\(180^\\circ\\) each and still sum up correctly.\n\n- **Option D: 4 acute angles**  \n  Having 4 acute angles would mean the remaining 6 angles would have to compensate for this in terms of the sum of the interior angles. However, if we try to distribute the angles such that the sum works out while keeping the polygon convex, we run into a problem. For a decagon, having 4 acute angles would force at least one of the remaining angles to be too large to maintain the polygon's convexity without exceeding \\(180^\\circ\\), violating the definition of a convex polygon.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is:\n\n**C. 3**"
