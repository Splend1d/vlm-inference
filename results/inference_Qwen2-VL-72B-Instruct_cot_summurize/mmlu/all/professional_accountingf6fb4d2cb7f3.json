Given that Darv Co.'s quick ratio is 1-to-1 and its current liabilities are $322,000, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{322,000} \\]\nSolving for Quick Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 322,000 \\]\n\nNow, we know that:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets} = \\text{Quick Assets} + \\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[ 966,000 = 322,000 + \\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses} \\]\n\nSolving for Inventory and Prepaid Expenses combined:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses} = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. $644,000"
