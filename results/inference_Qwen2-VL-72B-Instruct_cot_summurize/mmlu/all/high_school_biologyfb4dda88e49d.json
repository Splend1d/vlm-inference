Removing some of reactant C\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust in such a way as to counteract that change and re-establish equilibrium. In this case, removing some of the product (reactant C) will shift the equilibrium towards the formation of more product to compensate for its removal. This will result in an increase in the production of product C.\n\nAdding more enzyme K (option C) could potentially speed up the reaction rate but does not directly affect the equilibrium position. Increasing the temperature (option D) may also affect the reaction rate and equilibrium constant, but it is not guaranteed to produce more product C specifically. Removing some of reactant A (option A) would shift the equilibrium to the left, reducing the amount of product C formed."
