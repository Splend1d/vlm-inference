For the second spring, let's denote its force constant as \\( k_2 \\), its extension as \\( x_2 \\), and the work done on it as \\( W_2 \\).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n- \\( W_2 = 2W_1 \\)\n- \\( x_2 = \\frac{1}{2}x_1 \\)\n\nWe can write the equations for the work done on each spring using the formula above:\n\nFor the first spring:\n\\[ W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k_1x_1^2 \\]\n\nFor the second spring:\n\\[ W_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k_2x_2^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( W_2 = 2W_1 \\) and \\( x_2 = \\frac{1}{2}x_1 \\), we substitute these into the equation for \\( W_2 \\):\n\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k_2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x_1\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k_2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x_1^2\\right) \\]\n\\[ 2W_1 = \\frac{1}{8}k_2x_1^2 \\]\n\nNow, we know from the first spring's equation that \\( W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}k_1x_1^2 \\), so we can substitute this into our equation:\n\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}k_1x_1^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}k_2x_1^2 \\]\n\\[ k_1x_1^2 = \\frac{1}{8}k_2x_1^2 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( x_1^2 \\) gives us:\n\n\\[ k_1 = \\frac{1}{8}k_2 \\]\n\nRearranging for \\( k_2 \\) gives us:\n\n\\[ k_2 = 8k_1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 8 times that of the first spring. The correct answer is:\n\nD. 8k"
