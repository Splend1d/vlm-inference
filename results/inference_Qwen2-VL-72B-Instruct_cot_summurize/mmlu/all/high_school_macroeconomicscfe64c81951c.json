Money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, it injects $1 million into the banking system. With a reserve ratio of 10%, each dollar can be lent out nine times over (since only 10% needs to be kept as reserves), creating a potential money multiplier effect. The formula for the money multiplier is \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{reserve ratio}} \\), so in this case, it would be \\( \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \\). Therefore, the initial $1 million could potentially increase the money supply by up to $10 million ($1 million * 10).\n\nIf money demand is perfectly elastic, it means that people are willing to hold any amount of money at the current interest rate. As the money supply increases, the additional money will lower the interest rate because there is more money available to lend. Lower interest rates typically stimulate borrowing and spending, which increases aggregate demand (AD).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD."
