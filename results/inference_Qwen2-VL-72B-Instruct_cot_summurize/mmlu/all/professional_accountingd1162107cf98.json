At the end of year 2, the land was revalued, and the fair value increased to $105,000. How should the company account for the year 2 change in fair value?\n\nA.

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. By recognizing $10,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe increase in fair value from the end of year 1 ($90,000) to the end of year 2 ($105,000) is $15,000. However, since there was an initial decrease in fair value from the acquisition cost ($100,000) to the end of year 1 ($90,000), the net increase over the two years is $10,000 ($105,000 - $95,000). This net increase should be recognized in other comprehensive income."
