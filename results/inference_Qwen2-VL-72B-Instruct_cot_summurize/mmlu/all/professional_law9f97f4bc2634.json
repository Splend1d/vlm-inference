The contract contained a provision wherein the supermarket promised to purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year. \" The agreement also provided that any modifications must be in writing. On February 1, the produce company shipped the supermarket 70 bushels of oranges, which were accepted and paid for. On March 1, the produce company tendered 80 bushels of oranges, which the supermarket accepted and paid for. On April 1, the produce company delivered 100 bushels of oranges to the supermarket. This shipment was accepted and also was promptly paid for. On April 2, the manager of the supermarket became concerned because a Florida drought had resulted in a sharp increase in the price of oranges. Consequently, the manager consulted the supermarket's attorney, who advised him to demand adequate assurances that the produce company would perform its obligations under the terms of the contract. Heeding the attorney's advice, the manager sent a letter on April 3 to the produce company, expressing his concern and requesting an adequate assurance of due performance for the balance of the contract. This letter was received by the produce company on April 4. Which of the following best states the supermarket's legal rights against the produce company?\n\nA. Cancel the contract on May 1, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\nB. Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.\nC. Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.\nD. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\n"

The supermarket has concerns about the produce company's ability to fulfill its contractual obligations due to a Florida drought, leading to increased prices. The supermarket's attorney advises seeking adequate assurances from the produce company.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), particularly Article 2, which governs sales contracts, a party who has reasonable grounds for insecurity may demand adequate assurances of due performance from the other party. If such assurances are not provided within a reasonable time, the party may treat the failure to provide assurances as a repudiation of the contract.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Cancel the contract on May 1, cover immediately and then sue for damages.**\n   - This option suggests immediate cancellation without waiting for adequate assurances. However, the UCC requires a party to give the other a reasonable opportunity to provide adequate assurances before treating the contract as repudiated.\n\nB. **Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.**\n   - This option implies waiting for a potential breach before demanding adequate assurances. However, the supermarket has already expressed concern and requested assurances before the May shipment, so this sequence is not aligned with the actions taken.\n\nC. **Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.**\n   - This option suggests waiting until the entire contract period has passed before taking action. However, the UCC allows for earlier action if there is reasonable cause for insecurity and inadequate assurances are provided.\n\nD. **Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.**\n   - This option aligns with the UCC provisions. After requesting adequate assurances, the supermarket should wait a reasonable time (not exceeding 30 days) for the produce company to respond. If no adequate assurances are provided within this period, the supermarket can treat the contract as repudiated, cancel the contract, cover its needs elsewhere, and sue for damages.\n\nTherefore, the best statement of the supermarket's legal rights against the produce company is:\n\n**D. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.**"
