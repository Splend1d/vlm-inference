The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations' and restrictions recited in the Declaration of Covenants. One of the restrictions reads:\"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. \"The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a psychologist when he purchased lot 24 in the housing development. The psychologist recorded his deed. The psychologist gave his lot to his son. The deed conveying lot 24 to the son contained no reference to the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. The deed provided that \"these premises are conveyed to (the son), his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only. \" The son did not record his deed. The son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants. The son started a home business selling imported wine from his home. A geologist, the owner of lot 26, which was situated next to the son's lot, brought an action of ejectment against the son. Which of the following is the best argument for the son?\n\nA. The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.\nB. Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.\nC. The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.\nD. The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the best argument for the son, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in this scenario.\n\n1. **Fee Simple Determinable with Possibility of Reverter**: This type of estate automatically reverts to the grantor if a specified condition is violated. However, the condition must be clearly stated in the deed. In this case, the deed to the son does not mention the Declaration of Covenants or any specific conditions related to it. Therefore, the deed does not create a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter. Hence, option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Recording Requirement**: Generally, recording a deed provides constructive notice to subsequent purchasers. Since the son did not record his deed, he might argue that he had no actual notice of the Declaration of Covenants. However, the Declaration of Covenants was recorded and included in the original deed to the psychologist, which means it is part of the public record. The son\u2019s lack of recording does not negate the existence of the covenants. Thus, option B is not a strong argument.\n\n3. **Injunction**: An injunction is a court order requiring someone to do or refrain from doing something. While the geologist may seek an injunction to prevent the son from violating the covenant, this does not address whether the son can be ejected from the property. Therefore, option C is not the best argument for the son.\n\n4. **Prohibition of Fee Simple Determinable**: There is no general prohibition against fee simple determinable estates under common law. This statement is misleading because it misrepresents the nature of the estate created by the deed to the son. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best argument for the son is:\n\n**B. Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.**\n\nThis argument leverages the fact that the son did not record his deed and thus might claim he had no actual notice of the Declaration of Covenants. Although this argument has limitations due to the public record nature of the original Declaration of Covenants, it is the most plausible among the given options."
