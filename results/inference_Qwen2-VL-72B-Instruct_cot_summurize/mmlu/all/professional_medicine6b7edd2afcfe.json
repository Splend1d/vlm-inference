Splitting\n\nSplitting is a defense mechanism where an individual divides their perception of people or situations into extremes of good and bad, often without acknowledging any middle ground. In this scenario, the patient is displaying extreme negative attitudes towards certain individuals (the nurses, one of his children) while maintaining a polite demeanor towards others (the physician). This dichotomy in his behavior suggests splitting as the underlying psychological mechanism."
