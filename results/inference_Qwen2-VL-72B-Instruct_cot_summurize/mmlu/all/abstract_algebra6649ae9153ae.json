A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with coefficients in the same field.\n\nLet's check each option for \\(c\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\):\n\n### Option A: \\(c = 0\\)\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 1\\).\n\n- Check if it has roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n  - For \\(x = 0\\), \\(0^3 + 1 = 1\\).\n  - For \\(x = 1\\), \\(1^3 + 1 = 2\\).\n  - For \\(x = 2\\), \\(2^3 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\).\n\nSince \\(x = 2\\) is a root, the polynomial is reducible. Thus, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + 1)\\) is not a field.\n\n### Option B: \\(c = 2\\)\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\\).\n\n- Check if it has roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n  - For \\(x = 0\\), \\(0^3 + 2*0^2 + 1 = 1\\).\n  - For \\(x = 1\\), \\(1^3 + 2*1^2 + 1 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\).\n  - For \\(x = 2\\), \\(2^3 + 2*2^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\).\n\nNone of these are roots, so we must check if it can be factored into lower degree polynomials. Since it's cubic and doesn't have any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), it cannot be factored into linear factors. We also need to check if it can be factored into a quadratic and a linear factor. However, since it doesn't have any roots, it cannot be factored this way either. Therefore, it is irreducible.\n\nThus, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1)\\) is a field.\n\n### Option C: \\(c = 1\\)\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\).\n\n- Check if it has roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n  - For \\(x = 0\\), \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\\).\n  - For \\(x = 1\\), \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\).\n  - For \\(x = 2\\), \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\).\n\nSince \\(x = 1\\) is a root, the polynomial is reducible. Thus, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 1)\\) is not a field.\n\n### Option D: \\(c = 3\\)\nNote that in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), \\(3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\), so this case is identical to Option A, where the polynomial is reducible.\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\(c\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) that makes \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1)\\) a field is:\n\n**B. 2**"
