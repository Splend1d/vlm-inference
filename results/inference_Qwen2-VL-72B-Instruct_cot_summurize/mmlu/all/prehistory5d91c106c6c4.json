Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **When sled dogs were first domesticated**: While the domestication of sled dogs is an interesting aspect of human history, it is not directly relevant to determining when humans first entered the Americas from Siberia. Sled dogs were likely domesticated much later than the initial migration.\n\nB. **When the Bering Strait was exposed and open for travel**: This is crucial information because the Bering Strait is the land bridge that allowed humans to migrate from Siberia to Alaska. Knowing when this land bridge was exposed helps pinpoint the time frame during which migration could have occurred.\n\nC. **When eastern Siberia was first inhabited**: Understanding when eastern Siberia was first inhabited provides context about the potential origins and timing of the migration. It is relevant to the broader timeline of human movement.\n\nD. **The age of the earliest New World sites**: Determining the age of the earliest archaeological sites in the New World (North and South America) is essential for establishing when humans arrived in these regions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the information that anthropologists do not need to know to determine when people entered the Americas from Siberia is:\n\n**A. When sled dogs were first domesticated**"
