This absorption occurs when the frequency of the incident IR radiation matches the natural vibrational frequency of the chemical bond or group, causing it to vibrate more vigorously. By analyzing the pattern and intensity of these absorptions, chemists can identify the presence and types of functional groups in an unknown compound, which provides valuable information about its structure."
