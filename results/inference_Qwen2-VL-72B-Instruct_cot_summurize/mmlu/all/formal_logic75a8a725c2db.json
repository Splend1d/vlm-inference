                    "text": "To determine which formula best symbolizes the sentence \"Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, his brother drives him and pays for gas,\" we need to break down the sentence into its logical components:\n\n1. **Pablo will go to the store**: This can be represented as \\( P \\).\n2. **His brother drives him**: This can be represented as \\( D \\).\n3. **Pays for gas**: This can be represented as \\( G \\).\n\nThe sentence states that Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, both conditions (his brother driving him and paying for gas) are met. In propositional logic, \"if, and only if\" translates to the biconditional operator (\\( \\equiv \\)), and \"and\" translates to the conjunction operator (\\( \\cdot \\)).\n\nSo, the sentence can be translated as:\n\\[ P \\equiv (D \\cdot G) \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( (P \\equiv D) \\equiv G \\)\n   - This formula suggests that Pablo going to the store is equivalent to his brother driving him, and this equivalence is further equivalent to paying for gas. This does not match the original sentence.\n\nB. \\( (D \\cdot G) \\supset P \\)\n   - This formula suggests that if his brother drives him and pays for gas, then Pablo will go to the store. It is an implication but not a biconditional, so it doesn't capture the \"if, and only if\" part of the sentence.\n\nC. \\( P \\supset (D \\cdot G) \\)\n   - This formula suggests that if Pablo goes to the store, then his brother drives him and pays for gas. Again, it is an implication but not a biconditional, so it doesn't fully capture the sentence.\n\nD. \\( P \\equiv (D \\cdot G) \\)\n   - This formula correctly represents the biconditional relationship: Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, his brother drives him and pays for gas.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D. P \\equiv (D \\cdot G)} \\]"
