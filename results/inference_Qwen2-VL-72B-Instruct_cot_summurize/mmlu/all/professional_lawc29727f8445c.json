                    "text": "To determine whether the injured traveler will prevail in asserting a claim against the hotel for damages, we need to analyze the situation based on legal principles related to premises liability and intervening causes.\n\n1. **Premises Liability**: Hotels have a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for guests. This includes providing adequate security measures to protect guests from foreseeable risks.\n\n2. **Intervening Cause**: An intervening cause is an independent event that occurs after the defendant's negligent act and contributes to the plaintiff's injury. If the intervening cause is unforeseeable and sufficiently independent, it may relieve the defendant of liability.\n\nGiven these principles, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: Prevail, if the lock was defectively designed.**\n- If the lock was defectively designed, this could indicate that the hotel did not use reasonable care in selecting or maintaining the lock. This would likely be considered a breach of the hotel\u2019s duty to provide a safe environment for its guests. Therefore, the traveler might prevail under this scenario.\n\n**Option B: Prevail, because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property.**\n- Being a business visitor does not automatically entitle the traveler to prevail. The key issue is whether the hotel breached its duty of care by failing to provide a secure environment. Simply being a business visitor does not establish liability without evidence of negligence.\n\n**Option C: Not prevail, because the thief's act was an intervening cause.**\n- The thief's act could potentially be seen as an intervening cause. However, for this to relieve the hotel of liability, the thief's act must be both unforeseeable and sufficiently independent from the hotel's actions. If the theft was foreseeable (e.g., due to previous similar incidents), the hotel might still be liable despite the thief's actions.\n\n**Option D: Not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.**\n- If the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock, which complied with local ordinances, it can argue that it met its duty of care. In this case, the traveler would likely not prevail unless there is additional evidence of negligence beyond the lock selection.\n\nBased on the information provided and the analysis of each option, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. Not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the hotel exercised reasonable care in selecting the lock, which complied with local ordinances, and that no other evidence of negligence is present."
