Usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure\n\nFood allergies typically develop after an individual has been exposed to the allergen at least once, which sensitizes the immune system. Subsequent exposures can then trigger an allergic reaction. It's important to note that food allergies can range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening in some cases, so they should always be taken seriously."
