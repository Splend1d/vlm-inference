All of the above\n\nThe Marshall Plan, officially known as the European Recovery Program, was an American initiative that provided aid to Western Europe after World War II. It aimed to help rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and make Europe prosperous again. The plan also had strategic goals, including reducing the appeal of communism by fostering economic stability and prosperity, which would diminish the potential attraction of the Soviet system to Europeans. Additionally, it embedded U.S. influence in Europe by creating economic ties and dependencies."
