However, a study by the federal Food and Drug Administration revealed that the pies contain potentially harmful levels of nuts for some consumers with nut allergies. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines. A state has a statute that regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. In light of the federal legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, the state statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the federal law preempts any conflicting state legislation regarding the sale and shipment of the pies.\n"

This clause establishes that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and judges in every state are bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nGiven that Congress has enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines due to potential health risks, this federal law would preempt any conflicting state statutes. Therefore, the state statute regulating the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory would likely be deemed unconstitutional if it allows activities that are prohibited by the federal law."
