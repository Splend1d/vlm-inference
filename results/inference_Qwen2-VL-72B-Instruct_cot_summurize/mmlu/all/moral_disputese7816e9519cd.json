However, since I don't have direct access to Richardson-Self's specific work or discussion, I will infer based on common terminology and definitions:\n\n- **Hate speech** typically refers to speech that attacks or demeans a person or group based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, etc.\n- **Misogynistic speech** specifically targets women and is characterized by hatred or prejudice against them.\n- **Sexist speech** generally involves language or behavior that discriminates against people based on their sex or gender.\n\nGiven these definitions, it's possible that Richardson-Self could be discussing any or all of these types of speech depending on the scope of their work. Without more specific information, it's reasonable to consider that they might address multiple forms of discriminatory speech.\n\nTherefore, the most inclusive answer would be:\n\nD. all of the above"
