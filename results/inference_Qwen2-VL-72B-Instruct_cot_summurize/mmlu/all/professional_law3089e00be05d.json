The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nNegligent entrustment occurs when someone lends or allows another person to use property (such as a vehicle) knowing that the other person is incompetent or unfit to use it safely. In this case, the uncle knew about the teenager's numerous issues with driving and alcohol, which makes it plausible that he negligently entrusted the car to the teenager. Therefore, the teenager could potentially have a valid claim for negligent entrustment, even if he was injured himself.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the entrustee cannot collect damages or that their own negligence would always defeat the claim, which is not necessarily true in cases of negligent entrustment. Option C is incorrect because it suggests strict liability, which is not typically applied in negligent entrustment cases; rather, negligence principles apply where foreseeability and causation must be established."
