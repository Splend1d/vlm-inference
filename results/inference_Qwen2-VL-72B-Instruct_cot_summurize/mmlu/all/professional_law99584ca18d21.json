At trial, the customer shows the court a printed statement from a printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry in the community. The customer asks the court to take judicial notice that the printed statement constitutes the applicable standard of care for printing companies in the area. The court should\n\nA. grant the request, because it promotes expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings.\nB. grant the request, because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court.\nC. deny the request, because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case.\nD. deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n"

However, courts generally do not take judicial notice of matters that are subject to reasonable dispute or that require expert testimony to establish. In this scenario, the printed statement from the printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry could potentially be disputed by the printing company, especially if they argue that the statement does not accurately reflect the applicable standard of care or if there are other standards that should be considered. Therefore, the court would likely deny the request for judicial notice if the judge believes that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute."
