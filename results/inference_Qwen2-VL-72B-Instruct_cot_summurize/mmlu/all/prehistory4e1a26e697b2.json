It tested the ability of human beings to adapt.\n\nThe late Pleistocene to early Holocene period was marked by significant climate changes, including the end of the last Ice Age and the subsequent warming trend. These changes had profound effects on human populations, challenging them to adapt to new environments, develop new technologies, and alter their ways of life. This period saw the emergence of agriculture, the development of more complex social structures, and the spread of human populations across the globe."
