Therefore, their reproductive fitness is effectively zero.\n\nB. **Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.**\n   - Since mules cannot produce offspring, this statement is irrelevant because they do not have offspring to compare genetic variation with.\n\nC. **Mutations cannot occur in their genomes.**\n   - All living organisms can experience mutations in their DNA. The inability to undergo meiosis does not prevent mutations from occurring.\n\nD. **If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.**\n   - Crossing-over typically occurs during prophase I of meiosis, not during mitosis. Since mules cannot undergo meiosis, this scenario would not apply to them.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.**"
