The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift. The vacationer, severely bruised and badly frightened, jumped off the ski lift and completed his descent by foot. In a personal injury action by the vacationer against the owner of the private park, the vacationer will rely on the concept of\n\nA. respondeat superior.\nB. vicarious liability.\nC. joint venture.\nD. imputed negligence.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the vacationer will likely rely on the concept of **B. vicarious liability**.\n\nVicarious liability is a legal doctrine that holds an employer responsible for the actions of its employees when those actions occur within the scope of their employment. This means that if an employee's negligent act causes harm while they are performing their job duties, the employer can be held liable for the damages resulting from that negligence.\n\nHere\u2019s why the other options are less applicable:\n\n- **A. Respondeat Superior**: This term is often used interchangeably with vicarious liability but specifically refers to the principle that employers are responsible for the actions of their employees when those actions are performed within the scope of employment. Since vicarious liability is more commonly used in modern legal contexts, it is the preferred term here.\n  \n- **C. Joint Venture**: This involves a business arrangement where parties agree to pool resources to undertake a specific project or task. There is no indication in the scenario that the ski lift company and the park owner were engaged in a joint venture.\n  \n- **D. Imputed Negligence**: This concept applies when the negligence of one party is attributed to another due to a special relationship (e.g., parent-child). It does not fit the context of an employer-employee relationship described in the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Vicarious Liability."
