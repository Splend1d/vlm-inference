Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\nA. collateral estoppel\nB. proximate cause\nC. res ipsa loquitur\nD. respondeat superior\n"

In this case, the presence of a surgical sponge in the patient's pelvis after a hysterectomy strongly suggests that negligence occurred during the surgery, as it is highly unlikely for such an event to happen without someone being negligent."
