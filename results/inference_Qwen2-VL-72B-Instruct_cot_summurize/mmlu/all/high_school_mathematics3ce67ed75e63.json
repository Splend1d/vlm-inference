                    "text": " The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. So we want to find the probability that the product of the numbers on three dice is equal to $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$.\nThe only way this can happen is if one die shows a 5, and the other two dice show a 6 (since $6=2 \\cdot 3$).\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 6 on another die is also $\\frac{1}{6}$. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of their probabilities: $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}$.\nHowever, there are three different ways this can happen: the 5 can be on the first die, the second die, or the third die. So we need to multiply the probability by 3: $3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nBut we have only considered the case where the 5 is on one die and the 6s are on the other two dice. We also need to consider the case where the 5 is on one die and the 6 is on the other two dice. This gives us another $\\frac{1}{12}$.\nAdding these two probabilities together, we get $\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where the 5 is on one die and the 6 is on the other two dice. We need to subtract the probability of this happening once.\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on one die and a 6 on another die is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}$.\nSince there are three ways this can happen (the 5 can be on the first die, the second die, or the third die), we need to multiply this probability by 3: $3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nSo the final probability is $\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nHowever, we have made a mistake in our calculation. The correct calculation should be:\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on one die and a 6 on another die is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}$.\nSince there are three ways this can happen (the 5 can be on the first die, the second die, or the third die), we need to multiply this probability by 3: $3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nBut we have only considered the case where the 5 is on one die and the 6s are on the other two dice.

This gives us another $\\frac{1}{12}$.\nAdding these two probabilities together, we get $\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nAnd we have not overcounted any cases, so this is the correct probability.\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the numbers on three dice is equal to 180 is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. It seems we have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's reevaluate the problem.\nThe prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$.
