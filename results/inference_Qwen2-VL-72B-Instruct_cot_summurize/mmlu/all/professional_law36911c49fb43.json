The college student took the complaint papers that were approved by the prosecution and filed them with a magistrate court. An ongoing police investigation later determined, however, that the college student was a vengeful person not averse to creating stories, and that he and the former roommate had been arguing over several related issues. They also determined that he never had any quality sound or video equipment. The police dropped the prosecution, and the criminal case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing. When the former roommate filed a civil case against the college student alleging the tort of malicious prosecution, will evidence of the student's reputation for dishonesty be admissible and why?\n\nA. Yes, because dishonesty at any time in the past is always relevant to a malicious prosecution complaint.\nB. Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.\nC. Yes, because reputation evidence, just like most character evidence, is virtually always admissible.\nD. Yes, because while most character evidence is not admissible, some is, and reputation evidence is always admissible.\n"

Yes, because even though character evidence is too collateral to be admitted for circumstantial evidence, it is admissible if it is directly at issue in the case.\n\nIn legal proceedings, character evidence is generally not admissible to prove that a person acted in accordance with their character on a particular occasion. However, there are exceptions, particularly when the character itself is directly at issue in the case. In the context of a malicious prosecution claim, the plaintiff (the former roommate) would need to demonstrate that the defendant (the college student) initiated the prosecution with malice or without probable cause. Evidence of the college student's reputation for dishonesty could be relevant to establishing the absence of probable cause or the presence of malice, making it admissible under these circumstances."
