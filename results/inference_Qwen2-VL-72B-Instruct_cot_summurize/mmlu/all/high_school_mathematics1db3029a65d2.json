                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break down the conditions given:\n\n1. The number ends in the digit $0$. This means the number is divisible by $10$, and hence by $2$ and $5$.\n2. The sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. This implies that the number itself is divisible by $3$.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can conclude that the number must be divisible by $2$, $3$, and $5$. \n\nNow, let's consider the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9$:\n\n- We already know the number is divisible by $2$ and $5$.\n- It is also divisible by $3$ due to the sum of its digits being divisible by $3$.\n- Since the number is divisible by both $2$ and $3$, it is also divisible by $6$ (since $6 = 2 \\times 3$).\n- For divisibility by $4$, we need the last two digits of the number to form a number that is divisible by $4$. However, since the number ends in $0$, the only way for the last two digits to be divisible by $4$ is if they are $00$, which is not specified in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the number is necessarily divisible by $4$ without additional information.\n- For divisibility by $8$, we would need the last three digits of the number to form a number that is divisible by $8$. Again, with just the condition that the number ends in $0$, we cannot conclude that the number is necessarily divisible by $8$.\n- For divisibility by $9$, we would need the sum of all digits to be divisible by $9$. While the sum of digits is divisible by $3$, it does not necessarily mean it is divisible by $9$ unless explicitly stated or derived from additional information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditions, we can definitively say that the number is divisible by $2$, $3$, and $5$, and consequently also by $6$. This gives us a total of $4$ numbers ($2, 3, 5,$ and $6$) that necessarily divide the number.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4."
