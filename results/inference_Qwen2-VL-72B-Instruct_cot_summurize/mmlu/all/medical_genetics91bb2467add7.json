Since the alleles are distinct but have the same frequency, the total probability is simply twice the probability of one allele:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times p^2 = 2 \\times 0.04 = 0.08 \\]\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of an individual in the population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each with a frequency of 0.2, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.08} \\]"
