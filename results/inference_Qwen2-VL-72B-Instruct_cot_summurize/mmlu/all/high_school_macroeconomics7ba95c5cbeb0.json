In the short run there is a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment and in the long run the relationship is constant.\n\nIn the short run, the Phillips curve suggests that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, meaning that as unemployment decreases, inflation tends to increase, and vice versa. However, in the long run, according to the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, this trade-off disappears, and the economy returns to its natural rate of unemployment regardless of the level of inflation."
