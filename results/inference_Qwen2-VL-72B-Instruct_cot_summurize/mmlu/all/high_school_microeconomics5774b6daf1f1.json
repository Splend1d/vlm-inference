This ensures that the marginal benefit (as represented by the price consumers are willing to pay) equals the marginal cost of production, which is the standard for allocative efficiency in economics. \n\nOption A (where price is equal to average total cost) and Option C (where normal profits are made) relate more to conditions for a firm's survival in the long run rather than to achieving allocative efficiency. Option B (where marginal revenue equals marginal cost) is a condition for profit maximization but does not necessarily ensure allocative efficiency, especially in a monopolistic market where marginal revenue is typically less than price."
