While it might be considered insensitive or potentially traumatic for some students, it is not inherently morally wrong if done with appropriate context, sensitivity, and respect for the subject matter. It could be seen as a legitimate method of education if handled properly.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character rips and tears up the test papers from their teacher at school.\n\nThis scenario involves destroying property that belongs to someone else (the teacher). This action is generally considered disrespectful and against the rules of most educational institutions. It also violates common moral standards regarding respect for others' property and authority figures.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong if handled appropriately.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong because it involves destroying someone else's property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
