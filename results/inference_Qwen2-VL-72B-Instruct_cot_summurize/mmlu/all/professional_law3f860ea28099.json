In this context, the evidence being offered is that the witness was confined in a juvenile detention facility on a specific date.\n\n2. **Source of Information**: The information about the confinement comes from records maintained by the juvenile authorities. These records indicate that the witness was indeed confined in the juvenile detention facility on the specified date.\n\n3. **Declarant Identification**: The declarant is the person or entity that made the original statement or record. In this case, the original statement or record is the documentation maintained by the juvenile authorities indicating the confinement.\n\nGiven these points, the hearsay declarant would be the juvenile authorities, as they are the ones who created and maintain the records that state the witness was confined in the juvenile detention facility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The juvenile authorities."
