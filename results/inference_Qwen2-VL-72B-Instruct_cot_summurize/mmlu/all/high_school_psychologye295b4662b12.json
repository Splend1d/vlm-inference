Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley in 1977, suggests that dreams are the result of the brain's attempt to interpret and make sense of random neural signals originating from the brainstem during REM sleep. This theory posits that these signals are not purposeful or meaningful but rather random, and the brain synthesizes them into coherent dream narratives."
