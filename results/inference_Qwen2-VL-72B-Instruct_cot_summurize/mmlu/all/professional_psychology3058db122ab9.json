The central route involves careful and thoughtful consideration of the arguments presented in the message, while the peripheral route relies on cues such as the attractiveness of the speaker or the number of arguments presented.\n\nAccording to the ELM, a person is most likely to rely on the central route for processing information when:\n\nC. \"the message is within his 'latitude of acceptance.'\"\n\nThe latitude of acceptance refers to the range of attitudes or beliefs that an individual finds acceptable or compatible with their own views. When a message falls within this range, the individual is more likely to engage in careful and thoughtful consideration of the arguments presented, which is characteristic of the central route."
