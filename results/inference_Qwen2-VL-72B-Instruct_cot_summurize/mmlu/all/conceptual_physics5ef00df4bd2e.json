It is a measure of how tightly bound the nucleons are within the nucleus.\n\n3. **Iron Nucleus**: Iron has one of the highest binding energies per nucleon among all elements. This means that each nucleon in an iron nucleus is very tightly bound.\n\n4. **Fission Fragments**: When iron undergoes fission, the resulting fragments will have a higher binding energy per nucleon than the original iron nucleus. This is because the fragments are closer to the peak of the binding energy curve, which is around iron itself.\n\nGiven this information, if an iron nucleus splits in two, the fission fragments would have:\n\n- **More mass per nucleon** because they are more tightly bound, leading to a higher binding energy per nucleon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. more mass per nucleon"
