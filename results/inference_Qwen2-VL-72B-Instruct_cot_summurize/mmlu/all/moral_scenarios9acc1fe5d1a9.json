Since the brother is 25, he is legally allowed to consume alcohol.\n- Buying alcohol for someone who is of legal drinking age is not considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character is skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside a preschool.\n- Skateboarding at high speeds near a preschool could potentially endanger children and others around.\n- This behavior can be seen as reckless and irresponsible, posing a risk to public safety.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong because it involves buying alcohol for someone who is legally allowed to drink.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong because it involves engaging in an activity that poses a risk to the safety of others, especially children.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
