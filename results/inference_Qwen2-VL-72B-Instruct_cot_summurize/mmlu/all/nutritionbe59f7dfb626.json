                    "text": "Let's analyze each option to determine which statement is correct regarding fat digestion and absorption:\n\nA. **Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because fatty acid absorption primarily occurs in the jejunum, not the distal duodenum.\n\nB. **After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal blood system, while long chain triglycerides (LCTs) are absorbed into the lymphatic system as chylomicrons.\n\nC. **The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption.**\n   - This statement is correct. Partially digested triglycerides (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) form mixed micelles with bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids, which facilitates their absorption by the enterocytes.\n\nD. **Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported.**\n   - This statement is correct. Triglycerides need to be emulsified by bile salts and then hydrolyzed by lipases to monoglycerides and free fatty acids for absorption.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statements are C and D. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement, we should choose the one that best encapsulates the process of fat digestion and absorption:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported.**"
