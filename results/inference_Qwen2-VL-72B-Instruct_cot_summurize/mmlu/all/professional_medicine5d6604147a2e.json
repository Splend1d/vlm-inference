Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA.

Fatty acid oxidation\n\nMalonyl-CoA is an important intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, but it also serves as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for \u03b2-oxidation. Therefore, increased levels of malonyl-CoA would inhibit CPT1 activity, leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation."
