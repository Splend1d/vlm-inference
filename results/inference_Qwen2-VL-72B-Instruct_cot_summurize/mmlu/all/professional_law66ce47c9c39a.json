The college student generously lent the car to his friend. On his way home from the date, basking in the memories of a beautiful evening, the friend lost control of the car and hit a pedestrian. As a result of the accident, and after learning that the friend had no money and no insurance, the pedestrian brought suit against the college student to recover for his injuries. He asserted a claim against the college student for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. During his case, the pedestrian introduced evidence that the friend had been in several previous accidents. In his defense, the college student offered the testimony of his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent his car to his friend. The girlfriend further testified that the college student gave his friend permission to use his car only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The girlfriend's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as evidence of habit.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character.\nD. inadmissible, because she is biased.\n"

Evidence of habit involves demonstrating a person's routine behavior or regular practice in specific situations, which can be relevant to show that the person acted in a certain way on a particular occasion. This type of evidence is generally admissible under the rules of evidence to establish a pattern of behavior that is consistent with the actions in question."
