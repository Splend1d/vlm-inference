M (M is true)\n\nAnd the conclusion:\nN (N is true)\n\nLet's create the truth table:\n\n| M | N | ~N | M \u2261 ~N | ~(M \u2261 ~N) |\n|---|---|----|--------|-----------|\n| T | T | F  | F      | T         |\n| T | F | T  | T      | F         |\n| F | T | F  | T      | F         |\n| F | F | T  | F      | T         |\n\nNow let's analyze the truth table step by step:\n\n1. When M is true (T) and N is true (T):\n   - ~N is false (F).\n   - M \u2261 ~N is false (F), because M is true and ~N is false.\n   - ~(M \u2261 ~N) is true (T).\n\n2. When M is true (T) and N is false (F):\n   - ~N is true (T).\n   - M \u2261 ~N is true (T), because both M and ~N are true.\n   - ~(M \u2261 ~N) is false (F).\n\n3. When M is false (F) and N is true (T):\n   - ~N is false (F).\n   - M \u2261 ~N is true (T), because both M and ~N are false.\n   - ~(M \u2261 ~N) is false (F).\n\n4. When M is false (F) and N is false (F):\n   - ~N is true (T).\n   - M \u2261 ~N is false (F), because M is false and ~N is true.\n   - ~(M \u2261 ~N) is true (T).\n\nNow, let's check the validity of the argument:\n\n- The first premise is ~(M \u2261 ~N). We see that it is true in rows 1 and 4.\n- The second premise is M. It is true in row 1.\n- The conclusion is N. In row 1, where both premises are satisfied, N is also true.\n\nSince there is at least one row where both premises are true and the conclusion is also true, the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
