Finally, the woman hired a handyman to build a wooden stake fence between her property and her neighbor's property for $10,000. The handyman built the fence as agreed, and the woman paid him the sum of $10,000. Two weeks later, the neighbor was operating his lawn mower near the property line between his and the woman's property when a section of the fence suddenly fell on top of him, seriously injuring him. A subsequent investigation revealed that the handyman did not properly reinforce the fence. Which of the following is the handyman's best defense in a contract action brought against him by the neighbor, in which the only damages alleged are those for the neighbor's personal injuries?\n\nA. Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\nB. Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\nC. The neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\nD. The neighbor has no standing to assert such an action, since he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n"

Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\n\nThis defense addresses the issue of foreseeability and the scope of liability under the contract. When parties enter into a contract, they are generally liable for damages that are foreseeable and arise naturally from the breach of the contract. In this case, the handyman could argue that personal injuries to the neighbor were not a foreseeable consequence of the contract between the woman and himself, and thus, he should not be held liable for those damages."
