Have they simply become IR and lost their position that defines them as security studies?\n\nA. The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks.\nB. Policy knowledge reflected in terms of theories, when an interaction emerges between the US and European thinkers, the theoretical context will be the same.\nC. The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners.\nD. European security studies will be treated as a form of (policy) knowledge, whereas security theory in the US will treat this as the main empirical source for critical analysis.\n"

They have also challenged the dominant realist paradigm in international relations, which emphasizes state sovereignty and power politics, by highlighting the importance of non-state actors and transnational processes.\n\nWhile some argue that these new approaches have led to a blurring of the boundaries between security studies and other fields such as international relations, others see this as a positive development that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of contemporary security challenges. In any case, it is clear that the new critical schools of security studies have contributed to a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of security and its implications for global politics.\n\nRegarding the options provided:\n\nA. This statement suggests that the next generation of scholars will engage more directly with policy questions and policymakers, which could lead to a greater emphasis on practical applications of security studies research.\n\nB. This statement implies that there may be a convergence of theoretical perspectives between US and European thinkers, which could facilitate greater collaboration and exchange of ideas.\n\nC. This statement highlights the ongoing tension between security studies and other disciplines, particularly technical experts and practitioners, which could limit the impact of security studies research on policy-making.\n\nD. This statement suggests that there may be differences in how security studies is approached in Europe and the US, with European scholars focusing more on policy-oriented research and US scholars emphasizing critical analysis of security theory."
