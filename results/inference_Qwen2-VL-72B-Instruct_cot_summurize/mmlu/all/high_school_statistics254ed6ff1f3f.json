                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution. The LSAT scores are normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 650 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 45.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-score for an LSAT score of 740. The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value we're interested in (740), \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (650), and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (45).\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{740 - 650}{45} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{90}{45} \\]\n\\[ z = 2 \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage of applicants who have scores below 740. This corresponds to finding the area under the normal curve to the left of \\( z = 2 \\). We can look up this value in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator or software that provides the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the CDF at \\( z = 2 \\) is approximately 0.9772. This means that about 97.72% of the scores fall below 740 when considering all applicants.\n\nHowever, we are only considering applicants with scores above 700. First, let's find the z-score for an LSAT score of 700:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{700 - 650}{45} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{50}{45} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11 \\]\n\nThe CDF at \\( z = 1.11 \\) is approximately 0.8665. This means that about 86.65% of the scores fall below 700 when considering all applicants.\n\nSince we are only considering applicants with scores above 700, we need to adjust our calculation. The percentage of applicants with scores between 700 and 740 out of those above 700 is given by the difference in the CDF values:\n\n\\[ P(700 < X < 740) = P(X < 740) - P(X < 700) \\]\n\\[ P(700 < X < 740) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 \\]\n\\[ P(700 < X < 740) = 0.1107 \\]\n\nSo, about 11.07% of all applicants have scores between 700 and 740. However, since we are only considering applicants with scores above 700, we need to find what percentage this represents out of those above 700. Since 86.65% of all applicants have scores below 700, the remaining 13.35% have scores above 700.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of applicants with scores above 700 that also have scores below 740 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \\times 100 \\approx 82.9\\% \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 82.9%"
