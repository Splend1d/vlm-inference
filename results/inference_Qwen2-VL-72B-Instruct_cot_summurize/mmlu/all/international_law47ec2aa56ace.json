R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle that aims to prevent mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It differs from humanitarian intervention in several ways:\n\n1. **UNSC Involvement**: R2P emphasizes the role of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in authorizing interventions, which adds a layer of international legitimacy and reduces the arbitrariness associated with unilateral or ad hoc humanitarian interventions.\n\n2. **Primary Objective**: The primary goal of R2P is to protect populations from mass atrocity crimes, whereas humanitarian intervention may have broader objectives, including regime change or territorial control.\n\n3. **Spectrum of Actions**: R2P encompasses a range of actions beyond military intervention, including diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and other non-military measures aimed at preventing or stopping atrocities.\n\n4. **State Consent**: While R2P does not necessarily require the consent of the state in distress, it does emphasize the responsibility of states to protect their own populations first. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, often occurs without the consent of the affected state.\n\n5. **Armed Force**: R2P does not always involve armed force; it can include preventive measures and non-military responses. Humanitarian intervention, however, typically involves the use of military force.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately captures the essence of how R2P differs from humanitarian intervention by highlighting the requirement for some UNSC input and the primary objective of averting a humanitarian crisis."
