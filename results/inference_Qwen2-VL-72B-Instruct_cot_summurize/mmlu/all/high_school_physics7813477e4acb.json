                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how capacitors behave when connected in series and how they store charge.\n\nWhen capacitors are connected in series, their equivalent capacitance \\( C_{eq} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\frac{1}{C_3}\n\\]\n\nGiven that each of the three capacitors has a capacitance of \\( 18 \\mu F \\), we can calculate the equivalent capacitance as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{18 \\mu F} + \\frac{1}{18 \\mu F} + \\frac{1}{18 \\mu F}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{18 \\mu F} \\times 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{3}{18 \\mu F}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{6 \\mu F}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nC_{eq} = 6 \\mu F\n\\]\n\nNow, let's determine the voltage across the capacitors. Since the original 2 \u03bcF capacitor stores 600 \u03bcC of charge, we can find the voltage \\( V \\) using the formula for capacitance:\n\n\\[\nQ = CV\n\\]\n\n\\[\n600 \\mu C = (2 \\mu F) \\times V\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{600 \\mu C}{2 \\mu F}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = 300 \\text{ volts}\n\\]\n\nSince the capacitors are connected in series, the same voltage will be applied across each capacitor. Therefore, each of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors will also have 300 volts across them.\n\nNow, we can calculate the charge stored on each of these capacitors using the formula:\n\n\\[\nQ = CV\n\\]\n\nFor one 18 \u03bcF capacitor:\n\n\\[\nQ = (18 \\mu F) \\times (300 \\text{ volts})\n\\]\n\n\\[\nQ = 5400 \\mu C\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might have been an error in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem carefully.\n\nUpon re-examining, we realize that the total charge stored in the system should remain constant because the voltage source (battery) remains the same. The total charge stored in the original 2 \u03bcF capacitor was 600 \u03bcC. When the capacitors are replaced with three 18 \u03bcF capacitors in series, the total charge stored in the system must still be 600 \u03bcC.\n\nSince the capacitors are in series, the charge on each capacitor will be the same. Therefore, the charge stored on each of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors will be:\n\n\\[\nQ_{each} = \\frac{600 \\mu C}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nQ_{each} = 200 \\mu C\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 200 \u03bcC"
