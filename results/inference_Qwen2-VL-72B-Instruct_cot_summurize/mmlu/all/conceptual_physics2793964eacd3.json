Each piece has its own surface area.\n2. **Assembly**: When these pieces are assembled together to form a larger piece, some of the surfaces that were previously exposed will now be internalized (i.e., they will no longer be part of the external surface area).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- The external surface area of the assembled larger piece will be less than the sum of the individual surface areas of the smaller pieces because some surfaces become internal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. decreases"
