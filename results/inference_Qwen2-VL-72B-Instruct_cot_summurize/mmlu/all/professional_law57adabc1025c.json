A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\nD. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n"

The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\n\nIn cases involving regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment, courts typically consider whether the regulation has deprived the property owner of all economically viable use of their property. If the regulation leaves some reasonable economic use, it is generally considered constitutional. In this scenario, since the ordinance allows for the development of up to five single-family residences on the five-acre lot, it does not deprive the partnership of all economically viable use of the property. Therefore, the Supreme Court would likely find the ordinance constitutional."
