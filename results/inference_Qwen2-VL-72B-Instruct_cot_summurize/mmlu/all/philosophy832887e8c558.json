In his philosophical and theological works, Aquinas often discusses the concept of perfection in relation to God and the ultimate end of human activity. He argues that true perfection is found in aligning oneself with the divine will and participating in the goodness and perfection of God. This perspective is rooted in his broader understanding of teleology, where all things are directed towards their ultimate end or purpose, which for humans is union with God."
