Just ahead, the pedestrian noticed a private dinner club. As the pedestrian approached the club, he noticed a sign over the front door that read: \"ADMITTANCE TO MEMBERS ONLY. \" Although the pedestrian was not a member of the exclusive club, he entered the dimly lit club, found a door marked \"Gentlemen,\" and entered the restroom.

Therefore, the most appropriate description of his legal status is:\n\n**A. Trespasser.**"
