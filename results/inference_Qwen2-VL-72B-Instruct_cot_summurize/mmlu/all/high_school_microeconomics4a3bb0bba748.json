This cost reduction allows manufacturers to increase their production levels without increasing prices or even potentially lower the prices of bicycles, which can lead to an increase in the supply of bicycles in the market. The other options do not directly follow from the given information:\n\n- A. The demand for aluminum is not necessarily related to its own price change; it depends on the demand for products that use aluminum.\n- C. A fall in the price of a key input typically leads to an increase in supply, not a decrease.\n- D. While a decrease in the price of bicycles could lead to an increase in demand for bicycles, this is a secondary effect and not the direct result of the aluminum price change."
