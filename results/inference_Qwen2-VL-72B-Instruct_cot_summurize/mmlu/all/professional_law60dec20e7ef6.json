A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n"

The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\n\nExplanation:\nThe regulation of immigration is primarily a federal responsibility under the U.S. Constitution. This principle is based on the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2), which establishes that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws. Therefore, even though states may have some authority to regulate certain aspects of employment, when it comes to immigration status and the employment of aliens, federal law generally preempts state law. Thus, the state labor code provision attempting to regulate the employment of aliens based on their immigration status would likely be found unconstitutional due to federal preemption."
