You can never prove your theory to be correct only \"yet to be proven wrong.\"\n\nIn science, theories are not definitively proven to be correct; rather, they are considered valid as long as they have not been disproven by experimental evidence or observations. The scientific method involves making predictions based on a theory and then testing those predictions through experiments and observations. If the results of these tests consistently align with the predictions, the theory gains more acceptance within the scientific community. However, even widely accepted theories can be revised or replaced if new evidence emerges that contradicts them. Therefore, a theory can never be conclusively proven correct, but it can remain robust and useful until it is falsified by new evidence."
