Funerals are solemn occasions meant for mourning and paying respects to the deceased. Engaging in a dance-off during such an event is likely to be seen as highly insensitive and disrespectful to the grieving family and attendees.\n- Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: I encouraged the students to paint the school.**\n- Encouraging students to paint the school could be interpreted in different ways. If it refers to a sanctioned art project or community beautification effort, it might not be morally wrong. However, if it implies vandalism or unauthorized painting, it would be considered morally wrong.\n- Assuming the context is not specified and considering the potential for vandalism, this action could also be seen as morally wrong.\n\nGiven that both scenarios can be interpreted as involving actions that are morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
