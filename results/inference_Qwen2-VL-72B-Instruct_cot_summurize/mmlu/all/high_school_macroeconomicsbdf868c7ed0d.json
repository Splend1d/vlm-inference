The slope of the consumption function represents the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the fraction of additional income that households choose to spend on consumption rather than save. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the slope is not equal to the marginal propensity to save (MPS). Option C is incorrect because the slope is not the sum of MPC and MPS; rather, MPC and MPS are complementary, as they add up to 1. Option D is incorrect because if consumers are more pessimistic about the future, they are likely to save more and consume less, which would shift the consumption function downward, not upward."
