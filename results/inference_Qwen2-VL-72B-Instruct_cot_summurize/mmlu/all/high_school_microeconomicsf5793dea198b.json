Without this information, it's impossible to accurately answer the question.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the total budget for labor is known and you're asking how many units can be hired with that budget, then the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of units} = \\frac{\\text{Total Budget}}{\\text{Wage per unit}} \\]\n\nFor example, if the total budget for labor is $9.00:\n\\[ \\text{Number of units} = \\frac{9.00}{4.50} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, in this case, the answer would be B. 2.\n\nBut without the total budget, we cannot definitively choose an option. Please provide the total budget for labor if available."
