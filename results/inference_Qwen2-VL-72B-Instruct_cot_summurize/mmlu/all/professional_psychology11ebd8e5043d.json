High levels of post-divorce conflict can lead to increased stress and emotional distress for children, whereas lower levels of conflict or cooperative co-parenting can help facilitate a smoother transition and better adjustment for the child. While other factors such as the quality of parent-child relationships and contact with the noncustodial parent are also important, the degree of post-divorce conflict tends to be a key factor in children's successful adjustment to parental divorce."
