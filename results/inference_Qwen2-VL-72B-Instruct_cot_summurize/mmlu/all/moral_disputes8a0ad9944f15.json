Expressive harm refers to the idea that certain forms of expression can be harmful in themselves, without necessarily causing direct physical or psychological harm to individuals. This type of harm is often more abstract and subjective, making it challenging to justify censorship on these grounds alone.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. expressive harm"
