With the permission bf the husband, the attorney's law clerk also sat in on the consultation to see how the attorney conducted these meetings. Shortly after this initial consultation with the attorney, the secretary quit. During the divorce trial, the wife's attorney seeks to call the secretary to testify about what the husband told the attorney during the initial client consultation. Upon objection, the secretary's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible, because her presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney-client privilege.\nB. admissible, because the law clerk's presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney- client privilege.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

This privilege extends to those who are present during the communication for the purpose of facilitating the attorney-client relationship, such as secretaries or law clerks. In this scenario, both the secretary and the law clerk were present to assist the attorney in providing legal advice to the client. Therefore, their presence does not destroy the attorney-client privilege. The secretary cannot be compelled to testify about the confidential communications made during the consultation due to the attorney-client privilege."
