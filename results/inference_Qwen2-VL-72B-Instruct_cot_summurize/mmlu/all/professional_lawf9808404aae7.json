This person does not necessarily need to be an expert; they just need to have familiarity with the defendant's writing style and be able to testify confidently that the handwriting in question matches the defendant's. In this case, the defendant's former girlfriend could reasonably be considered an authenticating witness if she has had sufficient exposure to the defendant's handwriting to make a credible identification."
