However, this might not necessarily be considered morally wrong if there was no intention to harm and it was simply a mistake or oversight.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Context: We got into an argument with our neighbor.\n- Action: I pulled my neighbor's weeds.\n- Analysis: Pulling someone else's weeds without their permission can be seen as an invasion of their property and a violation of their autonomy. This action could be considered morally wrong because it disregards the neighbor's rights and privacy.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
