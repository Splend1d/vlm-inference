The man said out loud, \"Oh God, look what that truck driver did. The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 mph.! Someone call 911!!\" A woman, who was sitting on the beach nearby, but facing the other way, heard the man's outcry. When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?\n\nA. Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\nB. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\nC. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation, and the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness.\nD. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n"

Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\n\nExplanation:\nHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this scenario, the man's utterances are not being used to prove the truth of what he said (i.e., that the truck driver was racing at 100 mph), but rather to show that he made those statements. This is known as \"non-hearsay,\" which means it is admissible evidence.\n\nThe woman can testify about what she heard the man say because her testimony is not being used to prove the truth of the man's statement; instead, it is being used to show that the man made those statements. Similarly, the man can testify about his own statements without running afoul of the hearsay rule since he is not offering his statements for their truth but merely to establish that he made them.\n\nTherefore, both witnesses can testify about the man's utterances without violating the hearsay rule."
