Static figures and a sense of optical surface movement\n\nGeorges Seurat is known for his Pointillist technique, which involves the application of small, distinct dots of color applied in patterns to form an image. This method creates a sense of optical surface movement and allows the viewer's eye to mix the colors when viewed from a distance. The figures in his paintings often appear static, contributing to the overall calm and methodical feel of his work."
