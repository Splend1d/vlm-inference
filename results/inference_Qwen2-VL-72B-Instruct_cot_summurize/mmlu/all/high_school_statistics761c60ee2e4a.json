It is not affected by changes in scale or location of the variables. Therefore, adding a constant to all values of one variable or multiplying all values of another variable by a constant will not change the correlation coefficient.\n\nHowever, interchanging the two variables will change the sign of the correlation coefficient. If the original correlation was positive (r > 0), then interchanging the variables will result in a negative correlation (r < 0). Conversely, if the original correlation was negative (r < 0), then interchanging the variables will result in a positive correlation (r > 0).\n\nIn this case, the original correlation is positive (r = 0.19). Interchanging the variables will result in a negative correlation (r < 0). Therefore, the new correlation will be -0.19.\nTherefore, the answer is D."
