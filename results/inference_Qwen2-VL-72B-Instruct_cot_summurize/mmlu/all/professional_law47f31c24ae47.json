A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?\n\nA. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.\nB. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.\nC. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\nD. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.\n"

No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\n\nIn this scenario, the seller made a unilateral mistake regarding the value of the etching. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in case law, if the mistake is material and the other party knew or should have known about the mistake, the contract can be rescinded. The buyer knew the true value of the etching and took advantage of the seller's ignorance. Therefore, the court might allow the seller to rescind the contract and recover the etching or seek damages equivalent to its fair market value."
