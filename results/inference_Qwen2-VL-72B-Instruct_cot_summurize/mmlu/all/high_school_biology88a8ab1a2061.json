Hot and dry\n\nPlants with fewer stomata are typically better adapted to hot and dry environments because stomata are the openings through which plants exchange gases (like carbon dioxide for photosynthesis) and lose water vapor (transpiration). In hot and dry conditions, having fewer stomata helps reduce water loss, conserving moisture in the plant's tissues. This adaptation allows the plant to survive in environments where water is scarce."
