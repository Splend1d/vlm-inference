The courts exercise discretion as to the enforcement of foreign judgments on the basis of the rule of comity\n\nExplanation:\nThe recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are generally governed by principles of international law, particularly the principle of comity, which refers to the respect that one nation's legal system has for another's. This principle allows courts in one country to recognize and enforce judgments made by courts in another country, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nWhile bilateral or multilateral treaties can provide specific rules for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, they are not always necessary. In the absence of such treaties, courts often rely on the principle of comity to decide whether to enforce a foreign judgment. This approach gives courts some discretion in determining whether to enforce a foreign judgment based on factors such as the fairness of the original proceeding, the similarity of legal systems, and other considerations relevant to the particular case.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the doctrines of incorporation and transformation pertain to how treaties become part of domestic law, rather than the enforcement of foreign judgments. Option C is partially correct but incomplete, as it does not account for the role of comity and judicial discretion in the absence of treaties."
