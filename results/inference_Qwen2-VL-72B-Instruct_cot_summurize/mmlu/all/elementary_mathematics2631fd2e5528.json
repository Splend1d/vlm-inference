This means the digit 6 must be in the ten-thousands place in the new number.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. 681,452 - The digit 6 is in the hundred-thousands place, not the ten-thousands place.\nB. 462,017 - The digit 6 is in the ten-thousands place, making its value \\(6 \\times 10,000 = 60,000\\).\nC. 246,412 - The digit 6 is in the thousands place, not the ten-thousands place.\nD. 125,655 - The digit 6 is in the hundreds place, not the ten-thousands place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 462,017."
