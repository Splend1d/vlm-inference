Without specific information on what Altman's arguments are, we cannot definitively conclude if he discusses all three objections. However, based on common critiques of speech codes, it is plausible that he might address multiple aspects of these objections.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive answer would be:\n\n**D. all of the above**\n\nThis choice acknowledges that Altman could potentially discuss various objections to speech codes, including their potential to encourage bigotry, treat hate speakers unequally, and result in causal harms."
