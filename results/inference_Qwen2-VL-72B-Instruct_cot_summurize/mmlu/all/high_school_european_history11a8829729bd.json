By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the best description of the plans being changed, let's analyze the excerpt step-by-step:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage discusses Addison's Act, which was conceived due to fears of a potential revolution in Britain similar to the Russian Revolution if working-class aspirations were not met post-World War I.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - By 1920, fears of revolution were receding.\n   - Addison's policy was seen as extravagant.\n   - The Borough's Kingfield Street housing scheme was deferred by the Government's Housing Board.\n   - In May 1921, the government announced a significant reduction in the housing program, cutting the housing target by half.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\"\n     - This option is somewhat relevant because it touches on the questioning of policies (like Addison's Act) post-World War I. However, it doesn't specifically address the housing aspect mentioned in the passage.\n   \n   - **Option B**: \"Housing was a large part of the British budget.\"\n     - This option is partially correct but does not capture the core issue discussed in the passage, which is the change in policy due to receding fears and perceived extravagance rather than just the budgetary aspect.\n   \n   - **Option C**: \"Workers were threatening communist revolution.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the passage states that fears of revolution were receding by 1920, implying that workers were no longer threatening revolution.\n   \n   - **Option D**: \"The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\"\n     - This option is incorrect because the passage indicates that the Housing Board deferred the Kingfield Street scheme and the government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing program, indicating they did not want to build more houses.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best description of the plans being changed is:\n\n**Final Answer: A. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.**"
