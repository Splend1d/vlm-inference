Bariatric surgery can be considered a treatment option for mild cases\n\nBinge Eating Disorder (BED) is a serious eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without the compensatory behaviors seen in Bulimia Nervosa (BN). While bariatric surgery can be an effective treatment option for severe obesity, it is not typically recommended as a primary treatment for mild cases of BED. Instead, psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication are often used to address the underlying issues contributing to BED."
