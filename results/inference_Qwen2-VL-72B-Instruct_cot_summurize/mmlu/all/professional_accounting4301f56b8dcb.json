Receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded.\n\nAn auditor looking for unrecorded liabilities would typically examine receiving reports for items received before the year-end because these could indicate goods or services that have been received but not yet invoiced or recorded in the company's financial records. This helps ensure that all obligations incurred up to the balance sheet date are properly accounted for, which is crucial for the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements."
