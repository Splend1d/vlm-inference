By crossing the placenta early in pregnancy and infecting the foetus\n\nRubella, also known as German measles, can cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if a woman contracts the virus during pregnancy. The virus can cross the placenta and infect the developing foetus, leading to various abnormalities such as heart defects, hearing loss, vision problems, and developmental delays. The risk of severe complications is highest when the infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy."
