                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to apply principles from traditional learning theories, particularly operant conditioning, which focuses on how behaviors are influenced by their consequences.\n\n1. **Identify the behavior and its consequences:**\n   - The behavior is the infant's crying.\n   - In family A, crying is followed by delayed attention.\n   - In family B, crying is followed by immediate attention.\n\n2. **Understand the principle of reinforcement:**\n   - Immediate attention (positive reinforcement) can increase the frequency of the behavior (crying).\n   - Delayed or no attention (negative reinforcement or extinction) can decrease the frequency of the behavior.\n\n3. **Apply these principles to nighttime crying:**\n   - During the night, both infants receive no attention when they cry.\n   - According to learning theory, if an infant has been reinforced for crying during the day (immediate attention), they might continue to cry at night expecting similar reinforcement.\n   - If an infant has not been reinforced for crying during the day (delayed or no attention), they might be less likely to cry at night because crying does not lead to desired outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the length of nighttime crying depends on the level of arousal, which is not directly related to learning theory principles.\n- **Option B** suggests that family A\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods at night. This is unlikely because the infant is used to delayed responses and may have learned that crying does not immediately result in attention.\n- **Option C** suggests that family B\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods at night. This is plausible because the infant is used to receiving immediate attention when crying, so they might continue to cry at night expecting the same response.\n- **Option D** suggests that neither infant will tend to cry more than the other at any time, which contradicts the principles of learning theory where reinforcement affects behavior.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer based on traditional learning theories is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. family B\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods of time at night.**"
