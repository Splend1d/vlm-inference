She transformed the UK's economy and had a profound impact on British politics.\n\nB. **Mikhail Gorbachev**: As the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev introduced policies like perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), which led to the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. His leadership was transformative in reshaping global politics.\n\nC. **Nelson Mandela**: As the first black President of South Africa, Mandela played a crucial role in ending apartheid and promoting racial reconciliation. His leadership was transformational in bringing about significant social and political change in South Africa.\n\nD. **Bill Clinton**: While Clinton was an influential president who oversaw economic growth and made significant policy changes during his tenure, his leadership did not bring about the same level of fundamental societal or political transformation as the other leaders listed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the political leader who could not be termed a 'transformational' leader is:\n\n**D. Bill Clinton**"
