So, we have:\n   - An equation for \\(X_t\\) involving \\(X_{t-1}\\), \\(X_{t-2}\\), \\(X_{t-3}\\), \\(X_{t-4}\\), \\(Y_{t-1}\\), \\(Y_{t-2}\\), \\(Y_{t-3}\\), \\(Y_{t-4}\\), \\(Z_{t-1}\\), \\(Z_{t-2}\\), \\(Z_{t-3}\\), and \\(Z_{t-4}\\).\n   - An equation for \\(Y_t\\) with similar terms.\n   - An equation for \\(Z_t\\) with similar terms.\n\n3. **Parameters per Equation**: Each equation has 12 parameters (4 lags for each of the 3 variables).\n\n4. **Total Parameters**: Since there are 3 equations, the total number of parameters is \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 36"
