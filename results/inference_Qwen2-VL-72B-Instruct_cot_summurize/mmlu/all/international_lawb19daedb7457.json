The determination of baselines is instrumental to the establishment of all maritime zones, since they constitute the starting point for measuring the breadth of each zone.\n\nBaselines under the law of the sea serve as the reference points from which the limits of various maritime zones, such as territorial seas, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and continental shelves, are measured. These baselines are crucial for defining the extent of a coastal state's jurisdiction over maritime areas."
