Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A**: Changing from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups does not necessarily increase the power of the test. The power of a test can be influenced by sample size, but it's not directly related to whether the sizes are equal or unequal.\n- **Option B**: Changing from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would actually decrease the power of the test because a lower significance level makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, thus reducing the chance of detecting a true effect.\n- **Option C**: Reducing variability in the response by taking more careful measurements increases the precision of the estimates and makes it easier to detect differences between groups, thereby increasing the power of the test.\n- **Option D**: Increasing the sample size generally increases the power of the test, not reduces the probability of a Type I error. The probability of a Type I error (false positive) is controlled by the chosen significance level (e.g., 5%) and is not directly affected by sample size. However, larger samples do make it less likely to miss a true effect (Type II error), thus increasing the power of the test."
