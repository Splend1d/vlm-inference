The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its cost.\n\nAn enterprise fund is typically used to account for operations where the governmental unit is authorized to charge a fee to external users for goods or services. The key feature of an enterprise fund is that it is intended to be financially self-sustaining through user charges, which means that the fees and charges are set to cover the costs of providing the service, including capital costs. This distinguishes it from other types of funds where costs may be covered by general taxation or other revenue sources."
