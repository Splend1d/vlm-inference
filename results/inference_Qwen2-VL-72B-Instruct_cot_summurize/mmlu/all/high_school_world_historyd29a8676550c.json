The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts\n\nAshoka, the Mauryan emperor, is known for his conversion to Buddhism after witnessing the horrors of war during the Kalinga War. As a result of his conversion, he promoted Buddhist principles throughout his empire, encouraging the spread of Buddhism and the implementation of Buddhist edicts as part of his governance. This had a significant impact on the religious landscape of ancient India."
