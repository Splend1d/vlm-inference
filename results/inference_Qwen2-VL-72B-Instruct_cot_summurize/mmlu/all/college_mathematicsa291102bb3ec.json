The number of ways to partition the exponents in the prime factorization corresponds to the number of structurally distinct abelian groups.\n\nFor \\( 2^3 \\), the partitions of 3 are:\n1. \\( 3 \\)\n2. \\( 2 + 1 \\)\n3. \\( 1 + 1 + 1 \\)\n\nSo, there are 3 possibilities for the structure involving powers of 2.\n\nFor \\( 3^2 \\), the partitions of 2 are:\n1. \\( 2 \\)\n2. \\( 1 + 1 \\)\n\nSo, there are 2 possibilities for the structure involving powers of 3.\n\nTo find the total number of structurally distinct abelian groups, we multiply the number of possibilities for each prime factor:\n\\[ 3 \\text{ (for } 2^3) \\times 2 \\text{ (for } 3^2) = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of structurally distinct abelian groups of order 72 is 6.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 6"
