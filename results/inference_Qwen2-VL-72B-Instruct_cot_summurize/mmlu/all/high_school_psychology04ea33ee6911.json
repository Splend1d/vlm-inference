Implementing a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response-cost raffle.\n\nGiven that a large majority of the students in Ms. Smith's class (26 out of 30) have received discipline referrals, it suggests that the issue may be systemic rather than isolated to a few individuals. A class-wide behavior management plan can help create a consistent and supportive environment for all students, addressing the broader issue of classroom behavior. A response-cost raffle or similar system can provide clear expectations and consequences for behavior, which might help improve overall classroom management and reduce disruptions."
