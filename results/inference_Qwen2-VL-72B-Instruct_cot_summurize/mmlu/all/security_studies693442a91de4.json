Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors.\nB. The growth of capitalism has catapulted the individual consumer to a place of extreme significance in shaping the global market. The behaviour of consumers dictates the nature of the global system.\nC. Behaviour, as a social constructivist concern, is not relevant to economic theory or security theory in general.\nD. The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favourable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations.\n"

Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors.\n\nThis option highlights the importance of understanding how economic principles can be applied to the field of security. By recognizing that economics is fundamentally about decision-making, we can better analyze and anticipate the actions of various actors within the security context. This approach enables us to develop strategies that address potential threats and vulnerabilities more effectively."
