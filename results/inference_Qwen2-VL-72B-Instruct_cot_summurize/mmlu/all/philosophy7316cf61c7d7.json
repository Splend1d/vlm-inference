Cicero was a Roman statesman, philosopher, lawyer, and academic skeptic who wrote extensively on moral philosophy.\n\n1. **Commit acts of injustice (Option A)**: Cicero believed in the importance of justice and would not likely support committing acts of injustice under any circumstances.\n\n2. **Break one's promises (Option B)**: Cicero placed great emphasis on honesty and integrity. He argued that keeping promises is essential for maintaining trust and social order. However, he also recognized that there could be exceptional circumstances where breaking a promise might be necessary to prevent greater harm or injustice.\n\n3. **Steal (Option C)**: Stealing is generally considered an act of injustice and would not align with Cicero's ethical principles.\n\nGiven Cicero's philosophical stance, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**B. break one\u2019s promises.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that while Cicero valued honesty and integrity, he might have acknowledged situations where breaking a promise could be justified to avoid greater harm or injustice."
