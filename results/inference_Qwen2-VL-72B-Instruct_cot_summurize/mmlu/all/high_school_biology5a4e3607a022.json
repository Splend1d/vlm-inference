The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a yeast cell is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, it switches from aerobic respiration to anaerobic fermentation (alcoholic fermentation). Aerobic respiration yields significantly more ATP per molecule of glucose compared to anaerobic fermentation. Specifically, aerobic respiration can produce up to 38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, whereas anaerobic fermentation produces only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.\n\nTherefore, to maintain its energy requirements under anaerobic conditions, the yeast cell must consume glucose at a much higher rate to generate enough ATP. This is why option B is correct. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The cell does not die immediately; instead, it adapts by increasing glucose consumption.\nC. The cell does not need to switch to another food source; it continues to use glucose but at a higher rate.\nD. The cell does not necessarily begin to divide rapidly; the focus is on maintaining ATP production rather than cell division."
