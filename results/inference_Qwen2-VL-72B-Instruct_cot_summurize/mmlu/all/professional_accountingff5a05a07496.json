According to IRS regulations, a partnership is considered terminated if there is a sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interest in the partnership capital and profits within a 12-month period.\n\nIn this case:\n- Initially, the capital interests were divided as follows:\n  - Ross: 15%\n  - Stone: 35%\n  - Taylor: 50%\n\n- On April 9, Stone sold his entire 35% interest to Taylor.\n\nAfter the sale:\n- Ross: 15%\n- Taylor: 85% (50% + 35%)\n\nSince Taylor now owns 85% of the partnership, the sale of Stone's 35% interest results in a change where one partner (Taylor) holds more than 50% of the partnership interest. However, the key point is whether the cumulative sales exceed 50% within a 12-month period. Since only Stone's 35% interest was sold, it does not meet the threshold of 50%.\n\nTherefore, the partnership did not terminate based on the information provided.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. Studio did not terminate."
