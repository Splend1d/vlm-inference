According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), significant progress has been made in reducing open defecation globally over the past decades.\n\nAs of 2020, the percentage of the world population practicing open defecation is estimated to be around 2%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2%"
