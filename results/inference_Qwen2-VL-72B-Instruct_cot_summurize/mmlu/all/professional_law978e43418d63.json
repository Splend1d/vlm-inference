Both requests are denied by the judge, and the defendant is found guilty. The maximum penalty for shoplifting is a $500 fine and six months in jail. The defendant is sentenced to three months in jail, which he is allowed to serve on weekends in the county detention center. The defendant claims that his constitutional rights have been violated. Is he correct?\n\nA. No, because his actual sentence was only three months.\nB. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to a jury trial.\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial.\n"

According to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, a defendant has the right to be represented by counsel and the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.\n\nGiven that the defendant requested an attorney and a jury trial but both requests were denied, it indicates that his constitutional rights were indeed violated. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial."
