The cashier was nervous and moving slowly, and when she accidentally spilled all of the money out of the bag and onto the floor, the defendant shot her and left. The bullet lodged close to the cashier's spine, paralyzing her. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Two months later, the cashier decided she wanted an operation to remove the bullet. The doctors warned the cashier that the procedure was very risky and could result in her death. The cashier decided to go ahead with the surgery and, unfortunately, died as a result. If the defendant is now prosecuted for felony murder, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he was not the cause of the cashier's death.\nB. not guilty, because the subsequent prosecution violates double jeopardy.\nC. not guilty, because the cashier decided to have the surgery, aware of the risks.\nD. guilty, because he was the cause of the cashier's death.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the defendant should be found guilty or not guilty of felony murder in this scenario, we need to consider several legal principles and the specific circumstances described.\n\n1. **Felony Murder Rule**: This rule holds that if someone dies during the commission of a felony (such as robbery), the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if they did not intend to kill anyone.\n\n2. **Chain of Causation**: For the felony murder rule to apply, there must be a direct causal link between the felony and the death. In this case, the defendant's actions led to the cashier being paralyzed, which ultimately led to her decision to undergo surgery.\n\n3. **Intervening Cause**: An intervening cause is an event that occurs after the initial act and contributes to the final outcome. In this scenario, the cashier's decision to undergo surgery is an intervening cause. However, for the felony murder charge to hold, the intervening cause must not break the chain of causation initiated by the defendant's actions.\n\n4. **Double Jeopardy**: Double jeopardy protects individuals from being tried twice for the same crime. Since the defendant has already been prosecuted and convicted for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, the question here is whether prosecuting for felony murder constitutes double jeopardy.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A: Not guilty, because he was not the cause of the cashier's death** - This option is incorrect because the defendant's actions directly caused the cashier's paralysis, which led to her decision to undergo surgery. The chain of causation remains intact despite the intervening cause.\n\n- **Option B: Not guilty, because the subsequent prosecution violates double jeopardy** - This option is incorrect because felony murder is considered a separate offense from the original charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. The defendant can still be prosecuted for felony murder without violating double jeopardy principles.\n\n- **Option C: Not guilty, because the cashier decided to have the surgery, aware of the risks** - This option is incorrect because while the cashier's decision to undergo surgery is an intervening cause, it does not break the chain of causation initiated by the defendant's actions. The defendant's actions led to the situation where the surgery became necessary.\n\n- **Option D: Guilty, because he was the cause of the cashier's death** - This option is correct because the defendant's actions led to the cashier's paralysis, which necessitated the surgery. Even though the cashier chose to undergo the surgery, the defendant's initial actions set the chain of events in motion that resulted in her death.\n\nTherefore, the defendant should be found **guilty, because he was the cause of the cashier's death**."
