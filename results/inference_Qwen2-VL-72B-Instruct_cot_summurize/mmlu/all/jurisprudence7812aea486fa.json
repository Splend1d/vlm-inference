To examine the central questions of legal and political philosophy.\n\nLon Fuller's hypothetical case of the Speluncean Explorers is designed to explore fundamental questions about the nature of law, justice, and moral obligations within a legal framework. The case presents a scenario where five explorers are trapped in a cave and must decide whether to eat one of their own to survive. This thought experiment allows for a deep dive into discussions about legal principles, the limits of law, and the relationship between law and morality."
