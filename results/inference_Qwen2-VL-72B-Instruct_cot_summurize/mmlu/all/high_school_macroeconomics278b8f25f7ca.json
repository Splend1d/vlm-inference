The people of country X are smarter than the people of country Y.**\n   - This statement makes an assumption about intelligence based on economic output, which cannot be concluded from the given data alone. Intelligence is not directly measurable through output alone.\n\n   **B. The people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y.**\n   - Standard of living is often measured by per capita income or GDP per capita. Since Country X has twice the output with the same population, its per capita output (and thus potentially its standard of living) would indeed be twice that of Country Y.\n\n   **C. The people of country Y enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country X.**\n   - This contradicts the given information. If Country X produces twice as much output with the same population, it implies a higher standard of living for Country X, not Country Y.\n\n   **D. The people of country Y work twice as hard as the people of country X.**\n   - This statement assumes that \"working harder\" correlates directly with output, which may not necessarily be true. Output can also be influenced by technology, efficiency, and other factors besides sheer effort.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the most logical conclusion is that the people of Country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as Country Y because their per capita output is twice as high.\n\n**Final Answer: B. The people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y.**"
