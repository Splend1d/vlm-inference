Operant conditioning involves modifying behavior through reinforcement or punishment. It focuses on voluntary behaviors that are influenced by their consequences.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Milo starts at the sound of a buzzer because it sounds very similar to the alarm clock that wakes him every morning.\n- This describes classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus (buzzer) becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus (alarm clock).\n\nB. Paula is promoted to vice president of her company and vows to not lose touch with her employees.\n- This describes a personal resolution or commitment rather than a behavior modified by its consequences.\n\nC. Rebecca cancels her credit card to avoid paying the annual fee but plans to reinstate it in the new year.\n- This describes a strategic decision based on financial considerations rather than a behavior modified by its consequences.\n\nD. Ashmed speaks louder than usual when he talks to his mother on the phone because she is hard of hearing.\n- This describes a necessary adjustment due to a physical condition rather than a behavior modified by its consequences.\n\nNone of these options directly illustrate operant conditioning as they do not show a behavior being reinforced or punished to change future behavior. However, if we must choose the closest example, it would be:\n\n**B. Paula is promoted to vice president of her company and vows to not lose touch with her employees.**\n\nThis could imply that Paula's behavior (staying connected with employees) might be reinforced by her promotion, although it is not explicitly stated. The other options clearly do not fit the definition of operant conditioning."
