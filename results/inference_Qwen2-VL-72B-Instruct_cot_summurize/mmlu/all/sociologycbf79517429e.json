This period saw the widespread adoption of power-driven machinery, such as steam engines, which replaced manual labor and animal power. As a result, there was a shift from small-scale, often home-based production to large-scale factories where machinery could be efficiently operated.\n\nThis concentration of workers in large workplaces, such as factories and mills, led to the development of new forms of organization and management. The factory system required coordinated efforts and discipline among workers, leading to the emergence of a managerial class that oversaw the operation of these industrial enterprises.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C may have some relevance to different aspects of economic history, they do not accurately characterize the primary features of industrial production during the 19th century. Option D best captures the essence of the industrial transformation that occurred during this time."
