It involves the separation of DNA-protein complexes by electrophoresis, followed by detection of the bound proteins using autoradiography or other methods. Western blot hybridization is used to detect specific proteins in a sample, Northern blot hybridization is used to detect specific RNA molecules, and Southern blot hybridization is used to detect specific DNA sequences."
