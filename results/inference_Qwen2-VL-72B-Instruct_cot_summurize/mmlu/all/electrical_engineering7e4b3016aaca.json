High inertia: Mechanical systems often have significant mass, which means they resist changes in motion. This resistance makes it difficult for them to respond quickly to rapid changes in the measured quantity.\n\nB. Higher response time: Due to their inertia and other factors like friction, mechanical instruments may take longer to react to changes compared to electronic or digital counterparts.\n\nC. Large time constant: The time constant is a measure of how long it takes for a system to reach a certain percentage (usually 63%) of its final value after a step change in input. A large time constant indicates a slower response, which is problematic for dynamic measurements that require quick adjustments.\n\nTherefore, all these factors contribute to the limitations of purely mechanical instruments in dynamic measurement applications."
