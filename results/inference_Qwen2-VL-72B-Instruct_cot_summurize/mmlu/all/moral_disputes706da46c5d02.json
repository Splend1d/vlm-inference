Van den Haag was known for his support of the death penalty, often arguing that it serves as a deterrent and is morally justified in certain cases.\n\nReiman, on the other hand, might be critiquing or analyzing van den Haag's position. If van den Haag's argument leads to a particular conclusion according to Reiman, it would likely be one that aligns with van den Haag's views on the death penalty.\n\nConsidering this, the most plausible conclusion based on van den Haag's argument would be one that supports the death penalty rather than opposes it. Therefore, options A and B can be ruled out because they suggest refraining from or refusing to impose the death penalty.\n\nOption C, \"We should institute death by torture,\" seems extreme and unlikely to be a direct conclusion drawn from van den Haag's argument, especially since van den Haag did not advocate for torture.\n\nThis leaves us with Option D, \"Murder is wrong.\" While this statement is true and could be part of the broader moral framework within which van den Haag operates, it does not directly address the specific argument about the death penalty.\n\nHowever, given the context and the nature of van den Haag's arguments, the most fitting conclusion that aligns with his views on the death penalty would be one that supports its use. Since none of the options directly state this, the closest relevant option is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Murder is wrong.**"
