This means that only the mother's mitochondria contribute to the offspring's mitochondrial DNA, while the father's mitochondria do not contribute.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- If the affected male has MERRF due to a mutation in his mtDNA, he cannot pass this mutation to his offspring because paternal mitochondria are not inherited.\n- The normal female does not have the mutation in her mtDNA, so she also cannot pass it on to her offspring.\n\nTherefore, none of the offspring will inherit the mutation responsible for MERRF from either parent.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected"
