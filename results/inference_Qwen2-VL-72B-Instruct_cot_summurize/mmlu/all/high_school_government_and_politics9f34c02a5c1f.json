Fiscal federalism\n\nFiscal federalism refers to the financial relationships and interactions between different levels of government, such as the federal, state, and local governments. When the federal government provides most of the funding for a project that involves multiple levels of government working together, it exemplifies fiscal federalism. This principle involves the allocation of funds and responsibilities among these governmental levels to achieve common goals or objectives."
