The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.\n\nDental plaque tends to accumulate more on surfaces that are harder to reach during brushing, such as the buccal (cheek side) surfaces of the upper molars and the lingual (tongue side) surfaces of the lower incisors. These areas can be challenging to clean thoroughly, especially for individuals with poor oral hygiene practices."
