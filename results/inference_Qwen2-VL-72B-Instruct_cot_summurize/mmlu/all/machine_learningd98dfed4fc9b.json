The objective function in logistic regression is convex, meaning it has no local optima other than the global optimum. Therefore, when maximizing the likelihood of a logistic regression model, there will be only one global optimum and no local optima.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** This statement is false.\n\n### Statement 2: No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known.\nNaive Bayes classifiers assume that features are conditionally independent given the class label. If this assumption holds true and the distribution of the data is known, then the Naive Bayes classifier can achieve optimal performance. However, if the conditional independence assumption does not hold, other classifiers might perform better even if the data distribution is known. For example, more complex models like decision trees or support vector machines could potentially outperform Naive Bayes under such conditions.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** This statement is false.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
