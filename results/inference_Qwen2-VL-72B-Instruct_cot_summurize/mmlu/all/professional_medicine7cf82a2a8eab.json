The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade.

The white lesions in the mouth that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade are indicative of oral thrush, which is caused by an overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans. Nystatin is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat oral thrush in infants. Acyclovir and valacyclovir are antiviral medications used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex virus, and fluconazole is another antifungal medication that can also be used to treat oral thrush, but it is generally reserved for more severe cases or for patients who do not respond to nystatin."
