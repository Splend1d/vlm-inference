Decrease Increase\n\nIssuing additional capital stock for cash increases the company's equity and total assets, which can lead to a decrease in the total debt-to-total assets ratio because the denominator (total assets) increases while the numerator (total debt) remains unchanged. This results in a lower ratio.\n\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. Issuing capital stock for cash increases current assets (since cash is received), which leads to an increase in working capital, assuming current liabilities remain constant."
