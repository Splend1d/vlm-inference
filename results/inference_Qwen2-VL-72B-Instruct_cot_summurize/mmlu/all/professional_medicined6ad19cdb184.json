She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Exercise and weight reduction program\nB. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations\nC. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations\nD. Captopril therapy\n"

Exercise and weight reduction program\n\nGiven the patient's elevated blood pressure readings over multiple visits, her high weight percentile, and the absence of other significant findings or abnormalities, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate an exercise and weight reduction program. This approach addresses the potential underlying issue of obesity, which can contribute to hypertension in adolescents. Lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity and dietary changes aimed at achieving a healthy weight, are often recommended as first-line interventions before considering pharmacological treatment or further invasive diagnostic tests."
