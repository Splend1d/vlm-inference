Pleasure can be fleeting and may not lead to long-term satisfaction.\n\nB. **Pursue happiness**: This option seems redundant since the question itself is about pursuing happiness. It doesn't provide any insight into Feinberg's specific approach or philosophy.\n\nC. **Forget about happiness**: This could imply that focusing too much on happiness might hinder its attainment. Feinberg might suggest that happiness is a byproduct of living a fulfilling life rather than something to be directly pursued.\n\nD. **None of the above**: This option suggests that Feinberg has a different perspective that isn't captured by the other choices.\n\nGiven these considerations, Feinberg's view might align more closely with the idea that happiness should not be directly pursued but rather emerges from living a meaningful and fulfilling life. Therefore, the most fitting answer would be:\n\n**C. Forget about happiness.**"
