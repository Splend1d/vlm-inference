Discrete\n\nThe price of a house is best described as a discrete number because it represents a specific, countable value that can be measured in whole units (e.g., dollars). Discrete numbers are typically used to represent quantities that cannot be divided into smaller parts, such as the number of houses or the price of a single house."
