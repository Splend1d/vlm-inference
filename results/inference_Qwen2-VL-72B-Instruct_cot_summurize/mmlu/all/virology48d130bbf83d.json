To search for drug resistant mutants\n\nNGS has revolutionized the field of genomics by enabling rapid and cost-effective sequencing of entire genomes, transcriptomes, and other types of nucleic acid samples. It is widely used in various applications, including identifying genetic variations associated with drug resistance in pathogens, which is crucial for developing effective treatments and monitoring the spread of resistant strains."
