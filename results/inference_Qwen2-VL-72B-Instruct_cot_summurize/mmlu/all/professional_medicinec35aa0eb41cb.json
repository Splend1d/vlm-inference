He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?\n\nA. Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)\nD. Normal development\n"

Normal development\n\nThis scenario describes gynecomastia, which is a common condition characterized by benign enlargement of the male breast(s). In adolescents, it is often due to normal hormonal changes during puberty. The presence of bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex, along with normal pubertal development and serum hormone levels, suggests that this is a case of physiologic gynecomastia, which is a normal variant of development rather than a pathological condition."
