The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\n\nHere's why: \n\nIn Susan's letter to Bobby, she expressed a desire to sell her antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000 and invited Bobby to contact her if he was interested. This type of communication is typically considered an invitation to negotiate rather than a formal offer. An offer must contain specific terms that can be accepted without modification to form a binding contract. Since Susan did not specify a precise price or other terms, her letter did not constitute a formal offer.\n\nTherefore, Bobby's response with an offer to pay exactly $20,000 does not create a binding contract because there was no valid offer from Susan to accept. Consequently, Susan was free to sell the car to Harriet Higherprice at a higher price without breaching any contract with Bobby."
