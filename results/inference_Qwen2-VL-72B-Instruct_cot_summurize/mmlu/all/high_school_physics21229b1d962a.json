If the string length is not a multiple of \\(\\lambda/2\\), standing waves cannot form.\n\nB. **The wave speed on the string is fixed.**\n   - While it is true that the wave speed on the string is fixed (determined by the tension and linear mass density), this fact alone does not explain why standing waves do not form at 60 Hz.\n\nC. **60 Hz is in the lowest range of audible sound.**\n   - This statement is irrelevant to the formation of standing waves. The audibility of the sound has no direct impact on whether standing waves can form on the string.\n\nD. **The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is equal to the speed of waves on the string divided by 60 Hz.**\n   - This statement describes the relationship between wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)), wave speed (\\(v\\)), and frequency (\\(f\\)) given by \\(v = f\\lambda\\). However, it does not address why standing waves do not form at 60 Hz.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct explanation is:\n\n**A. The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.**\n\nThis is because standing waves require specific conditions where the string length matches an integer multiple of half the wavelength. If the string length does not meet this condition, standing waves will not form, regardless of the frequency."
