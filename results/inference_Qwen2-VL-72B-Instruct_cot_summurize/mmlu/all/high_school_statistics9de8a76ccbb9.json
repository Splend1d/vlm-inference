                    "text": "To determine the probability of the union \\( P(A \\cup B) \\) under different conditions, we need to consider each scenario separately.\n\n1. **Mutually Exclusive Events:**\n   - When events A and B are mutually exclusive, it means they cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, the probability of their intersection \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is 0.\n   - The formula for the union of two events when they are mutually exclusive is:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( P(A) = 0.3 \\) and \\( P(B) = 0.2 \\):\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Independent Events:**\n   - When events A and B are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. The formula for the union of two independent events is:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( P(A) = 0.3 \\) and \\( P(B) = 0.2 \\):\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - (0.3)(0.2) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44\n     \\]\n\n3. **B is a Subset of A:**\n   - When B is a subset of A, every outcome in B is also an outcome in A. Therefore, the probability of B occurring is included in the probability of A occurring. Hence, the probability of the union \\( P(A \\cup B) \\) is simply the probability of A:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = P(A) = 0.3\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's match these results with the given options:\n\n- Mutually exclusive: 0.5\n- Independent: 0.44\n- B is a subset of A: 0.3\n\nThe correct sequence is: 0.5, 0.44, 0.3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3**"
