Therefore, the quotation that best describes the central thesis of difference feminism is:\n\nC. Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.\n\nThis statement highlights the idea that women tend to focus on the specific contexts and relationships in which they find themselves, while men often rely on more general, abstract principles of justice. This reflects the core belief of difference feminism that women's unique experiences and perspectives should be acknowledged and integrated into broader social and political discussions."
