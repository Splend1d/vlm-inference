The light for the carpenter was green, so the carpenter proceeded to drive through the intersection. A bus entered the intersection from the west and slammed into the carpenter's car. The carpenter was seriously injured in the crash and missed several weeks of work while recovering from the injuries. Which of the following facts or inferences, if true, would be most helpful in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus?\n\nA. The bus driver had received three speeding tickets in the past.\nB. The carpenter's car was in good condition, and it had passed a safety inspection just a week before the accident.\nC. The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.\nD. The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.\n"

It might be relevant in establishing a history of poor driving habits but is not as strong as direct evidence of negligence in this particular case.\n\nB. **The carpenter's car was in good condition, and it had passed a safety inspection just a week before the accident.**\n   - While this shows that the carpenter's vehicle was well-maintained and not the cause of the accident, it does not provide direct evidence against the bus driver\u2019s actions during the accident.\n\nC. **The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.**\n   - This fact is crucial because it rules out any malfunction of the traffic signals as a contributing factor to the accident. If the signals were functioning correctly, it implies that the bus driver must have ignored them, thus indicating negligence on their part.\n\nD. **The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.**\n   - This is significant because it demonstrates that the bus driver was not legally authorized to operate the vehicle. This violation could be used to argue that the bus driver was already acting negligently by being on the road without a proper license.\n\nAmong these options, **Option C** provides the most direct evidence that the bus driver was at fault. Since the traffic signals were functioning properly, it strongly suggests that the bus driver ran the red light, leading to the collision with the carpenter's car.\n\nTherefore, the most helpful fact or inference in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus is:\n\n**C. The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.**"
