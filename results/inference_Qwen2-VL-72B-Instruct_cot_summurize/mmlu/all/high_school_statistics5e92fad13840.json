He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nD. Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis.

For a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, we look up the critical t-value in a t-distribution table or use statistical software.\n\n   The critical t-value for 17 degrees of freedom at a 5% significance level is approximately \u00b12.110.\n\n3. **Compare the calculated t-statistic to the critical t-value:**\n   The calculated t-statistic is \\( t = -1.973 \\).\n\n   Since \\( |t| = |-1.973| = 1.973 \\), which is less than the critical value of 2.110, the t-statistic does not fall in the rejection region.\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\n   Because the calculated t-statistic is less extreme than the critical t-value, we do not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**B. Because t is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.**"
