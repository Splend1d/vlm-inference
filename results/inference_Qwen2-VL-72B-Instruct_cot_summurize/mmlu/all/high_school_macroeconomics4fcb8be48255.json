This is because, with higher prices, people and businesses need more money to make transactions and maintain their purchasing power. The other options listed (recession, higher interest rates, and expected future inflation) may affect the demand for money indirectly or differently:\n\n- A recession generally leads to decreased economic activity, which might reduce the demand for money as there are fewer transactions taking place.\n- Higher interest rates can decrease the demand for money as borrowing becomes more expensive, and people might hold less cash and more interest-bearing assets.\n- Expected future inflation might lead to an increase in the demand for money if people anticipate that prices will rise and want to make purchases before prices go up, but this is not as direct a relationship as the one between the current price level and the demand for money."
