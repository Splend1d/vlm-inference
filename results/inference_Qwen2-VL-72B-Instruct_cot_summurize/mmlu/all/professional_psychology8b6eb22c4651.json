This stage indicates that the therapist has developed a more sophisticated understanding of their own racial identity and its impact on their interactions with others, including those from different racial backgrounds. They are able to integrate this awareness into their therapeutic practice, which can enhance their ability to provide culturally sensitive and effective therapy."
