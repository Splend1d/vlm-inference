Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.\nB. Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.\nC. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\nD. Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.\n"

Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\n\nIn economic theory, information is crucial for making informed decisions. Actors (individuals or organizations) use the information they have to make choices that they believe will maximize their utility or benefit. The availability and quality of information can significantly influence the outcomes of these decisions. Therefore, having access to accurate and timely information is essential for making rational and effective economic decisions."
