The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Nefazodone\nB. Nortriptyline\nC. Phenelzine\nD. Sertraline\n"

IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural or biochemical abnormalities.\n\nAmong the options provided, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for IBS would be:\n\nD. Sertraline\n\nSertraline is an antidepressant medication that belongs to the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It can help alleviate some of the symptoms of IBS, particularly those related to anxiety and depression, which are common comorbid conditions in patients with IBS. SSRIs may also have a beneficial effect on gut motility and visceral sensitivity.\n\nNefazodone (A) is another antidepressant but is less commonly used due to its side effect profile.\nNortriptyline (B) is a tricyclic antidepressant that might be used for pain management but is generally not first-line for IBS.\nPhenelzine (C) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant, which is typically reserved for treatment-resistant depression and is not indicated for IBS.\n\nIt's important to note that while sertraline may provide some relief, the management of IBS often involves a multimodal approach including dietary modifications, stress management, and possibly other medications such as antispasmodics or agents that regulate bowel movements. A healthcare provider should tailor the treatment plan based on the individual patient's needs and response to therapy."
