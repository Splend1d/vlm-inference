By taking control and driving instead, the main character is acting responsibly and ethically.\n- This action is generally considered morally right because it prioritizes safety and prevents potential harm.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I played fetch with my dog at the nuclear power plant.\"\n- Playing fetch with a dog at a nuclear power plant can be dangerous due to potential radiation exposure and other hazards associated with such facilities.\n- This action is generally considered morally wrong because it exposes both the person and the dog to unnecessary risks and disregards safety protocols typically in place around nuclear power plants.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
