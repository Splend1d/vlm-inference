                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. The relationship between temperature and kinetic energy for an ideal gas can be described by the equation \\( KE = \\frac{3}{2} kT \\), where \\( KE \\) is the average kinetic energy per molecule, \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the initial temperature is 50 \u00b0C (or 323 K) and the final temperature is 100 \u00b0C (or 373 K), we can see that the temperature has doubled from the initial value when considering the ratio of the temperatures in Kelvin.\n\nSince the kinetic energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature, doubling the temperature will double the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Therefore, the correct statement is that their kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2."
