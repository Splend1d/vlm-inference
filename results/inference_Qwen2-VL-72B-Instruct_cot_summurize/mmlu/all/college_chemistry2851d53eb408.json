In this case, the resonant frequency is in the X-band, which typically ranges from 8 GHz to 12 GHz. Let's assume a resonant frequency of 9.5 GHz (a common value for X-band EPR cavities) for our calculation.\n\nGiven:\n- Resonant frequency (f) = 9.5 GHz = 9.5 \u00d7 10^9 Hz\n- Bandwidth (\u0394f) = 1.58 MHz = 1.58 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nThe Q-factor is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{f}{\\Delta f} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}}{1.58 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz}} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{9.5}{1.58} \\times 10^{9-6} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 5.994 \\times 10^3 \\]\n\n\\[ Q \\approx 6000 \\]\n\nSo, the closest option to our calculated Q-factor is:\n\nD.
