According to this view, an individual's actions are determined by their desires, beliefs, and circumstances, but they still have free will because they act according to those desires and beliefs. For a soft determinist, saying \"you could have done otherwise\" implies that if your desires or circumstances had been different, you would have made a different choice. This perspective acknowledges the role of desires in decision-making while maintaining that individuals are not completely constrained by them."
