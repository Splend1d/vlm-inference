Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not appear to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Using one's intelligence to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT (Human Intelligence Task) is generally considered acceptable and ethical. The tasks on Mechanical Turk are designed to be completed by humans, and using one's intelligence to do so is part of fulfilling the task requirements.\n\nScenario 2: Taking photos at an art gallery is also typically not considered morally wrong. Many art galleries allow photography for personal use, although some may have restrictions on commercial use or flash photography. Assuming that the individual is following the gallery's rules and policies, there is no inherent moral issue with taking photos.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves an action that would be considered clearly morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
