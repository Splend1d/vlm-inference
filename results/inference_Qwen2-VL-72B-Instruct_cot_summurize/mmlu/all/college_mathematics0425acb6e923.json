This does not necessarily imply that \\( P \\) has an inverse because it could be the case that \\( P \\) is a projection matrix onto a subspace of \\( V \\), which is not invertible unless it is the identity matrix.\n   - Therefore, \\( P \\) being invertible is not guaranteed.\n\n2. **Diagonalizability (Statement II)**:\n   - A matrix \\( P \\) is diagonalizable if it can be expressed as \\( P = Q D Q^{-1} \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix and \\( Q \\) is an invertible matrix.\n   - For \\( P^2 = P \\), the characteristic polynomial of \\( P \\) is \\( \\lambda^2 - \\lambda = 0 \\), which factors into \\( \\lambda(\\lambda - 1) = 0 \\). The eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are thus 0 and 1.\n   - Since the eigenvalues are distinct and real, \\( P \\) is diagonalizable by the spectral theorem for real matrices.\n   - Therefore, \\( P \\) is diagonalizable.\n\n3. **Identity or Zero Transformation (Statement III)**:\n   - Statement III claims that \\( P \\) must be either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\n   - While these transformations satisfy \\( P^2 = P \\), they are not the only possibilities. Any projection matrix also satisfies this property.\n   - Therefore, \\( P \\) does not have to be the identity or zero transformation.\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n\n- Statement I is false.\n- Statement II is true.\n- Statement III is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
