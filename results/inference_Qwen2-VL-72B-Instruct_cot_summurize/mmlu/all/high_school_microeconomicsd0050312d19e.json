Oligopolies can often earn supernormal profits due to their market power.\n\nB. **No opportunities for collusive behavior**: This is incorrect. Oligopolies typically involve a small number of firms, which creates opportunities for collusion or tacit agreements to maintain prices and limit competition.\n\nC. **Significant barriers to entry**: This is correct. One of the key characteristics of an oligopoly is that there are significant barriers to entry, such as economies of scale, patents, or control over resources, which prevent new firms from easily entering the market.\n\nD. **Price-taking behavior**: This is incorrect. Price-taking behavior is typical of perfectly competitive markets where individual firms have no control over the market price. In contrast, oligopolistic firms often have some degree of market power and can influence prices.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. significant barriers to entry."
