The colonic microbiome may be changed with the consumption of oligosaccharides.\n\nOligosaccharides are complex carbohydrates that are not fully digested in the small intestine and reach the colon where they can be fermented by the gut bacteria. This fermentation process can lead to changes in the composition and activity of the colonic microbiome, which can have beneficial effects on health.\n\nWhile the colonic microbiome is established after birth and not present in babies in utero (answer A is incorrect), it has been suggested that alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the development of eosinophilic esophagitis (answer B is incorrect). However, this is still an area of active research and the exact role of the microbiome in this condition is not yet fully understood.\n\nProbiotic supplementation can also change the composition of the colonic microbiome (answer C is partially correct), but the extent and duration of these changes can vary depending on the specific probiotic strain and dosage used, as well as individual factors such as diet and genetics."
