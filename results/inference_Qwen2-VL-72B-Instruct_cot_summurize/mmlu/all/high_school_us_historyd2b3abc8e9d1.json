I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nThe theme of Beveridge's speech can most directly be compared to which of the following?\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Containment\nC. Manifest Destiny\nD. The ideology of states' rights\n"

                    "text": "C. Manifest Destiny\n\nThe theme of Albert Beveridge's speech, \"The March of the Flag,\" can most directly be compared to Manifest Destiny. Beveridge's speech advocates for the expansion of American territory and influence, emphasizing the belief that it is the destiny of the United States to expand its borders and spread its values and governance. This aligns with the concept of Manifest Destiny, which was a widely held belief in the 19th century that the United States was destined to expand across North America.\n\nHere's why the other options are not as fitting:\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine: While the Monroe Doctrine also pertains to American foreign policy, it focuses on preventing European intervention in the Americas rather than promoting territorial expansion.\n\nB. Containment: Containment is a Cold War-era strategy aimed at preventing the spread of communism, which is not the focus of Beveridge's speech.\n\nD. The ideology of states' rights: This refers to the belief in the sovereignty of individual states within the United States, which is not the central theme of Beveridge's argument for territorial expansion."
