Convicted, because any death that is a natural and probable consequence of a felony is first degree murder.\n\nIn legal terms, this scenario falls under the \"felony murder rule,\" which states that if someone dies during the commission of a felony (such as armed robbery), the person committing the felony can be charged with first-degree murder even if they did not intend to kill anyone. The accidental discharge of the gun during the commission of the armed robbery led to the death of a customer, making it a natural and probable consequence of the felony, thus supporting a charge of first-degree murder."
