The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n\nIn a products liability case involving strict liability, the focus is on the condition of the product itself rather than the conduct of the manufacturer or seller. However, misuse of the product can be a defense if the plaintiff's actions were unreasonable and contributed to the injury. In this scenario, since the consumer ignored the prominent notice and used the lawn mower on a steep hill despite the warning, the court may consider this misuse of the product. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment could be granted based on the consumer's failure to heed the warning, which constitutes misuse of the product."
