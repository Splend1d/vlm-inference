Defamation occurs when someone makes a false statement that damages another person's reputation. To successfully defend against a defamation claim, the professor must prove that his statement was true.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class.**\n   - This directly relates to the specific accusation made by the professor. If the professor can prove that the graduate cheated on the entertainment law exam, it would support the truthfulness of his statement.\n\nB. **another professor told him that the graduate had cheated on an admiralty law final examination.**\n   - This involves hearsay (secondhand information) rather than direct evidence of the graduate's cheating in the entertainment law class. While it might be relevant to the graduate's overall character, it does not directly substantiate the professor's specific claim about the entertainment law exam.\n\nC. **the findings of the law school indicated that the graduate had submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief.**\n   - This involves a different form of academic dishonesty (plagiarism) rather than cheating on an exam. While it speaks to the graduate's integrity, it does not directly support the professor's claim about cheating in the entertainment law class.\n\nD. **the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations.**\n   - This is based on hearsay and subjective opinions of others. It does not provide concrete evidence of the graduate's actual behavior in the entertainment law class.\n\nGiven these analyses, the professor should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows:\n\n**D. the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations.**\n\nThis is because it relies on hearsay and subjective opinions rather than direct evidence of the graduate's actions in the specific context of the entertainment law class."
