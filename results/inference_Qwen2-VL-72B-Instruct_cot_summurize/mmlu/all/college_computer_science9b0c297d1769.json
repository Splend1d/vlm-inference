For an 8-bit system, the range is from -128 (10000000) to 127 (01111111).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 11111111 (-1) + 00000001 (1)\n- Adding these results in 00000000 (0), which is within the valid range and does not cause an overflow.\n\nB. 00000001 (1) + 10000000 (-128)\n- Adding these results in 10000001 (-127), which is within the valid range and does not cause an overflow.\n\nC. 11111111 (-1) + 10000001 (-127)\n- Adding these results in 100000000 (-128), which is outside the valid range and causes an overflow.\n\nD. 10000001 (-127) + 10101010 (-86)\n- Adding these results in 11110011 (-213), which is within the valid range and does not cause an overflow.\n\nTherefore, the pair that will result in overflow when added is C."
