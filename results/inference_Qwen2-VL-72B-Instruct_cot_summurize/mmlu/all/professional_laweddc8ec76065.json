If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD.

The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nWhen the woman sent a fax stating she would only pay $800, she made a counter offer, which legally terminates her power to accept the original offer at the original terms. Once a counter offer is made, the original offeror (in this case, the man) can either accept the new terms or reject them. When the man rejected the woman's counter offer, he did not revive the original offer; instead, he left both parties without an enforceable agreement. Therefore, when the woman later tried to accept the original offer by telephone, she could no longer do so because the original offer had already been superseded by her own counter offer."
