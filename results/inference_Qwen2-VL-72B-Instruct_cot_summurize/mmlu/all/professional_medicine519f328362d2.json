All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?\n\nA. Amputation\nB. Application of topical collagenase\nC. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen\n"

Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\n\nDebridement involves the removal of dead or damaged tissue from the affected area, which can help prevent infection and promote healing. In this case, the patient has developed cellulitis in the midfoot, which is an infection of the skin and underlying tissues. Debridement can help remove any necrotic (dead) tissue that may be contributing to the infection and allow for better healing.\n\nWhile amputation (option A) might be considered in severe cases where there is extensive tissue damage or infection that cannot be controlled, it is not the first-line treatment in this scenario. Topical collagenase (option B) is used to break down necrotic tissue but is typically applied after debridement has been performed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (option D) can be beneficial in certain cases of frostbite to improve tissue oxygenation and reduce inflammation, but it is not the primary treatment for cellulitis.\n\nTherefore, debridement of necrotic skin over the toes is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's condition."
