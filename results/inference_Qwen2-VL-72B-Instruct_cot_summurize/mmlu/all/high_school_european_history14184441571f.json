This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran ideas, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.**\n   - This statement reflects Calvinist beliefs about the relationship between church and state, particularly in places like Geneva where Calvin had significant influence. However, this is more about governance rather than core theological differences.\n\nB. **Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.**\n   - This is incorrect because both Calvinists and Lutherans rejected the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. Calvinists held to a view closer to memorialism or spiritual presence, while Lutherans held to consubstantiation.\n\nC. **Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.**\n   - This statement is true regarding the historical context of Lutheranism, particularly in Germany, but it doesn't directly address a theological contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans.\n\nD. **Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.**\n   - This is a significant theological difference. Lutherans retained all seven sacraments (baptism, Eucharist, penance, confirmation, marriage, holy orders, and anointing of the sick), whereas Calvinists typically recognized only baptism and the Lord's Supper (Eucharist).\n\nGiven these analyses, the biggest contrast between Calvinist and Lutheran ideas is related to their views on the number of sacraments they recognize.\n\n**Final answer: D. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.**"
