By limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold.\n\nTo effectively disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability, the disclaimer must be clear, conspicuous, and specific. Options A, B, and C all meet these criteria by explicitly stating that there is no implied warranty or by using the phrase \"as is,\" which is commonly understood to mean that the buyer accepts the product in its current condition without any warranties. However, option D does not effectively disclaim the implied warranty because it merely limits the amount to the value of the vehicle sold, rather than clearly and conspicuously stating that there is no implied warranty of merchantability."
