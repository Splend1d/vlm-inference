Since the ratio of the concentration of the weak acid to its conjugate base remains the same, the pH of the buffer solution will not change significantly. The buffer capacity, however, will be reduced because the ability of the buffer to resist changes in pH will be diminished due to the lower overall concentration of the buffering components."
