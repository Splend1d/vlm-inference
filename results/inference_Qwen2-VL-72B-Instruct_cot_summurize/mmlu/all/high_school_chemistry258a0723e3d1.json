It is particularly useful for identifying isotopes, which are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and thus different atomic masses). By analyzing the mass spectrum, one can determine the relative abundance of different isotopes of an element. While mass spectrometry can provide information related to other options listed (such as oxidation states in certain contexts), its primary utility in this context is for confirming the existence and abundance of isotopes."
