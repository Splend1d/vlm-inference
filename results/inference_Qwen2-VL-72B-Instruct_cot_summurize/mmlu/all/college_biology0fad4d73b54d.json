In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\n\nThis statement is correct because in the relaxed state of a muscle fiber, tropomyosin molecules are positioned such that they block the active sites on actin filaments, preventing myosin heads from binding to these sites. This inhibition is relieved during muscle contraction when calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the active sites, allowing myosin to bind and initiate the contraction process."
