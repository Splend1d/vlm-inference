(S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\n\nWe need to check if the sum of any two elements in \\( S \\) is also in \\( S \\). Let's consider all possible sums:\n\n- \\( 0 + 0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0 + 2 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 0 + 4 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 0 + 6 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 0 + 8 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 8 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 4 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 6 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 4 + 8 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 6 + 6 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 6 + 8 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 8 + 8 = 6 \\)\n\nAll sums are in \\( S \\), so \\( S \\) is closed under addition modulo 10.\n\n### B. (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nWe need to check if the product of any two elements in \\( S \\) is also in \\( S \\). Let's consider all possible products:\n\n- \\( 0 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 4 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 6 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 8 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 6 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 8 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 4 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 6 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 8 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times 6 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times 8 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 8 = 4 \\)\n\nAll products are in \\( S \\), so \\( S \\) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\n\n### C. (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\n\nThe identity element under addition modulo 10 is 0. Since 0 is in \\( S \\), \\( S \\) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\n\n### D. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nThe identity element under multiplication modulo 10 is 1. However, 1 is not in \\( S \\). Therefore, \\( S \\) does not have an identity under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nAfter analyzing all the statements, we conclude that:\n\n**Statement D is false.**"
