A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles\n\nWhen there is a decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles, it means fewer foreign buyers are willing to purchase these goods. This reduction in demand leads to a decrease in the demand for Mexican pesos, as fewer foreign buyers need to exchange their currency for pesos to buy Mexican products. Consequently, the demand curve for the Mexican peso shifts to the left.\n\nLet's briefly analyze why the other options do not cause a leftward shift in the demand curve:\n\nA. Speculation that the peso will increase in value: If people speculate that the peso will appreciate, they are more likely to buy pesos now before the expected appreciation occurs. This increases the demand for pesos, shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nB. An increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries: Higher interest rates in Mexico make it more attractive for investors to hold pesos, increasing the demand for pesos and shifting the demand curve to the right.\n\nC. A lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries: Lower inflation makes Mexican goods relatively cheaper compared to goods from countries with higher inflation. This increases the demand for Mexican goods and, consequently, the demand for pesos, shifting the demand curve to the right."
