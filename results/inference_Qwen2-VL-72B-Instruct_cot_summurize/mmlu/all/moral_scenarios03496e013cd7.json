However, it is not necessarily morally wrong; it could be viewed as a thoughtful gesture that missed the mark due to a lack of consideration for her health goals.\n- It is more about poor judgment rather than a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case I needed to discipline the students.\"\n- Bringing a gun into a classroom for disciplinary purposes is highly controversial and generally considered inappropriate and dangerous.\n- The presence of firearms in educational settings raises significant safety concerns and is widely regarded as morally wrong due to the potential harm it poses to students and staff.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong but shows poor judgment.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to the danger it poses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
