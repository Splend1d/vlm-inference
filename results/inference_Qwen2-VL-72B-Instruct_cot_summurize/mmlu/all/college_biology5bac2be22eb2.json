The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\nB. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nB. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nExplanation:\nThe gray crescent is a region on the surface of the amphibian egg that contains important developmental signals and factors necessary for proper embryonic development. When the first cleavage plane is manipulated such that the gray crescent is contained within only one of the two resulting blastomeres, this blastomere has the potential to develop into a complete, albeit smaller, embryo because it retains the critical developmental cues. The blastomere without the gray crescent lacks these essential signals and typically fails to develop properly or develops abnormally. Therefore, the blastomere with the gray crescent has the capacity to form a complete embryo, albeit smaller due to the reduced number of cells compared to a normal, unmanipulated embryo."
