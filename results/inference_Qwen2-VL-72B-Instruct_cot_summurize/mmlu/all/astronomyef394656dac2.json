                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between mass, weight, and gravity.\n\n1. **Mass**: The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter it contains and does not change regardless of location or gravitational field.\n   \n   Therefore, the mass of the sand bag remains 5 kg on any planet.\n\n2. **Weight**: Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity and is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight} = \\text{mass} \\times \\text{gravity}\n   \\]\n\n   On Earth, the weight of the sand bag is given as 50 N. The standard gravitational acceleration on Earth (\\( g_{\\text{Earth}} \\)) is approximately \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\). Thus, we can write:\n   \\[\n   50 \\, \\text{N} = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Gravity on the other planet**: The problem states that the planet has half the gravity compared to Earth. Therefore, the gravitational acceleration on this planet (\\( g_{\\text{planet}} \\)) is:\n   \\[\n   g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 4.9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Weight on the other planet**: Using the formula for weight again, but now with the reduced gravity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight}_{\\text{planet}} = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 4.9 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 24.5 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n\nSince the options provided are in whole numbers, we round 24.5 N to the nearest whole number, which is 25 N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Mass 5kg weight 25N**"
