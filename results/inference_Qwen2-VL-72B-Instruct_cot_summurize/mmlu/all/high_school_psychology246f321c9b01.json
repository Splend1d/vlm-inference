If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the significance of studying twins in the field of behavioral genetics. Identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins share 100% of their genetic material, while fraternal ( dizygotic, DZ) twins share only about 50% of their genes, similar to other siblings. Therefore, if a psychological trait is strongly influenced by genetics, identical twins would be more likely to exhibit similarities in that trait compared to fraternal twins or other siblings. This comparison helps researchers understand the extent to which genetic factors contribute to various behaviors and psychological attributes."
