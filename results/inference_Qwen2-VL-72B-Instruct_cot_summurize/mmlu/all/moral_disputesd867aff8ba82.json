He is still confident that the threat of the death penalty at least sometimes prevents murder.\n- This suggests that van den Haag believes the death penalty has some deterrent effect, even if it is not absolute.\n\nB. Criminal law is supposed to protect the innocent over murderers.\n- This implies that the primary purpose of criminal law is to safeguard the lives of non-criminals, which could be seen as a broader justification for the death penalty beyond just deterrence.\n\nC. The severity and finality of the death penalty is appropriate to the seriousness and finality of murder.\n- This indicates that van den Haag believes the death penalty is justified because it matches the gravity of the crime of murder.\n\nGiven these options, it seems that van den Haag might hold multiple views simultaneously. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer would be:\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nThis choice encompasses the belief in the deterrent effect, the protection of the innocent, and the appropriateness of the punishment relative to the crime."
