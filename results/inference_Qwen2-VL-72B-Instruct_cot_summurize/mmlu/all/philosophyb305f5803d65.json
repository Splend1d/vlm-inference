According to Hume, moral distinctions are not derived from reason but from feelings and emotions. Virtue is that which naturally produces a feeling of approval or pleasure in the observer, while vice produces disapproval or displeasure. This perspective places virtue within the realm of subjective experience rather than objective reasoning."
