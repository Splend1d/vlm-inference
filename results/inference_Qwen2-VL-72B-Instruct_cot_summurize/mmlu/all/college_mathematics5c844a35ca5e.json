In this case, the null space of D consists of all polynomials in P whose derivative is the zero polynomial. The only such polynomial is the constant polynomial 0, so the dimension of the null space is 1.\n\nThe range of an operator is the set of all vectors that can be obtained by applying the operator to some vector in the domain. In this case, the range of D consists of all polynomials in P that can be obtained by taking the derivative of some polynomial in P. Since the derivative of a polynomial of degree n is a polynomial of degree n-1, the range of D consists of all polynomials in P of degree less than or equal to 6. Therefore, the dimension of the range is 6.\nTherefore, the answer is A."
