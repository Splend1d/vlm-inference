We'll calculate the probability of each and then use those probabilities to find the expected value.\n\n- The probability of getting a 1 as the larger number is only when both dice show 1, which has a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36} \\).\n- The probability of getting a 2 as the larger number includes the outcomes where both dice show 2 or one shows 2 and the other shows 1. This gives us \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{36} \\).\n- For a 3 as the largest number, we include the outcomes with both showing 3, one showing 3 and the other showing 1 or 2. This gives us \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{36} \\).\n- For a 4 as the largest number, we include the outcomes with both showing 4, one showing 4 and the other showing 1, 2, or 3. This gives us \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{7}{36} \\).\n- For a 5 as the largest number, we include the outcomes with both showing 5, one showing 5 and the other showing 1, 2, 3, or 4. This gives us \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{9}{36} \\).\n- For a 6 as the largest number, we include the outcomes with both showing 6, one showing 6 and the other showing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This gives us \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{11}{36} \\).\n\nNow, we calculate the expected value:\n\n\\[ E = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{36} + 2 \\times \\frac{3}{36} + 3 \\times \\frac{5}{36} + 4 \\times \\frac{7}{36} + 5 \\times \\frac{9}{36} + 6 \\times \\frac{11}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{15}{36} + \\frac{28}{36} + \\frac{45}{36} + \\frac{66}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1+6+15+28+45+66}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{161}{36} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \\(\\frac{161}{36}\\)."
