                    "text": "To find the position \\(x\\) of the body at \\(t = 11\\) seconds, we need to consider two phases of its motion: the first phase with constant speed before \\(t = 1\\) second, and the second phase with constant acceleration after \\(t = 1\\) second.\n\n### Phase 1: Constant Speed (0s to 1s)\n\nThe body moves with a constant speed of \\(24 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) for \\(1\\) second. The distance covered during this phase can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[d_1 = v \\times t\\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the velocity and \\(t\\) is the time. Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[d_1 = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 1 \\, \\text{s} = 24 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nSo, by \\(t = 1\\) second, the body has moved \\(24\\) meters from the origin in the positive \\(x\\) direction.\n\n### Phase 2: Constant Acceleration (1s to 11s)\n\nAfter \\(t = 1\\) second, the body experiences a constant acceleration of \\(-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) (negative because it's in the negative \\(x\\) direction). We need to calculate the displacement during this phase from \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 11\\) seconds, which is \\(10\\) seconds.\n\nThe displacement \\(d_2\\) under constant acceleration can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[d_2 = v_i t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_i\\) is the initial velocity (which is \\(24 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) in this case), \\(a\\) is the acceleration (\\(-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)), and \\(t\\) is the time interval (\\(10\\) seconds).\n\n\\[d_2 = 24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 10 \\, \\text{s} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-6 \\, \\text{m/s}^2) \\times (10 \\, \\text{s})^2\\]\n\n\\[d_2 = 240 \\, \\text{m} - 3 \\times 100 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\n\\[d_2 = 240 \\, \\text{m} - 300 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\n\\[d_2 = -60 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThis means that during the second phase, the body moves \\(60\\) meters back towards the origin due to the acceleration.\n\n### Total Displacement\n\nTo find the total displacement from the origin at \\(t = 11\\) seconds, we add the displacements from both phases:\n\n\\[d_{total} = d_1 + d_2\\]\n\n\\[d_{total} = 24 \\, \\text{m} - 60 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\n\\[d_{total} = -36 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nTherefore, the position \\(x\\) of the body at \\(t = 11\\) seconds is \\(-36\\) meters from the origin, making the correct answer **C. -36m**."
