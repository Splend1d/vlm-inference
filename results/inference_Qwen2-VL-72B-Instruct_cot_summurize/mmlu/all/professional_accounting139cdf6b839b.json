Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\nDuring a review engagement, the accountant does not perform tests of controls or substantive testing as extensive as those performed in an audit. The primary focus is on inquiry, analytical procedures, and obtaining other evidence to provide a moderate level of assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework. Therefore, identifying internal control activities is more aligned with an audit rather than a review engagement."
