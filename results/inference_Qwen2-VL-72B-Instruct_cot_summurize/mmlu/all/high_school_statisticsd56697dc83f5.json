To determine what this shows, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.**\n   - Voluntary response bias occurs when only people with strong opinions (usually those who feel strongly about an issue) choose to respond to a survey. This can lead to results that do not accurately represent the views of the general population. Since the survey was conducted via e-mail and people chose to respond voluntarily, there is indeed a risk of voluntary response bias.\n\nB. **No meaningful conclusion is possible without knowing something more about the characteristics of his listeners.**\n   - While it is true that understanding the demographics and characteristics of the listeners could provide additional context, the primary issue here is the method of data collection (voluntary response). Even with demographic information, the bias from voluntary response remains a significant concern.\n\nC. **The survey would have been more meaningful if he had picked a random sample of the 2500 listeners who responded.**\n   - Picking a random sample from the respondents might help reduce some bias within the responding group, but it doesn't address the core issue of voluntary response bias. The initial selection of respondents is already biased, so randomizing within that biased group doesn't solve the problem.\n\nD. **The survey would have been more meaningful if he had used a control group.**\n   - A control group is typically used in experimental designs to compare outcomes between groups. In this context, a control group wouldn't be applicable since the survey is observational rather than experimental.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**A. The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.**\n\nThis option directly addresses the primary flaw in the survey methodology, which is the reliance on voluntary responses leading to potential bias in the results."
