This is not necessarily true for all abelian groups.

This is also not necessarily true for all abelian groups.

Let's examine the equation:\n\\[ (g \\circ h)^2 = (g \\circ h) \\circ (g \\circ h) \\]\nSince \\( G \\) is abelian, we can rearrange the terms:\n\\[ (g \\circ h) \\circ (g \\circ h) = g \\circ (h \\circ g) \\circ h = g \\circ (g \\circ h) \\circ h \\]\n\\[ = (g \\circ g) \\circ (h \\circ h) = g^2 \\circ h^2 \\]\n\nThus, this property holds for all elements in an abelian group.\n\nD. \\( G \\) is of finite order\n\nThis statement implies that \\( G \\) has a finite number of elements. Being abelian does not imply that \\( G \\) must be finite. There are many infinite abelian groups, such as the integers under addition (\\( \\mathbb{Z}, + \\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( (g \\circ h)^2 = g^2 \\circ h^2 \\) for every \\( g, h \\) in \\( G \\)"
