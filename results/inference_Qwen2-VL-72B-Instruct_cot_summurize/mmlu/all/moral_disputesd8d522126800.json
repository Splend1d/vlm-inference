Sexual objectification occurs.\n- Sexual objectification involves treating someone as an object for sexual pleasure, ignoring their autonomy and humanity. If partners deny each other's humanity, they might be more likely to treat each other as objects rather than as individuals with rights and dignity.\n\nB. Sexual objectification does not occur.\n- This option contradicts the idea that denying humanity could lead to treating someone as an object, which is central to sexual objectification.\n\nC. There is no straightforward answer to the question of whether or not sexual objectification occurs.\n- This option suggests ambiguity, but given the context of denying humanity, it seems clear that such denial could lead to objectification.\n\nD. The context of the relationship will determine whether or not sexual objectification occurred.\n- While context can influence interpretations, the core issue here is the mutual denial of humanity, which inherently suggests a form of objectification.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting answer is:\n\nA. Sexual objectification occurs."
