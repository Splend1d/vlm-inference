Using the z-score formula again, but this time solving for \\( X \\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   For the final exam:\n   \\[\n   z = 1.5, \\quad \\mu = 112 \\text{ points}, \\quad \\sigma = 10 \\text{ points}\n   \\]\n\n   Rearrange the formula to solve for \\( X \\):\n   \\[\n   1.5 = \\frac{(X - 112)}{10}\n   \\]\n\n   Multiply both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   15 = X - 112\n   \\]\n\n   Add 112 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   X = 15 + 112 = 127\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the student's score on the final exam must have been 127 points.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 127 points"
