It suggests that reducing taxes, particularly on businesses and high-income earners, can stimulate investment, increase productivity, and lead to overall economic expansion.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Higher taxes on corporate profits: This would not align with supply-side economics because it would likely discourage business investment and reduce incentives for economic activity.\n\nB. Lower tax rates on interest earned from savings: This could potentially align with supply-side economics as it might encourage saving and investment, although it is more focused on individual savings rather than business investment.\n\nC. Removal of investment tax credits: This would not align with supply-side economics because investment tax credits are designed to incentivize businesses to invest, which is a core principle of supply-side economics.\n\nD. A longer duration of unemployment benefits: This would not align with supply-side economics because it could reduce the incentive for individuals to seek employment quickly, potentially leading to lower labor force participation and reduced economic output.\n\nTherefore, the policy most aligned with supply-side economics would be:\n\nB. Lower tax rates on interest earned from savings."
