                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of exactly two out of four dice showing an even number.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single die. Since there are 20 sides and half of them are even (10 even numbers), the probability of rolling an even number on one die is \\( \\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, we want exactly two of the four dice to show an even number. This is a binomial probability problem where:\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (the number of trials, or dice rolled),\n- \\( k = 2 \\) (the number of successful outcomes, or dice showing an even number),\n- \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\) (the probability of success on a single trial, or rolling an even number),\n- \\( q = 1 - p = \\frac{1}{2} \\) (the probability of failure on a single trial, or rolling an odd number).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is given by:\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k} \\]\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4-2} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\frac{6}{16} \\]\n\\[ P(X = 2) = \\frac{3}{8} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)."
