Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n\nTransition metals typically form ions by losing their outermost s electrons first, which often results in an oxidation state of +2. This is because the s orbitals are higher in energy than the d orbitals and are thus more easily lost during chemical reactions."
