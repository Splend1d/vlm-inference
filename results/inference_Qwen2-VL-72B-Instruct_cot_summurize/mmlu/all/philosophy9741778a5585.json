The external view and the internal view\n\nThese views refer to different perspectives on the source of meaning in life. The external view suggests that meaning is derived from external factors such as societal norms, cultural values, or religious beliefs. On the other hand, the internal view posits that meaning comes from within an individual, through personal experiences, self-reflection, and individual goals.\n\nWhile the other options (B, C, and D) also present different viewpoints on the meaning of life, they do not directly address the fundamental dichotomy between external and internal sources of meaning."
