A positive Babinski reflex is not the same as a normal flexor response. A positive Babinski reflex is an abnormal finding where the big toe extends upward and the other toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stroked. This indicates an upper motor neuron lesion.\n\nB. An extensor plantar response (also known as a positive Babinski sign) indicates an upper motor neuron lesion, not a lower motor neuron lesion.\n\nC. The ankle reflex, also known as the Achilles reflex, has a root value of S1. This means that it involves the first sacral spinal nerve root.\n\nD. The knee reflex, or patellar reflex, has a root value of L3 and L4, not L1 and L2. This reflex involves the third and fourth lumbar spinal nerve roots.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C."
