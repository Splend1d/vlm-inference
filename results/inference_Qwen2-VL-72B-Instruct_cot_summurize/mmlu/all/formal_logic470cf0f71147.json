This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ (\\exists x) [Cx \\land (\\forall y) (Py \\rightarrow Wxy)] \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( (\\exists x) [Cx \\land (\\forall y) (Py \\land Wxy)] \\)\n   - This states that there exists an x which is a CEO and for all y, y is a person and x is wealthier than y. However, this implies that every person must be wealthier than themselves, which is not what we want.\n\nB. \\( (\\exists x) [Cx \\rightarrow (\\forall y) (Py \\rightarrow Wxy)] \\)\n   - This states that if there exists an x which is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This is logically equivalent to saying that if there is a CEO, they are wealthier than everyone, but it doesn't guarantee the existence of such a CEO.\n\nC. \\( (\\exists x) [Cx \\land (\\forall y) (Py \\rightarrow Wxy)] \\)\n   - This states that there exists an x which is a CEO and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This correctly captures the intended meaning.\n\nD. \\( (\\forall x) [Px \\rightarrow (\\exists y) (Cy \\rightarrow Wxy)] \\)\n   - This states that for all x, if x is a person, then there exists a y which is a CEO and x is wealthier than y. This does not capture the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nC. \\( (\\exists x) [Cx \\land (\\forall y) (Py \\rightarrow Wxy)] \\)"
