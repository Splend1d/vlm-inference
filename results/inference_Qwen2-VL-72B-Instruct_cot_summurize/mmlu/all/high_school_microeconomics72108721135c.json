This suggests that for Julia, popsicles are an inferior good. An inferior good is one whose demand decreases as income increases. In contrast, normal goods see their demand increase as income rises. Since Julia buys less of the popsicles when her income goes up, it indicates that popsicles are inferior goods for her."
