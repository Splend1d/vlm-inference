It includes both domestic production and the production by foreign entities operating within those borders but does not include the production by a nation's citizens abroad. \n\nOption C refers to the components that make up GDP, but it is not the definition of GDP itself. GDP is calculated as the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). Depreciation and indirect business taxes are accounted for in the calculation of GDP, but they are not what GDP measures directly."
