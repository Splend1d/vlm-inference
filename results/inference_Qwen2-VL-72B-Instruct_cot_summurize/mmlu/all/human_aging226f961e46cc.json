This could lead to a reduction in the number of medications needed by older adults.\n\nB. **Be able to avoid certain diseases**: Discovering links between diseases might enable better preventive measures or treatments that can help avoid certain diseases altogether. However, this is more speculative and depends on the nature of the links found.\n\nC. **Pay far less for pharmaceuticals**: While finding links between diseases could potentially reduce the need for multiple medications, it does not necessarily mean that the cost of pharmaceuticals would decrease significantly. The cost could still be high if the remaining medications are expensive.\n\nD. **Pick and choose the disease(s) they want**: This option is unrealistic. Diseases are not something people can choose to have or not have based on personal preference.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible outcome is:\n\n**A. Take fewer medications**\n\nThis is because discovering links between diseases could lead to more comprehensive treatments that address multiple conditions simultaneously, thereby reducing the number of medications required."
