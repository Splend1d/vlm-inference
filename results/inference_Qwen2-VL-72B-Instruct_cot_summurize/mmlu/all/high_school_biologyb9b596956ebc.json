Increasing the temperature can either increase or decrease enzyme efficiency depending on whether it is closer to the optimal temperature for that enzyme or if it denatures the enzyme.\n\nB. **Adding an acidic solution to the setup**: The pH level significantly affects enzyme activity. An acidic environment could alter the enzyme's structure and thus its efficiency.\n\nC. **Adding substrate but not enzyme**: Without the enzyme present, there will be no reaction regardless of the amount of substrate. This scenario would not result in any enzymatic activity, hence no change in efficiency.\n\nD. **Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity**: Simply increasing the volume of the container without changing the concentrations of the substrate and enzyme would not affect the enzyme's efficiency. The enzyme-substrate interactions would remain the same as long as their concentrations are unchanged.\n\nGiven this analysis, the protocol that would probably not result in a change in the enzyme's efficiency is:\n\n**D. Placing the substrate and enzyme in a container with double the capacity**"
