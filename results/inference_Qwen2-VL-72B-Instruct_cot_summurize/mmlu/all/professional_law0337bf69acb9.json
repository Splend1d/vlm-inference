He wrote mainly about consumer issues, while acting like a watchdog exposing wrongdoers. He wrote one article about a female preacher with a local church that had no affiliations and only a local blog on the internet. He wrote that she was \"conspiring with the devil\" to figure out \"how to lead people's minds astray\" and to live a nice \"sheltered role of pure moral superiority at the expense of inferiors\" like himself and his readers. He called the woman's fashion Medieval and her hair style was like a bag of \"hot wires ready to electrocute anyone who dares come too close.\" The preacher was not amused, and she filed a defamation action claiming libel per se and demanding damages along with an injunction against the web site. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n"

Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\n\nIn defamation cases, courts often distinguish between statements of fact and opinion. Statements of fact can be proven true or false and are actionable in defamation lawsuits. In contrast, statements of opinion are generally protected under the First Amendment, especially when they pertain to matters of public concern. The defendant's comments about the preacher's fashion and hair style appear to be subjective opinions rather than verifiable facts. Additionally, the phrase \"conspiring with the devil\" might be considered hyperbole or rhetorical flourish rather than a literal accusation. Therefore, the court is likely to view these statements as constitutionally protected opinions, leading to the dismissal of the defamation claim."
