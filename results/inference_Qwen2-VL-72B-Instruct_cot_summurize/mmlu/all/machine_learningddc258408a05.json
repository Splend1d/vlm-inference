Unsupervised learning\n\nThis is an unsupervised learning problem because the goal is to identify patterns or clusters within the data without having predefined labels or outcomes. In supervised learning, you would have labeled data where the algorithm learns to predict the label based on input features. Here, since you're trying to discover hidden structures in the data (clusters of patients), it falls under unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering."
