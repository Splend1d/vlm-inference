Freezing occurs when the temperature of water drops to its freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard conditions.\n\nDecreased atmospheric pressure can lower the boiling point of water, but it does not directly cause boiling or freezing; rather, it affects the temperature at which these phase changes occur. Increased atmospheric pressure can raise the boiling point of water but does not directly cause boiling or freezing either."
