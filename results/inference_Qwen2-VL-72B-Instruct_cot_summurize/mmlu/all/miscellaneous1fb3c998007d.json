Johnson the authority to escalate U.S. military involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. This resolution was based on reports of North Vietnamese attacks on U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin, although the accuracy of these reports has been widely disputed. The resolution effectively granted the president broad powers to conduct military operations in Vietnam, leading to a significant increase in U.S. troop deployments and military engagement in the conflict."
