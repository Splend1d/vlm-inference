                    "text": "The tax burden falls mainly on the consumer when the demand for the good is inelastic and the supply is elastic. This is because when demand is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to changes in price, meaning they will continue to purchase the good even if the price increases due to the tax. On the other hand, when supply is elastic, producers are more responsive to changes in price, meaning they will reduce their production if the price decreases due to the tax. As a result, the burden of the tax falls primarily on the consumer.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: the demand is inelastic and the supply is elastic."
