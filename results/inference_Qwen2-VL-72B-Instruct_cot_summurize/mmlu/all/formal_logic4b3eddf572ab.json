This means that if the patients are not rude, then doctors are helpful. In other words, doctors being helpful is true when patients are not rude.\n\nIn propositional logic, this can be expressed using implication or disjunction:\n- \"Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude\" translates to: \\( H \\) unless \\( R \\), which is equivalent to \\( H \\) if \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nThis can be written as:\n\\[ H \\lor \\neg R \\]\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\( H \\equiv R \\)\n   - This represents a biconditional statement, meaning \\( H \\) and \\( R \\) are both true or both false. This does not match our sentence.\n\nB. \\( H \\cdot R \\)\n   - This represents a conjunction, meaning \\( H \\) and \\( R \\) are both true. This does not match our sentence.\n\nC. \\( H \\lor \\neg R \\)\n   - This represents a disjunction where either \\( H \\) is true or \\( R \\) is false. This matches our sentence.\n\nD. \\( H \\lor R \\)\n   - This represents a disjunction where either \\( H \\) is true or \\( R \\) is true. This does not match our sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence \"Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude\" is:\n\nC. \\( H \\lor \\neg R \\)"
