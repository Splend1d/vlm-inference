                    "text": "To determine whether the new handgun tax will survive a constitutional challenge, we need to consider several factors, including the purpose and effect of the tax.\n\nFirstly, it's important to understand that taxes imposed by Congress must be constitutional under the taxing power granted by Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. This power allows Congress to levy taxes for the general welfare and to raise revenue.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Yes, if Congress could have banned possession of handguns outright.**\n   - This option suggests that the constitutionality of the tax hinges on whether Congress has the authority to ban handgun possession entirely. However, the Supreme Court has ruled in cases like District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that individuals have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Therefore, even if Congress could theoretically ban possession, the tax itself must still meet other constitutional requirements.\n\nB. **Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.**\n   - This option focuses on the intent behind the tax. If the primary purpose of the tax is to generate revenue rather than to regulate or penalize behavior, it is more likely to be considered a legitimate exercise of Congress's taxing power. Courts often look at the stated purpose and practical effects of a tax to determine its constitutionality.\n\nC. **No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.**\n   - This option implies that the tax must produce substantial revenue to be constitutional. However, the amount of revenue generated is not necessarily the deciding factor. The key consideration is the intent and purpose of the tax.\n\nD. **No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.**\n   - This option suggests that if the tax is primarily punitive rather than revenue-generating, it may be unconstitutional. Courts have distinguished between taxes and penalties, with penalties being subject to stricter scrutiny. If the tax is seen as a punitive measure rather than a revenue-raising one, it might fail constitutional muster.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.**\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that taxes are generally constitutional if their primary purpose is to raise revenue rather than to regulate or penalize behavior."
