Mucous cells in the stomach lining secrete mucin, which forms a protective layer over the stomach lining.\n\nB. **Chief cells the hormone gastrin (which stimulates acid secretion)** - This is incorrect. Chief cells do not secrete gastrin. Gastrin is actually secreted by G cells and stimulates acid secretion by parietal cells.\n\nC. **Parietal cells secrete pepsinogen, the inactive precursor of pepsin** - This is incorrect. Parietal cells do not secrete pepsinogen. They secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl). Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells.\n\nD. **G Cells secrete hydrochloric acid** - This is incorrect. G cells do not secrete hydrochloric acid. They secrete gastrin, which stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nA. Mucous cells secrete the glycoprotein mucin"
