This does not match our original sentence.\n\nB. \\( (U \\rightarrow P) \\land B \\)\n   - This means if the university raised tuition, then the president approved, and also the board prevented it. This does not match our original sentence.\n\nC. \\( U \\rightarrow (P \\land \\neg B) \\)\n   - This means if the university raised tuition, then the president approved and the board didn't prevent it. This matches our original sentence.\n\nD. \\( U \\rightarrow (P \\lor \\neg B) \\)\n   - This means if the university raised tuition, then either the president approved or the board didn't prevent it. This does not match our original sentence because it allows for the possibility that only one condition holds, whereas both conditions must hold together.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: \\( U \\rightarrow (P \\land \\neg B) \\)."
