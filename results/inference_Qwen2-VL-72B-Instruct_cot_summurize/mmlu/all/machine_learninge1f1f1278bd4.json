The variance of a Bernoulli random variable \\(B \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Var}(B) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x)) \\]\n\nThus, the derivative of the sigmoid function with respect to \\(x\\) is indeed equal to the variance of the Bernoulli random variable \\(B\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2:\nSetting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 affects the model's bias and variance. Bias refers to systematic errors in the model, while variance refers to how much the predictions vary for different training sets.\n\nWhen bias parameters are set to 0, the model becomes simpler because it no longer has an offset term. This simplification can lead to higher bias because the model might not be able to fit the data as well without the offset. On the other hand, setting biases to 0 reduces the complexity of the model, which typically leads to lower variance because the model is less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: False\n\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**."
