None of the above.\n\nAccording to Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, particularly his categorical imperative, actions must be judged based on whether they can be universalized without contradiction. Kant believed that sexual acts should be expressions of mutual respect and love within the context of marriage. Therefore, he would likely consider masturbation, prostitution, and consensual sexual activity outside of marriage as morally impermissible because they do not align with the principles of mutual respect and the intrinsic value of human beings."
