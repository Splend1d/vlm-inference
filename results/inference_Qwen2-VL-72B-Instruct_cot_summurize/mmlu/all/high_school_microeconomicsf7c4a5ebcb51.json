Marginal cost (MC) intersects average variable cost (AVC) and average total cost (ATC) at their minimum points.\n\nIn microeconomics, the relationship between marginal cost (MC), average variable cost (AVC), and average total cost (ATC) can be visualized on a graph where the x-axis represents quantity produced and the y-axis represents cost per unit. \n\n- **Average Variable Cost (AVC)**: This is the variable cost per unit of output.\n- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**: This includes both fixed and variable costs per unit of output.\n- **Marginal Cost (MC)**: This is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of output.\n\nAt the minimum points of the AVC and ATC curves, the MC curve intersects these curves. This is because the marginal cost reflects the change in total cost as production increases by one unit. When MC is below AVC or ATC, it is pulling down the average costs. Conversely, when MC is above AVC or ATC, it is pushing up the average costs. At the point where MC equals AVC or ATC, the average costs are neither increasing nor decreasing; they are at their lowest possible level for that quantity of output.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\nC. MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points."
