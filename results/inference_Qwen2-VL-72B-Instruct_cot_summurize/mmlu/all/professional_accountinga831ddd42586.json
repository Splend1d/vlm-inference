                    "text": "To determine whether a contract was formed under the Sales Article of the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), we need to analyze the sequence of events and the relevant provisions of the UCC.\n\n1. **Offer**: Jackson mailed Sands an offer to sell 500 electric fans at $10 per fan on day 1. This offer was received by Sands on day 3.\n2. **Revocation**: Jackson mailed a revocation of the offer on day 4, which Sands received on day 6.\n3. **Acceptance**: Sands mailed an acceptance of the original offer on day 7, which Jackson received on day 9.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Offer and Revocation**:\n  - According to the UCC, an offer can be revoked any time before it is accepted unless there is a firm offer exception or a promise not to revoke.\n  - In this case, Jackson's offer included a promise not to revoke the offer. However, the promise did not specify an expiration date.\n\n- **Firm Offer Exception**:\n  - The UCC provides that a merchant's firm offer (an offer made in good faith and supported by consideration) cannot be revoked for a stated period of time or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable period of time.\n  - Since Jackson is a merchant and the offer was made in writing, it qualifies as a firm offer. Without an expiration date, the offer remains open for a reasonable period.\n\n- **Revocation Receipt**:\n  - The revocation was sent on day 4 and received by Sands on day 6. Since Sands received the revocation after the offer was made, the revocation is effective upon receipt.\n  - Therefore, the offer was effectively revoked on day 6 when Sands received it.\n\n- **Acceptance**:\n  - Sands mailed the acceptance on day 7, after receiving the revocation on day 6. Thus, Sands' acceptance was made after the offer had been revoked.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince Sands received the revocation before mailing their acceptance, the acceptance was made after the offer had been revoked. Therefore, no contract was formed.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer."
