Kissing someone you are in a relationship with and attracted to is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character cuts and divides livestock.\n\nThis scenario is less clear without additional context. However, assuming that \"cutting and dividing\" refers to the process of distributing or allocating livestock among different parties, it could be seen as a neutral or even positive action if done fairly and ethically. If the livestock were being mistreated or harmed during this process, it might be considered morally wrong. Without further information, we cannot definitively say this action is morally wrong based solely on the description provided.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is ambiguous but likely not morally wrong based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
