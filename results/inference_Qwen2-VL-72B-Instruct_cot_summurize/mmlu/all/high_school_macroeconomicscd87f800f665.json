This can lead to a decrease in interest rates because there is less demand for borrowing from the government. Lower interest rates can stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money, which can lead to increased spending and investment. However, if this increased spending and investment outpaces the growth in productive capacity, it can result in inflationary pressures. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
