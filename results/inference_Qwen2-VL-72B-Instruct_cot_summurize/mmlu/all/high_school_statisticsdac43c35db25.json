Follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.\n\nThis approach is preferable because it aims to increase the response rate and reduce non-response bias, which can affect the representativeness and reliability of the survey results. By following up with non-respondents, you may be able to obtain more complete data from the original sample, which was randomly selected to reflect the characteristics of the entire graduating class. This method helps ensure that the analysis is based on a more comprehensive and unbiased dataset."
