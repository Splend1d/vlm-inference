Girls physiologically increase their percentage body fat\n\nDuring adolescence, girls typically experience an increase in body fat as part of the normal process of development. This increase in body fat is necessary for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and for preparing the body for potential pregnancy and childbirth later in life. It is important to note that this increase in body fat is a normal physiological change and not necessarily indicative of being overweight or obese."
