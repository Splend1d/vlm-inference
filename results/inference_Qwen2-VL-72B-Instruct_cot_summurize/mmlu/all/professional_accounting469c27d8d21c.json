The correct interpretation should focus on the benefit derived from leverage before accounting for the costs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Benefit from leverage} = \\text{Value of the firm} - \\text{Value if unlevered} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Benefit from leverage} = $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Benefit from leverage} = $220,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $220,000"
