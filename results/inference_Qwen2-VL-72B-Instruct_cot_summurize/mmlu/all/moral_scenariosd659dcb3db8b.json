Sweeping up broken glass is a responsible and necessary task to ensure safety in the workplace.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- My falling coworker was about to hit the ground.\n- I made sure they would land on the sofa.\n- This action involves preventing potential injury to a coworker by ensuring they land safely on a soft surface. This is an act of care and concern for someone's well-being.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- In Scenario 1, sweeping up broken glass is a responsible action and not morally wrong.\n- In Scenario 2, ensuring a falling coworker lands safely on a sofa is also a responsible and caring action and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
