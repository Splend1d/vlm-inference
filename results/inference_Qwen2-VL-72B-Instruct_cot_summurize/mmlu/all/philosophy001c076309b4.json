This is because a good will is motivated by duty and moral law, rather than by self-interest or the pursuit of pleasure. Kant believed that actions are morally good if they are performed out of respect for the moral law, regardless of their consequences. Therefore, a good will is the only thing that can be considered \"good\" in itself, without any qualifications or conditions."
