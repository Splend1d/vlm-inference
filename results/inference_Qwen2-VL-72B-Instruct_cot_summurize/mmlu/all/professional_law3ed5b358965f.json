The retiree and his wife lived in an exquisitely decorated penthouse apartment overlooking a park. One night, the retiree and his wife were returning home from dinner when they were accosted by a man outside their apartment building. The man brandished a gun and told the retiree and his wife to take him to their apartment. Upon entering the apartment, the man blindfolded the retiree and his wife and tied them up with duct tape to chairs in the living room. The man then stole the retiree's wallet and assorted jewelry from the bedroom. After the man exited the apartment, the retiree and his wife tried desperately to free themselves from their constraints. As the retiree was struggling, he suffered a heart attack and died. The man should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary.\nB. robbery and burglary.\nC. robbery and murder.\nD. burglary, robbery, and murder.\n"

In this case, the man entered the apartment with the intent to steal items, which fits the definition of burglary.\n\n2. **Robbery**: Robbery is defined as taking property from another person through force or intimidation. Here, the man used a gun to threaten the retiree and his wife, compelling them to enter their apartment and subsequently stealing items, which constitutes robbery.\n\n3. **Murder**: Murder is the unlawful killing of one human being by another. While the retiree died during the incident, it is important to consider whether the death was a direct result of the man's actions. If the retiree's death was caused by the stress or physical exertion due to being bound and struggling to free himself, the man could potentially be charged with murder if it can be proven that his actions directly led to the death.\n\nGiven these points, the most comprehensive charge would include all three crimes:\n\n**D. burglary, robbery, and murder.**\n\nThis option covers all aspects of the incident: the unlawful entry (burglary), the theft and use of force (robbery), and the resulting death (murder)."
