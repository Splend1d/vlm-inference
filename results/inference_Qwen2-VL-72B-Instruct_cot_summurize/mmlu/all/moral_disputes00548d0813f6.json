However, the statement does not specifically mention coercion as a factor.\n\nB. \"are in general more sexist than other places.\"\n- This option implies that sexism is a significant factor in why certain harms go unnoticed. While sexism could be a contributing factor, it doesn't directly address the core issue of why specific harms are overlooked.\n\nC. \"tend to equate what is legal with what is good or harmless.\"\n- This option suggests that people in the U.S. might overlook certain harms because they assume that if something is legal, it must be good or harmless. This aligns well with the idea that legal status can influence perceptions of harm.\n\nD. \"West actually thinks that people in the U.S. disproportionately recognize these harms.\"\n- This option contradicts the premise of the question, which states that these harms go unnoticed. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. tend to equate what is legal with what is good or harmless."
