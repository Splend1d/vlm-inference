The main character chose not to throw eggs at a car.\n- Throwing eggs at a car is generally considered vandalism and potentially harmful behavior.\n- By choosing not to engage in this behavior, the main character has made a decision that aligns with ordinary moral standards.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I sprayed mace into the violent man.\"\n- This scenario describes an action taken in response to a violent situation.\n- Spraying mace can be seen as a form of self-defense when faced with a violent threat.\n- In many jurisdictions, using non-lethal force for self-defense is considered morally and legally justifiable if there is an imminent threat of harm.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally neutral or positive decision (not doing something harmful).\n- Scenario 2 involves a morally justifiable action (using self-defense against a violent threat).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
