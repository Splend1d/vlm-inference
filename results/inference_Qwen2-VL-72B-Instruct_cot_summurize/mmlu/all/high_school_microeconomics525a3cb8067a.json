Non-excludability means that it is impossible or very costly to prevent people from using the good, even if they do not pay for it. Non-rivalry means that one person's consumption of the good does not reduce the amount available for others. Therefore, pure public goods cannot be divided into discrete units because their consumption by one individual does not diminish the availability for others."
