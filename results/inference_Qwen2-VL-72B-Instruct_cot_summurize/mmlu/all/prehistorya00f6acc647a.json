In primates, the position of the foramen magnum can indicate whether an animal is primarily adapted for quadrupedal (four-legged) locomotion or bipedal (two-legged) locomotion. In quadrupedal primates, the foramen magnum is positioned more towards the back of the skull, allowing for a head posture that is more aligned with the spine when walking on all fours. In bipedal primates, such as humans, the foramen magnum is positioned more towards the bottom center of the skull, which allows for an upright posture when walking on two legs."
