Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\nB. Spontaneous mutations can result in the appearance of new traits.\nC. Only favorable adaptations have survival value.\nD. Disuse of an organ may lead to its eventual disappearance.\n"

Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\n\nThis statement directly addresses the misconception by explaining that the elongation of the giraffe's neck due to stretching (an acquired characteristic) is not heritable. Evolutionary changes occur through genetic variations and natural selection, not through the inheritance of acquired characteristics. This principle was famously refuted by the work of Charles Darwin and others, who showed that traits must be genetically based to be passed on to subsequent generations."
