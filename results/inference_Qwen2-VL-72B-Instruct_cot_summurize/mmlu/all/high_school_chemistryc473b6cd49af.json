Starting at equilibrium, moving particles apart while in the solid or equilibrium phases requires added energy proportional to the attractive forces.\n- This statement is relevant because it explains the energy needed to separate solvent molecules (Step 1) and solute molecules (Step 2).\n\nB. Bringing particles together releases energy in proportion to their attractive forces.\n- This statement is also relevant because it explains the energy released when the solute and solvent come together (Step 3).\n\nC. The total of the energies in steps 1 to 3 indicates if a solution will form.\n- This statement is relevant because the overall energy change (\u0394G) determines whether the solution formation is favorable.\n\nD. Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. While molecular mass can influence solubility, it is not a requirement for forming a solution. Factors such as polarity, intermolecular forces, and temperature play more significant roles.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental principle that is not important in understanding the formation of solutions is:\n\nD. Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions."
