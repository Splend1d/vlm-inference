They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nHow is the \"temporal power\" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?\n\nA. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority\nB. A legal or scholarly authority\nC. A state or secular authority\nD. A business or economic authority\n"

A state or secular authority\n\nIn the context of Martin Luther's Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, the \"temporal power\" refers to the authority of the state or secular government. This is in contrast to the \"spiritual power,\" which refers to the authority of the Church. Luther argues that the Roman Catholic Church has claimed that the spiritual power is superior to the temporal power, thereby insulating itself from reform by secular authorities."
