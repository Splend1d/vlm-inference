                    "text": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3- to 4-week history of swelling of her legs and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight gain. Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia. She has been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1 month ago. She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, and she drinks one to five beers on weekends. She experimented with cocaine briefly 16 years ago, but she has never used intravenous drugs. She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12 years. Today, vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally. Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient?\n\nA. HIV antibody study\nB. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration\nC. Toxicology screening of the urine\nD. Urine protein concentration\n"

                    "text": "The most likely abnormal study in this patient would be:\n\nD. Urine protein concentration\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of leg swelling, weight gain, and physical findings of periorbital edema and pitting edema in the lower extremities, along with a blood pressure reading that suggests hypertension, these could indicate a condition such as nephrotic syndrome or another form of kidney disease. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria (high levels of protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), and edema.\n\nWhile the other options might also be relevant in certain contexts, they are less likely to be directly related to the patient's current presentation:\n\nA. HIV antibody study - There is no indication in the history or examination that suggests a risk factor for HIV infection.\nB. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration - This test is typically used to evaluate heart failure, but there is no evidence of cardiac issues in the patient's examination.\nC. Toxicology screening of the urine - The patient denies recent drug use, and there is no indication of substance abuse in the history or examination.\n\nTherefore, the urine protein concentration is the most likely to be abnormal given the patient's symptoms and physical findings."
