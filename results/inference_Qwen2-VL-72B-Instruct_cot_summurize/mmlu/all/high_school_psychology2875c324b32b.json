The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\n\nWhen a person experiences fear or stress, their body activates the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares them for a \"fight or flight\" response. This includes increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and other physiological changes. When the threat passes or the person feels safe (such as when the child is picked up by her mother), the parasympathetic nervous system takes over to help the body return to a normal, relaxed state. This process involves reversing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, such as slowing the heart rate and stabilizing breathing."
