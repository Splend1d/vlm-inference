The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss.\n\nIn the short run, a profit-maximizing firm will continue to operate as long as its total revenue covers its total variable costs (TR > TVC). This is because shutting down would mean incurring all fixed costs without any offsetting revenue, leading to greater losses. Therefore, the firm operates to minimize losses by covering at least its variable costs."
