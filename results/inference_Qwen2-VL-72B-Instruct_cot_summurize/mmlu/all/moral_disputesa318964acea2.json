This contrasts with retributive theories of punishment, which emphasize that punishment should be proportional to the crime committed and serve as just retribution for the wrong done. Retributive theories are concerned with the moral balance being restored by punishing the offender in accordance with their guilt, whereas consequentialist theories prioritize the practical effects of punishment on society or the individual."
