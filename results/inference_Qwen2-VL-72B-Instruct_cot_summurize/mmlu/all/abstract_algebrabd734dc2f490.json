The order of an abelian group is the product of powers of distinct prime numbers. For \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{45} \\), we have:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, possible orders for subgroups of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{45} \\) are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.\n\nHowever, 10 does not divide 45. Hence, there cannot exist a subgroup of order 10 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{45} \\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is false**.\n\n### Statement 2: A subgroup \\( H \\) of a group \\( G \\) is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of \\( H \\) is equal to the number of right cosets of \\( H \\).\n\nThe definition of a normal subgroup \\( H \\) in a group \\( G \\) is that \\( H \\) is normal if and only if for every element \\( g \\in G \\), the left coset \\( gH \\) equals the right coset \\( Hg \\). This means:\n\\[ gH = Hg \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\]\n\nIn general, the number of left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) (denoted by \\( [G : H]_L \\)) is always equal to the number of right cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) (denoted by \\( [G : H]_R \\)). This equality holds regardless of whether \\( H \\) is normal or not. It is a consequence of the fact that both sets of cosets partition \\( G \\) into disjoint subsets of equal size.\n\nThus, the condition that the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets does not imply that \\( H \\) is normal. Instead, it is always true by the nature of cosets.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is false**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are false. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
