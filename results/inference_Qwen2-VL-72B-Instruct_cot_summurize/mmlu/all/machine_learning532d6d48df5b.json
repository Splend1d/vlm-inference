It calculates precision scores for n-grams of various lengths and then combines these scores into a single score.\n- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) Metric**: This is a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic summarization and machine translation software. It measures overlap between systems' outputs and reference summaries based on n-grams, word sequences, or word pairs.\n\nThe statement suggests that BLEU uses precision and ROUGE uses recall. While it is true that BLEU focuses on precision, ROUGE does not exclusively use recall; it can measure both precision and recall depending on the specific ROUGE variant being used (e.g., ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is partially correct but not entirely accurate as stated.\n\n**Statement 2: Hidden Markov Models were frequently used to model English sentences.**\n\n- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**: These are statistical models where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable (hidden) states. HMMs have been widely used in various applications including speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.\n- **Modeling English Sentences**: In the context of natural language processing, HMMs have indeed been used to model sequences of words in sentences, particularly for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
