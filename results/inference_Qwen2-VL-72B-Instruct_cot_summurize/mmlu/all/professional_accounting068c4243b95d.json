The payback period formula is:\n\nPayback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Cash Inflow\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the initial investment gives us:\n\nInitial Investment = Payback Period * Annual Net Cash Inflow\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nInitial Investment = 5.2 years * $32,000/year\n= $166,400\n\nTherefore, the company paid $166,400 for the new machine.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $166,400."
