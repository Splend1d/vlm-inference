Murder.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Murder**: The defendant provided the gun used by his friend to kill the victim. Even though he did not pull the trigger himself, providing the weapon used in the commission of the murder makes him an accessory to the murder. Additionally, the defendant later fired two more shots into the victim's body, which constitutes murder even if the victim was already dead because it demonstrates intent to kill.\n\n2. **Attempted Murder**: This would apply if there was an attempt to kill someone who survived. However, since the victim died, attempted murder is less serious than actual murder.\n\n3. **Assault with a Deadly Weapon**: While this is a serious charge, it is less severe than murder. It typically involves an attempt or threat to harm someone with a weapon, but does not necessarily result in death.\n\n4. **Concealment of a Deadly Weapon**: This is a lesser offense compared to murder. It involves hiding or attempting to hide a weapon, which is not the primary focus here.\n\nGiven these points, the most serious crime the defendant can be convicted of is murder."
