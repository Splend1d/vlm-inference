Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns. From the patterns, it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep. The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders. Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment?\n\nA. It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind, because human subjects are involved.\nB. This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music.\nC. This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not.\nD. This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.\n"

This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Single-blind Experiment**: In a single-blind experiment, the participants are aware of which treatment they are receiving, but the researchers or the examining doctors may not know which treatment each participant is getting. This helps to reduce bias on the part of the researchers when analyzing the results.\n- **Double-blind Experiment**: In a double-blind experiment, neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving which treatment. This further reduces bias in the study.\n\nGiven the scenario described, where patients are aware of whether they are receiving medication or a blindfold with soft music, it is clear that the experiment cannot be double-blind. However, it can still be single-blind if the examining doctor does not know which treatment each patient is receiving. Therefore, option C accurately describes the nature of the experiment."
