Its electron configuration is \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^2\\). This means that:\n\n- The first two electrons occupy the 1s orbital.\n- The next two electrons occupy the 2s orbital.\n- The last two electrons occupy the 2p orbitals.\n\nIn terms of energy:\n- The 1s orbital has the lowest energy.\n- The 2s orbital has higher energy than the 1s but lower than the 2p.\n- The 2p orbital has the highest energy among these orbitals.\n\nGiven this information, the peak corresponding to the lowest energy would be the one associated with the 1s orbital.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The 1s peak has the lowest energy."
