Attitude toward the behavior: This refers to a person's positive or negative evaluation of performing the behavior.\n\n2. Subjective norms: These are the perceived social pressures to perform or not perform the behavior, based on what others think one should do.\n\n3. Perceived behavioral control: This component reflects a person's belief about their ability to perform the behavior, considering the resources and opportunities available to them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control."
