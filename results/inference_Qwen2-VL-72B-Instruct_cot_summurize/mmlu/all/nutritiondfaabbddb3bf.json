The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.\n\nAdaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its metabolism in response to changes in nutrient intake, including protein. When protein intake is low, the body may become more efficient at utilizing the available protein, which can lead to an underestimation of the true protein requirement when measured through nitrogen balance studies. This is because the studies might not account for this increased efficiency, leading to an underestimate of the actual protein needs."
