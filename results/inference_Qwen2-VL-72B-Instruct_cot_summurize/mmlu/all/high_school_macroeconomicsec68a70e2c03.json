In this case, Bill is an unemployed welder who lives in New York, while there is a strong demand for welders in California. This suggests that Bill's unemployment is due to a geographic mismatch rather than a lack of jobs or a downturn in the economy (which would indicate cyclical unemployment) or a temporary period of job search (which would indicate frictional unemployment). Hidden workers are those who have given up looking for work and are not counted in official unemployment statistics, which does not seem to apply to Bill's situation."
