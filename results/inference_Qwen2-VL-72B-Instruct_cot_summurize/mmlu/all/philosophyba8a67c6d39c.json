For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\n\nA. from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB. since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC. our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD. since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n"

                    "text": "To solve this logic reasoning problem, let's break down the context and analyze each option carefully.\n\nPlato's theory suggests that true knowledge is attained by understanding the Forms or ideals, which are eternal and unchanging, rather than relying on the sensory experiences of the physical world. According to Plato, our knowledge of these Forms is innate, meaning it is present within us from birth and is merely \"recalled\" when we encounter their instances in the physical world.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. \"from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\"\n- This option implies that we gain knowledge through our senses, which contradicts Plato's view that true knowledge comes from understanding the Forms, not sensory experiences.\n\nB. \"since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\"\n- This option also suggests that knowledge comes from sensory experiences, which again contradicts Plato's emphasis on the Forms being the source of true knowledge.\n\nC. \"our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\"\n- While this option aligns somewhat with Plato's idea that true knowledge is of the ideal Forms, it does not directly address the innate nature of this knowledge.\n\nD. \"since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\"\n- This option correctly captures Plato's argument. It states that our certain knowledge cannot come from the changing sensory experiences but must be innate and merely triggered by those experiences. This aligns well with Plato's theory of recollection, where the Forms are already present in the soul and are recalled upon encountering their instances in the physical world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
