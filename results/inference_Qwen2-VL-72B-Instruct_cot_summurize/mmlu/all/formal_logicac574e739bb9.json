However, Option A uses the phrase \"not everything is not at work,\" which is less clear than \"not everything is at work\" used in Option D. Therefore, Option D provides a clearer and more direct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer:** D. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work."
