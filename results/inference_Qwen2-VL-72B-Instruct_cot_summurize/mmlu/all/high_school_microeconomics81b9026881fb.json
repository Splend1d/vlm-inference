However, the direction of the price change depends on the relative magnitude of the shifts in demand and supply. If demand increases more than supply, the price will rise. If supply increases more than demand, the price will fall. If they increase by the same amount, the price may remain unchanged. Therefore, without knowing the relative magnitudes of the shifts, the price change is ambiguous."
