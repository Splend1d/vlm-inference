The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\n\nThis statement is accurate because programs written in high-level programming languages can indeed be compiled or interpreted into binary code that computers can execute directly. However, binary code is difficult for humans to read and understand, whereas high-level programming languages provide a more human-readable syntax, making it easier for programmers to write, debug, and maintain their code."
