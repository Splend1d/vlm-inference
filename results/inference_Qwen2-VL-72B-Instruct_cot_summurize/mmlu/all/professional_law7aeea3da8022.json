S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the lawyer will prevail in a claim against the columnist for invasion of the right to privacy, we need to analyze the elements of the tort of invasion of privacy and consider the specific circumstances described.\n\nThe tort of invasion of privacy typically involves four distinct types: intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, public disclosure of embarrassing private facts, false light, and appropriation of name or likeness. In this scenario, the relevant type is the public disclosure of embarrassing private facts.\n\n1. **Intrusion Upon Seclusion**: The apprentice's action of breaking into the lawyer's private office and copying letters clearly constitutes an unlawful intrusion upon the lawyer's seclusion.\n\n2. **Public Disclosure of Embarrassing Private Facts**: The columnist published excerpts from the material obtained through the apprentice's illegal actions. This act could be considered a public disclosure of embarrassing private facts if those facts were indeed private and not already known to the public.\n\n3. **Truthfulness**: While truthfulness can be a defense in defamation cases (false light), it does not necessarily apply to claims of invasion of privacy based on the public disclosure of private facts. The issue here is not about the veracity of the information but rather the unauthorized access and subsequent publication of private information.\n\n4. **Conspiracy and Direct Involvement**: The columnist did not participate directly in the burglary nor conspired with the apprentice regarding the burglary. However, the columnist's role in publishing the information obtained through illegal means is significant.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the plaintiff will prevail because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts. This is a strong argument since the apprentice's actions were indeed unlawful and the information disclosed was private.\n\n- **Option B** states that the plaintiff will prevail because the publication was not newsworthy. Whether the publication was newsworthy or not is subjective and may not be a decisive factor in determining liability for invasion of privacy.\n\n- **Option C** argues that the plaintiff will not prevail because the information was true. As mentioned earlier, truthfulness is not a defense in invasion of privacy claims related to the public disclosure of private facts.\n\n- **Option D** claims that the plaintiff will not prevail because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice. While the columnist did not commit the burglary, their decision to publish the illegally obtained information is still actionable under invasion of privacy laws.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most compelling reason why the plaintiff will most likely prevail is due to the unlawful nature of the intrusion and the subsequent public disclosure of private facts.\n\n**Final Answer: A. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.**"
