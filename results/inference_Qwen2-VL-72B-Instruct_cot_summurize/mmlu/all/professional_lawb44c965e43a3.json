During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\nB. admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\nC. inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Hearsay Rule**: Generally, hearsay is inadmissible in court unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n2. **Firsthand Knowledge**: The television correspondent has firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement because she was present at the campaign speech and heard the statement directly. This means her testimony is not hearsay but rather direct evidence of what she observed.\n\n3. **Business Records Exception**: While the correspondent did record the statement in her notebook, which could potentially fall under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, the primary reason her testimony is admissible here is because she has firsthand knowledge of the event.\n\n4. **Best Evidence Rule**: The best evidence rule applies to situations where the original document or recording is required to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph. However, this rule does not apply to the situation where the witness is testifying about what they heard directly.\n\nTherefore, the television correspondent's testimony is admissible because she had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement, making option B the correct choice."
