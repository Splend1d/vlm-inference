Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results\n\nThis activity is the most effective for introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water because it provides a clear and observable demonstration of the process. When celery stalks are placed in water colored with a dye, the dye moves up through the xylem (the plant's water-conducting tissue), allowing children to see the movement of water within the plant. This hands-on experience helps young learners visualize and understand the concept of water transport in plants more easily than abstract explanations or less direct observations."
