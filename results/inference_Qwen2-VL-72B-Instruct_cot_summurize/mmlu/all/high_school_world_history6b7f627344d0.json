The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nThe instructions indicated in the fourth paragraph to remain nonviolent most likely inspired which of the following historical developments?\n\nA. The Zionist movement that created the modern state of Israel\nB. The independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule\nC. The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States\nD. The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba\n"

The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States\n\nGandhi's philosophy of nonviolence had a profound impact on various civil rights movements around the world, including those in the United States. Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. were inspired by Gandhi's methods and applied them to their own struggles for racial equality and justice."
