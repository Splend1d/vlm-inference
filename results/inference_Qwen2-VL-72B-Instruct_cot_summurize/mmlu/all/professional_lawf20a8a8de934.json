Their contract provided that the artist would paint a full-color portrait of the man, to be delivered by November 1, in exchange for $15,000. A contractual provision recited that the artist \"guarantees that the quality of the portrait will be fully satisfactory. \"The artist finished the portrait and presented it to the man on November 2. The man looked at the portrait and said, \"This is awful! I really expected better. I'm not paying for this!\" The artist was enraged by the man's reaction, as he felt the finished portrait was one of his best works. Which of the following arguments would be LEAST helpful to the artist in his efforts to recover on a breach of contract theory?\n\nA. The man's dissatisfaction with the quality of the portrait was not genuine.\nB. The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.\nC. The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.\nD. Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.\n"

If proven, this could undermine the man's claim and support the artist's case.\n\nB. **The man failed to make an adequate examination of the quality of the portrait.**\n   - This argument implies that the man did not properly assess the quality before rejecting the portrait. If true, it could suggest that the man's rejection was premature or unreasonable, supporting the artist's position.\n\nC. **The man's dissatisfaction with the portrait was the result of delivery after November 1, rather than of any lack of quality in the portrait.**\n   - This argument shifts the focus from the quality of the portrait to the timing of its delivery. It suggests that the man's dissatisfaction is due to the late delivery rather than the actual quality, which could help the artist argue that the quality issue is not valid.\n\nD. **Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.**\n   - This argument actually undermines the artist's position. It admits that the artist had a reason (hand injury) that prevented him from delivering a satisfactory product, which could justify the man's dissatisfaction and refusal to pay.\n\nGiven these analyses, the argument that would be least helpful to the artist is:\n\n**D. Because of a recent hand injury, the artist did not have sufficient time to produce a portrait of a quality satisfactory to the man.**\n\nThis argument essentially concedes that the quality of the portrait might indeed be unsatisfactory due to the artist's circumstances, thereby weakening the artist's case for recovery on a breach of contract theory."
