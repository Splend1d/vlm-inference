There were no palaces, public architecture, and little evidence for status differentiation.\n\nCatalh\u00f6y\u00fck is considered a large village rather than a city primarily because it lacks the characteristics typically associated with urban centers. The absence of palaces, significant public architecture, and clear evidence of social stratification or status differentiation are key factors that differentiate it from what we would consider a city. While it was a significant Neolithic settlement, its structure and organization do not meet the criteria for a city as defined by archaeologists."
