                    "text": "The scenario described involves an accident where a young girl falls into the street and is hit by a car, resulting in a broken leg. The girl's parents are considering asserting a claim on her behalf against the driver to recover damages for her injuries. To determine the most likely outcome of such a claim, we need to consider the principles of negligence law.\n\nNegligence typically requires four elements:\n1. Duty: The defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.\n2. Breach: The defendant breached that duty.\n3. Causation: The breach caused the plaintiff's injury.\n4. Damages: The plaintiff suffered actual harm or loss.\n\nIn this case, the key question is whether the driver of the car acted negligently. If the driver was driving within the posted speed limit and did everything reasonably possible to avoid hitting the girl, it would be difficult to prove negligence on the part of the driver. However, if the driver was speeding, distracted, or otherwise not exercising reasonable care, then the driver could be found negligent.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Prevail, unless the driver was driving his vehicle within the posted speed limit.**\n   - This option suggests that the parents will win unless the driver was obeying traffic laws. However, merely driving within the speed limit does not necessarily absolve the driver of all responsibility. Other factors, such as attentiveness and reaction time, also play a role.\n\nB. **Prevail, unless the girl fell because the boy negligently pushed her toward the street.**\n   - This option shifts focus to the actions of the boy. If the boy's actions contributed significantly to the accident, it might affect the liability of the driver. However, the primary issue here is the driver's conduct, not the boy's.\n\nC. **Not prevail, unless the driver was driving negligently when the accident occurred.**\n   - This option correctly emphasizes the need to establish the driver's negligence. If the driver was not acting negligently (e.g., driving carefully and attempting to avoid the girl), the parents' claim may not succeed.\n\nD. **Not prevail, unless the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.**\n   - The \"last clear chance\" doctrine is relevant in some jurisdictions, suggesting that even if both parties were negligent, the party who had the last opportunity to avoid the accident can still be held liable. However, this doctrine varies by jurisdiction and is not universally applicable.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C. Not prevail, unless the driver was driving negligently when the accident occurred.**\n\nThis option correctly reflects the necessity of proving the driver's negligence for the parents' claim to succeed."
