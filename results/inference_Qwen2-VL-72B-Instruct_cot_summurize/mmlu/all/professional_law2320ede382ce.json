In addition, the employment contract provided that the employer would pay the employee an annual bonus \"to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits have been ascertained. \"At the end of the first year, the business showed a net profit of $50,000. Accordingly, the employer and the employee agreed that the employee should receive a bonus of $5,000. This amount was subsequently paid to the employee. At the end of the second year, the business realized a net profit of $10,000. Once the profit had been calculated, the employer telephoned the employee and offered him a second-year bonus of $1,000. The employee refused and demanded a bonus of $2,000. The employer refused the employee's demand and immediately terminated his employment. Following his dismissal, the employee brought suit for breach of contract against the employer. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The employee has a cause of action against the employer to recover a bonus for the second year in an amount to be determined by the court.\nB. The employer is excused for his obligation to pay a bonus, because of the unforeseen downtum in business during the second year.\nC. The employee is not entitled to any recovery, because employment contracts are generally terminable at will.\nD. The employee is not entitled to a bonus, but the employee can sue for loss of wages.\n"

                    "text": "The most accurate statement is:\n\nA. The employee has a cause of action against the employer to recover a bonus for the second year in an amount to be determined by the court.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Option A**: The employment contract stipulated that the employer would pay an annual bonus \"to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits have been ascertained.\" Since the employer did offer a bonus ($1,000) but the employee refused it and demanded more ($2,000), there is a dispute over the amount of the bonus. Given that the contract left the determination of the bonus amount to the employer, but the employee disputes this amount, the court may need to determine what constitutes a reasonable bonus based on the terms of the contract and the circumstances. Therefore, the employee has a cause of action to seek a bonus for the second year, with the amount to be determined by the court.\n\n- **Option B**: This option suggests that the employer is excused from paying the bonus due to unforeseen downturns in business. However, the contract does not specify any conditions related to business performance affecting the bonus payment. The employer's obligation to pay a bonus is based on the contract terms, not on the business's financial performance.\n\n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly states that employment contracts are generally terminable at will. While many employment relationships in the United States are considered \"at-will,\" meaning either party can terminate the relationship at any time without cause, this specific case involves a written contract with a fixed term (five years). Therefore, the employment cannot be terminated at will; it must adhere to the terms of the contract.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests that the employee is not entitled to a bonus but can sue for loss of wages. However, the employee's claim is specifically about the bonus, not the wages. The termination of employment is a separate issue from the bonus dispute, and the employee's right to a bonus is based on the contract terms, not on the termination itself.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is Option A."
