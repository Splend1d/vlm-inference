It only indicates that no members of the group have applied, which could be due to various reasons unrelated to the test itself.\n\nB. **The test manual demonstrates that the test is valid for a wide variety of jobs**\n   - While demonstrating the test's validity across various jobs is important, it does not specifically address whether the test discriminates against a particular racial group. Validity for different jobs does not necessarily mean non-discrimination against specific racial groups.\n\nC. **The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion**\n   - This condition suggests that the test treats all racial groups equally by rejecting them at the same rate. If the rejection rates are consistent across racial groups, it implies that the test does not favor or disadvantage any particular racial group, indicating non-discrimination.\n\nD. **It is not feasible to conduct separate validity studies on male and female employees**\n   - This statement addresses feasibility issues related to conducting separate studies but does not provide information about the test\u2019s impact on racial groups. It is irrelevant to determining whether the test discriminates against a particular racial group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the condition that would make it safe to assume that a selection test does not discriminate against a particular racial group is:\n\n**C. The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion**\n\nThis condition directly addresses the issue of discrimination by ensuring that the test impacts all racial groups equally."
