Strong theory:** This term is not commonly associated with advertising theories or frameworks.\n  \n- **B. Weak theory:** Similarly, this term does not directly relate to any specific advertising theory or framework.\n\n- **C. ATR framework:** The ATR (Attention, Trial, Repeat) framework focuses on the stages of consumer behavior but does not specifically address the reinforcement of existing attitudes.\n\n- **D. DRIP model:** The DRIP (Defend, Reinforce, Increase, Persuade) model aligns well with the given statement. It suggests that advertising can be used for defense (retaining customers), reinforcing existing attitudes, increasing brand usage, and persuading consumers. However, the emphasis in the statement is more on defense and reinforcement rather than persuasion.\n\nGiven the context and the focus on retaining customers and reinforcing existing attitudes, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. DRIP model.**"
