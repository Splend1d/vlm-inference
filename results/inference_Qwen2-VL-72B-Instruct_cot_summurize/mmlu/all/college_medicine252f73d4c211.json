Aerobic respiration is the process by which cells produce the majority of their ATP. Without oxygen, the electron transport chain in the mitochondria cannot function properly, and thus, the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation ceases. While other molecules listed (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, and water) may still be involved in various metabolic pathways that do not require oxygen, ATP production is most directly and immediately affected by the lack of oxygen."
