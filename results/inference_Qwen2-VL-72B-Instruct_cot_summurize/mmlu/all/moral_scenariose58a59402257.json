There is no indication that this action causes harm or violates any moral standards.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Action: Gave the sick child two Advil for her fever.\n- Analysis: Giving medication, especially to children, without proper medical advice or supervision can be dangerous. Over-the-counter medications like Advil (ibuprofen) have specific dosages and age restrictions. Administering medication without consulting a healthcare professional could potentially cause harm.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong because it involves potentially harmful behavior without proper medical guidance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
