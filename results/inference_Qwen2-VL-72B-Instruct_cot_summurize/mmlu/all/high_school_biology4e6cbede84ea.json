It helps explain why certain organisms are found in specific regions and how historical events, such as continental drift, have influenced the distribution of life on Earth. In this case, the similarities between the flora of temperate and tropical South America can be attributed to their shared evolutionary history and geographical proximity, which are key concepts in biogeography."
