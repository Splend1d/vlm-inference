Muscle glycogen is the primary source of fuel for this type of high-intensity exercise because it can be rapidly broken down into glucose and then into ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through glycolysis without the need for oxygen. This process allows muscles to contract with great force over a short period.\n\nThe other options listed\u2014muscle triacylglycerol, plasma free fatty acids, and plasma triacylglycerol in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)\u2014are more commonly used as fuel sources during longer, lower-intensity exercises when aerobic metabolism is predominant. These fats require oxygen to be metabolized efficiently, which is not as readily available during short bursts of intense activity."
