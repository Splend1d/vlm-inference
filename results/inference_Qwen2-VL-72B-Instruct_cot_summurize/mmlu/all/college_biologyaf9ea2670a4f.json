It represents the potential habitat without considering competition or predation.\n\n2. **Realistic Niche**: This is the actual range of environmental conditions and resources that an organism uses in its natural environment, taking into account competition, predation, and other limiting factors.\n\n3. **Ecological Niche**: This term encompasses both the fundamental and realistic niches but specifically refers to the role an organism plays within its ecosystem, including its interactions with other organisms and the environment.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n- The treetop-nesting birds have the capability to nest in treetops or on cliff ledges.\n- However, they choose to nest only in treetops because of the presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges.\n\nThis means:\n- Their fundamental niche includes both treetops and cliff ledges since they are capable of nesting in either location.\n- Their realistic niche is limited to treetops because the presence of the aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges prevents them from using those locations.\n\nTherefore, the treetop-nesting birds are utilizing their realistic niche only.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. their realistic niche only"
