This involves ensuring that the denominator is not zero and that the expression under the square root is non-negative.\n\nThe denominator is \\(\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}\\). For this to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero:\n\n\\[x^2 - 3x - 4 \\geq 0\\]\n\nWe can factor the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[(x-4)(x+1) \\geq 0\\]\n\nThis inequality holds true when both factors are positive or both are negative. The critical points are \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -1\\). We can analyze the sign changes around these points:\n\n- For \\(x < -1\\), both factors are negative, so their product is positive.\n- For \\(-1 < x < 4\\), the first factor is negative and the second is positive, so their product is negative.\n- For \\(x > 4\\), both factors are positive, so their product is positive.\n\nTherefore, the expression under the square root is non-negative for \\(x \\leq -1\\) or \\(x \\geq 4\\).\n\nHowever, since we have a square root in the denominator, \\(x\\) cannot be such that the denominator equals zero. But from our analysis, we see that the denominator being zero is already accounted for by the inequality, meaning there are no additional restrictions beyond those identified.\n\nThus, the domain of the function is all real numbers less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 4, which corresponds to option C: (-inf, -1) U (4, inf)."
