In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The first student then signed the paper and handed it to the second student. The second student handed a one dollar bill to the first student and left. One week later, the second student succeeded in obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer. Upon hearing the second student say hello, and before the second student could accept the offer, the first student said, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car. \"Can the second student still accept the first student's offer?\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\nD. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the second student can still accept the first student's offer, we need to analyze the elements of contract formation and the specific terms agreed upon by both parties.\n\n1. **Offer and Acceptance**: The first student made an offer to sell the car for $1,000 and provided a one-month period for the second student to decide whether to accept the offer. This offer was accompanied by a $1 payment, which serves as consideration for the option to keep the offer open for one month.\n\n2. **Consideration**: The $1 paid by the second student to the first student is considered adequate consideration for the option to keep the offer open. Consideration does not need to be of significant monetary value; it merely needs to be something of legal value exchanged between the parties.\n\n3. **Revocation of Offer**: Generally, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance unless there is an agreement to keep the offer open for a specified period. In this case, the first student agreed to keep the offer open for one month, which means the offer cannot be revoked during that period.\n\n4. **Option Contract**: The document signed by the first student and the $1 payment from the second student created an option contract. An option contract allows the offeree (the second student) to hold the offer open for a specified period in exchange for consideration (the $1).\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The first student's statement about changing their mind does not revoke the offer because the offer is bound by the option contract for one month.\n- The second student has the right to accept the offer within the one-month period, regardless of the first student's change of heart.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.**"
