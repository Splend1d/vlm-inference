There is a broad indication of financial reporting fraud.\n\nThis is because the pattern of substantial increase in sales in December followed by a decrease in January could suggest that the company may have engaged in practices such as premature recognition of revenue to meet financial targets or manipulate earnings for the end of the fiscal year. This type of behavior falls under financial reporting fraud rather than misappropriation of assets, which typically involves the theft or misuse of the company's assets for personal gain."
