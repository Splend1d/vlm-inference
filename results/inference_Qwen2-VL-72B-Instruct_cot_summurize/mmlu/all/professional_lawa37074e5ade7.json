Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler \"for his use during his natural life. \"After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre \"subject to Cutler's mortgage. \"At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be\n\nA. liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.\nB. liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.\nC. not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.\nD. not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.\n"

This implies that the mortgage is a condition attached to the property itself, and as such, the devisees inherit the property along with the obligation to honor the mortgage. Therefore, Desmond would be liable for the mortgage upon taking title to Desertacre."
