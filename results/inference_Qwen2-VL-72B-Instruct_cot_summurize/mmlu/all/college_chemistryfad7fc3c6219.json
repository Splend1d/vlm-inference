However, when an atom loses electrons to form a cation, its radius decreases because the remaining electrons are held more tightly by the nucleus.\n\nAdditionally, the higher the charge on the ion, the smaller its radius will be because the increased positive charge attracts the electrons more strongly, pulling them closer to the nucleus.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- **K+** has lost one electron from potassium.\n- **Ca2+** has lost two electrons from calcium.\n- **Sc3+** has lost three electrons from scandium.\n- **Rb+** has lost one electron from rubidium.\n\nSince Sc3+ has the highest charge (three positive charges), it will have the smallest radius compared to the others.\n\nTherefore, the ion with the smallest radius is:\n\n**C.
