The excerpt does not mention anything about breaking up monopolies or regulating competition.\n\nB. **Free trade policies of the 1970s**: These policies aimed to reduce tariffs and other barriers to international trade. The excerpt discusses establishing new provisions and regulations to improve revenue and secure navigation and commerce, but it does not specifically mention reducing trade barriers.\n\nC. **Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I**: This involves raising taxes to generate more revenue for the government. The excerpt mentions the need to raise revenue in the American colonies to defray the expenses of defense and protection, which aligns with increasing tax rates to generate revenue.\n\nD. **Decreasing federal income tax rates in the 1980s**: This involves lowering taxes to stimulate economic growth. The excerpt does not discuss lowering taxes or stimulating economic growth through tax cuts.\n\nGiven the context of the excerpt, which focuses on raising revenue through new provisions and regulations, the most fitting comparison is:\n\n**C. Increasing federal income tax rates after World War I**\n\nBoth involve raising revenue through taxation to fund government expenses."
