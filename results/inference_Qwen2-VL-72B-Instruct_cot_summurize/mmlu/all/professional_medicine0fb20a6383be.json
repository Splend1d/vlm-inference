Arteriovenous fistula\n\nAn arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein that can develop after trauma, such as a gunshot wound. The buzzing sensation, murmur on auscultation, thrill, and presence of dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg are all indicative of an AV fistula. This condition allows blood to flow directly from the artery into the vein without passing through the capillary bed, which can lead to increased pressure in the venous system and subsequent varicosities."
