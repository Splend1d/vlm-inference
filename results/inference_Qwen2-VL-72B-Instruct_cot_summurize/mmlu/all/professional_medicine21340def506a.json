Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, \"Sometimes I forget.\" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options\nB. Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care\nC. Schedule neuropsychological testing\nD. Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian\n"

This would allow the patient to be discharged from the hospital while still receiving necessary medical care and support to manage his diabetes and address any underlying psychological issues. It is important to ensure that the patient has a plan in place for ongoing care and support to help improve his compliance with his diabetic regimen and address any potential underlying psychological issues. Option D, seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian, may also be considered if the patient is deemed unable to make decisions about his own care and treatment. However, this should be a last resort and only pursued if absolutely necessary."
