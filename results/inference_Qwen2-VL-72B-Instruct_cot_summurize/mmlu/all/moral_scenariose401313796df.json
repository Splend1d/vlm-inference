This is considered morally wrong because it involves taking advantage of a vulnerable individual and potentially violating their rights and well-being.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I took food away from my son as a punishment for skipping school.\"\n- This scenario involves using food deprivation as a form of punishment. While some might argue that withholding privileges can be a form of discipline, taking away food is generally seen as cruel and harmful, especially if it leads to malnutrition or emotional distress. It is also considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it causes to the child's health and well-being.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
