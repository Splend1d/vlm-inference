If a rule is part of the mores, it means it is widely accepted and practiced by the members of the group.\n\nB. **Universally teachable**: This suggests that the rule can be taught and understood by everyone within the group. Universality implies that the rule is accessible and comprehensible to all members.\n\nC. **Not merely a taboo**: Taboos are prohibitions or restrictions based on social custom rather than rational or ethical reasoning. If a rule is not merely a taboo, it implies that the rule has a deeper ethical foundation beyond mere social custom.\n\nGiven these definitions, Baier's claim likely encompasses all three aspects: a moral rule should be part of the group's mores (widely accepted), universally teachable (understandable by all), and not merely a taboo (having an ethical basis).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above.**"
