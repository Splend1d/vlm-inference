                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where an owner disputes the charge for car servicing and drives off without paying. To determine the correct legal outcome, we need to analyze the elements of larceny (theft) and consider the specific circumstances.\n\nLarceny typically involves taking someone else's property without their consent and with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. In this case, the key issue is whether the act of driving off without paying constitutes theft of services.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Not guilty, because the car was his own property.**\n   - This option focuses on the ownership of the car but ignores the fact that the service provided by the mechanic was not paid for. Ownership of the car does not negate the obligation to pay for services rendered.\n\nB. **Not guilty, if the jury finds the servicing charge to be excessively high.**\n   - Whether the charge is excessive or not is irrelevant to the question of theft. The owner still received a service and left without paying for it, regardless of the perceived fairness of the charge.\n\nC. **Guilty, if the jurisdiction has a statute making theft of services a crime.**\n   - This option correctly identifies that the legality depends on local statutes. If the jurisdiction has laws specifically addressing theft of services, the owner could indeed be found guilty.\n\nD. **Guilty, because he took the car without the mechanic's consent.**\n   - This option misinterprets the nature of the theft. The issue isn't about taking the car itself but rather about leaving without paying for the service provided.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Guilty, if the jurisdiction has a statute making theft of services a crime.**\n\nThis option correctly acknowledges that the legality hinges on the specific laws of the jurisdiction regarding theft of services."
