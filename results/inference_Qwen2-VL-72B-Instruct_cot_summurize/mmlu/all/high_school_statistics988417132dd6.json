E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nIf two events are mutually exclusive, they cannot occur at the same time, which means their intersection is an empty set. If two events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. However, if two events are mutually exclusive, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other, making them dependent in the sense that knowing one event occurred changes the probability of the other event occurring (to zero). Therefore, it is impossible for two events to be both independent and mutually exclusive."
