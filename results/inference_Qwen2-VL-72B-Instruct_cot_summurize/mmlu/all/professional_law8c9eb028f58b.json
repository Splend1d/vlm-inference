The state adopted the so-called \"disaffiliation\" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's \"disaffiliation\" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nD. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n"

The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\n\nIn this scenario, the man is challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which restricts his ability to run as an independent candidate based on his previous party registration and voting history. This type of restriction implicates fundamental rights, specifically the right to participate in the electoral process and the freedom of association. Under constitutional law, when a statute burdens fundamental rights, the state bears the burden of demonstrating that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest. This is a higher standard of scrutiny compared to rational basis review, which would apply if the statute did not implicate fundamental rights. Therefore, the state must show that the disaffiliation statute serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest."
