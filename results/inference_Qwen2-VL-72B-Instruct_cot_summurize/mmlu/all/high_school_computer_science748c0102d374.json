In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.\nB. Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\nC. A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.\nD. Using a linear search is preferable to using a binary search if there is a chance that the target may not be found in the list.\n"

Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\n\nBinary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it more efficient for larger lists compared to linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n). As the size of the list grows, the number of comparisons required by binary search grows much slower than that of linear search, making it the better choice for large datasets."
