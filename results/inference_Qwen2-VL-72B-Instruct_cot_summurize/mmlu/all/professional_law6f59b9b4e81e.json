The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n"

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n\nThe federal government has exclusive authority over foreign affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries. This authority is derived from the Constitution's Foreign Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause. When a state enacts a law that conflicts with federal foreign policy, such as a thaw in relations with Cuba, the state law is preempted by federal law and is therefore unconstitutional. The National Trade Council's lawsuit would likely succeed if it can demonstrate that the state law directly contradicts or undermines federal policy toward Cuba."
