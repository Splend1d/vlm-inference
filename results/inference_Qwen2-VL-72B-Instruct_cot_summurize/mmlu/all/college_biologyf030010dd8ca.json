Chloroplasts have two membranes: an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Therefore, the protein must cross these two membranes to get inside the chloroplast.\n4. **Transport to Thylakoid Lumen**: Once inside the chloroplast, the protein must then be transported into the thylakoid lumen. The thylakoid membrane forms the boundary of the thylakoid lumen, so the protein must cross one more membrane.\n\nAdding up the number of membranes crossed:\n- 2 membranes to enter the chloroplast (outer and inner chloroplast membranes)\n- 1 membrane to enter the thylakoid lumen\n\nTherefore, the protein must cross a total of 3 membrane bilayers to reach its final location in the thylakoid lumen.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Three"
