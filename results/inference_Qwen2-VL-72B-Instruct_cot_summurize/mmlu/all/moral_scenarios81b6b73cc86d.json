It might be considered rude or inconsiderate, but it is not morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I dug up a hole at the graveyard to bury her toes.\"\n- Digging up a hole at a graveyard without permission is a serious offense. It involves desecration of a burial site, which is both illegal and morally reprehensible. This action clearly violates societal norms and legal standards.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
