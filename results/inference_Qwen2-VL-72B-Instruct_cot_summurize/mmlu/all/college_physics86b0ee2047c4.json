Thus, the total charge on all three capacitors combined is still \\( CV_0 \\).\n\n4. **Final Voltage:**\n   - Let \\( V_f \\) be the final voltage across all three capacitors.\n   - The equivalent capacitance of all three capacitors connected in parallel is:\n     \\[\n     C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_{\\text{series}} = C + \\frac{C}{2} = \\frac{3C}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Using the conservation of charge:\n     \\[\n     Q_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{total}} V_f\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     CV_0 = \\left(\\frac{3C}{2}\\right) V_f\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( V_f \\):\n     \\[\n     V_f = \\frac{CV_0}{\\frac{3C}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3} V_0\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final voltage on the first capacitor is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2V_0}{3}}\n\\]"
