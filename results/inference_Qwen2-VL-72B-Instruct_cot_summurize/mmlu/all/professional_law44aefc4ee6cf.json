Late one night, the defendant broke into the bar and proceeded to load large kegs of beer onto his truck. As he was leaving, the defendant inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a trash can behind the bar. Soon afterward, the trash ignited into a small fire. Although the defendant had time to douse the fire without any danger to himself, he did not do so. Instead, he climbed into the truck and drove away. Although the fire spread beyond the trashcan, the fire department responded quickly and was able to put it out. The floor behind the bar was charred. The statutes for both burglary and arson in this jurisdiction include residential and business structures. The defendant should be convicted of which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Arson, burglary, and larceny.\nB. Arson and burglary.\nC. Larceny and burglary.\nD. Arson, robbery, and burglary.\n"

Even though the fire was small and quickly extinguished, the defendant's action directly caused the fire.\n\n2. **Burglary**: The defendant broke into the bar with the intent to commit theft (stealing kegs of beer). This fits the definition of burglary, which involves entering a structure unlawfully with the intent to commit a felony or theft inside.\n\n3. **Larceny**: The defendant loaded large kegs of beer onto his truck, intending to steal them. This constitutes larceny, as it involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.\n\n4. **Robbery**: Robbery typically involves the use of force or fear to take property from another person. Since there is no indication that the defendant used force or fear during the incident, robbery does not apply here.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Arson, burglary, and larceny.**\n\nThe defendant should be convicted of arson, burglary, and larceny."
