At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient?\n\nA. Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient\nB. Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms\nC. Interview the patient under hypnosis\nD.
