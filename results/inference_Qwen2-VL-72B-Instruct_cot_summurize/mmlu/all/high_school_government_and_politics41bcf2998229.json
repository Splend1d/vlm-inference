                    "text": "The \"elastic clause\" of the Constitution, also known as the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18), gives Congress the power to make all laws that are necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers. This clause allows Congress to pass laws that are not explicitly listed in the Constitution but are deemed necessary to execute its enumerated powers.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Change citizenship requirements** - This is generally handled through immigration law, which falls under the enumerated powers of Congress to regulate naturalization (Article I, Section 8, Clause 4). While the elastic clause might be used to support such legislation, it is not directly tied to changing citizenship requirements.\n\nB. **Impose workplace safety standards** - This involves regulating commerce and ensuring public health and welfare, which can be seen as necessary and proper for executing Congress's enumerated powers. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) is an example of using the elastic clause to create laws that ensure workplace safety.\n\nC. **Increase tax rates** - Taxation is an enumerated power of Congress (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). While the elastic clause could be used to justify the means by which taxes are collected or spent, increasing tax rates itself does not inherently require the elastic clause.\n\nD. **Authorize the treasury to print money** - The power to coin money and regulate its value is an enumerated power (Article I, Section 8, Clause 5). This power does not typically involve the elastic clause, as it is a direct and explicit power granted to Congress.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Impose workplace safety standards"
