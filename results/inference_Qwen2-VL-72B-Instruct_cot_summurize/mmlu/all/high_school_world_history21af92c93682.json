The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe \"revolutions\" spoken of by Sukarno in the passage above most likely relate to which of the following causes?\n\nA.

Decolonization\n\nThe context of the passage suggests that Sukarno is referring to the struggle for independence from colonial rule, which aligns with the cause of decolonization. The Bandung Conference was a meeting of Asian and African states, most of which were newly independent or struggling against colonial domination. Therefore, the \"revolutions\" mentioned are most likely related to decolonization efforts."
