ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary source of energy for muscle contractions. If the rate at which ATP is produced cannot keep up with the rate at which it is consumed, this mismatch leads to fatigue. This can occur due to various factors such as depletion of glycogen stores, accumulation of metabolic byproducts like lactate, or insufficient oxygen supply to muscles during anaerobic conditions."
