Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched. In Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, children typically begin to understand object permanence around 8 to 12 months of age. Before this stage, if an object is out of sight, it is considered out of mind for the child."
