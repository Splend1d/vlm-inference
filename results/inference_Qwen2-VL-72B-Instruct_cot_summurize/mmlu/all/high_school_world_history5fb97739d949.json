It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics\n"

They weakened the state by diverting resources away from defense and governance.\n\nB. **Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire**: Barbarian invasions were a major threat to the stability and territorial integrity of the Roman Empire. These incursions led to the loss of territories and further weakened the empire.\n\nC. **The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire**: The persistence of the Senate was more of an institutional continuity rather than a direct cause of decline. While the Senate had lost much of its power by this time, it continued to exist as a ceremonial body. Its presence did not significantly contribute to the decline compared to other factors.\n\nD. **Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics**: Diseases and epidemics, such as the Antonine Plague, significantly reduced the population and workforce, contributing to economic and military weaknesses.\n\nGiven this analysis, the factor that contributed least to the decline of the Roman Empire is:\n\n**C. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire**."
