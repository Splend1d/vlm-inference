According to his estimates, poverty-related causes account for a substantial portion of all human deaths.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Around one quarter of all human deaths.\nB. Around one third of all human deaths.\nC. Around one half of all human deaths.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPogge's research suggests that poverty-related causes are responsible for a significant proportion of deaths globally. However, the exact figure he uses varies slightly in different contexts, but it is generally around one-third or more.\n\nGiven this information, the most accurate option based on Pogge's work would be:\n\nB. Around one third of all human deaths."
