However, it could be viewed negatively if it leads to arrogance or disrespect towards others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong due to potential harm to children.\n- Scenario 2 involves a personal feeling that may be viewed negatively but does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
