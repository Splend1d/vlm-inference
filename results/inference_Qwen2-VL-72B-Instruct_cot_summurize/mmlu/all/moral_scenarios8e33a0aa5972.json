It is commonly understood that finding small amounts of money in public places can be kept without ethical concerns.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I took home donations for the local thrift store that I saw outside its front door after closing hours.\"\n- Taking donations intended for a thrift store without permission is typically seen as morally wrong. These items are meant for the thrift store to sell or distribute, and taking them would be considered theft or stealing.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
