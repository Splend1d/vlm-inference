Choose a random value \\( r \\) from the set \\( R \\).\n2. Output the pair \\( (r, F(k, r) \\oplus m) \\).\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Scheme\n\n- **Randomness**: The randomness in the encryption comes from choosing \\( r \\) uniformly at random from \\( R \\).\n- **Pseudorandomness**: The output of \\( F(k, r) \\) is pseudorandom due to \\( F \\) being a secure PRF.\n\n### Step 2: CPA Security\n\nIn a chosen plaintext attack (CPA), an adversary can choose plaintexts and obtain their corresponding ciphertexts. The goal is to distinguish between two messages encrypted under the same key.\n\n#### Adversary's Strategy\n\nSuppose the adversary has access to an encryption oracle that encrypts messages using \\( E(k, m) \\). The adversary chooses two messages \\( m_0 \\) and \\( m_1 \\) and receives the ciphertext \\( c \\) for one of these messages (chosen randomly by the challenger).\n\nThe ciphertext \\( c \\) consists of \\( (r, F(k, r) \\oplus m_i) \\) where \\( i \\) is either 0 or 1.\n\n### Step 3: Indistinguishability\n\nFor the encryption scheme to be semantically secure under CPA, the adversary should not be able to tell which message was encrypted given the ciphertext \\( c \\).\n\nGiven \\( c = (r, F(k, r) \\oplus m_i) \\):\n\n- The first part \\( r \\) is just a random value.\n- The second part \\( F(k, r) \\oplus m_i \\) combines the pseudorandom output of \\( F \\) with the message \\( m_i \\) via XOR.\n\nSince \\( F \\) is a secure PRF, \\( F(k, r) \\) looks like a truly random string to anyone who does not know \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( F(k, r) \\oplus m_i \\) also appears random and independent of \\( m_i \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBecause the output of \\( F(k, r) \\) is indistinguishable from random, and XORing it with any message \\( m_i \\) results in another seemingly random string, the adversary cannot distinguish between \\( m_0 \\) and \\( m_1 \\) based on the ciphertext alone.\n\nThus, the encryption scheme \\( E(k, m) \\) is semantically secure under CPA whenever \\( F \\) is a secure PRF.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA. Yes, whenever \\( F \\) is a secure PRF"
