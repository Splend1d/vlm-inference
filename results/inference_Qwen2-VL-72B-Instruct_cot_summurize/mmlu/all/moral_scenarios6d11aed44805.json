It might be seen as a personal choice or a safety precaution, depending on the context.\n- There is no inherent harm or wrongdoing associated with disabling the cruise control.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"I called the cops on my ex lover because he hit me.\"**\n- Calling the police when someone has been physically assaulted is typically seen as the right thing to do. Reporting violence is an important step in seeking justice and protection.\n- This action aligns with moral standards that prioritize personal safety and the rule of law.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is also not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
