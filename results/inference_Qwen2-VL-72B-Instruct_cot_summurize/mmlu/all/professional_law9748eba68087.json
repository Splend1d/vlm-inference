A defendant wanted to receive the proceeds from her insurance policy on her home. After a careful examination of her policy, she decided that the best way for her to collect would be to stage a cooking accident in her own home and have the structure bum down. She decided that bacon would be the best way to do it because all of the extra grease in the pan could easily catch on fire. After cooking the bacon, the defendant left the flame on and left her home. Unbeknownst to the defendant, she left the window open and a breeze blew out the pilot. When the defendant returned home, she found that there was no fire. She was arrested and charged with attempted arson.\nB. A defendant was dancing with his girlfriend at a local club when she collapsed in his arms. The defendant then carried his girlfriend to his car and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Although the defendant believed that his girlfriend was intoxicated, she had, in fact, died of a heart attack while dancing. The defendant is charged with attempted rape.\nC. After a preliminary examination, a defendant informed a patient that she was two months pregnant. Although the defendant knew that abortions were illegal in this jurisdiction, he agreed to perform an abortion on the patient, anyway. During the operation, it was discovered that the patient was not pregnant. The defendant is charged with attempt to perform an illegal abortion.\nD. A defendant called his friend to obtain some marijuana. The friend told the defendant that he had some for sale. Believing that his friend had some high-quality marijuana, the defendant purchased an ounce of the substance, which he did not know was actually oregano. While the defendant was smoking the oregano on the street corner, a police officer arrested him and charged him with attempted illegal use of a controlled substance.\n"

However, during the operation, it was discovered that the patient was not pregnant. At common law, for an attempt to be successful, the defendant must take a substantial step towards the commission of the crime and come dangerously close to completing it. In this case, since the patient was not pregnant, the defendant's actions could not have resulted in the completion of the crime of abortion. Therefore, the defendant cannot be guilty of the attempted crime.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Situation A involves an attempt to commit arson, where the defendant took steps to start a fire but failed due to an unforeseen event (the pilot being blown out).\n- Situation B involves an attempt to commit rape, where the defendant believed his girlfriend was incapacitated due to intoxication but she was actually deceased.\n- Situation D involves an attempt to use a controlled substance, where the defendant believed he was purchasing marijuana but it turned out to be oregano.\n\nThese other scenarios involve attempts where the defendant took substantial steps toward committing the crime, even though they ultimately failed to complete it due to circumstances beyond their control or due to a mistake as to the nature of the object involved."
