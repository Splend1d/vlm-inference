A chain of coastal volcanic mountains\n\nWhen a continental lithospheric plate collides with an oceanic lithospheric plate, the denser oceanic plate typically subducts beneath the less dense continental plate. This process, known as subduction, can lead to the formation of a volcanic arc along the edge of the continental plate. The volcanoes form due to the melting of the subducting oceanic plate as it descends into the mantle, generating magma that rises to the surface through fissures in the overlying continental crust. This results in a chain of coastal volcanic mountains, such as those found along the western coast of South America (Andes) or the Pacific Ring of Fire."
