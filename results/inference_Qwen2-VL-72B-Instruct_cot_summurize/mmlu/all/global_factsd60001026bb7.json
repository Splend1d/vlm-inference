Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B as they represent lower percentages.\n\nBetween C (71%) and D (86%), option D represents an even higher majority, which aligns more closely with the general sentiment towards the importance of free media in many democratic societies.\n\nThus, the most plausible answer is:\n\nD. 86%"
