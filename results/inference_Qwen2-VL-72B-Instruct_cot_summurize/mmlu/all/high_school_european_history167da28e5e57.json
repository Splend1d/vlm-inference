Triple Entente (1907)\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, also known as the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, was an agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed in August 1939. It contained secret protocols that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and set the stage for World War II.\n\nThe Triple Entente, signed in 1907, was an agreement between France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. It was a system of agreements designed to create a balance of power in Europe and prevent any one country from becoming too dominant. The Triple Entente was similar to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in that it was an agreement between two countries to maintain peace and prevent aggression against each other."
