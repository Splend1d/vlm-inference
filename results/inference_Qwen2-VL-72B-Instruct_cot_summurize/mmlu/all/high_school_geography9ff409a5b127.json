Complementarity\n\nThe concept of complementarity in geography refers to the idea that places or businesses can benefit from being located near each other because they offer different but related goods or services, thereby attracting more customers collectively than they would individually. New stores opening around a large shopping mall reflect this concept because they are likely to attract customers who are already visiting the mall for shopping, dining, or entertainment, thus benefiting from the foot traffic generated by the mall."
