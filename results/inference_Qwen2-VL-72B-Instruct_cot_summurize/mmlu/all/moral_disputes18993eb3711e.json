In her famous essay \"A Defense of Abortion,\" Thomson uses thought experiments to argue that even if a fetus has a right to life, it does not necessarily have a right to use the mother's body. She discusses the moral character of individuals in these situations, which aligns with the principles of virtue ethics."
