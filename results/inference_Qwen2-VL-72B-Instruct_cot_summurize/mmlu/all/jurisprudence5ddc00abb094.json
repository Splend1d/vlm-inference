Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nRonald Dworkin, a prominent legal philosopher and political theorist, supports liberal egalitarianism primarily because he believes that it aims to distinguish between choices made by individuals and the circumstances they are born into or otherwise encounter through no fault or choice of their own (often referred to as \"brute luck\"). Liberal egalitarianism seeks to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by factors beyond their control while still respecting their autonomy and choices.\n\nIn Dworkin's view, a just society should compensate for inequalities that arise from brute luck but should not interfere with inequalities that result from deliberate choices made by individuals. This perspective aligns with his broader argument that justice requires treating equals equally and unequals unequally according to relevant differences. Thus, Dworkin advocates for a system where individuals are held responsible for the outcomes of their choices but are protected against disadvantages arising from factors outside their control."
