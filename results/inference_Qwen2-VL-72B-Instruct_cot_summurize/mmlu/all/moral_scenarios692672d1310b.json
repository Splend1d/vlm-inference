Styling one's hair to \"show her up\" during this time can be seen as insensitive and lacking empathy. It suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings and the challenges she is facing.\n  \n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When my friend told me in private she had a crush, I kept it to myself.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** Keeping a friend's secret about their crush is generally considered respectful and trustworthy behavior. It shows loyalty and discretion, which are positive traits in a friendship.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong because it lacks empathy and consideration for someone who is already dealing with a serious health issue.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that is not morally wrong because it respects the privacy and trust of a friend.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
