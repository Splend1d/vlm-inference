                    "text": "To construct the truth table for the given argument, we need to evaluate each of the premises and the conclusion for all possible combinations of truth values for S, T, and U.\n\nThe argument consists of three premises:\n1. ~S \u2228 T\n2. ~S \u00b7 U\n3. ~T \u2228 U\n\nAnd the conclusion:\n4. T \u00b7 U\n\nLet's create the truth table:\n\n| S | T | U | ~S | ~T | ~S \u2228 T | ~S \u00b7 U | ~T \u2228 U | T \u00b7 U |\n|---|---|---|----|----|--------|--------|--------|------|\n| T | T | T | F  | F  | T      | F      | T      | T    |\n| T | T | F | F  | F  | T      | F      | T      | F    |\n| T | F | T | F  | T  | T      | F      | T      | F    |\n| T | F | F | F  | T  | T      | F      | T      | F    |\n| F | T | T | T  | F  | T      | T      | T      | T    |\n| F | T | F | T  | F  | T      | F      | T      | F    |\n| F | F | T | T  | T  | T      | T      | T      | F    |\n| F | F | F | T  | T  | T      | F      | T      | F    |\n\nNow let's analyze the truth table to see if there are any rows where all premises are true but the conclusion is false. This would indicate that the argument is invalid.\n\n- In row 1: All premises are true, and the conclusion is also true.\n- In row 2: The second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is false, so this row does not count as a counterexample.\n- In row 3: The first premise (~S \u2228 T) is true, the second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is false, and the third premise (~T \u2228 U) is true. The conclusion (T \u00b7 U) is false.\n- In row 4: The second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is false, so this row does not count as a counterexample.\n- In row 5: All premises are true, and the conclusion is also true.\n- In row 6: The second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is false, so this row does not count as a counterexample.\n- In row 7: The second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is true, and the conclusion (T \u00b7 U) is false.\n- In row 8: The second premise (~S \u00b7 U) is false, so this row does not count as a counterexample.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that in rows 3 and 7, all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nFor the counterexample, we can use either row 3 or row 7. Let's choose row 3:\n- S is true (T)\n- T is false (F)\n- U is true (T)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when U is true and S and T are false"
