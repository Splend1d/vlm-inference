Decreases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases\n\nExplanation:\n1. **U.S. Net Exports**: If the Japanese economy suffers a deep, prolonged recession, it is likely that Japanese consumers and businesses will reduce their spending, including on imports from the United States. This decrease in demand for U.S. goods and services would lead to a decrease in U.S. exports to Japan. Since net exports are exports minus imports, if U.S. exports fall more than imports (or imports rise), net exports would decrease.\n\n2. **Value of Dollar**: A decrease in demand for U.S. exports can lead to a decrease in the demand for dollars, as fewer Japanese buyers need to exchange yen for dollars to purchase U.S. goods. This reduced demand for dollars could cause the value of the dollar to decrease relative to other currencies, including the yen.\n\n3. **Value of Yen**: Conversely, if the Japanese economy is in recession and there is less demand for U.S. goods, this might also mean that there is less need for Japanese companies to sell yen to buy dollars. This could lead to an increase in the value of the yen relative to the dollar, as the supply of yen on the foreign exchange market decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Decreases (for U.S. net exports), Decreases (for the value of the dollar), and Increases (for the value of the yen)."
