This is because commercial substance is about whether the economic position of the entity has changed significantly due to the exchange.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?**\n   - This question pertains to the accounting treatment of the exchange but does not directly address the change in future cash flows, which is central to determining commercial substance.\n\nB. **Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows?**\n   - While this question touches on the impact on future cash flows, it focuses more on the comparison between the gain and the increase in cash flows rather than the significance of the change itself.\n\nC. **Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?**\n   - This question directly addresses the core criterion for commercial substance: whether the exchange results in a significant change in the future cash flows of the entity.\n\nD. **Is the exchange nontaxable?**\n   - Taxability of the exchange is a separate consideration and does not directly relate to the determination of commercial substance.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?**"
