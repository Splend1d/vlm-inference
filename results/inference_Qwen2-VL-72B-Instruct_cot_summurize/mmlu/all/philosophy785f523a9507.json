According to Taurek, each person's life has intrinsic value, and it is not appropriate to aggregate these values in order to make decisions about who to save or how to allocate resources. This perspective implies that the death of two people cannot be compared directly to the death of one person by simply adding their individual losses together.\n\nTherefore, Taurek would argue against the notion that the death of two people is always worse than the death of one (option A), sometimes less bad than the death of one (option B), or always exactly as bad as the death of one (option C). Instead, he would reject the very idea of summing up individual losses (option D)."
