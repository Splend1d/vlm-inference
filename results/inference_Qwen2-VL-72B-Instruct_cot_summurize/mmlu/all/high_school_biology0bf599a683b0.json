These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n\nLegumes, such as peas, beans, and clover, are able to grow well in nitrogen-poor soils because they form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, primarily from the genus Rhizobium. These bacteria live in nodules on the roots of legumes and convert atmospheric nitrogen (N\u2082) into ammonia (NH\u2083), which the plant can then use to synthesize amino acids and proteins. This process is known as nitrogen fixation, and it allows legumes to thrive even when soil nitrogen levels are low."
