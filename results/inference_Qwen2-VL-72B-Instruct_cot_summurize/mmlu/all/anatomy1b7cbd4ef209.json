It provides sensory innervation to the lower eyelid, cheek, and upper lip. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The facial nerve (CN VII) does not have a maxillary branch; it has temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches.\n\nC. Parasympathetic secretomotor fibers to the lacrimal gland are carried by the greater petrosal nerve, which is a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII).\n\nD. The infraorbital nerve does not innervate muscles; it is purely sensory. The orbicularis oculi muscle is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII)."
