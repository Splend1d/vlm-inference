                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The sky appears blue because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters shorter wavelengths of light, which are in the blue part of the spectrum. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. These collisions cause the light to scatter in different directions. Since blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light, it is scattered more easily by the molecules in the atmosphere. As a result, when we look up at the sky during the day, we see a blue color because the blue light is being scattered in all directions and reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky."
