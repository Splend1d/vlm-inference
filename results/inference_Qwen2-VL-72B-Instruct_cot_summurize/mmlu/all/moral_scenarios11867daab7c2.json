It may be seen as a form of social strategy rather than an inherently immoral act.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I threw my milk on my classmates' head to make him cry.\"\n\n- This scenario describes a situation where the main character intentionally throws milk on a classmate's head with the goal of making them cry.\n- This action is clearly aggressive and intended to cause harm or distress to another person. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, such behavior is considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
