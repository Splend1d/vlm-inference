In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife.\" Is the witness's testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.\nB. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.\nD. Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n"

Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nThe witness's testimony is admissible because it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of then-existing state of mind. This includes statements of intent or belief at the time they were made, which can be relevant to understanding the defendant's actions and intentions during the period in question. The statement \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife\" reflects the defendant's state of mind at the time, indicating his intention to eventually return the car."
