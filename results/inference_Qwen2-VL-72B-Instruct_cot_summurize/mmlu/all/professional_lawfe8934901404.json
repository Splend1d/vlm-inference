On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n"

Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the collector made an offer to the expert to restore the toy for $500. The expert began the restoration work on June 4, which can be considered as acceptance of the offer. Since the acceptance occurred before the collector's death, a binding contract exists between the expert and the collector's estate. The fact that the expert later learned about the collector's death does not affect the validity of the contract formed prior to the collector's death."
