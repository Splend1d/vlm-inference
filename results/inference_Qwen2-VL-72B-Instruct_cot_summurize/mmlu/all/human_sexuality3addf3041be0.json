Sample size was relatively small: The study had a limited sample size, which may not be representative of the broader population and could limit the generalizability of the findings.\n\nB. Gay and straight groups were not equivalent in terms of the number of deaths due to AIDS: The study included a higher proportion of gay men who had died of AIDS compared to the straight group. This difference in health status could potentially confound the results, as AIDS can affect brain structure and function.\n\nC. Lesbians were omitted from the study: The study focused exclusively on gay men and straight men, excluding lesbians and bisexual individuals. This limits the scope of the research and raises questions about the applicability of the findings to other sexual orientations.\n\nTherefore, all of these criticisms are plausible concerns regarding LeVay's work."
