Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.\n\nMediation typically involves a neutral third party who facilitates discussions between disputing parties to help them reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator does not impose a solution but helps the parties find one themselves.\n\nConciliation, on the other hand, often involves a commission or committee that examines the dispute in detail and then proposes a solution. This process can be more formal and structured than mediation, and the commission's proposals may carry more weight, although they are generally not legally binding unless agreed upon by the parties involved."
