                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the most efficient searching algorithm for a sorted list, which is Binary Search.\n\nBinary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, it compares the middle element of the current interval with the target value. If the middle element matches the target, the search ends successfully. If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the interval; if it's greater, the search continues in the left half.\n\nGiven a sorted list of 120 integers, let's calculate how many steps (comparisons) are required in the worst case to find the value 100 or determine it's not in the list using binary search:\n\n1. Start with the entire list: \\( 2^k \\geq 120 \\)\n2. Solve for \\( k \\): \\( k = \\log_2{120} \\)\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\\[ \\log_2{120} \\approx 6.906 \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer and represents the number of comparisons, we round up to the nearest whole number because even if the exact midpoint isn't found on the last comparison, we still need to check one more time to confirm the absence of the value.\n\nTherefore, \\( k = 7 \\).\n\nSo, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 7.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 7."
