This electric field then induces a voltage (also known as an electromotive force or EMF) across the ends of the loop. If the loop is part of a complete circuit, this induced voltage can drive a current through the circuit. Therefore, changing the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire can lead to the creation of an electric field, a voltage, and potentially a current if the loop is part of a circuit."
