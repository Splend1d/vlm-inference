However, since the exact wording or context is not provided in the question, I will analyze each option based on common definitions of violence in the context of terrorism.\n\nA. Including only bodily harm to persons - This is a narrow definition that focuses solely on physical injury to individuals.\n\nB. Including bodily harm to persons and the destruction of property - This is a broader definition that encompasses both physical harm to people and damage to property.\n\nC. Including only the destruction of property - This is another narrow definition that excludes physical harm to individuals.\n\nD. None of the above - This implies that the definition does not fit any of the given options.\n\nGiven that terrorism often involves both physical harm to individuals and destruction of property, it is reasonable to assume that Valls' definition would likely include both aspects.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Including bodily harm to persons and the destruction of property."
