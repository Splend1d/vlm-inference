The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC. The population standard deviations at both locations are known.\nD. The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n"

The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n\nFor a t-test to be valid, one of the key assumptions is that the data should be normally distributed within each group being compared. This is particularly important when the sample sizes are small (as in this case, with only 10 salespeople sampled from each location). If the populations are not normally distributed, the results of the t-test may not be reliable.\n\nWhile the equality or inequality of population standard deviations can affect the choice between using a pooled or unpooled t-test, it is not a fundamental assumption for the validity of the test itself. The normality of the data is more critical, especially with smaller sample sizes."
