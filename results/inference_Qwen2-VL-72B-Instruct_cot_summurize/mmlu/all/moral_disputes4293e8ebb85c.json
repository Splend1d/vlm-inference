However, there is no explicit constitutional prohibition on euthanasia.\n\nB. **Teach society the wrong kind of lesson.**\n   - This option implies that Callahan fears that legalizing euthanasia could have broader societal implications, potentially normalizing or encouraging behaviors he deems undesirable or unethical.\n\nC. **Violate our right to self-determination.**\n   - This option suggests that Callahan believes legalizing euthanasia would infringe upon individuals' rights to make decisions about their own lives. However, this argument typically supports rather than opposes euthanasia, as it aligns with the idea of autonomy and personal choice.\n\nD. **None of the above.**\n   - This option indicates that none of the provided reasons apply to Callahan's stance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible reason for Callahan being against the legalization of euthanasia is:\n\n**B. Teach society the wrong kind of lesson.**\n\nThis option aligns with concerns about the potential broader societal impacts of legalizing euthanasia, which is a common argument used by opponents of euthanasia."
