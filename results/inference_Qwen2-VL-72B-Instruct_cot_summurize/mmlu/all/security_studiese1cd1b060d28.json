The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.\nB. The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.\nC. Biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, but because these organisms and toxins occur in nature it makes it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring disease and subversive activities which, moreover, make a state's capacity hard to verify.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nEach point you've listed provides different aspects of how biological weapons have affected national security in the international community:\n\nA. Highlights the historical research and development efforts by Western nations, emphasizing the perceived lack of military utility compared to nuclear and conventional capabilities.\n\nB. Describes the Soviet Union's extensive research into genetic engineering for biological weapons, suggesting they were seen as a strategic countermeasure during the Cold War.\n\nC. Points out the challenges posed by biological weapons, including difficulties in distinguishing natural outbreaks from deliberate attacks and verifying a state's capabilities.\n\nTogether, these points cover various dimensions of the impact of biological weapons on national security, making D the correct answer."
