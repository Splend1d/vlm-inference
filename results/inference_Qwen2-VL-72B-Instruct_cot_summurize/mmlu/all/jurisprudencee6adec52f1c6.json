However, if Robert knows that the statement is false and makes it with the intention to deceive the buyer, it could potentially be considered misrepresentation. Fraud typically involves intentional deception with the purpose of inducing another person to act to their detriment. Without additional context indicating that Robert knew the statement was false and intended to deceive, the most appropriate answer would be misrepresentation."
