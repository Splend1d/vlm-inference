Rate = k[A]\n   - If the reaction were first-order (Rate = k[A]), then plotting ln [A] versus time should yield a straight line with a negative slope (-k). Since this is not the case, this option can be ruled out.\n\nB. Rate = k[A]^2\n   - If the reaction were second-order (Rate = k[A]^2), then plotting 1/[A] versus time should yield a straight line with a positive slope (k). This matches the given information, so this option is a strong candidate.\n\nC. Rate = k[A]^0\n   - If the reaction were zero-order (Rate = k[A]^0 = k), then plotting [A] versus time should yield a straight line with a negative slope (-k). Since this is not the case, this option can be ruled out.\n\nD. Rate = k[A]^-1\n   - If the reaction were inverse-first-order (Rate = k[A]^-1), then plotting [A] versus time would not necessarily give a straight line, and plotting ln [A] versus time would not give a straight line either. This does not match the given information, so this option can be ruled out.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Rate = k[A]^2"
