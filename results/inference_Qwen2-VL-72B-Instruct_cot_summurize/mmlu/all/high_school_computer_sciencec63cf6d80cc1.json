If a data value is greater than the\n   value of the variable max, set max to the data value.\n\n Which of the following statements best describes the behavior of the two algorithms?\n\nA. Both algorithms work correctly on all input values.\nB. Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\nC. Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to -l.\nD. Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values.\n"
