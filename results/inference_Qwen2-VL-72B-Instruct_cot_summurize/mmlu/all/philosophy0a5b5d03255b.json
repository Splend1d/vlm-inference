He famously critiques the identification of \"good\" with natural properties or states of affairs, such as pleasure or happiness, through his \"open question argument.\" Moore's position is that \"good\" is a simple, non-natural property that cannot be defined in terms of naturalistic concepts. This view is central to his ethical philosophy and is known as ethical non-naturalism."
