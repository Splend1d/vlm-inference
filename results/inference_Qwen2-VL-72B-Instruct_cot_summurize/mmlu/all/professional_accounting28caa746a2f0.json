In this case, the shareholder contributed equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, subject to a liability of $12,000.\n\nThe contribution of the equipment itself does not trigger recognition of gain because there is no boot (cash or other property) received by the shareholder. The liability assumed by the S corporation reduces the shareholder's basis in their stock but does not result in immediate gain recognition. Therefore, the correct answer is A. $0."
