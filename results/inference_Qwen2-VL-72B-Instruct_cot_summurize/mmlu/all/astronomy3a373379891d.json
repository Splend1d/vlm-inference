These gaps occur at orbital resonances with Jupiter, meaning that asteroids in these regions would have orbital periods that are simple fractions (such as 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.) of Jupiter's orbital period. Therefore, both options A and B are correct because they describe orbital periods that are simple fractions of Jupiter's period."
