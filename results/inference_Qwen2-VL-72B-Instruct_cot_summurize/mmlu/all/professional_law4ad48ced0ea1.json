Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the original owner of the real estate held a fee simple interest and transferred a life estate to a friend. A life estate grants the holder the right to use and occupy the property during their lifetime. Upon the death of the life tenant (the friend), the property would revert to the original owner or their heirs unless otherwise specified.\n\nHowever, the life tenant has the right to convey their life estate to others during their lifetime. Therefore, when the life tenant conveyed his interest to his children, they acquired the life estate. This means that the children hold the life estate until the death of the original life tenant, at which point the property would revert to the original owner's heirs if no other arrangements were made.\n\nThe fact that the original fee simple owner died does not automatically break the life estate; it simply means that upon the death of the life tenant, the property would revert to the original owner's heirs. Since the life tenant conveyed his interest to his children, they hold the life estate and have an enforceable interest in the property until the life tenant's death."
