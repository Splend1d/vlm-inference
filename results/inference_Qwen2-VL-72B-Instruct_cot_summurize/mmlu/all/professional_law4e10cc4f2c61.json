Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which constitutional provision furnishes the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Native American Party, we need to analyze each option carefully:\n\nA. **The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment**: This clause guarantees that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While it ensures fair procedures, it does not directly address discrimination based on race or ethnicity.\n\nB. **The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment**: This right protects the freedom to assemble peacefully and to petition the government for redress of grievances. However, this right does not specifically address issues of membership in private organizations or parties.\n\nC. **The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment**: This clause prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. It is designed to prevent discriminatory practices, including those based on race or ethnicity. Since the Native American Party has expelled non-Native American members based on their ethnicity, this clause could potentially be used to challenge such discriminatory practices.\n\nD. **The voting provisions of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment**: This amendment prohibits the use of poll taxes as a condition for voting in federal elections. It does not address membership in political parties or discrimination based on ethnicity.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most relevant constitutional provision for challenging the exclusion based on ethnicity is:\n\n**C. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.**\n\nThis clause provides the strongest legal basis for arguing against discriminatory practices based on race or ethnicity, which is precisely what the former member is challenging."
