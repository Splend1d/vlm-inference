The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

The English settlers generally did not view the natives as equals and often treated them harshly.\n\nB. **Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership**: This is accurate. The English settlers often found it difficult to understand the native concept of communal land ownership, which was different from their own system of private property.\n\nC. **Widely did not condone intermingling with the natives**: This is partially correct but not entirely relevant to the comparison. While there were restrictions on intermingling, this does not directly address the treatment of natives in terms of labor and exploitation.\n\nD. **Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton**: This is also inaccurate. While the English did use native labor, they also relied heavily on African slaves for cash crop production.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership**\n\nThis option highlights a significant difference in understanding between the English settlers and the native populations, which influenced their interactions and treatment of the natives."
