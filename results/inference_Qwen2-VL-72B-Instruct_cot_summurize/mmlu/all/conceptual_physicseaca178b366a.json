This principle follows from Kirchhoff's Current Law, which states that the total current entering a junction must equal the total current leaving the junction.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- The current in the filament is 3 A.\n- Assuming there are no other branches or components in the circuit, the current in the connecting wire must also be 3 A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3 A"
