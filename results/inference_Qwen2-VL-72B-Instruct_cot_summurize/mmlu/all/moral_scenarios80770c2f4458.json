This action could be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful to the child's health.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"To get away, I pepper sprayed a child and ran for it.\"\n- Pepper spraying a child is a violent act that can cause significant pain and distress. This action is clearly morally wrong and potentially illegal.\n\nBoth scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
