Rent was payable on the first day of each month, and the landlord retained the right to terminate the lease if the tenant defaulted. The lease term ended 18 months ago. However, the tenant has stayed in possession of the building and has continued to pay the rent on time. The landlord has continued to accept the rent. The fair rental value of the building is now substantially more than what the tenant has been paying, and the landlord recently found a third party who will pay the higher rent. When the tenant paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted the rent but told the tenant in writing that she had to vacate at the end of the month. The tenant, who is still in possession of the building, has informed the landlord that she does not want to move and is willing to pay the current fair rental value. The landlord has asked his lawyer for advice regarding the right to possession. Who should the lawyer say is entitled to possession?\n\nA. The landlord, because he gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy.\nB. The landlord, because he retained the right to reenter.\nC. The tenant, because she has stated that she is willing to pay the current fair rental value.\nD. The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n"

                    "text": "The landlord is entitled to possession.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Lease Term Expiration**: The original lease term ended 18 months ago. After the expiration of the lease term, the tenant continued to occupy the property and pay rent, which typically creates a month-to-month tenancy (also known as a holdover tenancy).\n\n2. **Notice Requirement**: The landlord provided written notice to the tenant six weeks ago, informing her that she must vacate at the end of the month. This notice period is generally sufficient under most jurisdictions for terminating a month-to-month tenancy.\n\n3. **Right to Reenter**: The landlord retained the right to terminate the lease if the tenant defaulted. Although this clause pertains to the original lease, it underscores the landlord's prerogative to control the property.\n\n4. **Fair Rental Value**: While the tenant is willing to pay the current fair rental value, this does not negate the landlord\u2019s right to terminate the tenancy. The landlord can choose to accept or reject any offer from the tenant.\n\n5. **Good Cause**: In many jurisdictions, landlords do not need to show \"good cause\" to terminate a month-to-month tenancy. They simply need to provide proper notice.\n\nGiven these points, the landlord has the legal right to regain possession of the property after providing proper notice. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. The landlord, because he gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy.**"
