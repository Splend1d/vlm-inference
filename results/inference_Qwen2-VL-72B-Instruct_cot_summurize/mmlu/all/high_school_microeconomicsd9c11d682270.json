If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nD.

This principle states that consumers will allocate their spending so that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods.\n\nGiven:\n- The price of an apple (P_apple) = $1\n- The price of an orange (P_orange) = $2\n- Marginal Utility of apples (MU_apple) = 12\n- Marginal Utility of oranges (MU_orange) = 18\n\nFirst, calculate the marginal utility per dollar for each good:\n\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Dollar of Apples} = \\frac{\\text{MU_apple}}{\\text{P_apple}} = \\frac{12}{1} = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Dollar of Oranges} = \\frac{\\text{MU_orange}}{\\text{P_orange}} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n\nSince the marginal utility per dollar for apples (12) is greater than the marginal utility per dollar for oranges (9), Melanie should reallocate her spending to consume more apples and fewer oranges until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both."
