The stronger an acid is, the more it will ionize in solution.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the acids listed:\n\n1. **HNO2 (Nitrous Acid)**: This is a weak monoprotic acid.\n2. **HClO4 (Perchloric Acid)**: This is a strong monoprotic acid.\n3. **H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide)**: This is a weak diprotic acid.\n4. **H3PO4 (Phosphoric Acid)**: This is a weak triprotic acid.\n\nStrong acids completely ionize in water, while weak acids only partially ionize. Therefore, among these options, **HClO4** (perchloric acid) is the strongest acid and will have the highest percentage ionization when dissolved in water.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. HClO4**"
