When you multiply any number by 5 and then by an even number, the result will end in 0. This is because multiplying by 5 and then by 2 is essentially multiplying by 10, which always results in a number ending in 0.\n\nTherefore, without needing to calculate the entire product, we can conclude that the ones digit of the given product is 0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 0"
