It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.\n\nThis description accurately explains the concept of a Barr body, which refers to the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females. This process, known as Lyonization or X-chromosome inactivation, ensures that both males (XY) and females (XX) have one active X chromosome per cell, thus balancing gene expression between the sexes. The inactivated X chromosome condenses into a Barr body, which can be observed under a microscope in certain types of cells."
