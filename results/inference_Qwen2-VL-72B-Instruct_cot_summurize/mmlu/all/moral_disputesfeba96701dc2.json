However, it doesn't directly support the idea of a general prerogative for mothers to end a pregnancy.\n\nD. **there is no clear answer about the moral status of abortion.**\n   - This option indicates uncertainty about the morality of abortion, which does not provide a strong basis for accepting a prerogative to end a pregnancy.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most coherent and supportive option for Little's argument is:\n\n**A. we should accept a prerogative to decline radical changes to one's practical identity.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that mothers should have the prerogative to end a pregnancy due to the significant impact it has on their lives and identities."
