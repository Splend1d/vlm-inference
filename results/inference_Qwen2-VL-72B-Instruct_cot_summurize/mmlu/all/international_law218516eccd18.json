Yes, it has been consistently held by the Court since the La Grand case (2001) that they are binding.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has the authority to issue provisional measures in cases before it to prevent irreparable harm to the rights of a party pending the final decision on the merits of the case. Since the landmark LaGrand case in 2001, the ICJ has consistently held that its provisional measures are binding upon the parties. This means that states are expected to comply with such measures as part of their obligations under international law."
