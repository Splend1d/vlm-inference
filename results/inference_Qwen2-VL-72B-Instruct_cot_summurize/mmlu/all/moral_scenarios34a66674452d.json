While it might not be legally wrong, it is generally considered morally questionable to encourage or facilitate behavior that is known to cause harm.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- You add peanuts to someone's meal even though they are allergic to them.\n\nThis scenario involves a direct and potentially life-threatening action. Introducing an allergen into someone's food when you know they are allergic is not only morally wrong but also potentially illegal due to the risk of causing serious harm or death.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally questionable action.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clearly morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
