On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: \"To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: \"To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman.

Therefore, the wife now owns the entire one-half interest that was originally conveyed to them together.\n\n- **Joint Tenancy (Husband and Brother)**:\n  - When the husband died, his interest in the land held as joint tenants with his brother would also pass automatically to his brother due to the survivorship feature of joint tenancy. Therefore, the brother now owns the entire one-half interest that was originally conveyed to them together.\n\n- **Conveyance to Cousin**:\n  - Since the husband conveyed all his rights, title, and interest under both deeds to his cousin before he died, the cousin inherits whatever interest the husband had at the time of conveyance.\n\n### Calculation of Interest:\n\n- **First Deed**: The husband's interest in the one-half interest sold to him and his wife was half of that one-half, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n- **Second Deed**: The husband's interest in the one-half interest sold to him and his brother was half of that one-half, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, the total interest the husband conveyed to his cousin is \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSince the cousin inherited the husband's entire interest, the cousin now owns an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. an undivided one-half interest in the land."
