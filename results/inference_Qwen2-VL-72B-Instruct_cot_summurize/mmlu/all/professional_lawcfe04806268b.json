However, there are exceptions, such as when a defendant introduces evidence of their own good character or when character is directly at issue. In this case, the neighbor's testimony about the man being a \"good neighbor\" does not relate to any pertinent trait of the man's character that would be relevant to the specific incident in question (i.e., whether he acted in self-defense). Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible."
