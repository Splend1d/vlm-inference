Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles that compartmentalize various metabolic processes, which can increase efficiency by isolating different reactions.\n\nB. **Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ significantly, they do share some basic structural features such as cell membranes and ribosomes.\n\nC. **The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. Organelles do not directly address the surface area-to-volume ratio issue; instead, eukaryotic cells often use infoldings of the plasma membrane (e.g., mitochondria) or other strategies to manage this ratio.\n\nD. **Eukaryotic cells are able to multiply faster based on their more complex structure.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. In fact, eukaryotic cells generally divide more slowly than prokaryotic cells due to their complexity and the need for more intricate division processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.**"
