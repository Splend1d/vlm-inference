Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n"

In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nExplanation: Hydrangea flowers can change color based on the pH level of the soil in which they are grown. This is an example of how environmental factors (in this case, soil pH) can influence the expression of a genetic trait. The color of the flowers is not determined solely by their genetic makeup but also by the environmental conditions they experience."
