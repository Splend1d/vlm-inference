Expansionary policy greatly increases aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate.\n\nIn a deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, can stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing and spending. This is particularly effective if investment is sensitive to changes in interest rates, as lower rates can incentivize businesses to invest more, thereby increasing aggregate demand and potentially helping to pull the economy out of recession."
