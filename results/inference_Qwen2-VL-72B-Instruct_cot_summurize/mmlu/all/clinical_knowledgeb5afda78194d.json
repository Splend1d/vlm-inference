The conversion factor typically used is that 1 liter of oxygen consumed is equivalent to about 20 kilojoules (kJ) of energy expended.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean rate of oxygen consumption = 2 liters per minute\n\nUsing the conversion factor:\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = \\text{Oxygen consumption} \\times \\text{Conversion factor} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 2 \\, \\text{l/min} \\times 20 \\, \\text{kJ/l} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 40 \\, \\text{kJ/min} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 40 kJ/min."
