However, for the purpose of this problem, we can estimate or use numerical methods to find that the intersection occurs at approximately \\(x \\approx 0.828\\).\n\nNow, we'll integrate the difference between the two functions from 0 to this intersection point:\n\n\\[Area = \\int_{0}^{0.828} (\\cos(x) - x^2) dx\\]\n\nLet's calculate this integral:\n\n\\[Area = \\left[ \\sin(x) - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{0.828}\\]\n\n\\[= \\sin(0.828) - \\frac{(0.828)^3}{3} - (\\sin(0) - \\frac{0^3}{3})\\]\n\n\\[= \\sin(0.828) - \\frac{0.828^3}{3}\\]\n\nUsing a calculator to evaluate this expression gives us:\n\n\\[Area \\approx 0.731 - 0.223\\]\n\n\\[Area \\approx 0.508\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.508."
