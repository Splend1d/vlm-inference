This critique likely played a significant role in shifting perspectives towards environmental security.\n\nB. **There became a growing recognition that environmental changes do not merely pose risks to ecosystems - they also pose risks to human well-being.**\n   - This option indicates an increased awareness that environmental issues have direct impacts on human health and well-being. This realization would certainly contribute to the emergence of environmental security concerns.\n\nC. **A shared environmental consciousness emerged in developing countries.**\n   - The development of a shared environmental consciousness in developing countries implies a broader understanding and concern for environmental issues, which could also contribute to the emergence of environmental security.\n\nGiven that all three options describe developments that would logically lead to the emergence of environmental security concerns, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**D. All of these options.**\n\nThus, the final answer is D."
