Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Bacterial vaginosis\nB. Candidiasis\nC. Chlamydia trachomatis infection\nD. Escherichia coli infection\n"

Candidiasis\n\nThe symptoms of erythema of the vulva and vagina, along with a thick white vaginal discharge and a normal vaginal pH of 4, are characteristic of a yeast infection, which is commonly caused by Candida species. The recent use of antibiotics (amoxicillin) can disrupt the normal vaginal flora, making the patient more susceptible to a yeast infection.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Bacterial vaginosis typically presents with a thin, homogeneous discharge that has an unpleasant odor and a higher vaginal pH (usually above 4.5).\n\nC. Chlamydia trachomatis infection usually does not present with such prominent symptoms as erythema and a thick discharge. It often causes a mucopurulent cervical discharge and may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.\n\nD. Escherichia coli infection is not typically associated with vaginal symptoms like those described. E. coli infections are more commonly associated with urinary tract infections, which might present with dysuria but without the vaginal discharge and erythema described here.\n\nGiven the history and clinical presentation, candidiasis is the most probable diagnosis."
