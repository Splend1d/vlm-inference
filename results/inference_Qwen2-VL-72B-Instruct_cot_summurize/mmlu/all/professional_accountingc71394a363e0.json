Two employees, who work in different departments, are circumventing an internal control.\n\nThis situation can be particularly challenging because it involves collusion between individuals from separate areas within the organization. Collusion can make it harder for auditors to detect because it often bypasses standard controls and may not leave obvious traces. The other scenarios (neglect by the accounting staff, a programming error, or an accidental disabling of edit checks) might be more straightforward to uncover through routine audits, reviews of system logs, or testing of controls."
