Inspired by a progressive revolt against the chemical company's domination of the state government, the corporate official's opponent, won by an extremely close margin. After the new governor took office, he vowed to get back at the company that owned the local newspaper for its newspaper's endorsement of the corporate official. Using his influence, the new governor was instrumental in getting the state legislature to pass a bill that imposed a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation. The tax bill was signed into law by the governor. The strongest constitutional basis upon which to challenge the validity of the tax would be the\n\nA. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. bill of attainder provision under Article I, Section 10.\nC. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis is because the imposition of a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals could be seen as a targeted measure aimed at suppressing or punishing speech, which is protected under the First Amendment. The First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and any law that appears to single out and penalize the press for its editorial content or endorsements could be viewed as a violation of this fundamental right. The Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the protections of the First Amendment to apply to state governments, ensuring that states cannot infringe upon these freedoms either."
