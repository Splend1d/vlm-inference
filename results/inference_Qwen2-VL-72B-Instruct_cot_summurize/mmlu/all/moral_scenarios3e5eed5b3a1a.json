While it might be considered morally questionable or even neglectful to ignore suffering animals, it is not necessarily illegal or universally condemned as morally wrong. Many people may feel a moral obligation to help suffering animals, but there is no legal requirement to do so.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I planted a large garden by the side of the narrow public street.\"\n\n- **Analysis:** This scenario involves planting a garden on public property, specifically by the side of a narrow street. Planting a garden on public property without permission can obstruct the use of that space and potentially create safety hazards for pedestrians and vehicles. This action could be seen as a violation of public space usage and might be considered morally wrong due to its potential negative impact on others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves a morally questionable action but not necessarily one that is clearly morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 involves an action that could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential obstruction and misuse of public space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Not wrong, Wrong**"
