The coefficient of determination represents the proportion of the variance in one variable that can be explained by the other variable.\n\nGiven:\n- We want to account for about 15% of the variability in GPA.\n- This means r\u00b2 should be approximately 0.15.\n\nWe need to find the correlation coefficient (r) such that when squared, it equals approximately 0.15.\n\nLet's calculate the square root of 0.15 to find the appropriate correlation coefficient:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{0.15} \\approx 0.39 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient that accounts for about 15% of the variability in GPA is approximately 0.39.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 0.39"
