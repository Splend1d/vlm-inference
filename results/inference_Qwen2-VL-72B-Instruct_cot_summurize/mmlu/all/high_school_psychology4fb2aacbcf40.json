They advocate for a broader approach to education that acknowledges and nurtures various forms of intelligence, including spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligences. This broader approach encourages a more holistic development of students' abilities and talents."
