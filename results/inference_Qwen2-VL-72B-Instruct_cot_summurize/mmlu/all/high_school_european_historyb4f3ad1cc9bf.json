And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. \u2026\nWhensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\nJohn Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when\n\nA. it is weak and can be overthrown\nB. when the people wish to change governors\nC. when it becomes corrupt\nD. it tries to exercise absolute power\n"

It emphasizes that the purpose of government is to preserve the lives, liberties, and possessions of its citizens.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - The power of the government should aim at preserving the society (i.e., the lives, liberties, and possessions of the people).\n   - This power must not be absolute or arbitrary but should be used to make laws that help preserve the community.\n   - The origin of this power comes from the mutual consent of the people through a compact or agreement.\n   - If the government breaches this trust by attempting to gain absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people, it forfeits its legitimacy.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"It is weak and can be overthrown\" \u2013 The passage does not discuss the legitimacy of a government based on its strength or vulnerability to overthrow.\n   - **Option B**: \"When the people wish to change governors\" \u2013 The passage does not mention the legitimacy of a government being contingent on the people's desire to change leaders.\n   - **Option C**: \"When it becomes corrupt\" \u2013 While corruption is mentioned, the passage focuses more specifically on the misuse of power rather than just corruption itself.\n   - **Option D**: \"It tries to exercise absolute power\" \u2013 This directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on the government losing legitimacy if it attempts to gain absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate inference is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. It tries to exercise absolute power**"
