The hydrogen atom undergoes rapid intermolecular exchange.\n\nIn NMR spectroscopy, a singlet in the 1H spectrum indicates that the hydrogen nucleus does not experience any splitting due to coupling with other nuclei. In the case of chloroform (CHCl3), the hydrogen nucleus would normally couple with the chlorine nuclei if they were present in a static environment. However, because chloroform molecules can undergo rapid intermolecular exchange (i.e., the hydrogen atoms can rapidly exchange between different chloroform molecules), this averaging effect leads to a single peak for the hydrogen signal rather than a split pattern that would be expected from coupling with the chlorine isotopes.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because neither 35Cl nor 37Cl have a nuclear spin quantum number (I) of 0; both isotopes have I = 3/2. Option C is also incorrect because whether the molecule is rigid or not does not directly affect the appearance of a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum in this context."
