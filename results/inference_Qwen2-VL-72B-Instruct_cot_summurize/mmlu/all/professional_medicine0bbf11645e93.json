She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor\nB. Cushing syndrome\nC. Hypothyroidism\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n"

                    "text": "D. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical findings are most consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and infertility. The patient's history of amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), weight gain, acne, and hirsutism, along with the physical examination findings of slightly enlarged ovaries and uterus, are all indicative of PCOS.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor: While this can cause similar symptoms such as hirsutism and menstrual irregularities, it would typically present with more severe symptoms and possibly with signs of virilization (masculinization).\n\nB. Cushing syndrome: This condition is associated with excessive production of cortisol, leading to symptoms like central obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, and purple striae, which were not described in the patient's presentation.\n\nC. Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause weight gain and menstrual irregularities, but it usually does not present with hirsutism and acne as prominently as seen in this patient.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate diagnosis based on the given information is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)."
