They argue that behaviors have evolved because they contribute to reproductive success. In this context, the central function of sex is seen as reproduction, as it ensures the continuation of genes into future generations. While pleasure and other factors may play roles in sexual behavior, sociobiologists emphasize reproduction as the primary evolutionary purpose."
