                    "text": "To determine the correct translation of the statement \"All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit\" into predicate logic, let's analyze each option step by step.\n\nThe original statement can be broken down as follows:\n- \"All jellybeans\" translates to (\u2200x)(Jx).\n- \"are sweeter than\" translates to Sxy.\n- \"all fruit\" translates to (\u2200y)(Fy).\n\nSo, the logical structure should be:\n(\u2200x)(Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy))\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. (\u2200x)[Fx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Jy \u2283 Sxy)]\nThis option suggests that if something is a fruit (Fx), then for all jellybeans (Jy), it is sweeter than them (Sxy). This does not match the original statement because it implies that fruits are sweeter than jellybeans, which is the opposite of what we need.\n\nB. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Fx \u2022 Jy) \u2022 Sxy]\nThis option states that for all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. Again, this implies that fruits are sweeter than jellybeans, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nC. (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[Sxy \u2283 (Fy \u2022 Jx)]\nThis option suggests that if x is sweeter than y (Sxy), then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. This does not capture the intended meaning either, as it does not directly state that all jellybeans are sweeter than all fruits.\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]\nThis option correctly states that for all x, if x is a jellybean (Jx), then for all y, if y is a fruit (Fy), x is sweeter than y (Sxy). This matches the original statement perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Jx \u2283 (\u2200y)(Fy \u2283 Sxy)]"
