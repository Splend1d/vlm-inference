The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately 149.6 million kilometers (or 1.496 x 10^8 kilometers).\n\nGiven that the distance between the Earth and Altair is one million times greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance to Altair} = (\\text{Distance to the Sun}) \\times 1,000,000 \\]\n\nFirst, convert the distance to the Sun into meters:\n\\[ 149.6 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{km} = 149.6 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{m} = 149.6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, multiply by one million:\n\\[ 149.6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1,000,000 = 149.6 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 1.496 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNone of the provided options exactly match this value, but the closest option is:\n\nD. \\( 1.5 \\times 10^{17} \\) meters\n\nSo, the correct answer is D."
