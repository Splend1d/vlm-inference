This reduces the risk of insertional mutagenesis, which is the disruption of normal cellular genes by the insertion of viral DNA. However, adenoviruses do have some limitations, such as short-term expression and potential immunogenicity. They are also relatively difficult to assemble compared to other viral vectors."
