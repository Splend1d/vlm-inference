Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds.\n\nAfter translation, proteins can undergo various post-translational modifications (PTMs) that alter their structure and function. These include lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation. However, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a typical post-translational modification. Instead, this would be considered an extension of the translation process itself."
