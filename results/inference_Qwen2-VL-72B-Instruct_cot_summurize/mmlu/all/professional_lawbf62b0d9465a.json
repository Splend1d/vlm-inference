The airline that owned and operated the airplane is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C. One day before the statute of limitations on their claims would have run, the estates of the pilot and each of the passengers filed a wrongful death action against the airline in federal court in State A. The airline was served one week later and wants to prevent the State A federal court from hearing the action. Which of the following motions is most likely to accomplish the airline's goal?\n\nA. A motion to dismiss the action for improper venue.\nB. A motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nC. A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n"

A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n\nThis is because the airline is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C, which makes it a more appropriate venue for the lawsuit. Transferring the case to a federal court in State C could be seen as more convenient for the airline and potentially more relevant given the location of its operations and where the decisions regarding the airplane's maintenance and operation were made. \n\nWhile options A, B, and C might also be considered, they are less likely to succeed based on the information provided. A motion to dismiss for improper venue (A) or lack of personal jurisdiction (B) would require demonstrating that the court in State A does not have the proper venue or lacks jurisdiction over the defendant, which may be difficult given the circumstances. A motion under the doctrine of forum non conveniens (C) involves showing that another forum is more appropriate, but this is often a more complex argument compared to simply transferring the case to a more convenient location for the defendant."
