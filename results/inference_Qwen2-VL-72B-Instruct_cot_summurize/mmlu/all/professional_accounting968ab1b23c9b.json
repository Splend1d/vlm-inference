This aligns well with obtaining evidence about subsequent events.\n\nC. **Compare the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year.**\n   - While this comparison can provide insights into trends and changes, it does not specifically address the occurrence of subsequent events.\n\nD. **Trace information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions.**\n   - This procedure is primarily used to verify the completeness and accuracy of recorded sales transactions and does not directly relate to subsequent events.\n\nGiven the analysis, the procedure that best aligns with obtaining evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events is:\n\n**B. Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.**\n\nThis approach allows the auditor to understand if there have been any changes or adjustments to these transactions post-reporting period, which is crucial for assessing subsequent events."
