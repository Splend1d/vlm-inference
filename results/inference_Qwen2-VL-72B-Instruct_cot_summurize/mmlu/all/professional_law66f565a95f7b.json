As part of an elaborate plan to increase the city's tourist trade and revive the local economy, the city planned to sell the beach houses to a company that would demolish the houses and build a luxury hotel in their place. The owners of the beach houses have challenged the city's exercise of eminent domain, contending only that the city's plan is unconstitutional. Will the owners of the beach houses be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.\nB. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\nC. Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\nD. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.\n"

No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\n\nIn the context of eminent domain, the key issue is whether the taking serves a \"public use.\" While traditionally this meant literal public use (like roads or schools), courts have increasingly interpreted \"public use\" more broadly to include actions that serve a public purpose, such as economic development. In this scenario, the city's plan to increase the tourist trade and revive the local economy by selling the beach houses to a private developer for the construction of a luxury hotel could be seen as serving a public purpose. Therefore, the owners' challenge based solely on the unconstitutionality of the plan is unlikely to succeed if the court finds that the economic development goal constitutes a valid public use."
