All of the options given are correct\n\nSevere Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development and function of the immune system, leaving affected individuals highly susceptible to infections. The signs most suggestive of SCID include:\n\nA. Recurrent severe infections: Infants with SCID often experience frequent and severe infections, which can be life-threatening.\n\nB. Family history of unexplained death in infancy: A family history of unexplained infant deaths may suggest an inherited condition like SCID.\n\nC. Generalised spread of the Tuberculosis strain BCG after vaccination: The Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine, used to prevent tuberculosis, can cause disseminated disease in infants with SCID because their immune systems cannot handle the live attenuated bacteria in the vaccine.\n\nTherefore, all of the options provided are correct as they are indicative of severe combined immunodeficiency."
