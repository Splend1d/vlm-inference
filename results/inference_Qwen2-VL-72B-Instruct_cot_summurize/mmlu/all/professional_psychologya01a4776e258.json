Older parents typically have more income for additional expenses due to established careers\n\nThis option highlights one of the potential advantages of having children later in life. By the age of 30, many individuals have had more time to establish their careers and financial stability, which can provide a more secure economic foundation for raising children. This financial security can help cover the costs associated with child-rearing, such as childcare, education, and healthcare.\n\nWhile the other options may present some valid points, they do not accurately reflect general advantages of having children after the age of 30:\n\nB. Older mothers generally face higher risks of medical complications during pregnancy and birth, rather than fewer.\nC. Expectations about children's behavior are not necessarily related to the age at which one becomes a parent.\nD. Physical energy and time to play with young children might be more prevalent among younger parents."
