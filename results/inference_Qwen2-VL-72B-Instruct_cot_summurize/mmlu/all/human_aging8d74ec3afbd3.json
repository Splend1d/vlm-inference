Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, which may help protect against cognitive decline and dementia. However, it's important to note that while some studies have found a link between fish consumption and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's, more research is needed to fully understand this relationship.\n\nThe other options listed do not have a clear association with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's:\n\nA. Being African or Hispanic American: There is no evidence to suggest that being African or Hispanic American is associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.\nC. A lower level of education: Lower levels of education have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's, rather than a decreased risk.\nD. Being married: While social support and engagement can be beneficial for overall health and well-being, there is no strong evidence to suggest that being married specifically decreases the risk of Alzheimer's."
