True, True\n\nBoosting combines multiple weak learners into a strong learner, and while the individual weak learners might have simple decision boundaries, the final classifier can have a more complex decision boundary due to the combination of these weak learners. However, each weak learner's decision boundary remains the same in form, just with different parameters. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nCross-validation can indeed be used to tune hyperparameters such as the number of iterations in boosting. This helps prevent overfitting by selecting the optimal number of iterations that generalizes well to unseen data. Thus, Statement 2 is also true."
