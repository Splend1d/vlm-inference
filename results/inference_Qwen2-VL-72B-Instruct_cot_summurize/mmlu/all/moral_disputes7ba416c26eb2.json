However, the argument explicitly states that homosexuals are \"born that way,\" so this option does not address the core issue.\n\nB. **It assumes that all innate desires are good ones.**\n   - This option points out that the argument makes a leap from being born with a certain trait (homosexuality) to concluding that the behavior associated with that trait (homosexual activity) is inherently good and natural. This assumption\u2014that all innate desires or traits are morally good\u2014is problematic and could indeed make the argument unsound.\n\nC. **It is equivalent to recognizing that homosexuality is unusual.**\n   - This option suggests that the argument equates being born with a particular trait to being unusual, which doesn't directly address the logical flaw in the argument. The argument's unsoundness is more about the moral evaluation of innate traits rather than their prevalence.\n\nD. **None of the above**\n   - This option would imply that none of the provided reasons explain why the argument is unsound, but we have already identified a valid reason in option B.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate reason for why Corvino claims the argument is unsound is:\n\n**B. It assumes that all innate desires are good ones.**"
