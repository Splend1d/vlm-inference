Specific performance.\n\nSpecific performance is a legal remedy that compels the breaching party (in this case, the seller) to fulfill their contractual obligations. Since the buyer has tendered the full amount as per the contract but the seller has refused to deliver the car, specific performance would require the seller to hand over the car to the buyer as originally agreed upon. This remedy is particularly suitable when the subject matter of the contract (the used car) is unique or when monetary damages would not adequately compensate the buyer for the loss."
