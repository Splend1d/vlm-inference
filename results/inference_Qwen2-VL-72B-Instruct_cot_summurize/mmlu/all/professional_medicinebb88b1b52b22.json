The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Ductography\nB. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\nC. Repeat mammography\nD. Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast\n"

This imaging technique involves injecting contrast material into the ducts of the breast to visualize any abnormalities or blockages that may be causing the discharge. It can help identify the source of the discharge and guide further diagnostic procedures such as biopsy if necessary."
