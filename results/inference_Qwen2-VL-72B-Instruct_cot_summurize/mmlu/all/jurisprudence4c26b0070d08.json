A morality of aspiration.\n\nFuller's 'inner morality of law' refers to the idea that laws should be aspirational and promote certain moral values, rather than simply being a set of rules to be followed. This contrasts with a positivist view of law, which focuses on the existence and validity of laws based on social facts, and an Aquinian concept of natural law, which emphasizes the inherent goodness or badness of actions. The 'harm principle' is not directly related to Fuller's concept of the inner morality of law."
