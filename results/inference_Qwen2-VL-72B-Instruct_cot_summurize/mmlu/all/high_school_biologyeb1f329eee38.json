Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n"

Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the concept of natural selection and resistance development in populations. When DDT was first introduced, it likely killed most mosquitoes that were susceptible to it. However, some mosquitoes may have had genetic variations that made them resistant to DDT. As the susceptible mosquitoes were killed off, the resistant ones survived and reproduced, leading to an increase in the frequency of the resistant trait in the mosquito population over time. This process is a classic example of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection."
