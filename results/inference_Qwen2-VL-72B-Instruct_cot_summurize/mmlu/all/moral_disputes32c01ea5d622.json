It suggests that if we grant full moral standing to certain humans (such as infants or those with severe cognitive impairments) who may have cognitive abilities similar to some animals, then it becomes difficult to justify excluding those animals from full moral consideration. This argument challenges criteria for moral standing that rely solely on cognitive abilities or other characteristics that some humans possess but many animals do not."
