On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website.\" She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?\n\nA. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.\nB. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\nC. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.\nD. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.\n"

The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\n\nIn legal terms, when a user is presented with a clear and conspicuous notice that creating an account constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions, and those terms are readily accessible (e.g., via a clickable link), it is generally considered sufficient to bind the user to the contract. The fact that the notice was in bold letters and the terms were accessible by clicking a link suggests that the company took reasonable steps to inform the user about the contractual agreement. Therefore, the company is likely to prevail in this scenario."
