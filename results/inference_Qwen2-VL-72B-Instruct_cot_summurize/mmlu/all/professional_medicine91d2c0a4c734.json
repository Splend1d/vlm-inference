Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition in which a person with one or more X chromosomes is resistant to androgens, leading to the development of female physical characteristics despite having male genetic makeup (XY). This can result in a lack of menstruation, normal breast development, and absence of pubic and axillary hair, as seen in the patient's presentation."
