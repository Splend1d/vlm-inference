They might view physical symptoms such as ulcers, hypertension, and tension headaches as manifestations of deeper psychological or existential issues, such as a lack of alignment with one's personal values or a sense of disconnection from oneself or the world. These therapists would likely explore these symptoms as potential indicators of underlying emotional or existential distress rather than treating them solely as physical ailments."
