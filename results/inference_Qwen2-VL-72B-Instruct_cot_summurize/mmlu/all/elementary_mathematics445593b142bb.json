Since there are 9 white soccer balls out of a total of 30, we subtract the white balls from the total:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total soccer balls} - \\text{White soccer balls} = \\text{Non-white soccer balls} \\]\n\\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \\]\n\nSo, there are 21 non-white soccer balls. These non-white soccer balls are equally divided into three colors: blue, pink, and green.\n\nTo find out how many soccer balls are of each color, we divide the number of non-white soccer balls by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Non-white soccer balls}}{3} = \\text{Soccer balls per color} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, Coach Wu has 7 green soccer balls.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 7."
