However, courts typically do not act on their own initiative unless there is a clear violation of law.\n   \n   - **Option B: Plain Error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination**.\n     - The defendant's refusal to take a lie detector test could be seen as self-incriminating. However, the initial declaration of innocence does not inherently violate the privilege against self-incrimination.\n   \n   - **Option C: Harmless Error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection**.\n     - Since the defense attorney did not object to the detective's testimony, any error in admitting this evidence would generally be considered harmless unless it can be shown that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\n   \n   - **Option D: Harmless Error, because the defendant's statements were admissions**.\n     - The defendant's initial declaration of innocence is not an admission of guilt. Refusal to take a lie detector test might be seen as an admission of guilt, but it is not a direct admission of the crime itself.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**Option C: Harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.**\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the failure to object at trial means the error (if any) must be evaluated under the harmless error doctrine."
