It gives rise to several structures, including:\n\n- The neural tube, which eventually develops into the brain and spinal cord.\n- Ectomesenchymal cells, which contribute to various tissues such as bone, cartilage, and connective tissue.\n- Dental enamel, which is the hard outer layer of teeth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all three structures."
