The company expensed the $90,000 cash payment in October, year 1, to its services expense general ledger account.

Since the payment was made on October 31, year 1, only two months (November and December) fall within year 1. Therefore, the portion of the payment that should be recognized as an expense in year 1 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{6} \\times \\$90,000 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\$90,000 = \\$30,000 \\]\n\nThis means that $30,000 should be recognized as an expense in year 1, and the remaining $60,000 should be deferred as a prepaid expense to be recognized in year 2.\n\nSince the company initially expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1, it needs to adjust this by crediting services expense for $60,000 (to reduce the overstated expense) and debiting prepaid services for $60,000 (to recognize the prepaid amount).\n\nTherefore, the correct adjusting journal entry is:\n\nDebit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000."
