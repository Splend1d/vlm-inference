In this scenario, the man-platform system is considered a closed system if no external torques are applied.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.**\n   - Catching the baseball introduces an external force (and thus an external torque) on the man-platform system because the baseball has angular momentum relative to the system. This external torque can change the angular momentum of the man-platform system.\n\nB. **The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.**\n   - When the man thrusts his arms out, he redistributes his mass within the system but does not introduce any external torque. The angular momentum of the man-platform system remains conserved.\n\nC. **The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.**\n   - Similar to option B, this action involves internal redistribution of mass without introducing any external torque. The angular momentum of the system remains unchanged.\n\nD. **The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform.**\n   - Jumping straight up introduces a vertical component of motion but does not involve any horizontal displacement or rotation that would introduce an external torque. Thus, the angular momentum of the man-platform system remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could change the angular momentum of the man-platform system is:\n\n**A. The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.**"
