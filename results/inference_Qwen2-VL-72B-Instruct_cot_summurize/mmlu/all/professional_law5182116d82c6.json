The statute does not, however, restrict the sale of red meat products. Producers of red meat have challenged the statute as a violation of their free speech rights protected by the First Amendment. Is the court likely to find the statute constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it does not serve a substantial government interest.\nB. No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers.\nC. Yes, because it does not affect speech protected by the First Amendment.\nD. Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.\n"

Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.\n\nThe court is likely to find the statute constitutional if it determines that the prohibition on commercial advertising of red meat products serves a legitimate government interest, such as protecting public health. Given that scientific studies show a causal relationship between the consumption of red meat and certain forms of cancer, the government has a compelling interest in reducing the risk of these diseases through measures like restricting advertising. This restriction would be evaluated under intermediate scrutiny, where the government must demonstrate that the regulation directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. If the court finds that the statute meets these criteria, it would likely be upheld as constitutional."
