An assignment of future rights from future contracts.\n\nIn contract law, it is generally true that all contractual rights may be assigned unless there are specific exceptions. The exceptions typically include:\n\n- Assignments that continue the obligor's duty or risk (Option A).\n- Assignments not allowed by law (Option B).\n- Assignments that substantially change the obligor's duty or risk (Option D).\n\nHowever, assignments of future rights from future contracts (Option C) are not inherently prohibited as an exception to the general rule. Future rights can often be assigned, provided they are sufficiently certain and identifiable at the time of the assignment."
