It could be seen as putting away or storing a weapon, which is a neutral or even responsible action.\n- There is no indication of harm or wrongdoing in this context.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"I ran a comb through my husband's hair.\"**\n- Running a comb through someone's hair is typically a benign and caring action, especially if it is done with consent and care.\n- This action is generally considered normal and positive within a relationship.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario appears to involve an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
