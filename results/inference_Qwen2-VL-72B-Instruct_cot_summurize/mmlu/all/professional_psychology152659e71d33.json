This involves assessing the defendant's ability to comprehend the charges, the potential consequences of the trial, and to participate in their own defense. The other options listed (ability to distinguish right from wrong, mental state at the time of the crime, and DSM-IV diagnosis) are more relevant to the issue of criminal responsibility or insanity, rather than competence to stand trial."
