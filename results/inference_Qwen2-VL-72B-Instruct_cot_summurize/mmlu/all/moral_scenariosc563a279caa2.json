This could be seen as selfish or unfair, especially if others are left without food. However, it is not necessarily morally wrong to ensure one's own survival or sustenance, particularly if the scarcity is unexpected and temporary.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Context: The main character has candy-coated pills that resemble candy.\n- Action: The main character puts the pills on a high shelf to prevent their younger sibling from accessing them.\n- Analysis: In this scenario, the main character is taking a proactive measure to protect their younger sibling from potential harm. By placing the pills out of reach, they are acting responsibly and ethically to prevent accidental ingestion.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 might be considered morally questionable due to the prioritization of self-interest in a situation of scarcity.\n- Scenario 2 is clearly a responsible and morally right action aimed at preventing harm to another person.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
