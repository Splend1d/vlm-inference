Anscombe, in her work \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" argues for a return to Aristotelian ethics and criticizes the prevailing moral philosophy of her time. She suggests that an adequate moral psychology should indeed encompass various aspects, including addressing the mind-body problem (which relates to understanding the nature of human beings), analyzing concepts like \"action\" and \"intention\" (central to understanding moral agency), and explaining the possibility of free will (crucial for discussions on moral responsibility). Therefore, all of these elements are considered important by Anscombe for developing a robust moral psychology."
