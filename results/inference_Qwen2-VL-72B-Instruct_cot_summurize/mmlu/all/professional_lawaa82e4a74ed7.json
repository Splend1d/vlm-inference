(2) In 1982, the man died a widower and devised the tract of land to his assistant by a will that was duly admitted to probate. (3) In 1993, the assistant mortgaged the tract of land to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9\u00c2\u00bd percent interest per annum. (4) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage. (5) In 2003, in a signed writing, which the assistant delivered to his daughter, the assistant promised to convey the tract of land to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. If the assistant refused to convey the tract of land to the daughter and the daughter brings suit against the assistant to compel a conveyance of the property, the daughter will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because there was an effective gift.\nB. prevail, because there was an effective assignment.\nC. not prevail, because there was no consideration to support the assistant's promise to convey the property.\nD. not prevail, because specific performance will not be granted where there is an adequate remedy at law.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the outcome of the daughter's lawsuit against the assistant to compel a conveyance of the property, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Gifts and Consideration**: A gift is a gratuitous transfer of property without any consideration. For a gift to be legally binding, it must be completed by delivery of the property or by a valid inter vivos transfer. In this case, the assistant promised to convey the property but did not actually deliver the deed or complete the transfer. Therefore, there was no effective gift.\n\n2. **Assignment**: An assignment involves transferring rights under a contract or other legal instrument from one party to another. The assistant's promise to convey the property and pay off the mortgage does not constitute an assignment since it was not a transfer of existing rights under a contract but rather a new promise.\n\n3. **Consideration**: For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties. The assistant's promise to convey the property and pay off the mortgage was made unilaterally and without any stated consideration from the daughter. Without consideration, the promise is not legally binding.\n\n4. **Specific Performance**: Specific performance is an equitable remedy used when monetary damages would not adequately compensate the plaintiff. It requires the defendant to perform their contractual obligations. However, courts generally do not grant specific performance if there is an adequate remedy at law, such as monetary damages.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- There was no effective gift because the property was not actually transferred.\n- There was no effective assignment because the assistant's promise did not involve transferring existing rights.\n- There was no consideration to support the assistant's promise, making it unenforceable.\n- Even if the daughter could argue for specific performance, courts typically require consideration for such promises.\n\nTherefore, the daughter will most likely **not prevail** because there was no consideration to support the assistant's promise to convey the property.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. not prevail, because there was no consideration to support the assistant's promise to convey the property."
