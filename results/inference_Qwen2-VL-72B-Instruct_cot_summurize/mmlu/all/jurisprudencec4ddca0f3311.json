We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.\n\nDavid Hume, an influential Scottish philosopher, argued that moral judgments are not derived from reason but rather from sentiment and feeling. He contended that we cannot derive \"ought\" from \"is,\" meaning that we cannot infer moral obligations (what ought to be) directly from statements of fact (what is). This critique challenges the idea that there is an objective, discoverable set of natural laws that dictate moral behavior."
