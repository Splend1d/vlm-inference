Since the question asks for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, we should aim to maximize the number of single-occupancy computers.\n\nIf we allocate one computer per student, we would need 26 computers, which exceeds the available 18. Therefore, we need to share some computers.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(x\\) as the number of students who have a computer to themselves.\n- \\(y\\) as the number of students who share a computer (with each shared computer accommodating 2 students).\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ x + y = 26 \\]\n\\[ x + \\frac{y}{2} = 18 \\] (since each shared computer is counted as half a computer per student)\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\\[ x + \\frac{y}{2} = 18 \\]\n\\[ 2x + y = 36 \\] (multiplying the first equation by 2)\n\\[ 2x + y - (x + y) = 36 - 26 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is 10.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 10."
