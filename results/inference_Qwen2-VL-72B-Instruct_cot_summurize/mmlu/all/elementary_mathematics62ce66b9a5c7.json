The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40). This statement is true.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place (4), because \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 0.4\\), not 0.04. This statement is false.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place (400) is not 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place (4), because \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\), not 400. This statement is false.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is indeed 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04), because \\(0.04 \\times 10 = 0.4\\). This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and D. However, since the question asks for a single true statement, it seems there might have been an oversight in the formulation of the question or the options provided. Based on the analysis, both A and D are individually true, but if only one answer can be selected, the question might need clarification."
