There is no inherent moral wrongdoing in this scenario unless there are specific circumstances that make it unsafe, which are not mentioned here.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I got more strikeouts because I used an illegal substance on the ball.\"\n- Using an illegal substance to gain an unfair advantage in sports is widely considered cheating and unethical. This action violates the principles of fair play and honesty, which are fundamental values in sports and society at large.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
