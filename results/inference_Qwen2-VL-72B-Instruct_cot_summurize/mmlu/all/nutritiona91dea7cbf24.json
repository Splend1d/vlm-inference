Cross-links formed by oxidation of -SH groups of cysteine to form disulphide bridges render the amino acid unavailable to digestion.\n\nThis is because disulphide bridges (S-S bonds) are covalent bonds that can stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein, making it more resistant to denaturation and digestion. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is its primary structure, not tertiary structure.\nC. Cross-links between the \u03b5-amino group of lysine and the carboxyl group of glutamate do not necessarily render the amino acids unavailable for digestion; they contribute to the stability of the protein's tertiary structure but do not prevent digestion entirely.\nD. Not all proteins have the same secondary structure; secondary structures can vary widely among different proteins."
