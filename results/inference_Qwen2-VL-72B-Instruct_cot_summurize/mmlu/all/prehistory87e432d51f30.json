This era saw the development of new and improved stone tool technologies, such as blades and burins, which were more sophisticated than earlier tools. There was also a broadening of the subsistence base, with humans adapting to a wider range of environments and developing new hunting and gathering strategies. Additionally, Upper Paleolithic sites often show evidence of larger populations and more complex social structures, indicating increased social organization and cooperation. Therefore, all of the options A, B, and C are correct."
