Summary judgment can be entered only after all discovery has been completed.\nB. Motion for summary judgment is the proper motion on the ground that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action.\nC. Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD. If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\n"

If plaintiff's proofs submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment are not contradicted and if plaintiff's proofs show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, summary judgment will be granted even if defendant's answer denied plaintiff's complaint.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Option A** is incorrect because summary judgment can be sought before all discovery is completed, although it is often more common after substantial discovery has taken place.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because a motion to dismiss (often referred to as a demurrer in some jurisdictions) is the proper motion to challenge whether the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action, not a motion for summary judgment.\n- **Option C** is incorrect because even if both parties file motions for summary judgment asserting there are no genuine issues of material fact, the court must still evaluate each motion independently based on the evidence presented. It does not automatically result in granting summary judgment for one party.\n- **Option D** is correct because if the plaintiff presents sufficient evidence to show there are no genuine issues of material fact and this evidence is not contradicted by the defendant, the court may grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, regardless of any denials in the defendant's answer."
