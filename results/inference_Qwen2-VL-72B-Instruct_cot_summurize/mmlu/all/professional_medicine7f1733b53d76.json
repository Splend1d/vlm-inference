He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?\n\nA. Azathioprine therapy\nB. Bronchoscopy\nC. Continuous humidified oxygen\nD. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n"

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that he may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or another form of chronic lung disease. Oxygen therapy can help improve the patient's oxygen saturation and alleviate his symptoms of dyspnea. Antibiotic therapy may also be necessary if there is evidence of a bacterial infection. Bronchoscopy may be indicated if there is suspicion of a malignancy or other underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Azathioprine therapy is not typically used for the treatment of COPD or other chronic lung diseases. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be useful for patients with sleep apnea, but it is not indicated for this patient based on the information provided."
