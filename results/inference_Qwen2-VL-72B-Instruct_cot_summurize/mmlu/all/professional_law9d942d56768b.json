Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, \"Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. \" The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.\nB. sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.\nC. overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.\nD. overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.\n"

Overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.\n\nIn legal proceedings, offers to pay medical bills can be considered as inferential admissions of liability. This means that such offers may be used as evidence to suggest that the party making the offer acknowledges some level of responsibility or fault for the incident in question. Therefore, the trial judge should allow the administrative assistant to testify about the doctor's offer to pay the patient's medical bills, as it could be relevant to establishing the doctor's liability."
