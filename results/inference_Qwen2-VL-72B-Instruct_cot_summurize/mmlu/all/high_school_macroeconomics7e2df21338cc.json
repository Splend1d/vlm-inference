Running a surplus means that the government is collecting more in taxes than it spends, which can help to reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy and thus help to curb inflationary pressures. This is in contrast to running a deficit, which would involve the government spending more than it collects in taxes and could potentially contribute to inflation if it leads to an increase in aggregate demand."
