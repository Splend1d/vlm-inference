Changing the temperature will alter the equilibrium constant because it affects the rate at which forward and reverse reactions occur, thus shifting the equilibrium position. Pressure changes can affect the concentrations of gases in a reaction mixture but do not change the value of K itself. Changes in the total mass of the chemicals present or the concentration of reactants or products will shift the equilibrium position but will not change the value of the equilibrium constant, as long as the temperature remains constant."
