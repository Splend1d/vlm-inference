An external event causes us to experience a specific emotion, and this emotion triggers certain physiological changes to occur.\nB. When our body responds to an external event, our brain interprets the biological changes as a specific emotion.\nC. Each person follows a predictable pattern of changes in response to stress, including alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.\nD. A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\n"

A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\n\nStanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion posits that emotions result from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. According to this theory, when we experience physiological arousal (such as increased heart rate or sweating), our brain seeks an explanation for these bodily changes. This cognitive interpretation of the arousal then leads to the experience of a specific emotion. Therefore, both physiological changes and cognitive processes are necessary components of emotional experience according to Schachter's theory."
