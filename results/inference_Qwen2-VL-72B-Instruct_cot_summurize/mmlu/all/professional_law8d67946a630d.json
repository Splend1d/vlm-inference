                    "text": "An actress went to a plastic surgeon for removal of an abnormal growth on her right cheek. Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the plastic surgeon will be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed, we need to analyze the situation based on contract law principles.\n\n1. **Parol Evidence Rule**: Generally, the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of oral agreements that contradict or modify the terms of a written contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including modifications made after the contract is signed if they are fair and equitable.\n\n2. **Oral Agreement Before Signing**: If the oral agreement made before signing the written contract is admitted and believed, it would modify the original contract to include the removal of any additional growths within the $1,000 fee. This would mean the actress would not owe any additional payment for the removal of the second growth.\n\n3. **Oral Agreement During Surgery**: If the oral agreement made during surgery is admitted and believed, it would add an additional $500 to the original contract for the removal of the second growth. This would mean the actress would owe the additional $500.\n\n4. **Knock-Out Rule**: The knock-out rule states that if two contradictory pieces of parol evidence are presented, neither is admissible. However, this rule typically applies when both pieces of evidence are equally valid and contradictory. In this case, the two oral agreements are not necessarily contradictory but rather address different aspects of the agreement (one modifies the scope of work, the other adds an additional fee).\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** suggests that the oral agreements contradict each other and neither would be enforceable under the knock-out rule. This is not accurate because the agreements address different aspects of the contract and do not directly contradict one another.\n  \n- **Option B** implies that the plastic surgeon was performing a legal duty already owed to the actress without additional compensation. This does not apply here since the removal of the second growth was not part of the original written contract.\n\n- **Option C** suggests that the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable. This could potentially support the additional $500 if the court finds that the modification was reasonable and unforeseen at the time of the original contract.\n\n- **Option D** argues that the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and enforcing her oral promise would avoid injustice. This aligns with the principle of preventing unjust enrichment and could support the recovery of the additional fee.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.**\n\nThus, the plastic surgeon would be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed."
