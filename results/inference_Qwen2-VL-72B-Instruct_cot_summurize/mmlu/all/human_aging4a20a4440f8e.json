Other older adults\n\nOlder adults are likely to have a more positive view of aging and other older adults because they have personal experience with the aging process and can appreciate the wisdom, experience, and contributions that come with it. They may also be more accepting of the physical changes associated with aging since they are experiencing them themselves. In contrast, children, young adults, and adolescents may have less understanding or appreciation for the aging process and may hold more negative stereotypes about older adults."
