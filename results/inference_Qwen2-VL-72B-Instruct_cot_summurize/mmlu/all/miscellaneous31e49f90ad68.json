Government authority is created as the result of a social contract.\n\nBoth Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were proponents of the social contract theory, which posits that government authority is derived from an agreement among individuals to form a society and establish a governing body to maintain order and protect their rights. While they had different views on the nature of this contract and the role of government, they both agreed on the fundamental concept of the social contract."
