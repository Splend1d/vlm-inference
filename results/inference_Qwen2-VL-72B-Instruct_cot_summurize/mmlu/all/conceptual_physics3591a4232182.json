This balance results in a net charge of zero.\n\n2. **Given Information**: The nucleus of the iron atom contains 26 protons.\n\nSince the iron atom is electrically neutral, it must have an equal number of electrons to balance out the positive charges from the protons.\n\nTherefore, the number of electrons in this iron atom is also 26.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 26"
