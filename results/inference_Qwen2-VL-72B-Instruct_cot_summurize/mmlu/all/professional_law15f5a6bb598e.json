                    "text": "A farmer owned a tract of land in a state that has a notice recording statute and follows the title theory of mortgages. There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n"

The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend's mortgage was recorded prior to the sale of the property to the investor, who then subdivided the property and sold the western farm to the developer without any mention of the mortgage. Since the mortgage was recorded, it is a matter of public record and would affect the title to the entire property, including both the eastern and western farms. The fact that the mortgage was not mentioned in subsequent deeds does not negate its existence or effect on the title.\n\nThe recording of the mortgage serves as constructive notice to all subsequent purchasers, including the developer and the florist. Therefore, when the rancher conducts a title search and discovers the mortgage, it reveals an encumbrance on the title to the western farm. This encumbrance makes the title unmarketable because it represents a financial obligation that must be satisfied before clear title can be conveyed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to rescind a contract typically depends on specific contractual terms and may require certain conditions to be met, such as providing notice within a specified timeframe or demonstrating that the encumbrance significantly affects the value or use of the property.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the partition of the property by the investor did not create a joint tenancy; rather, it resulted in separate ownership of the eastern and western farms. However, the mortgage still encumbers both farms because it was recorded before the partition occurred.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the discovery of the encumbrance before closing gives the rancher grounds to rescind the contract immediately, rather than waiting until the closing date. The presence of the mortgage is a material defect in the title that affects the rancher's ability to obtain clear and marketable title upon closing."
