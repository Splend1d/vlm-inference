Because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner.\n\nJohn Austin, a 19th-century British jurist, is known for his theory of legal positivism, which emphasizes that laws are commands issued by a sovereign authority and are not necessarily tied to moral or ethical considerations. This pragmatic approach focuses on the observable facts of how laws are made and enforced, rather than on abstract concepts or philosophical underpinnings. This is why he is often described as a naive empiricist, as he relies heavily on empirical evidence and observable phenomena to define law."
