                    "text": "Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) equals 33, we can use the relationship between LCM and GCD of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) \\times \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \\times b \\]\n\nLet's denote the unknown integer as \\(x\\) and the given integer as 45. We know:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{LCM}(45, x)}{\\text{GCD}(45, x)} = 33 \\]\n\nFrom the relationship above, we can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{45 \\times x}{\\text{GCD}(45, x)^2} = 33 \\]\n\nRearranging for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33 \\times \\text{GCD}(45, x)^2}{45} \\]\n\nSince 45 is a product of prime factors \\(3^2 \\times 5\\), the GCD of 45 and \\(x\\) must be a divisor of 45. The divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible value of \\(x\\), so we should start with the smallest possible non-trivial GCD (since a GCD of 1 would imply \\(x\\) is not related to 45 in terms of sharing any prime factors, which wouldn't satisfy our equation).\n\nLet's test the smallest non-trivial GCD, which is 3:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33 \\times 3^2}{45} = \\frac{33 \\times 9}{45} = \\frac{297}{45} = 6.6 \\]\n\nThis doesn't yield an integer solution, so let's try the next possible GCD, which is 5:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33 \\times 5^2}{45} = \\frac{33 \\times 25}{45} = \\frac{825}{45} = 18.33 \\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't yield an integer solution. Let's try GCD = 9:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33 \\times 9^2}{45} = \\frac{33 \\times 81}{45} = \\frac{2673}{45} = 59.4 \\]\n\nStill not an integer. Finally, let's try GCD = 15:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{33 \\times 15^2}{45} = \\frac{33 \\times 225}{45} = \\frac{7425}{45} = 165 \\]\n\nThis gives us an integer solution. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the given condition is 165.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 165."
