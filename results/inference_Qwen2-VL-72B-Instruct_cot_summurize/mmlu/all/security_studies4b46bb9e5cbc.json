From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. The question of what should or what should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.\nB. The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\nC. The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.\nD. Theorizing has parallel theoretical forms of knowledge based on empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships.\n"

The different forms of knowledge relate to a conflicting conception of the relationship to policy: the problem-solving tradition in US political science vs. the critical studies in Europe.\n\nThis option highlights the key difference in approach between US and European perspectives on theorizing in security studies. The US tends to focus on problem-solving and practical policy implications, while European approaches often emphasize critical analysis and a more theoretical engagement with security issues."
