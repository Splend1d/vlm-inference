Neandertal canine teeth showed that they relied only on meat for their subsistence.\n- This statement is too absolute and not supported by current scientific evidence. Neandertals likely had a varied diet that included both plant and animal sources.\n\nB. Animal bones were found showing stone tool cut marks and no animal teeth marks.\n- This would suggest that Neandertals used tools to process animal carcasses, indicating hunting behavior.\n\nC. Bones of large animals, such as elephant and horse, were found in caves.\n- The presence of large animal bones in caves could indicate that Neandertals hunted these animals and brought them back to their living sites.\n\nGiven this analysis, options B and C provide strong evidence that Neandertals were hunters. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Both A and C."
