However, the state in which they were married prohibits a couple from obtaining a divorce until they have resided in the state for at least 12 months. In an action by the couple challenging the constitutionality of the residency requirement of the state divorce law, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, because the requirement promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is within the area of state action.\nC. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n"

This clause generally means that states cannot discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of their own citizens. A state law that imposes a residency requirement for obtaining a divorce could be seen as violating this clause if it treats non-residents differently than residents without a sufficient justification. Therefore, the court would likely find such a provision unconstitutional under the privileges and immunities clause."
