One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n"

To find the molecular mass (molar mass), we divide the mass of the gas by the number of moles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Molecular Mass} = \\frac{\\text{Mass of Gas}}{n} \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The heat of formation of the gas**: This is not necessary for calculating the molecular mass using the ideal gas law.\n\nB. **The density of the water**: This is not required since we already know the volume of the displaced water and can calculate the mass of the displaced water if needed.\n\nC. **The mass of the displaced water**: This is not directly needed because we can use the volume of the displaced water and the known density of water to find the mass of the displaced water.\n\nD. **The vapor pressure of the water**: This is crucial because the total pressure inside the inverted bottle includes both the vapor pressure of the water and the partial pressure of the gas. We need to subtract the vapor pressure from the total pressure to get the correct partial pressure of the gas.\n\nTherefore, the additional information needed to complete the experiment is:\n\n**D.
