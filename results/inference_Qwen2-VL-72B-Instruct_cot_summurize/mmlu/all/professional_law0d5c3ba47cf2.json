The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\n\nWhen a borrower deeds property back to the lender to satisfy a debt, it can sometimes be viewed as a disguised mortgage rather than an outright sale. This is particularly true if the transaction appears to be a way for the borrower to avoid foreclosure while still retaining some rights or interests in the property. In such cases, courts may treat the transaction as a mortgage, which means the lender (in this case, the builder) does not obtain fee simple title but instead holds a security interest in the property."
