The formula for the cost of preferred stock is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Preferred Stock} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Dividend}}{\\text{Current Market Price}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Annual Dividend = $10 per share\n- Current Market Price = $96 per share\n\nFirst, calculate the pre-tax cost of preferred stock:\n\n\\[ \\text{Pre-Tax Cost of Preferred Stock} = \\frac{\\$10}{\\$96} \\approx 0.1042 \\text{ or } 10.42\\% \\]\n\nSince preferred dividends are not tax-deductible, there is no adjustment for taxes in this calculation. Therefore, the after-tax cost of preferred stock remains the same as the pre-tax cost.\n\nThus, the component cost of preferred stock to Lei-Feng, Inc. is approximately 10.4%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 10.4 percent"
