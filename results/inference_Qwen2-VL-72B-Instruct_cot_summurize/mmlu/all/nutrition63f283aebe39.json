                    "text": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work**\n   - This statement is incorrect because pepsinogen is secreted by the stomach, not the pancreas. The pancreas secretes trypsinogen, which is converted to trypsin.\n\nB. **Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose**\n   - This statement is partially correct but not entirely accurate. Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase does hydrolyze starch, but it breaks down starch into maltose, not directly into glucose. Maltose is then broken down into glucose by other enzymes.\n\nC. **Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.**\n   - This statement is correct. Enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase) is secreted by the small intestine and activates trypsinogen by cleaving a specific peptide sequence, converting it into its active form, trypsin.\n\nD. **Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The pancreas does not secrete hydrochloric acid; the stomach does. The pancreas secretes bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme coming from the stomach, creating an alkaline environment suitable for pancreatic enzymes.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**C. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.**"
