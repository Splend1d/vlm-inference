In this case, the resultant force is the absolute difference between the magnitudes:\n   \\[\n   |3 N - 4 N| = 1 N\n   \\]\n\n2. **Maximum Resultant Force**: The maximum resultant force occurs when the vectors are in the same direction. In this case, the resultant force is the sum of the magnitudes:\n   \\[\n   3 N + 4 N = 7 N\n   \\]\n\nGiven that the vectors can be at any angle between 0\u00b0 (same direction) and 180\u00b0 (opposite directions), the resultant force can vary continuously from 1 N to 7 N.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. 0 N**: This is not possible because even if the vectors were in opposite directions, the smallest non-zero resultant would be 1 N.\n- **B. 5 N**: This value falls within the range of possible resultants (1 N to 7 N).\n- **C. 8 N**: This value exceeds the maximum possible resultant force (7 N).\n- **D. Any of these**: Since only B (5 N) is within the valid range, D cannot be correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 5 N**"
