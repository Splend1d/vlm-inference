The base of the solid is bounded by the parabola \\(x^2 = 4y\\) and the line \\(y = 2\\). This means that for any value of \\(y\\) between 0 and 2, the corresponding \\(x\\) values range from \\(-\\sqrt{4y}\\) to \\(\\sqrt{4y}\\), giving us the width of the square cross-sections at different heights.\n\nSince each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, the side length of these squares will be equal to the width of the base at that particular \\(y\\)-value, which is \\(2\\sqrt{y}\\) (since the total width is from \\(-\\sqrt{4y}\\) to \\(\\sqrt{4y}\\), making it \\(2\\sqrt{4y} = 4\\sqrt{y}\\), but since we're looking for the side length of the square, we divide by 2).\n\nThe area of each square cross-section is then \\((2\\sqrt{y})^2 = 4y\\).\n\nTo find the volume of the solid, we integrate the area of these cross-sections along the y-axis from 0 to 2:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{2} 4y \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\int_{0}^{2} y \\, dy\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}y^2 \\right]_0^2\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(4) \\right)\\]\n\n\\[V = 4 \\times 2\\]\n\n\\[V = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is 8 cubic units, which corresponds to option A."
