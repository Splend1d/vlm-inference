She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Asthma\nB. Chronic bronchitis\nC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nD. Postnasal drip syndrome\n"

Asthma\n\nThe patient's symptoms of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, along with her family history of asthma, suggest that she may have exercise-induced asthma. The spirometry results showing a normal FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 percentage of predicted do not rule out asthma, as these tests can be normal in some individuals with asthma, especially if they are not experiencing symptoms at the time of testing. Further evaluation, such as a methacholine challenge test or peak flow monitoring, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
