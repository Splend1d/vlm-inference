A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a finite abelian group is cyclic if and only if its order is the product of distinct prime numbers.\n\n- The prime factorization of 159 is \\( 159 = 3 \\times 53 \\).\n- Since 159 is the product of two distinct primes (3 and 53), any group of order 159 must be cyclic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\nA nontrivial proper normal subgroup is a subgroup that is not the whole group or the trivial group (the group containing only the identity element). According to Sylow's Theorems, every finite group has subgroups whose orders are powers of primes dividing the order of the group.\n\n- The prime factorization of 102 is \\( 102 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 17 \\).\n\nUsing Sylow's Theorems:\n- For the prime 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups \\( n_2 \\) must divide \\( 3 \\times 17 = 51 \\) and satisfy \\( n_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\). Possible values for \\( n_2 \\) are 1 or 3.\n- For the prime 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups \\( n_3 \\) must divide \\( 2 \\times 17 = 34 \\) and satisfy \\( n_3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). Possible values for \\( n_3 \\) are 1 or 34.\n- For the prime 17, the number of Sylow 17-subgroups \\( n_{17} \\) must divide \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) and satisfy \\( n_{17} \\equiv 1 \\mod 17 \\). The only possible value for \\( n_{17} \\) is 1.\n\nSince there exists at least one Sylow subgroup for each prime factor, and at least one of them (the Sylow 17-subgroup) is unique and hence normal, every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is **True**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
