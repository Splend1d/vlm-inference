However, if the patient did not give informed consent or the procedure was unnecessary, it could be considered morally wrong.\n- Given the information provided, we assume the patient had consented and the procedure was necessary, so this action would not be considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 does not involve a clear moral wrongdoing assuming the patient consented and the procedure was necessary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
