Under this executive order, federal agents are empowered to prosecute all interstate shippers and sellers of the drug. The President claims that he is acting upon conclusive evidence that the drug causes cervical cancer in laboratory monkeys. This executive order is\n\nA. valid, because the President has the authority to ensure that laws are faithfully executed.\nB. valid, because the President has the authority to impose economic regulations unless overruled by Congress.\nC. invalid, because it is an unauthorized extension of executive power.\nD. invalid, because the President does not have the power to regulate interstate commerce.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the validity of the executive order, we need to consider the constitutional and legal framework governing the powers of the President.\n\n1. **Executive Power**: The President has broad executive powers under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, including the duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" However, these powers are not unlimited and must be exercised within the bounds of the law.\n\n2. **Regulation of Interstate Commerce**: The regulation of interstate commerce falls primarily under the purview of Congress, as established by the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8) of the Constitution. While the President can enforce laws related to interstate commerce, they cannot unilaterally create or modify such laws without congressional authorization.\n\n3. **Executive Orders**: Executive orders are directives issued by the President to manage operations within the federal government. They can have the force of law but must be grounded in existing statutory authority or the Constitution itself.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- Option A suggests that the executive order is valid because the President ensures the faithful execution of laws. However, this does not address whether the President has the specific authority to prohibit the shipment and sale of a drug based on new evidence without legislative action.\n\n- Option B implies that the President can impose economic regulations unless overruled by Congress. While the President can enforce regulations, creating new ones without legislative approval is generally beyond their authority.\n\n- Option C states that the executive order is invalid because it is an unauthorized extension of executive power. This is a strong argument since the President lacks the authority to unilaterally regulate interstate commerce without congressional legislation.\n\n- Option D asserts that the executive order is invalid because the President does not have the power to regulate interstate commerce. This is also correct, as the primary responsibility for regulating interstate commerce lies with Congress.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. invalid, because the President does not have the power to regulate interstate commerce.**"
