This ability is facilitated by having longer loops of Henle in their nephrons. The loops of Henle play a crucial role in the concentration of urine by creating a gradient in the kidney's medulla that allows for the reabsorption of water from the filtrate back into the bloodstream. Longer loops of Henle enhance this process, allowing for greater water reabsorption and more concentrated urine."
