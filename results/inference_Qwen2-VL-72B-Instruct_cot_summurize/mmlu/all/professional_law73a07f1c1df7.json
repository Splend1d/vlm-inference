The tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder. She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?\n\nA. This is not a contract for the sale of goods \u0080\u0093 unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.\nB. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.\nC. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.\nD. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n"

The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n\nExculpatory clauses, which attempt to release one party from liability for certain actions or omissions, are generally scrutinized closely by courts. In this scenario, the clause appears to be part of a standard form lease, which suggests that the tenant had little to no bargaining power over its terms. Additionally, the fact that the clause was set in fine print on the reverse side of a multi-paged document could indicate that it was not brought to the tenant's attention in a clear and conspicuous manner. These factors can contribute to a finding of unconscionability, making the clause unenforceable."
