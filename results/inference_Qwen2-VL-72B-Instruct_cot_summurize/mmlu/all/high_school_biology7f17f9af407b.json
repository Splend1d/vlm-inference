Strenuous exercise.\n\nWhile strenuous exercise can certainly affect breathing rate and depth, it does not directly regulate respiration in the same way that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), or pH do. The primary regulators of respiration in humans are the levels of CO2 and O2 in the blood and the pH level of the blood. An increase in CO2 or a decrease in O2 triggers the respiratory center in the brain to increase the rate and depth of breathing. Similarly, a decrease in plasma pH (making it more acidic) also stimulates increased respiration to help remove excess CO2 from the body."
