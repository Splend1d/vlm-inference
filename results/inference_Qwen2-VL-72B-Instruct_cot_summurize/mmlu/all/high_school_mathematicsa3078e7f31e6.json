To do this, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is $10$), square it, and add it to both sides. Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of $y$ (which is $12$), square it, and add it to both sides.\n\nFor $x$: Half of $10$ is $5$, and $5^2 = 25$.\nFor $y$: Half of $12$ is $6$, and $6^2 = 36$.\n\nAdding these to both sides gives us:\n\\[x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 12y + 36 = -57 + 25 + 36\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\\[x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 12y + 36 = 4\\]\n\nRewriting the left side as perfect squares:\n\\[(x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\\]\n\nSo, the center of the circle $(h, k)$ is $(-5, -6)$, and the radius $r$ is $\\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $a = -5$, $b = -6$, and $r = 2$. The question asks for the value of $a + b + r$:\n\\[a + b + r = -5 - 6 + 2 = -9\\]\n\nThe correct answer is A. -9."
