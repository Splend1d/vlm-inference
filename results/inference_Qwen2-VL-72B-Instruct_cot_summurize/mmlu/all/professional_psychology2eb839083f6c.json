Discuss your concerns with him or her\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, if you believe another psychologist has committed an ethical violation, the first step is typically to attempt to resolve the issue informally by discussing your concerns directly with the individual involved. This approach allows for the possibility of addressing the issue through dialogue and mutual understanding before taking more formal action. If the issue cannot be resolved through discussion, then reporting to the appropriate authorities such as the APA Ethics Committee or the state professional standards board may be necessary."
