Binocular cues include stereopsis, which is the ability to perceive depth based on the slightly different images received by each eye. Monocular cues include relative size, interposition (one object blocking another), linear perspective, texture gradient, shading, and light and shadow, among others. These cues help us understand the three-dimensional structure of our environment."
