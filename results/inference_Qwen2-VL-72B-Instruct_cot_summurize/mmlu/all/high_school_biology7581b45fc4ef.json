                    "text": "To determine which option is least likely to be observed in the algae-eater population under predation pressure from pike-cichlids, we need to consider how each adaptation would affect the survival and reproductive success of the algae-eaters.\n\n1. **Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters**: Drab coloration can help algae-eaters blend into their environment, making them less visible to predators. This adaptation would likely increase their survival rate.\n\n2. **Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters**: Being active only at night would reduce the time when algae-eaters are exposed to visual predators like pike-cichlids, increasing their chances of survival.\n\n3. **Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young**: Larger females might produce more offspring, but this does not directly address the issue of avoiding predation. Larger size could make them more conspicuous to predators, potentially decreasing their survival rate.\n\n4. **Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes**: Becoming sexually mature at a smaller size allows individuals to reproduce earlier, potentially increasing their reproductive output before falling prey to pike-cichlids.\n\nGiven these considerations, the adaptation that is least likely to be observed due to its potential negative impact on survival is:\n\n**C. Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young**\n\nThis is because larger size could make the algae-eaters more visible and thus more vulnerable to predation by pike-cichlids, reducing their overall survival rate."
