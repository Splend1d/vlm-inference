Conceptual equivalence: This refers to the similarity in meaning and interpretation of concepts across different cultures or languages.\n2. Functional equivalence: This involves ensuring that the research instruments (e.g., questionnaires) function similarly in different cultural contexts.\n3. Translation equivalence: This pertains to the accurate translation of research materials from one language to another, maintaining the original meaning and context.\n\n\"Market equivalence\" is not one of these recognized types of equivalence in the context of international market research."
