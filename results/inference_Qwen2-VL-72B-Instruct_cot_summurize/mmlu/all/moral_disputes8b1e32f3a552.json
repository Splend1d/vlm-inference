One significant way this occurs is through the disproportionate contribution of developed nations to global warming. Developed countries have historically emitted more greenhouse gases, leading to climate change, which disproportionately affects developing nations that often lack the resources to adapt or mitigate its effects. This exacerbates poverty and inequality on a global scale."
