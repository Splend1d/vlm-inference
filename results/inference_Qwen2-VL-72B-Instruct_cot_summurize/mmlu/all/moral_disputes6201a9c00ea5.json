He argues that in responding to terrorism, it is crucial for states to maintain moral integrity and avoid committing acts that mirror the very wrongs they are fighting against. This means that while taking necessary measures to combat terrorism, states should adhere to principles of justice and proportionality, ensuring that their actions do not violate the rights of individuals or lead to unjustified violence."
