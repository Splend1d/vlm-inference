                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\n**Statement 1:**\n\"A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user\u2019s computer from stealing the user\u2019s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user\u2019s computer is turned off.\"\n\n- **U2F (Universal Second Factor)** is a protocol designed to enhance security by providing a physical device (like a USB dongle) for authentication.\n- The key point here is that U2F devices store cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations locally, without exposing them to the host system. This means that even if malware is present on the user's computer, it cannot access or steal the cryptographic keys stored on the U2F device.\n- However, the statement mentions \"even when the user\u2019s computer is turned off.\" Since the computer being turned off would mean the U2F device is not in use, this part of the statement is misleading because the U2F device only provides protection while it is actively being used.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is **False**.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\"A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.\"\n\n- U2F is designed to ensure that the user is physically present at the device during the authentication process. It uses public-key cryptography and challenge-response mechanisms to verify the authenticity of the user's presence.\n- When a user attempts to log in, the server sends a challenge to the U2F device, which the user must confirm by touching or otherwise interacting with the device. The device then signs the challenge with its private key and sends the response back to the server.\n- This process allows the server to verify that the user is physically present and interacting with the U2F device, thereby ensuring that the login attempt is legitimate.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is **True**.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. False, True**"
