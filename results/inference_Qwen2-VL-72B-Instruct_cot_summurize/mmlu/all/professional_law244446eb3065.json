The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\n\nIn civil cases involving negligence, the plaintiff (in this case, the pedestrian) typically bears the burden of proving their case by a preponderance of the evidence. This means that the pedestrian must show that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% probability) that the painting company was negligent and that this negligence caused the injury."
