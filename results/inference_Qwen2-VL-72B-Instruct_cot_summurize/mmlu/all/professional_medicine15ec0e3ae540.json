Past medical history reveals AIDS, and his most recent CD4\u00a0count was 30\u00a0cells/mcL. The patient's tilt test result and hemoglobin level are normal. Rectal examination demonstrates brown stool that is positive for occult blood.

This is because the patient has symptoms of odynophagia (painful swallowing), gastroesophageal reflux, and hematemesis (vomiting blood), which could indicate a serious underlying condition such as esophageal or gastric cancer. Additionally, the patient has AIDS and a low CD4 count, which puts him at higher risk for opportunistic infections such as candidiasis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. An upper endoscopy with biopsy can help diagnose these conditions and guide further treatment. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers may be used to manage symptoms, but they do not address the underlying cause. Clotrimazole troches may be used to treat oral candidiasis, but it is not indicated for esophageal candidiasis."
