Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.\nB. Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\".\nC. Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion.\nD. Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D.\n\nFission nuclear weapons are primarily divided into two types: gun-type devices and implosion devices. \n\n1. **Gun-Type Devices**: These are designed using two sub-critical masses of fissile material (such as uranium-235 or plutonium) that are fired down a barrel at very high velocities. When these masses come together, they form a supercritical mass, initiating a chain reaction that results in a nuclear explosion. This type of weapon was used in the first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.\n\n2. **Implosion Devices**: These are more complex and involve the use of high explosives arranged around a sub-critical mass of fissile material. The explosives are detonated simultaneously, compressing the fissile material to criticality, which then triggers a nuclear explosion. This method was used in the second atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki.\n\nBoth types of fission weapons rely on the principle of nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. The key difference lies in how the critical mass is achieved: through direct collision in gun-type devices or through compression in implosion devices.\n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes both types of fission nuclear weapons."
