This could imply an older date for the discovery compared to the animal remains.\n\nB. **on the surface, above the remains of extinct animals**:\n   - This implies that the discovery was made at a higher level than the remains of extinct animals, which might suggest a more recent date or different context.\n\nC. **in a region of Africa where no one thought humans had ever lived**:\n   - This indicates that the discovery was made in an unexpected location, challenging previous assumptions about human habitation.\n\nD. **on top of the ruins of a Medieval castle**:\n   - This suggests that the discovery was associated with a historical site from the Medieval period, which would be quite different from the context of extinct animals.\n\nGiven the context of Frere's discovery and its significance, the most plausible answer is:\n\nA. **beneath the remains of extinct animals**.\n\nThis aligns with archaeological discoveries where finding artifacts beneath the remains of extinct animals can provide evidence of early human activity and interaction with these animals, thus offering insights into prehistoric times."
