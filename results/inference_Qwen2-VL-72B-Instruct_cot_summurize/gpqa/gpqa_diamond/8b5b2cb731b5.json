                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the chemical transformations step-by-step and understand the structure of each intermediate product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n**Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane\n**Conditions:** Heated to 240\u00b0C with excess KOH\n\nThe reaction involves the elimination of bromine atoms under basic conditions, leading to the formation of a carbonyl compound due to the characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which corresponds to a ketone or aldehyde. The 1H NMR spectrum shows signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H).\n\nGiven these data, the product formed is likely **adamantanone**:\n```\n    O\n   / \\\n  C   C\n / \\ / \\\nC   C   C\n \\ / \\ /\n  C   C\n   \\ /\n    C\n```\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n**Starting Material:** Adamantanone\n**Conditions:** Heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide\n\nAluminum isopropoxide can act as a base and deprotonate the carbonyl group, forming an enolate. However, since no specific details about the reaction mechanism are provided, let's assume it forms a stable derivative of adamantanone, possibly an alcohol or another carbonyl derivative.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n**Starting Material:** Product 2\n**Conditions:** Ozone treatment at -78\u00b0C followed by dimethylsulfide addition\n\nOzone reacts with unsaturated bonds (double bonds) to form ozonides, which upon workup with dimethylsulfide typically yield aldehydes or ketones. Given the previous steps, the most likely product would be a derivative of adamantanone, potentially involving further oxidation or rearrangement.\n\n### Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum for Product 3\n\nThe most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent) is typically near a carbonyl group or other electronegative groups. In this case, the signal at 4.79 ppm in the initial spectrum suggests a hydrogen close to a carbonyl group.\n\nConsidering the structure of adamantanone and its derivatives, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely part of a methine group adjacent to the carbonyl. This hydrogen would couple with two neighboring methylene groups, resulting in a triplet.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of Product 3 is:\n\n**B. triplet**"
