                    "text": "To identify the final product of the reaction between compound X and red phosphorus and HI, we need to analyze the given IR and NMR data for compound X.\n\n### IR Analysis:\n- **3400\u20132500 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This range typically indicates the presence of O-H stretching vibrations, suggesting that compound X contains a carboxylic acid group.\n- **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This peak is characteristic of the C=O stretch in a carboxylic acid.\n- **1610 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This could be due to the C=C stretch in an aromatic ring.\n- **1450 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This peak is often associated with aromatic C-H bending vibrations.\n\n### 1H NMR Analysis:\n- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet at around 10.5 ppm is indicative of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet at 8.0 ppm suggests two protons on an aromatic ring, likely ortho to each other.\n- **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Another doublet at 7.2 ppm suggests two more protons on the same aromatic ring, meta to the first set of protons.\n- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet at 2.9 ppm could indicate a methine proton adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplets around 1.7 ppm suggest methylene protons next to a methine proton.\n- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet at 1.4 ppm indicates methyl protons attached to a methine proton.\n- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests methyl protons at the end of an alkyl chain.\n\nGiven these data, compound X appears to be a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring and an alkyl side chain. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically converts carboxylic acids into alkyl halides via the formation of phosphorus esters followed by halide substitution.\n\n### Reaction Mechanism:\n1. **Formation of Phosphorus Ester**: The carboxylic acid reacts with phosphorus trichloride (PCl\u2083) or phosphorus tribromide (PBr\u2083) to form a phosphorus ester.\n2. **Halide Substitution**: The phosphorus ester then reacts with HI to replace the phosphorus group with an iodide, forming an alkyl iodide.\n\n### Final Product Identification:\nThe final product will be an alkyl iodide derived from the original carboxylic acid. Given the NMR data, the alkyl side chain is likely a sec-butyl group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-CH(CH\u2083)-), and the aromatic ring is substituted with a methyl group.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This option fits well with the described structure after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\nB. **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid** - This is not consistent with the final product since it still contains a carboxylic acid group.\n\nC. **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene** - This does not match the sec-butyl side chain indicated by the NMR data.\n\nD. **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** - This also retains the carboxylic acid group, which should be converted to an alkyl halide.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**"
