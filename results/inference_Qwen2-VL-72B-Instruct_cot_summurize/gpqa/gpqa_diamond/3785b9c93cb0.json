                    "text": "To determine the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P outside the spherical conductor, we need to consider the effects of the charge distribution within the conductor and the cavity.\n\nWhen a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, the conductor will redistribute its charges such that the net electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that the conductor will induce charges on its inner surface to neutralize the electric field due to the charge $+q$ in the cavity. Specifically, an equal amount of negative charge $-q$ will be induced on the inner surface of the conductor directly opposite the charge $+q$.\n\nSince the conductor is uncharged overall, an equal amount of positive charge $+q$ will be induced on the outer surface of the conductor. This positive charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor will create an electric field outside the conductor as if it were a point charge located at the center of the conductor.\n\nGiven that point P is outside the conductor and has a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P can be calculated using Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n\\[ E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{L^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$"
