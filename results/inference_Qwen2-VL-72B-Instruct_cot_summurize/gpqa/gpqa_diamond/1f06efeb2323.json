A chiral center is an atom (usually carbon) that is bonded to four different groups.\n\nThe compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Let's break down the structure:\n\n1. **6-chloro**: Indicates a chlorine atom at position 6.\n2. **9-ethyl**: Indicates an ethyl group (CH\u2082CH\u2083) at position 9.\n3. **2-methyl**: Indicates a methyl group (CH\u2083) at position 2.\n4. **undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol**: Indicates an undecane backbone with double bonds at positions 3 and 7, and a hydroxyl group (OH) at position 5.\n\nNow, let's identify the chiral centers:\n- Position 5 has a hydroxyl group (OH), which makes it a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: OH, H, C=CH\u2082 (from the double bond), and the rest of the chain.\n- Position 6 has a chlorine atom, which also makes it a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: Cl, H, C=CH\u2082 (from the double bond), and the rest of the chain.\n\nSo, there are two chiral centers in this molecule.\n\nFor each chiral center, there are two possible configurations (R or S). Therefore, the total number of stereoisomers can be calculated as \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of chiral centers.\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 2\\), so the total number of stereoisomers is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4"
