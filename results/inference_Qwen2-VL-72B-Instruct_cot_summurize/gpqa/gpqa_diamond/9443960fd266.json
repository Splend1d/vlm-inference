Each vertex contributes a factor of the corresponding coupling constant. \n\nThe factor \\( \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^6} \\) suggests that there are six factors of \\( \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\), which usually corresponds to the number of loops in the diagram. This is because each loop integral in momentum space contributes a factor of \\( \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\).\n\nGiven this information, let's break down the expression:\n\n1. \\( \\alpha^3 \\): This indicates three vertices involving the fine-structure constant.\n2. \\( g^2 \\): This indicates two vertices involving another coupling constant.\n3. \\( \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^6} \\): This indicates six loops.\n\nTherefore, the number of loops in the Feynman diagram is 6.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. 6"
