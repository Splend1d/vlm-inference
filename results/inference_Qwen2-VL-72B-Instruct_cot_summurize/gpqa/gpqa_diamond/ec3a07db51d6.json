Specifically, if \\( p \\) is the parallax in arcseconds and \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs, then:\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{p} \\]\n\nThe volume of space within a certain distance from an observer increases as the cube of the distance. Therefore, the number of stars within a given distance range also increases as the cube of the distance. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the number of stars within a given parallax range will decrease as the cube of the parallax.\n\nThus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax should be inversely proportional to the cube of the parallax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ~ 1/plx^3"
