                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the diffraction pattern produced by a polygonal aperture and how it relates to the number of sides \\(N\\) as \\(N\\) approaches infinity. As \\(N\\) becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle, and the diffraction pattern will resemble that of a circular aperture.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle \\(\\theta\\) given by the formula:\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = 1.22 \\lambda \\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the radius of the aperture, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nSince we are dealing with small angles, we can use the approximation \\(\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta\\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ a \\theta = 1.22 \\lambda \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\theta\\), we get:\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nThis gives us the angular distance between the central maximum and the first minimum. However, the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. Since the diffraction pattern is symmetric, the angular distance between the first two minima is twice the angular distance from the central maximum to the first minimum.\n\nThus, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{a} = \\frac{2.44 \\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this result exactly. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question's context or the options provided. Given the standard formula for the first minimum of a circular aperture and the symmetry of the diffraction pattern, the correct interpretation should lead to the angular distance between the first two minima being approximately \\(2.44 \\lambda / a\\), which is not listed among the options.\n\nGiven the options provided and assuming a potential typo or misunderstanding in the question's formulation, the closest match to our calculation would be:\n\nD. 1.220 \\lambda / a\n\nThis represents the angular distance from the central maximum to the first minimum, not the distance between the first two minima. If the question intended to ask for the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum, then option D would be correct. However, based on the original interpretation of the question asking for the distance between the first two minima, the provided options do not accurately reflect the calculated value."
