                    "text": "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (4), we need to follow the sequence of reactions step-by-step and understand the structural changes that occur at each stage. Let's break down the process:\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\nStarting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene\nReactants: 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature\n\nThis reaction likely involves an electrophilic substitution or addition reaction where the dibromomethyl groups react with the bicyclic diene system. The tert-butoxy group might be replaced by iodide due to the presence of sodium iodide.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\nReactant: Aqueous sulfuric acid\n\nThe treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid typically results in protonation and subsequent hydrolysis of any ester or ether functionalities. If the tert-butoxy group was not already replaced, it would likely be converted into a hydroxyl group here.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\nReactants: SO3 and pyridine in DMSO\n\nSulfur trioxide (SO3) reacts with alcohols to form sulfonic acids. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the resulting H+ ions. This step likely converts any remaining hydroxyl groups into sulfonic acid groups.\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\nCondition: Heating at 150\u00b0C\n\nHeating at high temperatures can cause various rearrangements or eliminations. Without specific details about the structure of the intermediate products, it's challenging to predict the exact structure of the final product. However, we can infer some general characteristics based on typical organic chemistry transformations.\n\nGiven the complexity and lack of detailed structural information for each intermediate, let's consider the possible structures and hydrogen counts:\n\n- **Initial Compound**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n- **After Reaction with Sodium Iodide**: The tert-butoxy group might be replaced by iodide, but the number of hydrogen atoms remains unchanged.\n- **After Treatment with Sulfuric Acid**: The tert-butoxy group could be converted to a hydroxyl group, still maintaining the same number of hydrogen atoms.\n- **After Treatment with SO3 and Pyridine**: Any hydroxyl groups would be converted to sulfonic acid groups, which do not add or remove hydrogen atoms.\n- **Final Heating Step**: Heating might cause rearrangements or eliminations, but without specific details, it's hard to predict the exact structure.\n\nGiven these considerations, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (4) should remain close to the initial count of 10, assuming no significant loss or gain of hydrogen atoms through the reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is:\nA. 10"
