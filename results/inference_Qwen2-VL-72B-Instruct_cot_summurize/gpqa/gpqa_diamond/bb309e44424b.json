The volume of a spherical shell (which represents the unit range of distance) increases with the square of the radius:\n\\[ \\text{Volume} \\propto r^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance \\( r \\) would be:\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars per unit range of distance} \\propto \\frac{d^5}{r^2} \\]\n\nSince \\( d \\) and \\( r \\) are essentially the same in this context (both representing distance), we can simplify this to:\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars per unit range of distance} \\propto r^3 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ~ \\( r^3 \\)"
