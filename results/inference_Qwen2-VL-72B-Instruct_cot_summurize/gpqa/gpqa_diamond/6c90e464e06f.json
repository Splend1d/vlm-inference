The energy levels of such a system are given by:\n\n\\[ E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer representing the total number of quanta of excitation in the system.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have \\( n = 3 \\). Plugging this into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ E_3 = \\left(3 + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega \\]\n\nSo the energy of the third excited state is \\( \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega \\).\n\nNow, let's determine the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level. In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of each energy level is given by:\n\n\\[ g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
