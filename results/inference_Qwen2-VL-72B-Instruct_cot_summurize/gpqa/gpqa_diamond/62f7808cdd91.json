                    "text": "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3, we need to follow the sequence of reactions step by step and identify the structure of each intermediate product before arriving at product 3.\n\n1. **Toluene treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid:**\n   - This reaction involves nitration of toluene, which typically results in the formation of nitrotoluene. The most common product is o-nitrotoluene or m-nitrotoluene, depending on the conditions.\n   \n2. **Nitrotoluene treated with MnO2 and H2SO4:**\n   - This reaction likely involves oxidation of the methyl group in nitrotoluene to form a carboxylic acid. The product would be either o-nitrobenzoic acid or m-nitrobenzoic acid.\n   \n3. **Nitrobenzoic acid treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide:**\n   - This reaction involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a nucleophilic substitution. Acetone (propan-2-one) reacts with the aromatic ring to form an acylated product, which then undergoes a nucleophilic substitution with sodium hydroxide to form a substituted benzoic acid derivative.\n\nGiven these steps, let's assume the final product (product 3) is a substituted benzoic acid derivative. Without specific details about the exact substitution pattern, we can consider a general case where the molecule has a plane of symmetry but lacks other higher-order symmetry elements.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group that fits this description is **Cs**, which indicates a molecule with only a plane of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Cs**"
