The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\nA. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\nB.

Options B and C both fit this description better than Options A and D.\n\nHowever, considering the specific splitting patterns mentioned (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets), Option B seems more likely because it provides more distinct environments for hydrogen atoms to exhibit such complex coupling patterns.\n\nTherefore, the most likely identification of the compound is:\n\n**B.
