In the context of synthetic organic chemistry, this phrase is most likely referring to the compounds being difficult to separate from one another due to their similar properties.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\nB. The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.\nC. The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\nD. The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for the compounds being \"on top of each other\" in terms of separation difficulties would be:\n\nA. The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\n\nThis is because compounds with similar boiling points can be challenging to separate using distillation, which is a common method in organic chemistry labs for purifying compounds. Therefore, the second chemist is most likely referring to the fact that their compounds have similar boiling points, making it difficult to separate them effectively."
