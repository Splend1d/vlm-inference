Let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n### Initial State:\n- The initial state is a 1S0 state, which means:\n  - Total spin \\( S = 0 \\)\n  - Total orbital angular momentum \\( L = 0 \\)\n  - Total angular momentum \\( J = 0 \\)\n\n### Final State:\n- The final NN state has \\( T(NN) = 0 \\).\n- We need to check if the given transitions conserve angular momentum and parity.\n\n### Conservation of Angular Momentum:\nThe total angular momentum \\( J \\) must be conserved. For the initial state, \\( J = 0 \\). Therefore, the final state must also have \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n### Parity Considerations:\n- The initial state 1S0 has parity \\( P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \\).\n- The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity \\( P_X = -1 \\).\n- The final NN state must have parity \\( P_{\\text{final}} = P_{\\text{initial}} \\times P_X = (+1) \\times (-1) = -1 \\).\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n#### Option A: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n- Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 3 \\)\n  - Parity: \\( P = (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \\)\n  - This does not match the required parity of -1.\n  - Angular momentum conservation: \\( J = 3 \\) does not match \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n#### Option B: 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n- Final state: \\( S = 3 \\), \\( L = 2 \\), \\( J = 1 \\)\n  - Parity: \\( P = (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \\)\n  - This does not match the required parity of -1.\n  - Angular momentum conservation: \\( J = 1 \\) does not match \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n#### Option C: 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n- Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 1 \\), \\( J = 0 \\)\n  - Parity: \\( P = (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1 \\)\n  - This matches the required parity of -1.\n  - Angular momentum conservation: \\( J = 0 \\) matches \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n#### Option D: 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n- Final state: \\( S = 1 \\), \\( L = 0 \\), \\( J = 1 \\)\n  - Parity: \\( P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \\)\n  - This does not match the required parity of -1.\n  - Angular momentum conservation: \\( J = 1 \\) does not match \\( J = 0 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only option that conserves both angular momentum and parity is **Option C**. Therefore, the partial wave that is not permitted is:\n\n**Final Answer:**\nD. 1S0 -> 3S1 + p"
