The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?\n\nA. chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis\nB. attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I\nC. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\nD. progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst\n"

The less severe phenotype in Klinefelter's syndrome is due to the phenomenon of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), where one of the X chromosomes in females (and in individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome) becomes transcriptionally silent through epigenetic modifications, including chromatin methylation. This process helps to balance gene expression levels between XX and XY individuals, thereby mitigating the effects of having an extra X chromosome in Klinefelter's syndrome. In contrast, there is no analogous mechanism to silence the extra copy of chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome, leading to more pronounced phenotypic effects."
