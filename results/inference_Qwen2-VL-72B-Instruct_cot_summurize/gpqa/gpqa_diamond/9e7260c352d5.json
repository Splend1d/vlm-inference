Let's go through the synthesis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\nAcetic acid reacts with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride under heating conditions. This reaction typically results in the formation of a bromoacetate ester:\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH} + \\text{Br}_2 + (\\text{CH}_3\\text{CO})_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{Br} \\]\nProduct 1: \\(\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{Br}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\nProduct 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, resulting in an esterification reaction:\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{Br} + \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\nProduct 2: \\(\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}\\)\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\nProduct 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, which results in a nucleophilic substitution reaction:\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br} + \\text{NaCN} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN} + \\text{NaBr} \\]\nProduct 3: \\(\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}\\)\n\n### Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4\nProduct 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, resulting in a nucleophilic substitution reaction:\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN} + \\text{Br}(\\text{CH}_2)_5\\text{Br} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}(\\text{CH}_2)_5\\text{Br} + \\text{NaBr} \\]\nFinal Product 4: \\(\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}(\\text{CH}_2)_5\\text{Br}\\)\n\n### Analyzing the Structure of Final Product 4\nThe final product 4 has the following structure:\n\\[ \\text{CH}_3\\text{COOCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CN}(\\text{CH}_2)_5\\text{Br} \\]\n\nLet's count the distinct hydrogen environments:\n- Methyl group (\\(\\text{CH}_3\\)): 1 signal\n- Methylene groups (\\(\\text{CH}_2\\)) connected to different environments: 6 signals (one for each \\(\\text{CH}_2\\) group)\n- Cyanide group (\\(\\text{CN}\\)): no hydrogen atoms\n\nThus, there are a total of \\(1 + 6 = 7\\) distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we should consider that some of these signals might be very close in chemical shift and thus not practically distinguishable. Given this consideration, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 8**"
