                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the substances involved based on the given information and then determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the clues provided:\n\n1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**: This indicates that mixture X contains unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) because these can react with bromine, causing it to lose its color.\n\n2. **Disproportionation Reaction**: When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation typically involves the conversion of a single compound into two different products, often involving oxidation and reduction processes.\n\n3. **Hydrogenation of Mixture X and Y**: Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions results in the same hydrocarbon Z. This suggests that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n4. **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen in Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. We can use this information to find the molecular formula of Z.\n\n5. **No Conjugated Multiple Bonds in Mixture X**: This means that the unsaturated compounds in mixture X do not have conjugated double bonds.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula of Z:\n- Let the molecular formula of Z be \\( C_nH_{2n+2} \\).\n- The mass fraction of hydrogen (\\( \\frac{m_H}{m_C + m_H} \\)) is 14.28%.\n- The atomic masses are approximately: \\( m_H = 1 \\) and \\( m_C = 12 \\).\n\nUsing the mass fraction formula:\n\\[ \\frac{2n+2}{12n + 2n + 2} = 0.1428 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2n+2}{14n+2} = 0.1428 \\]\n\\[ 2n + 2 = 0.1428 \\times (14n + 2) \\]\n\\[ 2n + 2 = 2n \\times 0.1428 + 0.2856 \\]\n\\[ 2n + 2 = 2.856n + 0.2856 \\]\n\\[ 2 - 0.2856 = 2.856n - 2n \\]\n\\[ 1.7144 = 0.856n \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{1.7144}{0.856} \\approx 2 \\]\n\nThus, the molecular formula of Z is \\( C_2H_6 \\), which is ethane.\n\nNow, since Z is a product of hydrogenation of both X and Y, and it is also a component of Y, we need to identify the original components of X that could disproportionate to form Y and eventually give ethane upon hydrogenation.\n\nConsidering the information about no conjugated multiple bonds in X, possible candidates for X could be propene (C3H6) and butene (C4H8). These can disproportionate to form ethane and higher alkanes/alkenes.\n\nGiven that the final product Z is ethane (C2H6), and considering the initial conditions, the most plausible scenario is that mixture X consists of propene (C3H6) and butene (C4H8).\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ (from propene)} + 8 \\text{ (from butene)} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. 16"
