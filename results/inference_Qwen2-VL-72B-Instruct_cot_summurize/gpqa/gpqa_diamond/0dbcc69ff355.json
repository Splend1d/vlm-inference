                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the radiated power from an oscillating charge distribution varies with the angle \\(\\theta\\) and the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nThe radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole (which can be considered as a simplified model for the given spheroidal charge distribution) typically follows a pattern where the power is proportional to \\(\\sin^2(\\theta)\\) and inversely proportional to some power of the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). This is because the radiation pattern of a dipole is strongest perpendicular to the direction of oscillation (i.e., \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\)) and decreases as you move towards the axis of oscillation (\\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\nGiven that the maximum power \\(A\\) is radiated when \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (since \\(\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1\\)), we want to find the fraction of \\(A\\) that is radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\). The power at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) would be proportional to \\(\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\\), making the fraction of \\(A\\) that is radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) equal to \\(1/4\\).\n\nNow, considering the dependence on \\(\\lambda\\), the radiated power typically scales as \\(\\lambda^{-n}\\), where \\(n\\) depends on the specifics of the system. For a simple dipole, the power scales as \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), which means the correct form of \\(f\\) should include \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1/4, \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\)"
