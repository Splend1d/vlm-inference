Substituting this into the divergence formula gives:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^2})\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the derivative:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(1)\n\\]\n\nSince the derivative of a constant is zero:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the divergence of the field \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) is zero everywhere.\n\nNow, we evaluate the volume integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere:\n\n\\[\n\\iiint_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}) \\, dV = \\iiint_V 0 \\, dV = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0"
