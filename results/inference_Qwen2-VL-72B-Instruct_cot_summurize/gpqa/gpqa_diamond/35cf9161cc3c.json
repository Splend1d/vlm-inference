                    "text": "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we need to consider the geometry and dynamics of the system. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Orbital Period Relationship**:\n   - The first planet has an orbital period \\( P_1 = 3 \\) days.\n   - We need to find the maximum orbital period \\( P_2 \\) for the second planet.\n\n2. **Transit and Occultation Conditions**:\n   - For a transit event, the planet must pass directly between the star and the observer.\n   - For an occultation event, the planet must pass behind the star from the observer's perspective.\n\n3. **Impact Parameter**:\n   - The impact parameter \\( b \\) is defined as the distance of closest approach of the planet's center to the star's center, normalized by the star's radius.\n   - For the first planet, \\( b = 0.2 \\).\n\n4. **Geometry of the System**:\n   - The star's radius is \\( R_{\\text{star}} = 1.5 \\times R_{\\text{Sun}} \\).\n   - The first planet's radius is \\( R_{\\text{planet1}} = 1 \\times R_{\\text{Earth}} \\).\n   - The second planet's radius is \\( R_{\\text{planet2}} = 2.5 \\times R_{\\text{Earth}} \\).\n\n5. **Transit and Occultation Geometry**:\n   - For both planets to exhibit transit and occultation, their orbits must be such that they can pass through the star's disk as seen from the observer.\n   - The maximum impact parameter \\( b_{\\text{max}} \\) for the second planet should be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius.\n\n6. **Calculation of Maximum Impact Parameter**:\n   - The maximum impact parameter \\( b_{\\text{max}} \\) for the second planet is given by:\n     \\[\n     b_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{star}} + R_{\\text{planet2}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     b_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times R_{\\text{Sun}} + 2.5 \\times R_{\\text{Earth}}}{1.5 \\times R_{\\text{Sun}}}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Kepler's Third Law**:\n   - Kepler's third law relates the orbital period \\( P \\) to the semi-major axis \\( a \\):\n     \\[\n     P^2 \\propto a^3\n     \\]\n   - Since both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane, their periods are proportional to the cube root of their semi-major axes.\n\n8. **Maximum Orbital Period Calculation**:\n   - To ensure both transit and occultation, the second planet's orbit must be within the star's Roche limit, which is typically close to the star.\n   - Assuming the second planet's orbit is just at the edge of the star's Roche limit, its orbital period would be significantly larger than the first planet's period.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precise calculations involving the star's Roche limit and the specific radii, the provided options suggest a range rather than a precise calculation. Considering the relative sizes and the need for both transit and occultation, the maximum orbital period for the second planet would be significantly longer than the first planet's period.\n\nBased on the provided options and the general understanding of orbital mechanics, the most plausible answer is:\n\nD. ~ 37.5"
