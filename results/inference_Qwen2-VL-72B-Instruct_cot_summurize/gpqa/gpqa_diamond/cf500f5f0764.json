                    "text": "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we need to use the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) and its distance from the star \\( d \\). The equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) can be expressed using the following formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d^2} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( d \\) is the distance from the star.\n\nSince the planets have the same albedo, we can simplify this equation by focusing on the relationship between their distances from the star. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the fourth root of the distance squared:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\frac{1}{d^{1/2}} \\]\n\nGiven that the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can infer that the semi-major axes (distances from the star) are also in the same ratio because for circular orbits, the period \\( P \\) and the semi-major axis \\( a \\) are related by Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nThus, if the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, the distances (semi-major axes) will be in the ratio \\( 1^{\\frac{2}{3}} : 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} : 2.5^{\\frac{2}{3}} : 3.5^{\\frac{2}{3}} : 5^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\).\n\nWe need the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Let's denote the distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as \\( d_2 \\) and \\( d_4 \\) respectively. From the given ratios, we have:\n\n\\[ d_2 = 2^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\]\n\\[ d_4 = 3.5^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\]\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures \\( T_4 \\) and \\( T_2 \\) is then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_4} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{2^{\\frac{2}{3}}}{3.5^{\\frac{2}{3}}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2^{\\frac{2}{3}}}{3.5^{\\frac{2}{3}}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\]\n\nNow, taking the square root:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx \\left( 0.5714 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx 0.83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ~0.83"
