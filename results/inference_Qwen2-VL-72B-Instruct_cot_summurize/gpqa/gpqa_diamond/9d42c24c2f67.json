The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n"

                    "text": "To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the dark spots, we need to consider the area coverage and the temperature difference.\n\nGiven:\n- The star's radius is equal to that of the Sun.\n- One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.\n- The effective temperature (T_eff) of the star is 6000 K.\n- The spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K, making their temperature 5000 K.\n\nThe fractional area covered by the spots on one hemisphere is 20%, so the total fractional area covered by the spots on the entire star is:\n\\[ \\text{Fractional area} = 0.20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 0.10 \\]\n\nThis means 10% of the star's surface is covered by the spots.\n\nThe brightness variation due to the spots can be approximated by considering the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star. The fractional change in brightness (\\(\\Delta B\\)) due to the spots can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates luminosity to temperature:\n\\[ L \\propto T^4 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta B \\propto \\left( \\frac{T_{\\text{eff}} - T_{\\text{spots}}}{T_{\\text{eff}}} \\right)^4 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given temperatures:\n\\[ \\Delta B \\propto \\left( \\frac{6000 K - 5000 K}{6000 K} \\right)^4 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta B \\propto \\left( \\frac{1000 K}{6000 K} \\right)^4 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta B \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^4 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta B \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{1296} \\right) \\approx 0.000772 \\]\n\nSince the fractional area covered by the spots is 10%, the overall fractional change in brightness due to the spots is:\n\\[ \\Delta B_{\\text{total}} = 0.10 \\times 0.000772 \\approx 0.0000772 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical exoplanet. For the exoplanet to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve, its projected area must cover the same fraction of the star's surface as the spots do. Let \\( R_{\\text{pl}} \\) be the radius of the exoplanet and \\( R_{\\text{star}} \\) be the radius of the star. The fractional area covered by the exoplanet is:\n\\[ \\frac{\\pi R_{\\text{pl}}^2}{\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2} = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nSetting this equal to the fractional area covered by the spots:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 = 0.10 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} = \\sqrt{0.10} \\approx 0.316 \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star is approximately 0.32.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ~0.32"
