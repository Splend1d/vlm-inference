                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that the algorithm follows based on the given inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data:\n\n1. AGG -> 115\n2. TGCTGA -> 176\n\nWe need to determine how these inputs map to their respective outputs. One possible approach is to consider the length of the input strings and see if there's a relationship between the lengths and the outputs.\n\n- The length of \"AGG\" is 3.\n- The length of \"TGCTGA\" is 6.\n\nNow let's look at the outputs:\n- For \"AGG\", the output is 115.\n- For \"TGCTGA\", the output is 176.\n\nOne potential pattern could be that the output is related to the square of the length of the input string. Let's test this hypothesis:\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nLength = 3\nOutput = \\(3^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\\)\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nLength = 6\nOutput = \\(6^2 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38\\)\n\nThis doesn't match the given outputs exactly, so we need to refine our hypothesis. Another possibility is that the output is related to the cube of the length of the input string plus some constant.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nLength = 3\nOutput = \\(3^3 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29\\)\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nLength = 6\nOutput = \\(6^3 + 2 = 216 + 2 = 218\\)\n\nThis also doesn't match the given outputs. Let's try another approach: perhaps the output is related to the factorial of the length of the input string plus some constant.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nLength = 3\nOutput = \\(3! + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\)\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nLength = 6\nOutput = \\(6! + 2 = 720 + 2 = 722\\)\n\nThis still doesn't match the given outputs. We need to keep trying different mathematical operations until we find the correct pattern.\n\nAfter several attempts, we might realize that the output is actually the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the input string.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nASCII values: A=65, G=71, G=71\nSum = 65 + 71 + 71 = 207\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nASCII values: T=84, G=71, C=67, T=84, G=71, A=65\nSum = 84 + 71 + 67 + 84 + 71 + 65 = 442\n\nThis doesn't match the given outputs either. Let's try one more approach: perhaps the output is the product of the ASCII values of each character in the input string.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nASCII values: A=65, G=71, G=71\nProduct = 65 * 71 * 71 = 325,065\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nASCII values: T=84, G=71, C=67, T=84, G=71, A=65\nProduct = 84 * 71 * 67 * 84 * 71 * 65 = 2,027,040,040\n\nThis still doesn't match the given outputs. At this point, it's clear that none of the common mathematical operations (sum, product, factorial, etc.) directly apply to the given inputs and outputs. We need to think outside the box and consider other possibilities.\n\nOne possibility is that the output is related to the number of unique characters in the input string. Let's count the number of unique characters for each input:\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nUnique characters: A, G\nCount = 2\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nUnique characters: T, G, C\nCount = 3\n\nThis doesn't match the given outputs either. Let's try another approach: perhaps the output is related to the number of occurrences of each character in the input string.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nOccurrences: A=1, G=2\nSum = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nOccurrences: T=2, G=2, C=1, A=1\nSum = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nThis still doesn't match the given outputs. At this point, it's clear that none of the common approaches (sum, product, factorial, etc.) directly apply to the given inputs and outputs. We need to think outside the box and consider other possibilities.\n\nOne possibility is that the output is related to the number of occurrences of each character in the input string, but with a twist. Let's count the number of occurrences of each character and then apply a specific operation to those counts.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nOccurrences: A=1, G=2\nOperation: 1 * 2 = 2\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nOccurrences: T=2, G=2, C=1, A=1\nOperation: 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 4\n\nThis still doesn't match the given outputs. Let's try another approach: perhaps the output is related to the number of occurrences of each character in the input string, but with a different operation.\n\nFor \"AGG\":\nOccurrences: A=1, G=2\nOperation: 1 + 2 = 3\n\nFor \"TGCTGA\":\nOccurrences: T=2, G=2, C=1, A=1\nOperation: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nThis still doesn't match the given outputs.
