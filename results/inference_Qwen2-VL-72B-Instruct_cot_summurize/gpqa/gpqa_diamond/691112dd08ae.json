Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\n\nA. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nB. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nC. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\nD. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\n"

Dominant-negative mutations often result in the formation of non-functional complexes or aggregates due to the mutant protein's ability to interact with the wild-type protein, thereby preventing the wild-type protein from functioning properly. In this case, the mutant protein would likely form non-functional dimers with the wild-type protein, leading to protein aggregation and a loss-of-function phenotype. This is because the mutant protein interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein, even though it is present at only half the concentration (heterozygous)."
