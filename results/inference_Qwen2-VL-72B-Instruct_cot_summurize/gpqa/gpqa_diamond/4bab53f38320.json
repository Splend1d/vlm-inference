                    "text": "To determine which two compounds are present in the mixture based on the given 1H NMR spectrum, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. The spectrum shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio.\n2. There are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical shifts:\n- Aromatic protons typically appear around 6.7-7.5 ppm.\n- Methyl groups attached to aromatic rings usually appear around 2.2-2.5 ppm.\n\nNow, let's consider each compound:\n\n1. **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.\n   - All aromatic protons are equivalent, so there should be one signal for the aromatic protons.\n   - Four methyl groups will give four singlets, but since they are equivalent, it will appear as one signal.\n\n2. **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.\n   - All aromatic protons are equivalent, so there should be one signal for the aromatic protons.\n   - Four methyl groups will give four singlets, but since they are equivalent, it will appear as one signal.\n\n3. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Has four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.\n   - All aromatic protons are equivalent, so there should be one signal for the aromatic protons.\n   - Four methyl groups will give four singlets, but since they are equivalent, it will appear as one signal.\n\n4. **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n   - Has two ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring.\n   - Two aromatic protons are equivalent, so there should be one signal for the aromatic protons.\n   - Each ethyl group has three equivalent methyl protons and two equivalent methylene protons, giving a total of six methyl protons and four methylene protons.\n\nGiven that the spectrum shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, this suggests two different aromatic environments. This rules out any single tetramethylbenzene compound because they would only show one aromatic signal.\n\nNext, considering the three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, this indicates three different methyl environments with specific ratios.\n\nLet's match these observations with the given options:\n\nA. **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n   - 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: One aromatic signal, four equivalent methyl signals.\n   - 1,4-diethylbenzene: One aromatic signal, six equivalent methyl signals.\n   - This combination does not fit the observed 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals.\n\nB. **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Both have one aromatic signal and four equivalent methyl signals.\n   - This combination does not fit the observed 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals.\n\nC. **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Both have one aromatic signal and four equivalent methyl signals.\n   - This combination does not fit the observed 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals.\n\nD. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:\n   - Both have one aromatic signal and four equivalent methyl signals.\n   - This combination does not fit the observed 2:1:1 ratio for the methyl signals.\n\nNone of the options perfectly fit the described NMR spectrum. However, if we consider the possibility of an error in the question or the interpretation of the spectrum, option D might be the closest fit by considering the aromatic signals and methyl signals separately, though it still doesn't perfectly align with the given data.\n\nGiven the constraints and the provided options, none of them perfectly match the described NMR spectrum. It is possible there may be an error in the question or the interpretation of the spectrum."
