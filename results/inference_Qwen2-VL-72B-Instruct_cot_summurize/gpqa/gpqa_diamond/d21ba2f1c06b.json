In this case, 3-methylpent-1-ene exists as two enantiomers.\n\n2. **Grubbs Catalyst**: This catalyst promotes metathesis reactions, which involve the exchange of alkylidene groups between alkenes. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the metathesis can occur in various ways, leading to different products.\n\nLet's analyze the possible metathesis reactions step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Enantiomers of 3-Methylpent-1-ene:\n- **Enantiomer 1**: (S)-3-Methylpent-1-ene\n- **Enantiomer 2**: (R)-3-Methylpent-1-ene\n\n#### Metathesis Reactions:\n1. **Intramolecular Metathesis**:\n   - Each enantiomer can undergo intramolecular metathesis, forming cyclic compounds.\n   - Since there are two enantiomers, each can form its own cyclic product, resulting in two distinct cyclic products.\n\n2. **Intermolecular Metathesis**:\n   - The two enantiomers can react with each other or with themselves to form intermolecular products.\n   - When one enantiomer reacts with another, it forms a dimeric product.\n   - When an enantiomer reacts with itself, it forms a homodimeric product.\n\n#### Counting Products:\n- **Intramolecular Products**: 2 (one for each enantiomer)\n- **Intermolecular Products**:\n  - Homodimeric products: 2 (one for each enantiomer reacting with itself)\n  - Dimeric products: 1 (formed when both enantiomers react together)\n\nTotal products = Intramolecular + Intermolecular\n= 2 (intramolecular) + 2 (homodimeric) + 1 (dimeric)\n= 5 products\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of products excluding ethene. Since ethene is not formed in these reactions, all identified products are valid.\n\nThus, the total number of possible products (excluding ethene) is 5.\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. 8\nB. 6\nC. 2\nD. 4\n\nNone of the given options match the calculated result of 5 products. Therefore, based on the provided options, none of them are correct. However, if we must choose the closest option, it would be:\n\nD. 4"
