This reaction will convert the alkene into an epoxide:\n\\[ \\text{(E)-oct-4-ene} + \\text{mCPBA} \\rightarrow \\text{epoxide} \\]\n\n**Reaction 2:** \n(Z)-oct-4-ene also reacts with mCPBA, forming another epoxide:\n\\[ \\text{(Z)-oct-4-ene} + \\text{mCPBA} \\rightarrow \\text{epoxide} \\]\n\nSince both reactions involve the same reagent (mCPBA) and proceed to 100% completion, the products from both reactions will be the same epoxide derived from oct-4-ene. However, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) will influence the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide.\n\n### Products\n\nThe epoxides formed from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene will have different stereochemistries but will be the same compound structurally. Therefore, when combined, the mixture will contain two distinct epoxides.\n\n### Chromatography Analysis\n\n#### Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC Column:\nThis type of column separates compounds based on their polarity and hydrophobicity. Since the epoxides are identical in terms of these properties, they will elute at the same time, resulting in **one peak**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC Column:\nThis type of column separates enantiomers (stereoisomers). Each epoxide has a specific stereochemistry, so the two epoxides will be resolved into their individual enantiomers. Therefore, there will be **two peaks** for each epoxide, leading to a total of **four peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist observes:\n- **One peak** in the standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column.\n- **Four peaks** in the chiral HPLC column.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC"
