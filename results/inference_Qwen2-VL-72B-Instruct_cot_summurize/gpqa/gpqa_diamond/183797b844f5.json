                    "text": "To determine the number of peaks observed in the chromatograms for both the chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC columns, we need to analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n### Reaction I: (S)-5-Methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH + Acidic Workup\n\n1. **Reduction with LAH**: \n   - LAH reduces ketones to alcohols.\n   - (S)-5-Methoxyhexan-3-one will be reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n2. **Acidic Workup**:\n   - The acidic workup typically involves neutralizing any remaining LAH and converting any salts back into their original forms.\n   - This step should not change the product significantly.\n\n### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione + Excess NaBH4 + Acidic Workup\n\n1. **Reduction with NaBH4**:\n   - NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols.\n   - Pentane-2,4-dione will be reduced to pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n2. **Acidic Workup**:\n   - Similar to Reaction I, this step neutralizes any remaining reagents and converts any salts back into their original forms.\n\n### Combined Products:\n\n- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n- From Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Normal-Phase HPLC:\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity. Since both products are alcohols, they will have similar polarities but different structures. Therefore, we expect two distinct peaks corresponding to the two different alcohol products.\n\n### Chiral HPLC:\n\nChiral HPLC separates enantiomers. \n\n- For (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, it is already an enantiomerically pure compound (S-enantiomer), so it will give one peak.\n- Pentane-2,4-diol does not contain any chiral centers, so it will also give one peak.\n\nThus, the chiral HPLC will show two peaks, one for each product.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Normal-Phase HPLC**: 2 peaks (one for each product)\n- **Chiral HPLC**: 2 peaks (one for each product)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that the chiral HPLC would separate the enantiomers if they were present, which is not applicable here since the products do not form enantiomeric pairs."
