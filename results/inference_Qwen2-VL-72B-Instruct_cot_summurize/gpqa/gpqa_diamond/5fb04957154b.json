The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA. ~2.35\nB. ~2.23\nC. ~2.32\nD. ~2.25\n"

The surface area \\( A \\) of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi R^2 \\]\n\nFor Star_1 with radius \\( R_1 \\):\n\\[ A_1 = 4\\pi (R_1)^2 \\]\n\nFor Star_2 with radius \\( R_2 \\):\n\\[ A_2 = 4\\pi (R_2)^2 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \\), we substitute this into the equation for \\( A_1 \\):\n\n\\[ A_1 = 4\\pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \\]\n\\[ A_1 = 4\\pi (2.25 R_2^2) \\]\n\\[ A_1 = 9\\pi R_2^2 \\]\n\nNow, we compare the surface areas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{9\\pi R_2^2}{4\\pi R_2^2} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{9}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = 2.25 \\]\n\nSince the luminosity is proportional to the surface area when the temperature is constant, the ratio of the luminosities will be the same as the ratio of the surface areas:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = 2.25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.25.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. ~2.25"
