                    "text": "To determine the correct starting materials for the given reactions, we need to understand the stereochemistry and the effects of the reducing agents used.\n\n1. **Reaction with LiBH4:**\n   - The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes) to alcohols. It can also affect other functional groups depending on the reaction conditions, but in this context, it's likely reducing a ketone to an alcohol.\n\n2. **Reaction with BH3:**\n   - The product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n   - BH3 (borane) is another reducing agent that reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. However, it often requires a co-reductant like H+ to complete the reduction process.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options:\n\n**Option A:** \n- A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n- B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nBoth starting materials have the same configuration (R). If both starting materials were identical, they would produce the same enantiomer upon reduction. This contradicts the given products, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Option B:** \n- A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n- B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nHere, the starting materials are enantiomers of each other. Reduction of (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid could potentially yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and reduction of (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid could yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This matches the given products.\n\n**Option C:** \n- A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n- B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nAgain, both starting materials are identical and have the same configuration (S). This would not result in the formation of enantiomeric products.\n\n**Option D:** \n- A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n- B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis option has the starting materials as enantiomers, similar to Option B. Reduction of (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid could yield (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and reduction of (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid could yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This also matches the given products.\n\nBetween Options B and D, both seem plausible based on the stereochemical outcomes. However, since the question asks for the \"proper starting material,\" and assuming there might be a preference for matching the stereochemistry directly without inversion, Option B seems more straightforward because it directly correlates the starting material stereochemistry with the product stereochemistry without requiring additional assumptions about stereochemical inversion during reduction.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n**B. A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**"
