                    "text": "To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory, we need to consider both the refractive index of the glass and the motion of the glass relative to the observer.\n\nThe speed of light in a medium with refractive index \\( n \\) is given by:\n\\[ v_{\\text{medium}} = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nGiven that the glass is moving towards the observer with a velocity \\( v \\), we need to apply the relativistic addition of velocities formula to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The relativistic addition of velocities formula is:\n\\[ u' = \\frac{u + v}{1 + \\frac{uv}{c^2}} \\]\n\nIn this case, \\( u \\) is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is \\( \\frac{c}{n} \\), and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the glass relative to the observer.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\\[ u' = \\frac{\\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{c}{n}\\right)v}{c^2}} \\]\n\\[ u' = \\frac{\\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \\frac{v}{nc}} \\]\n\nSince \\( c = 1 \\):\n\\[ u' = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \\frac{v}{n}} \\]\n\\[ u' = \\frac{\\frac{1 + nv}{n}}{\\frac{n + v}{n}} \\]\n\\[ u' = \\frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:\n\\[ u' = \\frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \\]\n\nThis matches option D:\n\\[ \\boxed{(1 + nv)/(n + v)} \\]"
