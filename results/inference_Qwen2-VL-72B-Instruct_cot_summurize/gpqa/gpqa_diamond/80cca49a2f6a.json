                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step and determine the composition of the salts A and B.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Mixture Weight**: \n   - Total weight of the mixture = 7.20 g\n\n2. **Heating Process**:\n   - Heating the mixture at 200\u00b0C results in the formation of gases.\n\n3. **Tubes Analysis**:\n   - **Tube \u21161 (Mg(ClO\u2084)\u2082)**: Increases by 3.60 g. This indicates that water vapor is absorbed since Mg(ClO\u2084)\u2082 is used as a desiccant.\n     - Water absorbed = 3.60 g\n     - Moles of water = \\( \\frac{3.60 \\text{ g}}{18.02 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.20 \\text{ mol} \\)\n   \n   - **Tube \u21162 (Ca(OH)\u2082)**: No change in weight. This suggests no carbon dioxide or other acidic gases were present.\n   \n   - **Tube \u21163 (Red-hot Copper)**: Increases by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO.\n     - Moles of oxygen in CuO = \\( \\frac{0.80 \\text{ g}}{79.55 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 0.01 \\text{ mol} \\)\n\n4. **Remaining Gas Volume**:\n   - Volume of remaining gas C = 2.24 L at STP\n   - Moles of gas C = \\( \\frac{2.24 \\text{ L}}{22.4 \\text{ L/mol}} = 0.10 \\text{ mol} \\)\n\n### Composition of Salts A and B:\n\nGiven that the mixture is equimolar, each salt contributes equally to the total mass. Therefore, each salt weighs approximately half of the total mixture:\n- Mass of each salt = \\( \\frac{7.20 \\text{ g}}{2} = 3.60 \\text{ g} \\)\n\nFrom the analysis above, we know:\n- 0.20 mol of water is produced.\n- 0.01 mol of oxygen is produced.\n- 0.10 mol of another gas (likely nitrogen or another non-reactive gas) remains.\n\n### Possible Salts:\n\nConsidering common salts and their decomposition products, let's consider the following possibilities:\n- **Salts Decomposing into Water and Oxygen**:\n  - Salts like nitrates (e.g., NaNO\u2083, KNO\u2083) decompose into NO\u2082, O\u2082, and H\u2082O.\n  - Salts like carbonates (e.g., Na\u2082CO\u2083, K\u2082CO\u2083) decompose into CO\u2082, O\u2082, and H\u2082O.\n\nSince Tube \u21162 did not absorb any CO\u2082, carbonates can be ruled out. Nitrates are likely candidates.\n\n### Example Calculation for Nitrate Salts:\n\nLet's assume the salts are sodium nitrate (NaNO\u2083) and potassium nitrate (KNO\u2083).\n\n- **Sodium Nitrate (NaNO\u2083)**:\n  - Formula: NaNO\u2083\n  - Decomposition: \\( 2NaNO\u2083 \\rightarrow 2NaNO\u2082 + O\u2082 \\)\n  \n- **Potassium Nitrate (KNO\u2083)**:\n  - Formula: KNO\u2083\n  - Decomposition: \\( 2KNO\u2083 \\rightarrow 2KNO\u2082 + O\u2082 \\)\n\n### Total Atoms in Salts:\n\nFor each mole of NaNO\u2083 and KNO\u2083:\n- NaNO\u2083: 1 Na + 1 N + 3 O = 5 atoms\n- KNO\u2083: 1 K + 1 N + 3 O = 5 atoms\n\nSince both salts contribute equally:\n- Total atoms per mole of each salt = 5 atoms\n- Total atoms in 1 mole of each salt = 5 atoms \u00d7 2 = 10 atoms\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in salts A and B is 10 atoms.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 13"
