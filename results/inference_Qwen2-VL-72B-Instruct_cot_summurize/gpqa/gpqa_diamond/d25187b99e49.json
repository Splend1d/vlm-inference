                    "text": "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons produced after the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we need to consider the conservation laws of energy and momentum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - Electron (e\u207b) moves from left to right with a Lorentz factor \u03b3\u2081 = 4.\n   - Positron (e\u207a) moves from right to left with a Lorentz factor \u03b3\u2082 = 2.\n\n2. **Momentum Conservation:**\n   - The total initial momentum \\( \\mathbf{p}_{\\text{total}} \\) must be zero because the system is isolated.\n   - For the electron: \\( p_{e^-} = m_e c \\gamma_1 \\).\n   - For the positron: \\( p_{e^+} = m_e c \\gamma_2 \\).\n\n   Since the electron and positron move in opposite directions:\n   \\[\n   p_{e^-} = -p_{e^+}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   m_e c \\gamma_1 = m_e c \\gamma_2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Energy Conservation:**\n   - The total initial energy \\( E_{\\text{total}} \\) is the sum of the rest mass energy and kinetic energy of both particles.\n   - Energy of the electron: \\( E_{e^-} = m_e c^2 \\gamma_1 \\).\n   - Energy of the positron: \\( E_{e^+} = m_e c^2 \\gamma_2 \\).\n\n   Total initial energy:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{total}} = m_e c^2 (\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State:**\n   - Two photons are produced with equal energies \\( E_{\\gamma} \\).\n   - Each photon has energy \\( E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{2} \\).\n\n5. **Momentum of Photons:**\n   - Let the momenta of the two photons be \\( \\mathbf{p}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{p}_2 \\), respectively.\n   - The magnitudes of their momenta are related to their energies by \\( p = \\frac{E}{c} \\).\n\n6. **Direction of Photons:**\n   - One photon moves in the upper-right direction.\n   - Another photon moves in the lower-right direction.\n\nSince the photons have equal energies and the total momentum must be zero, the angles between their directions must be such that their components cancel out.\n\n### Calculation of Angle:\n\nGiven that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and another in the lower-right direction, the angle between them can be determined geometrically. The symmetry implies that the angle between the directions of the two photons is 180 degrees minus the angle each makes with the horizontal axis.\n\nLet's denote the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis as \u03b8. Then, the angle between the directions of the two photons is:\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 2\\theta\n\\]\n\nGiven the options, we need to find the correct angle. The problem does not provide specific values for \u03b8, but considering the symmetry and the given options, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**Answer: B. 96**\n\nThus, the angle between the directions of the photons is 96 degrees."
