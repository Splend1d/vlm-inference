The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD. The compound is contaminated with a precursor\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for these observations is:\n\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this choice:\n\n1. **Enantiomers (Option A)**: Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and would not show different peaks in an NMR spectrum unless they were resolved into their individual forms. Since the peaks are distinct but have similar chemical shifts, it suggests that they are not simple enantiomers.\n\n2. **Double Coupling (Option B)**: This term is not standard in chemistry and does not explain the observed phenomena. If there was an issue with the amide bond formation, it would typically result in incomplete reactions or side products rather than two peaks with similar chemical shifts.\n\n3. **Diastereoisomers (Option C)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They can arise from different configurations around chiral centers in a molecule. In the context of a peptidic compound, if there are multiple chiral centers, different diastereoisomers could form during synthesis. Each diastereoisomer would have slightly different chemical environments, leading to distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum. The fact that both peaks have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals supports the idea of diastereoisomers.\n\n4. **Contamination with a Precursor (Option D)**: If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, we would expect to see additional peaks in the NMR spectrum corresponding to the precursor's structure, not just two peaks with similar chemical shifts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the presence of two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, along with the observation of two peaks in LC-MS analysis at elevated temperatures, strongly suggests the presence of diastereoisomers."
