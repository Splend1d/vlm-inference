                    "text": "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **FTIR Spectrum**: Indicates the presence of an ester group.\n2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:\n   - Two signals for aromatic-H.\n   - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\n   - Two signals for \u2013CH3 groups.\n   - No signals for \u2013CH2 groups.\n\nGiven that there are two aromatic-H signals, we can infer that there are two hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring. Since it is a 6-membered aromatic ring, the remaining four positions must be occupied by other substituents.\n\nThe vinyl-H signals suggest the presence of a vinyl group (\u2013CH=CH\u2013). The doublet indicates one vinyl proton, and the doublet of quartets suggests another vinyl proton with coupling to three protons (likely from a methyl group).\n\nThe two \u2013CH3 signals indicate the presence of two methyl groups.\n\nConsidering these observations, let's deduce the structure step-by-step:\n\n- The aromatic ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n- The vinyl group adds 2 more carbon atoms.\n- The two methyl groups add 2 more carbon atoms.\n\nSo, the total number of carbon atoms is:\n\\[ 6 (\\text{aromatic}) + 2 (\\text{vinyl}) + 2 (\\text{methyl}) = 10 \\]\n\nHowever, since the options all have 11 or 12 carbon atoms, we need to account for the ester group. An ester group typically consists of a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkyl chain (R-O-C=O-R'). Given the information, the ester group likely contributes additional carbon atoms.\n\nLet's consider the hydrogen count:\n- The aromatic ring has 4 hydrogens (two aromatic-H signals).\n- The vinyl group has 2 hydrogens (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\n- The two methyl groups have 6 hydrogens (two \u2013CH3 signals).\n\nSo, the total number of hydrogen atoms is:\n\\[ 4 (\\text{aromatic}) + 2 (\\text{vinyl}) + 6 (\\text{methyl}) = 12 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the oxygen atoms:\n- The ester group contains at least one oxygen atom.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. C12H12O2\n- B. C11H12O2\n- C. C12H14O2\n- D. C11H14O2\n\nWe see that the total hydrogen count matches option B (C11H12O2) and option D (C11H14O2). However, considering the structure and the presence of an ester group, the correct formula should include 11 carbon atoms (aromatic ring + vinyl + methyl + ester group).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. C11H12O2"
