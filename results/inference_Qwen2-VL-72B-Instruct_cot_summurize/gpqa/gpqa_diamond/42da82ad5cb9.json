This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>\n\nA.

This type of mutation could potentially alter the amino acid sequence of the protein but may not necessarily disrupt the entire gene function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThis mutation introduces two base changes (T to A and T to G) at positions 7 and 8. Similar to Mutant 1, this could alter the amino acid sequence but might not completely disrupt the gene function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThis mutation introduces a deletion of one base (C) at position 9. This deletion would cause a frameshift mutation, altering the reading frame from that point onward. Frameshift mutations typically result in a non-functional protein because they disrupt the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nThis mutation introduces a deletion of three bases (TCT) at positions 9-11. This deletion also causes a frameshift mutation, similar to Mutant 3, leading to a non-functional protein due to the altered reading frame.\n\nGiven these analyses, **Mutants 3 and 4** both introduce frameshift mutations, which are more likely to completely disrupt the gene function and eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nHowever, since Mutant 4 has a larger deletion (three bases instead of one), it might be slightly more disruptive. Therefore, the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound would be:\n\n**B. Mutant 4**"
