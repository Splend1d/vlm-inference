Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation\n\nThis is because the linear partial fraction decomposition can help in decomposing the problem into smaller, more manageable parts that can be solved concurrently or in parallel. This approach facilitates the parallelization of the algorithm by allowing different parts of the computation to be executed simultaneously on different processors or cores."
