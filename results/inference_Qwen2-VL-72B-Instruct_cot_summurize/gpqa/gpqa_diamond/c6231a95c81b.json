Let's break it down:\n\n- There are 18 carbon atoms.\n- There are 30 hydrogen atoms.\n- There are 16 single C-C bonds.\n- There are 2 double C=C bonds.\n- There are 24 C-H bonds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total bond energy for each type of bond:\n\n1. Single C-C bonds: 16 bonds * 200 kJ/mol = 3200 kJ/mol\n2. Double C=C bonds: 2 bonds * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n3. C-H bonds: 24 bonds * 400 kJ/mol = 9600 kJ/mol\n\nTotal bond energy = 3200 + 600 + 9600 = 13400 kJ/mol\n\nNext, we need to account for the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Since there are 18 carbon atoms:\n\nEnthalpy of atomization of carbon = 18 * 1000 kJ/mol = 18000 kJ/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the enthalpy of formation by subtracting the total bond energy from the enthalpy of atomization:\n\nEnthalpy of formation = Enthalpy of atomization - Total bond energy\nEnthalpy of formation = 18000 kJ/mol - 13400 kJ/mol = 4600 kJ/mol\n\nNone of the provided options match this result. It seems there might be an error in the question or the options provided. The correct answer based on the calculations is 4600 kJ/mol, which is not listed among the options A through D."
