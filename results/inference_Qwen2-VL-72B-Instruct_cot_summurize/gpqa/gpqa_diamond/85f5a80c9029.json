                    "text": "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to calculate or compare the densities of each option given. Let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet**\n   - Density of Earth is approximately \\(5.5 \\text{ g/cm}^3\\).\n   - Since this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth, its density will also be \\(5.5 \\text{ g/cm}^3\\).\n\n2. **Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3**\n   - This planet has twice the mass of Earth but the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm^3). \n   - Therefore, its density remains \\(5.5 \\text{ g/cm}^3\\).\n\n3. **Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth**\n   - If the composition is the same as Earth, it means the material density is the same (5.5 g/cm^3).\n   - However, since it is 5 times more massive, if the volume increases proportionally, the density would remain the same (5.5 g/cm^3). But if the volume does not increase proportionally, the density could change. Without specific information on how the volume changes, we assume the density remains the same for simplicity.\n\n4. **Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth**\n   - Again, assuming the composition is the same as Earth, the material density is 5.5 g/cm^3.\n   - If the mass is halved, and the volume decreases proportionally, the density remains the same (5.5 g/cm^3). Without specific information on how the volume changes, we assume the density remains the same for simplicity.\n\nGiven these assumptions, all options have the same density of \\(5.5 \\text{ g/cm}^3\\), except for option c where the density might change due to the mass increase without proportional volume increase. However, since no specific volume information is provided, we consider all options to have the same density.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**C. a**"
