This can be seen because it is an equal mixture of the two basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. In the Bloch sphere representation of a qubit, a completely mixed state corresponds to the center of the sphere.\n\nThe Bloch vector for a general qubit state is given by:\n\n$$\nr = (x, y, z) = (\\text{Tr}[\\sigma_x \\rho], \\text{Tr}[\\sigma_y \\rho], \\text{Tr}[\\sigma_z \\rho])\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix $\\rho$, we calculate the components of the Bloch vector as follows:\n\n- The trace of $\\sigma_x \\rho$ is zero because $\\sigma_x |0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_x |1\\rangle = -|0\\rangle$, so their contributions cancel out.\n- Similarly, the trace of $\\sigma_y \\rho$ is also zero due to the same reason.\n- The trace of $\\sigma_z \\rho$ is zero because $\\sigma_z |0\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_z |1\\rangle = -|1\\rangle$, and since $\\rho$ has equal weights for both states, their contributions again cancel out.\n\nTherefore, the Bloch vector for the given density matrix is $(0, 0, 0)$, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. r=(0,0,0)"
