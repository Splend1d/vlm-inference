As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion about the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3 based on the experimental results, let's analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. **Single Mutants:**\n   - g1: 75% resistance\n   - g2: 0% resistance\n   - g3: 50% resistance\n\n2. **Double Mutants:**\n   - g1g3: 10% resistance\n   - g2g3: 0% resistance\n   - g1g2: 0% resistance\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **G2:** The single mutant g2 shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance to anthracnose. This suggests G2 might be a key regulator or transcription factor.\n  \n- **G1 and G3:** The single mutants g1 and g3 show partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively), suggesting that both genes contribute to resistance but are not as critical individually as G2.\n\n- **Double Mutants:**\n  - **g1g3:** The double mutant g1g3 shows significantly reduced resistance (10%), indicating that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance when G2 is present.\n  - **g2g3:** The double mutant g2g3 shows 0% resistance, similar to the single mutant g2, suggesting that G2 is epistatic over G3.\n  - **g1g2:** The double mutant g1g2 also shows 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is epistatic over G1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the results, we can infer that G2 acts as a transcription factor that is essential for resistance. The double mutants involving G2 (g2g3 and g1g2) show no resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3. \n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**D. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n\nThis option correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and indicates that G1 is epistatic towards G3, which aligns with the observed resistance levels in the double mutants."
