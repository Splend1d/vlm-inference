At active promoters and enhancers\n\nThe disappearance of ChIP peaks when using PFA+DSG (paraformaldehyde plus dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) fixation instead of just PFA suggests that the additional crosslinking agent DSG is affecting the accessibility or binding of the IKAROS transcription factor to its target sites. This could be due to increased crosslinking density, which might hinder the antibody's ability to recognize and bind to the epitope on the IKAROS protein.\n\nActive promoters and enhancers are regions where transcription factors like IKAROS are expected to bind frequently and dynamically. These regions are often more accessible to antibodies during ChIP-seq experiments because they are actively engaged in gene regulation. If the additional crosslinking from DSG interferes with this accessibility, it would be most noticeable at these highly dynamic and active regulatory elements. Therefore, the peaks that disappear are most likely found at active promoters and enhancers."
