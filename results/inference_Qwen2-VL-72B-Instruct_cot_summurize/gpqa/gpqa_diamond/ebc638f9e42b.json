Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?\n\nA. 77 years\nB.

The LMC is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes for the spacecraft to travel this distance from the perspective of an observer on Earth. The speed of the spacecraft is given as \\( v = 0.99999987c \\).\n\nThe time taken (\\( t_{Earth} \\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ t_{Earth} = \\frac{d}{v} \\]\nwhere \\( d \\) is the distance and \\( v \\) is the velocity.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ t_{Earth} = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \\approx \\frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \\approx 163,000 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nHowever, due to time dilation, the time experienced by the astronaut on the spacecraft will be significantly less. Time dilation is described by the Lorentz factor (\\( \\gamma \\)), which is given by:\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}} \\]\n\nFor \\( v = 0.99999987c \\):\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.00000026}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00051} \\approx 1960 \\]\n\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (\\( t_{astronaut} \\)) is then:\n\\[ t_{astronaut} = \\frac{t_{Earth}}{\\gamma} \\approx \\frac{163,000 \\text{ years}}{1960} \\approx 83.16 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSince the astronaut is 22 years old when they start the journey, they would be approximately \\( 22 + 83.16 = 105.16 \\) years old upon arrival. Given that the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 years, the astronaut would survive the journey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 72 years"
