For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of \\(S_y\\) are \\(\\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\).\n\nThe energy eigenvalues corresponding to these eigenstates are:\n\\[ E_{\\pm} = \\mp \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{2} \\]\n\nThe difference in energy between these two states is:\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = \\gamma B \\hbar \\]\n\nThe oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is related to the energy difference through the relation:\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\hbar} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\(\\Delta E\\):\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{\\gamma B \\hbar}{\\hbar} = \\gamma B \\]\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\gamma B} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\gamma B\\)"
