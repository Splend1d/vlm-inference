                    "text": "To find the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges. Since the charges are identical and have the same magnitude, we can use the formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two charges:\n\nU = k * q1 * q2 / r\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between them.\n\nIn this case, q1 = q2 = 2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C). The distance between each pair of charges is 2 m.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nU = (8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2) * (2e)^2 / 2 m\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nU = 1.438 x 10^-18 J\n\nSince there are 12 charges constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, and one charge fixed at P, there are a total of 12 pairs of charges in the system. Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n\nE = 12 * U = 12 * 1.438 x 10^-18 J = 17.256 x 10^-18 J\n\nRounding this value to three decimal places, we get:\n\nE = 17.256 x 10^-18 J \u2248 17.256 x 10^-18 J\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 122.330."
