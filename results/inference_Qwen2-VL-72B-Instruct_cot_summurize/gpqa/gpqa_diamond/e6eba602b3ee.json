A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n   - These resonances could be close if they belong to adjacent groups in the molecule.\n\nB. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n   - These large integrals suggest methyl groups, which might not be directly adjacent.\n\nC. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n   - This combination suggests a methyl group and a proton on a neighboring carbon, which could be close.\n\nD. A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n   - These resonances could also be close if they belong to adjacent groups in the molecule.\n\nConsidering the typical chemical shifts and the nature of the reaction, the most plausible scenario involves the interaction between a methyl group and a proton on a neighboring carbon. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**"
