                    "text": "To identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided IR and 1H NMR data, let's analyze each piece of information step by step.\n\n### IR Spectroscopy Analysis:\n1. **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These bands suggest the presence of an amide group (N-H stretch) or a primary amine (NH2 stretch). The splitting into two bands could indicate the presence of both types of functional groups or overlapping vibrations.\n2. **Strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch), which is consistent with either an ester or an amide.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal corresponds to a methyl group attached to a methylene group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-).\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm suggests the presence of an NH group, likely from an amide or amine.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This quartet indicates a methylene group (CH\u2082-) adjacent to a methyl group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-), consistent with an ethyl group.\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm suggest aromatic protons, indicating the presence of a benzene ring. The chemical shifts and coupling patterns are typical for ortho-disubstituted aromatic rings.\n\n### Compound Identification:\nGiven the above analysis, we can deduce that the compound contains:\n- An ethyl group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-)\n- An aromatic ring with ortho substituents\n- An amide or amine functionality\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n- Formula: C9H11NO2\n- Contains an ethyl group, an aromatic ring, and an amide/amino group.\n- Matches the IR and NMR data well.\n\n**B. 3-Ethoxybenzamide**\n- Formula: C9H11NO2\n- Contains an ethyl group, an aromatic ring, and an amide group.\n- The ethoxy group (O-CH\u2082-CH\u2083) would show different NMR signals than those observed.\n\n**C. N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide**\n- Formula: C9H11NO2\n- Contains an ethyl group, an aromatic ring, and an amide group.\n- The ethoxy group would again show different NMR signals.\n\n**D. 4-Aminophenyl propionate**\n- Formula: C9H11NO2\n- Contains an ethyl group, an aromatic ring, and an amide/amino group.\n- The propionate group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-COO-) would show additional NMR signals not observed.\n\nBased on the spectral data and the molecular formula, the most fitting compound is:\n\n**A. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\nThis compound matches all the observed IR and NMR characteristics."
