Let's calculate the energy for each configuration:\n\n1. \\(S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1\\): \n   \\[E = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\\]\n   \n2. \\(S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1\\):\n   \\[E = -J(-1 - 1 - 1) = 3J\\]\n   \n3. Two spins are +1 and one is -1 (three cases: \\(S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1\\); \\(S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1\\); \\(S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1\\)):\n   \\[E = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\\]\n   \n4.
