                    "text": "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent involves the deprotonation of the bromobenzene by the strong base NaNH2, followed by the displacement of the bromine atom by the amide ion (NH2-). This type of reaction is known as an aromatic nucleophilic substitution (S_NAr).\n\nGiven that 1-bromobenzene-2-d has a deuterium atom at the ortho position relative to the bromine, the reaction will proceed via the formation of an intermediate anion, which can then be protonated by the solvent (ammonia) or another source of protons.\n\nThe possible products arise from the different ways the amide ion can attack the benzene ring and the subsequent protonation step. The amide ion can attack either the carbon adjacent to the bromine (ortho position) or the carbon para to the bromine (para position), leading to two different intermediates. Each of these intermediates can then be protonated to give two different products:\n\n1. Attack at the ortho position relative to the bromine (not the one with deuterium) leads to a product where the amide group is ortho to the bromine.\n2. Attack at the para position relative to the bromine leads to a product where the amide group is para to the bromine.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible organic products in this reaction.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 2"
