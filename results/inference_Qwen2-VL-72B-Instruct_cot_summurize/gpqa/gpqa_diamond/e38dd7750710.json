These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA.

The product will be a substituted malonic ester.\n\nThe correct product for Reaction A is: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+)\n\n- **1-(Cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine:** This can act as a nucleophile.\n- **(E)-But-2-enenitrile:** This is the Michael acceptor.\n\nUnder acidic conditions (H3O+ in MeOH), the piperidine ring's nitrogen can act as a nucleophile and attack the \u03b2-carbon of the nitrile. The product will be a substituted nitrile.\n\nThe correct product for Reaction B is: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O)\n\n- **Cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C):** This acts as the Michael donor.\n- **But-3-en-2-one:** This is the Michael acceptor.\n\nUnder basic conditions (KOH in H2O), the dione forms an enolate which attacks the \u03b2-carbon of the ketone. The product will be a substituted dione.\n\nThe correct product for Reaction C is: **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answers for the reactants and major final products of the given Michael addition reactions are:\n\n- **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n- **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**\n- **C = 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n\n**A. A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**"
