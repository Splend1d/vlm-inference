He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:\nAt the concentration of 100000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.\nAt the concentration of 10000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.\nAt the concentration of 1000 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.\nAt the concentration of 100 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.\nAt the concentration of 10 copies per \u00b5l, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3\nWhich of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?\n\n\n\nA. Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples\nB. Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles\nC. The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates\nD. qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples\n"

                    "text": "The discrepancies in the results can be explained by option B: \"Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles.\"\n\nIn qPCR, the cycle threshold (Ct) value represents the number of PCR cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a predetermined threshold. A lower Ct value indicates a higher initial concentration of the target nucleic acid.\n\nGiven that the efficiency of qPCR is 100%, each cycle theoretically doubles the amount of DNA. Therefore, a tenfold dilution should result in an increase of approximately 3.3 cycles (since \\( \\log_2(10) \\approx 3.3 \\)).\n\nLet's analyze the data provided:\n\n- At 100,000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is around 34.2.\n- At 10,000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is around 30.9.\n- At 1,000 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is around 27.6.\n- At 100 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is around 24.3.\n- At 10 copies/\u00b5l, the average Ct is around 21.\n\nThe difference in Ct values between consecutive dilutions is roughly 3.3 cycles, which aligns with the expected change for a tenfold dilution given 100% efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the discrepancies in the results do not indicate any issues with the qPCR method or the quantification of nucleic acid. Instead, they reflect the expected behavior of qPCR with a tenfold dilution series and 100% efficiency."
