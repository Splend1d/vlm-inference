The peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared spectrum suggests that the quasar's emission lines have been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. \n\nThe redshift \\( z \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\lambda_{observed} - \\lambda_{rest}}{\\lambda_{rest}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda_{observed} \\) is the observed wavelength and \\( \\lambda_{rest} \\) is the rest wavelength of the emission line. For a typical quasar, the rest wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is around 121.6 nm. If we assume that the peak at 790 nm corresponds to the Lyman alpha line, then:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{790\\, \\text{nm} - 121.6\\, \\text{nm}}{121.6\\, \\text{nm}} \\approx 5.50 \\]\n\nNow, with the redshift \\( z \\), we can calculate the comoving distance \\( d_C \\) using the relation between redshift and comoving distance in a flat universe described by the Lambda-CDM model. The comoving distance can be found using the integral:\n\n\\[ d_C(z) = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{E(z')} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( H_0 \\) is the Hubble constant, and \\( E(z') \\) is the dimensionless Hubble parameter given by:\n\n\\[ E(z') = \\sqrt{\\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_k(1+z')^2 + \\Omega_\\Lambda} \\]\n\nFor a flat universe (\\( \\Omega_k = 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ E(z') = \\sqrt{\\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + \\Omega_\\Lambda} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( H_0 = 70 \\, \\text{km/s/Mpc} \\)\n- \\( \\Omega_m = 0.3 \\)\n- \\( \\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7 \\)\n\nWe can numerically integrate the expression for \\( E(z') \\):\n\n\\[ d_C(z) = \\frac{c}{H_0} \\int_0^{5.50} \\frac{dz'}{\\sqrt{0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7}} \\]\n\nUsing numerical integration techniques or software tools like Python's SciPy library, we find:\n\n\\[ d_C \\approx 8 \\, \\text{Gpc} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 8 Gpc"
