                    "text": "To determine how many of the stars listed would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we need to consider the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.\n\nThe ESPRESSO spectrograph has a limiting magnitude of approximately 17.5 for a 1-hour exposure with a S/N of 10 per binned pixel. This means that any star brighter than this magnitude should be detectable.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\na) Canopus: This is one of the brightest stars in the sky, with an apparent magnitude of around -0.7. It is easily detectable by ESPRESSO.\n\nb) Polaris: This star has an apparent magnitude of around 2.0. It is also easily detectable by ESPRESSO.\n\nc) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us: The absolute magnitude of 15 mag indicates that this star is quite faint. However, its proximity (10 pc) will make it appear brighter. We can calculate its apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula:\n\\[ m = M + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the apparent magnitude, \\( M \\) is the absolute magnitude, and \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs. Plugging in the values:\n\\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15 \\]\nAn apparent magnitude of 15 is too faint for ESPRESSO to detect with the required S/N.\n\nd) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us: Using the same formula:\n\\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(200) - 5 \\approx 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 \\approx 15 + 11.505 - 5 \\approx 21.505 \\]\nThis star is even fainter and well beyond the detection limit of ESPRESSO.\n\ne) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us: Again, using the formula:\n\\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 \\approx 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 \\approx 15 + 3.495 - 5 \\approx 13.495 \\]\nThis star is still faint but closer to the detection limit. However, it is likely not bright enough to meet the S/N requirement.\n\nf) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us: Using the formula:\n\\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(50) - 5 \\approx 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 \\approx 15 + 8.495 - 5 \\approx 18.495 \\]\nThis star is fainter than the detection limit of ESPRESSO.\n\nBased on the analysis, only stars a) Canopus and b) Polaris are detectable by ESPRESSO with the required S/N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2"
