A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This compound has no chiral centers because all carbons are either part of a double bond or bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms.\n   \n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The notation indicates that there are stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, making this compound optically active.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at C2 and C3, making it optically active.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similarly, this compound also has two chiral centers at C2 and C3, making it optically active.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This compound has one chiral center at C1, making it optically active.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has three chiral centers at C1, C3, and C5, making it optically active.\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: This compound does not have any chiral centers as all carbons are either part of a ring with identical substituents or bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the number of compounds that will exhibit optical activity is 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 5"
