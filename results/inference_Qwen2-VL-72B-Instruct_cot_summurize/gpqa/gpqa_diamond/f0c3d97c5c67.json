While this could be true, it doesn't directly address the specifics of the catalysts or activators involved.\n\nB. **Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n   - This statement implies that noble metals (such as platinum, palladium, etc.) can be used as catalysts but are prohibitively expensive for industrial applications. This is generally accurate since noble metals are often more expensive than other transition metals.\n\nC. **Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n   - This statement indicates that aluminum-based activators are ineffective for the additional reaction step needed to introduce regular branches. This could be true depending on the specific chemistry involved, but it doesn't provide enough context to confirm its accuracy without further information.\n\nD. **One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n   - This statement specifies that a group VIa transition metal catalyst (which includes elements like chromium, molybdenum, tungsten) can be used along with specific activators to achieve the desired branched polymer structure. This is consistent with known polymerization techniques where certain transition metals are used in conjunction with activators to control polymer structure.\n\nGiven the context and the need to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, the most accurate and relevant statement is:\n\n**D. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n\nThis statement directly addresses the type of catalyst and activator system that can be used to achieve the desired branched polymer structure using ethylene as the sole monomer."
