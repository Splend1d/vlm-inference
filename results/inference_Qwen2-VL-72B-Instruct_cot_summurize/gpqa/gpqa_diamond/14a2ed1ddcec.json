                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the substances involved based on the given clues and then calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Substance X:**\n   - Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n   - It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G.\n   - The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n   - Substance X and its close analog are used in organic chemistry.\n\nGiven these clues, Substance X is likely **sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**:\n   - Sodium hydroxide can incorporate a heavier isotope of hydrogen (deuterium), making it deuterated sodium hydroxide (NaOD).\n   - Sodium hydroxide reacts violently with acids (e.g., sulfuric acid, H\u2082SO\u2084), releasing water vapor (H\u2082O) and forming a precipitate (e.g., sodium sulfate, Na\u2082SO\u2084).\n\n2. **Identify Gas W:**\n   - Gas W has molecules containing the same number of neutrons and protons.\n   - This suggests gas W is **argon (Ar)**, which has an equal number of neutrons and protons in its nucleus.\n\n3. **Identify Precipitate G and Substance B:**\n   - The precipitate G, when heated, releases B.\n   - The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (0.85\u00b0C).\n   - This suggests B could be **water (H\u2082O)**, which melts at 273 K (0\u00b0C).\n\n4. **Identify the Keto Acid:**\n   - The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n   - A common keto acid is **pyruvic acid (CH\u2083COCOOH)**, which reacts with NaOH to form sodium pyruvate (CH\u2083COCONaO\u2082).\n\n### Cumulative Atomic Masses Calculation:\n\n- **Elements in Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH):**\n  - Sodium (Na): Atomic mass = 22.99 u\n  - Oxygen (O): Atomic mass = 16.00 u\n  - Hydrogen (H): Atomic mass = 1.008 u\n\n- **Heavier Isotopes:**\n  - Sodium (Na): No heavier stable isotopes commonly used.\n  - Oxygen (O): Oxygen-18 (18.00 u)\n  - Hydrogen (H): Deuterium (D, 2.014 u)\n\n### Summing the Atomic Masses:\n\n- **Lightest Elements:**\n  - Sodium (Na): 22.99 u\n  - Oxygen (O): 16.00 u\n  - Hydrogen (H): 1.008 u\n  - Total = 22.99 + 16.00 + 1.008 = 40.00 u\n\n- **Heaviest Elements:**\n  - Sodium (Na): 22.99 u\n  - Oxygen (O): 18.00 u\n  - Hydrogen (H): 2.014 u\n  - Total = 22.99 + 18.00 + 2.014 = 43.00 u\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X are 40.00 u and 43.00 u, respectively. However, none of the provided options match these values exactly. Given the context and the clues provided, the closest option that might fit the description is:\n\n**B. 35**\n\nThis choice seems to be the most plausible given the constraints and the nature of the question."
