                    "text": "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we need to use the relationships provided between the equilibrium temperatures, masses, and the fact that the albedos are equal.\n\nFirst, let's recall some key concepts:\n\n1. **Equilibrium Temperature**: The equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) of a planet can be related to its distance from the star (\\( d \\)) and its albedo (\\( A \\)) using the formula:\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\nwhere \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star and \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2. **Orbital Period**: The orbital period \\( P \\) of a planet around a star is given by Kepler's third law:\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} d^3 \\]\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant and \\( M \\) is the mass of the star.\n\nGiven:\n- The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4.\n- The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 2.3.\n- The ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15.\n- The ratio of the masses between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 1.35.\n- The albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3.\n\nSince the albedos are equal, the equilibrium temperatures will depend only on their distances from the star. Let's denote the distances as \\( d_1 \\), \\( d_2 \\), and \\( d_3 \\) for Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3 respectively.\n\nFrom the equilibrium temperature ratios:\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \\implies \\frac{\\left(\\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d_1^2}\\right)^{1/4}}{\\left(\\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d_2^2}\\right)^{1/4}} = 1.4 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \\implies \\frac{\\left(\\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d_2^2}\\right)^{1/4}}{\\left(\\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma d_3^2}\\right)^{1/4}} = 2.3 \\]\n\nSimplifying these equations:\n\\[ \\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.4}\\right)^4 \\approx 0.5378 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{d_2}{d_3} = \\left(\\frac{T_3}{T_2}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2.3}\\right)^4 \\approx 0.0398 \\]\n\nNow, combining these distances:\n\\[ \\frac{d_1}{d_3} = \\frac{d_1}{d_2} \\cdot \\frac{d_2}{d_3} \\approx 0.5378 \\cdot 0.0398 \\approx 0.0214 \\]\n\nUsing Kepler's third law, the orbital periods are proportional to the cube root of the distances cubed:\n\\[ \\frac{P_1}{P_3} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_3}\\right)^{3/2} \\approx (0.0214)^{3/2} \\approx 0.0214^{1.5} \\approx 0.0023 \\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of:\n\\[ \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0023} \\approx 434.78 \\]\n\nNone of the options match this value exactly, but the closest option is:\n\nC. ~ 33.4\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. ~ 33.4."
