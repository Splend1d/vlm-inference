Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

                    "text": "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to consider the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes and the masses of the stars in each binary system. The RV amplitude is directly related to the mass function of the system, which depends on the masses of the stars and their orbital parameters.\n\nThe mass function \\( f(m) \\) for a binary system can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{M_1^3 \\sin^3 i}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are the masses of the two stars.\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that the inclination angles \\( i \\) are the same for both systems since we don't have specific information about them. This assumption allows us to compare the RV amplitudes directly.\n\nThe RV amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to the mass function:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\sqrt{f(m)} \\]\n\nGiven the RV amplitudes for system_1 and system_2, we can write:\n\n\\[ K_1 \\propto \\sqrt{f(m)_1} \\]\n\\[ K_2 \\propto \\sqrt{f(m)_2} \\]\n\nWe know the RV amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2 they are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Let's denote the total RV amplitude for each system as the sum of the individual amplitudes:\n\n\\[ K_{total\\_1} = 10 \\text{ km/s} + 5 \\text{ km/s} = 15 \\text{ km/s} \\]\n\\[ K_{total\\_2} = 15 \\text{ km/s} + 10 \\text{ km/s} = 25 \\text{ km/s} \\]\n\nNow, we can express the ratio of the total RV amplitudes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_{total\\_1}}{K_{total\\_2}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ km/s}}{25 \\text{ km/s}} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\]\n\nSince the RV amplitude is proportional to the square root of the mass function, the ratio of the masses will be the square of this ratio:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{K_{total\\_1}}{K_{total\\_2}}\\right)^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36 \\]\n\nThus, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.36. To find out how much more massive system_2 is compared to system_1, we take the reciprocal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{0.36} \\approx 2.78 \\]\n\nTherefore, system_1 is approximately \\( \\frac{1}{2.78} \\approx 0.36 \\) times as massive as system_2, or equivalently, system_2 is about 2.78 times more massive than system_1.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. ~ 1.2\nB. ~ 0.4\nC. ~ 0.7\nD. ~ 0.6\n\nThe closest match to our calculation is option D. ~ 0.6. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. ~ 0.6"
