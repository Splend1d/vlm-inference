The probability that the atom does not decay in the first 50 minutes is:\n\\[ P(50) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 50} \\]\n\\[ P(50) = 1 - e^{-0.003867 \\cdot 50} \\]\n\\[ P(50) = 1 - e^{-0.19335} \\]\n\\[ P(50) \\approx 1 - 0.824 \\approx 0.176 \\]\n\nSince the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes (from 50 to 200 minutes) is:\n\\[ P(200) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 200} \\]\n\\[ P(200) = 1 - e^{-0.003867 \\cdot 200} \\]\n\\[ P(200) = 1 - e^{-0.7734} \\]\n\\[ P(200) \\approx 1 - 0.461 \\approx 0.539 \\]\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes given that it did not decay in the first 50 minutes is:\n\\[ P(\\text{decay between 50 and 200} | \\text{did not decay in first 50}) = \\frac{P(200) - P(50)}{1 - P(50)} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay between 50 and 200} | \\text{did not decay in first 50}) = \\frac{0.539 - 0.176}{1 - 0.176} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay between 50 and 200} | \\text{did not decay in first 50}) = \\frac{0.363}{0.824} \\approx 0.44 \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 44%"
