                    "text": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\n\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nB. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nC. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\nD. ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\n"

                    "text": "The most likely reason for not observing a green signal in the offspring when crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice is:\n\nC. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\n\nThis explanation suggests that the genetic construct designed to express the receptor fused to eGFP may have an issue with the reading frame. If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the fusion protein will not be properly translated, leading to no functional eGFP being produced and thus no observable green fluorescence.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options might not be as likely:\n\nA. **the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: While this could potentially affect the visibility of the green signal if the protein is not transported to the cell surface or cytoplasm where it can be observed, it does not inherently prevent the production of a functional eGFP protein.\n\nB. **the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: This would imply that neither the ligand nor the receptor is being expressed at all, which would affect both the red and green signals. However, since the question specifically mentions the absence of a green signal, this option does not directly address the lack of green fluorescence alone.\n\nD. **ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: A paracrine relationship implies that the ligand and receptor interact between different cells rather than within the same cell. While this could influence the biological function of the ligand-receptor interaction, it does not explain the absence of a green signal from the eGFP fusion protein.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation given the context provided is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, preventing the proper translation and expression of the eGFP protein."
