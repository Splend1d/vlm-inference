The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.\n\nIn our universe, one of Maxwell's equations states that the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero, which mathematically expresses the fact that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles (i.e., isolated North or South poles). This equation is:\n\n\u2207 \u00b7 B = 0\n\nIf in a parallel universe magnets could have isolated North or South poles, this would imply the existence of magnetic monopoles. Consequently, the equation for the divergence of the magnetic field would need to be modified to account for the presence of these monopoles. It would take the form:\n\n\u2207 \u00b7 B = \u03c1_m\n\nwhere \u03c1_m represents the magnetic charge density. This modification would reflect the new physical reality where isolated magnetic poles exist."
