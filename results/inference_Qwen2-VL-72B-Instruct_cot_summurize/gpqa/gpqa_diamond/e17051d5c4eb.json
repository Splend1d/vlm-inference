The substituents can be classified into two categories: ortho-para directors and meta directors.\n\n1. Ortho-para directors: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions relative to the substituent.\n   - Methyl group (-CH3): Strongly activating and ortho-para directing.\n   - Ethyl group (-C2H5): Activating and ortho-para directing.\n   - Phenyl group (-C6H5): Weakly activating and ortho-para directing.\n\n2. Meta directors: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position relative to the substituent.\n   - Nitro group (-NO2): Deactivating and meta directing.\n   - Carboxylic acid group (-COOH): Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n   - Carbethoxy group (-COOC2H5): Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n   - Chloride group (-Cl): Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each substance:\n\n1. **C6H5-CH3**: Methyl group is strongly activating and directs to ortho and para positions.\n2. **C6H5-COOC2H5**: Carbethoxy group is weakly deactivating and directs to meta positions.\n3. **C6H5-Cl**: Chloride group is weakly deactivating and directs to meta positions.\n4. **C6H5-NO2**: Nitro group is deactivating and directs to meta positions.\n5. **C6H5-C2H5**: Ethyl group is activating and directs to ortho and para positions.\n6. **C6H5-COOH**: Carboxylic acid group is weakly deactivating and directs to meta positions.\n\nThe order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer would be from the most meta-directing to the least meta-directing (i.e., from the strongest meta director to the weakest or no meta director):\n\n1. **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongest meta director.\n2. **Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**: Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n3. **Carbethoxy group (-COOC2H5)**: Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n4. **Chloride group (-Cl)**: Weakly deactivating and meta directing.\n5. **Ethyl group (-C2H5)**: Activating and ortho-para directing.\n6. **Methyl group (-CH3)**: Strongly activating and ortho-para directing.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 5 < 1**\n\nThis matches option D. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3"
