Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the parent structure**: The parent structure is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached. This makes the parent compound \"benzoic acid.\"\n\n2. **Locate the carboxylic acid group**: The carboxylic acid group will be considered as the reference point (position 1).\n\n3. **Number the ring**: Number the ring in such a way that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers.\n\n4. **Identify and prioritize the substituents**: \n   - Carboxylic acid (COOH)\n   - Hydroxyl (OH)\n   - Dimethylamino (N(CH\u2083)\u2082)\n   - Methoxy (OCH\u2083)\n   - Cyano (CN)\n   - Carbaldehyde (CHO)\n\n5. **Assign positions to the substituents**:\n   - The carboxylic acid is at position 1.\n   - The hydroxyl group is ortho to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 2.\n   - The dimethylamino group is also ortho to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 6.\n   - The methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 4.\n   - The cyano group is meta to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 3.\n   - The carbaldehyde group is meta to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position 5.\n\n6. **Construct the IUPAC name**:\n   - Start with the parent name: benzoic acid.\n   - List the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by their positions: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-(dimethylamino).\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is:\n\n**A. 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
