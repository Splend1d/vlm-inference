This shift can be used to estimate the semi-major axis \\(a\\) of the planet's orbit using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v}{c} \\lambda_0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta \\lambda\\) is the observed wavelength shift,\n- \\(v\\) is the radial velocity,\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light,\n- \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nSince the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, we can assume that the semi-major axes of their orbits are proportional to the square root of the ratio of their periods squared, according to Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the radial velocity \\(v\\) is proportional to the semi-major axis \\(a\\), we can write:\n\n\\[ v_1 \\propto a_1 \\]\n\\[ v_2 \\propto a_2 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\]\n\nFrom the given data:\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ milliangstroms}}{5 \\text{ milliangstroms}} = 1.4 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1.4 \\]\n\nSubstituting this into Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^3 = 1.4^3 \\]\n\nCalculating \\(1.4^3\\):\n\n\\[ 1.4^3 = 1.4 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.4 = 2.744 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\sqrt{2.744} \\approx 1.656 \\]\n\nSo, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.656 times longer than that of planet #1.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest value is:\n\nC. ~ 1.40\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. ~ 1.40."
