Since there are four particles, the total energy of the ground state is:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{ground}} = 4 \\times E = 4E \\]\n\nFor the first excited state of the system, three particles will occupy the ground state \\( E_1 \\) and one particle will occupy the first excited state \\( E_2 \\). The total energy of the first excited state is:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{first excited}} = 3 \\times E + 1 \\times 4E = 3E + 4E = 7E \\]\n\nFor the second excited state of the system, two particles will occupy the ground state \\( E_1 \\), one particle will occupy the first excited state \\( E_2 \\), and one particle will occupy the second excited state \\( E_3 \\). The total energy of the second excited state is:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{second excited}} = 2 \\times E + 1 \\times 4E + 1 \\times 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4E, 10E, 15E"
