                    "text": "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we need to follow the sequence of reactions step by step and understand how each reaction modifies the structure of the molecule.\n\nStarting with cyclohexanone:\n\n1. **Treatment with bromine:** This typically results in the formation of a bromoalkane. In this case, it would form 1-bromocyclohexane (product 1).\n\n2. **Heating with sodium hydroxide:** This is likely a substitution reaction where the bromine atom is replaced by a hydroxyl group, forming cyclohexanol (product 2).\n\n3. **Treatment with thionyl chloride and pyridine:** This converts the hydroxyl group into a chloroalkane, forming 1-chlorocyclohexane (product 3).\n\n4. **Treatment with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride:** This reagent is known for reducing alkyl halides to alkanes. Therefore, 1-chlorocyclohexane would be reduced to cyclohexane (product 4).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of cyclohexane:\n- Cyclohexane has a ring of six carbon atoms, each bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen atom.\n- Each carbon in the ring is bonded to two other carbons and one hydrogen atom, making a total of six hydrogen atoms directly attached to the ring.\n- Additionally, cyclohexane can exist in different conformations (chair, boat), but these do not affect the count of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane (product 4) is 6.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 6"
