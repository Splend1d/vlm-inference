                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each part of the question separately.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism refers to the ability of a molecule to exist in multiple interconvertible forms that differ in the position of hydrogen atoms and double bonds. \n\n- **Benzoquinone**: This compound does not typically exhibit tautomerism because it lacks the necessary functional groups that can undergo such rearrangements.\n- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three keto groups that could potentially participate in tautomerism, making it more likely to show this property compared to benzoquinone.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. A molecule with at least one chiral center will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n- **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups (H, OH, COOCH\u2083, CH\u2083). This makes it a chiral molecule, capable of exhibiting optical isomerism.\n- **Dimethyl fumarate**: This compound does not have any chiral centers; all carbons are either part of a double bond or bonded to two identical groups. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from both parts:\n\n- For Part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n- For Part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n**C. A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**"
