                    "text": "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations assumes that the interaction with an external field occurs as if the nucleons were free particles, ignoring the effects of the nuclear medium on the interaction. This approximation simplifies the calculation by treating each nucleon individually and neglecting the influence of other nucleons or the nuclear binding forces. Let's analyze each assumption:\n\n1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This implies that the interaction is localized to individual nucleons rather than affecting the nucleus as a whole. This is consistent with the impulse approximation.\n\n2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that the interaction with the external field is not affected by the presence of other nucleons in the nucleus. This aligns with the idea that the selected nucleon behaves as if it were isolated.\n\n3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: This assumption pertains to the internal dynamics of the nucleon itself and does not directly relate to the interaction with the external field or the behavior of the nucleon within the nucleus.\n\n4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This directly addresses the neglect of nuclear binding forces, which is a key aspect of the impulse approximation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n- The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons (1).\n- The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon (2).\n- The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces (4).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 1,2,4**"
