The image charge \\( q' \\) will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to \\( q \\), and it will be located at a distance \\( d' \\) from the center of the sphere such that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d'}{d} = \\frac{R}{d'} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( d' \\):\n\n\\[ d'^2 = Rd \\]\n\\[ d' = \\sqrt{Rd} \\]\n\nThe potential energy \\( U \\) due to the interaction between the charge \\( q \\) and its image charge \\( q' \\) can be calculated using Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{kq|q'|}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges. Since the charges are opposite in sign, the potential energy is negative. The distance \\( r \\) between the charges is the sum of their distances from the center of the sphere:\n\n\\[ r = d + d' \\]\n\\[ r = d + \\sqrt{Rd} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r \\) into the expression for \\( U \\):\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d + \\sqrt{Rd}} \\]\n\nThis expression does not match any of the given options directly. However, if we simplify or approximate the expression under certain conditions (e.g., \\( d \\gg R \\)), we might get closer to one of the options. Let's try to simplify the expression further:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{kq^2}{d(1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{d}})} \\]\n\nFor \\( d \\gg R \\), \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{d}} \\) becomes very small, and we can approximate \\( 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{d}} \\approx 1 \\). This approximation gives us:\n\n\\[ U \\approx -\\frac{kq^2}{d} \\]\n\nNone of the provided options exactly matches this simplified form. It seems there might have been an error in the question or the options provided. Without additional context or clarification, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer matching one of the given options."
