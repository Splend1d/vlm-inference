The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n\n1. \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\)\n2. \\(\\Delta m_l = 0, \\pm 1\\)\n\nGiven that the initial state is \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\), we can analyze each option based on these selection rules.\n\n### Option A: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n\n- First transition: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 1 - 0 = 1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = 0 - 0 = 0\\) (Allowed)\n\n- Second transition: \\(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = 0 - 0 = 0\\) (Allowed)\n\nBoth transitions satisfy the selection rules. Now, let's calculate the probability.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n\nThe probability of a dipole transition between two states is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the dipole operator between those states. For simplicity, we will not go into the detailed calculation of the matrix elements but rather use the given probabilities to check which one matches our analysis.\n\n### Option B: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n\n- First transition: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 1 - 0 = 1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = -1 - 0 = -1\\) (Allowed)\n\n- Second transition: \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = 0 - (-1) = 1\\) (Allowed)\n\nBoth transitions satisfy the selection rules. Let's check the probability.\n\n### Option C: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n\nThis is the same as Option A, so it also satisfies the selection rules.\n\n### Option D: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n\n- First transition: \\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 1 - 0 = 1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = 1 - 0 = 1\\) (Allowed)\n\n- Second transition: \\(|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\)\n  - \\(\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1\\) (Allowed)\n  - \\(\\Delta m_l = 0 - 1 = -1\\) (Allowed)\n\nBoth transitions satisfy the selection rules. Let's check the probability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll options satisfy the selection rules for dipole transitions. However, the question asks for the correct transition route and its corresponding probability. Without the detailed calculation of the matrix elements, we rely on the given probabilities to match with the correct transition route.\n\nGiven the options:\n- Option A has a probability of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n- Option B has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n- Option C has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n- Option D has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\nWithout additional information or calculations, we cannot definitively choose between Options B and D based solely on the selection rules. However, since both satisfy the selection rules and have the same probability, either could be correct. \n\nFor the sake of providing an answer, if we had to choose based on the given probabilities and assuming no errors in the question, **Option B** (\\(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle\\) with a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)) seems to be the most straightforward choice, considering the typical probabilities associated with such transitions."
