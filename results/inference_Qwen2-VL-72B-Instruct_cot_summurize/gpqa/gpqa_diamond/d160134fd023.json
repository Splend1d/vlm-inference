                    "text": "To determine the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Element Y**:\n   - Since five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known, and A1 decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine) and fluorine, we can infer that element Y is likely a halogen or another highly electronegative element.\n   - Given that A1 oxidizes xenon, it suggests that element Y is a strong oxidizer, further supporting the idea that Y could be a halogen.\n\n2. **Binary Compounds of Fluorine with Y**:\n   - Binary compounds of fluorine with halogens typically include fluorides such as ClF, BrF, IF, etc.\n   - The presence of multiple binary compounds indicates that Y forms various fluorides.\n\n3. **Formation of A3**:\n   - A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine, suggesting that A3 is a fluoride of Y.\n\n4. **Interaction with Xenon**:\n   - Both A1 and A3 can interact with xenon, indicating their high reactivity and possibly their role as oxidizing agents.\n\n5. **Formation of A5**:\n   - Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 yields A5.\n   - This implies that A4 is a compound of Y and another element, and A5 is formed through a reaction involving Y and A4.\n\n6. **Decomposition of A5 in Water**:\n   - A5 decomposes in water, forming two substances. This indicates that A5 is unstable in aqueous conditions.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider the possible identities of Y and the molecular weights of the compounds involved:\n\n- If Y is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br, I), then A4 would be a compound of Y with another element, likely an oxide or another halide.\n- The molecular weight of A4 would depend on the specific identity of Y and the other elements involved.\n\nConsidering the options provided for the molecular weight of A4:\n\nA. 160-180\nB. 110-130\nC. 220-240\nD. 140-160\n\nThe most plausible range for the molecular weight of A4, considering typical halogen compounds and their reactivities, would be:\n\n**Final Answer: D. 140-160**"
