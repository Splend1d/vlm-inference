This reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond, resulting in the addition of the nucleophile to the molecule. It's widely used for building complex organic compounds with specific functional groups and stereochemistry, finding applications in pharmaceuticals, natural product synthesis, and chemical synthesis.\nThe final products of the following reactions are:\nmethyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate + (NaOEt, THF, 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene) ---> A\nethyl 2-ethylbutanoate + (NaH, THF, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate) ---> B\n\nA.
