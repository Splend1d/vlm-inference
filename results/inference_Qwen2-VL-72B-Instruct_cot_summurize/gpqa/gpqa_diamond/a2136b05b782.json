In basic solutions, this tendency remains strong due to the presence of hydroxide ions (OH\u207b), which can facilitate the reduction process. Therefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\n2. **Kinetic Reactivity**:\n   - Kinetics deals with the rate at which reactions occur. In acidic solutions, the presence of hydrogen ions (H\u207a) can catalyze the reduction of oxygen, making the reaction proceed more quickly. Thus, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nGiven these points, the correct combination is:\n\n**C. stronger \u2013 faster**\n\nSo, the completed statement would be:\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.\""
