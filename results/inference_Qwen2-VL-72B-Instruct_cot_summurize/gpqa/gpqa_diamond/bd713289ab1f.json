                    "text": "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product E, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C**:\n   - This reaction suggests that C has a complex structure involving multiple atoms from both A and B.\n\n2. **Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E**:\n   - The formation of an extremely hazardous product indicates that E might have a highly reactive or unstable structure.\n\n3. **C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G**:\n   - Acid F is a strong acid, and acid G is a weak acid. This implies that C contains elements that can form these acids upon hydrolysis.\n\n4. **Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent**:\n   - This suggests that H is likely a stable compound suitable for use as a solvent.\n\nGiven this information, let's consider the possible molecular symmetry groups:\n\n- **A. D\u221eh**: This represents a molecule with infinite rotational symmetry around an axis, such as linear molecules like CO2 or N2. However, E is described as extremely hazardous, which typically does not align with simple linear molecules.\n  \n- **B. C2**: This represents a molecule with a single rotation axis of order 2. This could be a simple diatomic molecule or a more complex molecule with a specific symmetry axis. However, the description of E being extremely hazardous doesn't necessarily point towards a simple C2 symmetry.\n  \n- **C. C2v**: This represents a molecule with a principal axis of order 2 and two mirror planes perpendicular to each other. This type of symmetry is common in molecules like water (H2O) or ammonia (NH3), but again, the hazardous nature of E doesn't strongly suggest this symmetry.\n  \n- **D. D4h**: This represents a molecule with a fourfold rotation axis and additional symmetry elements including mirror planes and inversion centers. This type of symmetry is found in molecules like square planar complexes or tetrahedral structures. Given the complexity and hazardous nature of E, D4h seems plausible as it can accommodate a more intricate and potentially unstable structure.\n\nConsidering the complexity and hazardous nature of E, the most fitting molecular symmetry group is likely one that allows for a more intricate structure, which points towards **D. D4h**.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D. D4h**."
