For the state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1> \\), the possible combinations of individual \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) values that sum up to \\( m = -1 \\) are:\n\n1. \\( m_1 = 0 \\) and \\( m_2 = -1 \\)\n2. \\( m_1 = -1 \\) and \\( m_2 = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to find the probability of both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) being \\(-\\hbar\\). This corresponds to the case where \\( m_1 = -1 \\) and \\( m_2 = -1 \\).\n\nHowever, this combination does not satisfy the condition \\( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \\). Therefore, it is impossible for both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) to simultaneously have the value \\(-\\hbar\\) in the given state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1> \\).\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\(-\\hbar\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 0."
