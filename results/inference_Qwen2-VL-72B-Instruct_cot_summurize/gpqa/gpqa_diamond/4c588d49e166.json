The eigenvalues of \\(P\\) can be found by solving its characteristic equation. However, since \\(P\\) is a symmetric matrix, it has real eigenvalues. We can directly compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\(P\\) are \\(0\\), \\(1\\), and \\(-1\\). The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(0\\) is:\n\\[ | \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nTo find the probability of getting 0 from the measurement of \\(P\\), we project the initial state \\(| \\psi \\rangle\\) onto the eigenvector \\(| \\phi_0 \\rangle\\):\n\\[ \\langle \\phi_0 | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\sqrt{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 1 = 2 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThe probability of getting 0 from the measurement of \\(P\\) is:\n\\[ P(0) = |\\langle \\phi_0 | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = |2 - 2\\sqrt{2}|^2 = (2 - 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 - 8\\sqrt{2} + 8 = 12 - 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Measure Operator \\(Q\\) after \\(P\\)\n\nThe matrix representation of \\(Q\\) is:\n\\[ Q = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nAfter measuring \\(P\\) and getting 0, the system collapses into the state \\(| \\phi_0 \\rangle\\). Now, we measure \\(Q\\) on this new state.\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\(Q\\) are \\(1\\), \\(0\\), and \\(-1\\). The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(-1\\) is:\n\\[ | \\chi_{-1} \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nTo find the probability of getting \\(-1\\) from the measurement of \\(Q\\), we project the state \\(| \\phi_0 \\rangle\\) onto the eigenvector \\(| \\chi_{-1} \\rangle\\):\n\\[ \\langle \\chi_{-1} | \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\]\n\nThe probability of getting \\(-1\\) from the measurement of \\(Q\\) is:\n\\[ P(-1) = |\\langle \\chi_{-1} | \\phi_0 \\rangle|^2 = |1|^2 = 1 \\]\n\n### Final Probability\n\nThe overall probability of getting 0 from the measurement of \\(P\\) and then \\(-1\\) from the measurement of \\(Q\\) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\\[ P(0 \\text{ and } -1) = P(0) \\times P(-1) = (12 - 8\\sqrt{2}) \\times 1 = 12 - 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThis value does not match any of the provided options directly.

The correct approach involves normalizing the eigenvector and projecting properly.
