Let's break down its structure:\n   - It has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond).\n   - It has a vinyl group (another double bond).\n   - It has a formyl group (aldehyde, one double bond).\n   - It has a carboxylic acid group (one double bond).\n\n2. **Calculate the IHD of the starting compound**:\n   - Each double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.\n   - The cyclohexene ring has one double bond: +1.\n   - The vinyl group has one double bond: +1.\n   - The formyl group has one double bond: +1.\n   - The carboxylic acid group has one double bond: +1.\n\n   Therefore, the total IHD for the starting compound is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Understand the reaction**: The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI. This typically results in the reduction of the double bonds present in the molecule. Specifically, HI can reduce carbonyl groups (formyl and carboxylic acid) and alkenes (double bonds in the ring and vinyl group).\n\n4. **Predict the product**:\n   - The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n   - The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group.\n   - The double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group will be reduced to single bonds.\n\n5. **Calculate the IHD of the product**:\n   - After reduction, all double bonds are converted to single bonds.\n   - Therefore, the product will have no double bonds.\n\n   Hence, the IHD of the product is \\(0\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 0"
