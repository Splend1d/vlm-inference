It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps carefully.\n\nUpon reevaluation, it appears there was an error in the calculation of the uncertainty in kinetic energy. The correct approach should involve the uncertainty principle directly for energy and time, but since we don't have direct information about time uncertainty, we stick to the position-momentum uncertainty relation.\n\nGiven the options, let's reconsider the calculation for the uncertainty in momentum and its implications on energy. The correct approach involves understanding the relationship between momentum and energy more precisely, especially in quantum mechanics where the uncertainty principle applies differently to energy and momentum.\n\nGiven the provided options and the nature of the question, it seems there might have been an oversight in the direct conversion from momentum uncertainty to energy uncertainty without proper context. The correct answer based on the provided options and the initial interpretation would be:\n\nD. ~10^(-17) J\n\nHowever, please note that the detailed calculation process might require further clarification or adjustment based on the precise application of quantum mechanical principles."
