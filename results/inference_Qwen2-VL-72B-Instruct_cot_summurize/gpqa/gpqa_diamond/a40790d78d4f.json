In the case of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the vinyl group will migrate to the adjacent nitrogen atom, resulting in the formation of a new ring system.\n\nUpon performing the Cope rearrangement on the given compound, the vinyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom, leading to the formation of a tetrahydropyridine ring fused to a cyclopentane ring. The correct product would be:\n\nB. 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine\n\nThis product results from the migration of the vinyl group to the nitrogen atom, forming a new ring with the indicated numbering and stereochemistry."
