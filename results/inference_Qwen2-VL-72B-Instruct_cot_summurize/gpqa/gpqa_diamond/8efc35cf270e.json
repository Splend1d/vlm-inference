Without detailed experimental data or computational modeling, it's challenging to definitively identify the major isomer. However, based on common synthetic pathways and typical Diels-Alder reaction outcomes, the major isomer often results from the most stable transition state, which typically involves the least hindered approach of the reactants.\n\nGiven the complexity and without further specific details, it's not possible to conclusively determine the major isomer just from the given information. In practice, this would require experimental data or advanced computational chemistry tools to predict the major isomer accurately."
