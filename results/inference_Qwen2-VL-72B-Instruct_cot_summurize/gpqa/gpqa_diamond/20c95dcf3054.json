                    "text": "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting these clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the Lyman alpha line's wavelength and the typical range of wavelengths observable by optical telescopes.\n\nThe Lyman alpha line has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (\u00c5). Optical telescopes typically observe in the visible spectrum, which ranges roughly from 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5.\n\nWe want to find the minimum redshift \\( z \\) such that the observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{obs} \\) is within the visible spectrum. The relationship between the observed wavelength and the rest wavelength \\( \\lambda_0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0 (1 + z) \\]\n\nWe need \\( \\lambda_{obs} \\) to be greater than or equal to 4000 \u00c5, the lower end of the visible spectrum. Therefore,\n\n\\[ 4000 \\leq 1216 (1 + z) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( z \\):\n\n\\[ 4000 \\geq 1216 + 1216z \\]\n\\[ 4000 - 1216 \\geq 1216z \\]\n\\[ 2784 \\geq 1216z \\]\n\\[ z \\geq \\frac{2784}{1216} \\]\n\\[ z \\geq 2.3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift for these clouds to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 2.3. The closest option to this value is:\n\nB. 2.4"
