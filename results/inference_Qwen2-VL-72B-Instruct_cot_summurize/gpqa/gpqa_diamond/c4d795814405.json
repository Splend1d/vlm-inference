You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs during the maturation of B cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer patches in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). This process introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, leading to increased diversity in the antibody repertoire and affinity maturation for antigens."
