                    "text": "To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify if they contain chiral centers or asymmetric carbon atoms. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has one or more chiral centers, leading to enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound does not appear to have any chiral centers. The biphenyl structure and the substituents do not introduce asymmetry.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (lactate)**: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group and the carboxylate group. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3. **benzophenone**: This compound consists of two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. It does not have any chiral centers, so it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**: Fumarate is a trans-configuration of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. It does not have any chiral centers; hence, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 2 and 3**"
