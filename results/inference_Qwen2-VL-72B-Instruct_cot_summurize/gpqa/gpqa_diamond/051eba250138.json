Therefore, we can assume that most of the H2PO4- and HPO4^2- ions remain undissociated.\n\nThus, the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution will be approximately equal to the concentration of Na2HPO4\u25cf2H2O, which is 0.0281 M.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2.81x10^-7 M."
