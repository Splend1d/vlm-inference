The enolate will attack the electron-deficient carbon of the acrylate double bond.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Formation of Enolate**: The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at the \u03b1-position to form an enolate.\n   - The enolate formed is more stable when it is conjugated with the carbonyl group. In this case, the enolate will be formed at the less hindered position (the one not bearing the ethyl group).\n\n2. **Michael Addition**: The enolate attacks the electron-deficient carbon of the acrylate double bond.\n   - The attack occurs at the terminal carbon of the acrylate because it is less sterically hindered compared to the central carbon.\n\nGiven these considerations, the product will be:\n\\[ \\text{Ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate} \\]\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-Nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-But-2-enenitrile, H2O)\n\nThis reaction involves the nucleophilic substitution of the nitro group in 1-nitropropane with the nitrile group from (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Nucleophilic Substitution**: The nitro group in 1-nitropropane is replaced by the nitrile group from (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n   - The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism where the nitrile acts as the nucleophile attacking the primary carbon of the nitropropane.\n\nGiven these considerations, the product will be:\n\\[ \\text{3-Methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from both reactions, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**"
