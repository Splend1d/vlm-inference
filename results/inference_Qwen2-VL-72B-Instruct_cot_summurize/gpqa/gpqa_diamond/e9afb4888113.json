Superstring Theory\n\nSuperstring theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It is formulated to address issues with quantum gravity and unification of fundamental forces, including the problem of infinities that arise in quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In superstring theory, these infinities are thought to be resolved due to the extended nature of the strings, which leads to a natural form of regularization at high energies."
