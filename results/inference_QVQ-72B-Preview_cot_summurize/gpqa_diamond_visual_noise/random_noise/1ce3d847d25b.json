                    "text": "So I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25\u00b0C. The equilibrium constant for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5 \u00d7 10^10. The options are:\n\nA. 1.0 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\nB. 6.3 \u00d7 10^-7 M\n\nC. 2.0 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\nD. 5.0 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on here. Ca-EDTA is a complex ion formed when calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a) bind to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA\u2074\u207b). The reaction can be represented as:\n\nCa\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b \u21cc Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as K = 5 \u00d7 10^10.\n\nNow, I'm given the total concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free Ca\u00b2\u207a ions in this solution.\n\nAssuming the pH is ideal, I can probably neglect any protonation of EDTA or hydrolysis of Ca\u00b2\u207a, which simplifies things.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n[Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x M\n\n[EDTA\u2074\u207b] = y M\n\n[Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = c M\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, the total concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is equal to the concentration of Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b formed plus the concentration of free Ca\u00b2\u207a and EDTA\u2074\u207b. However, since the complexation is very strong (K = 5 \u00d7 10^10), I can assume that most of the Ca\u00b2\u207a and EDTA\u2074\u207b have formed the complex.\n\nBut to be precise, I should set up an ICE table for this equilibrium.\n\nThe initial concentrations:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that initially, we have [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c M and [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c M, since they form a 1:1 complex.\n\nAfter complexation:\n\n[Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c - x\n\n[EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c - x\n\n[Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = x\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the total stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think this refers to the total concentration of Ca and EDTA that can form the complex, which would be the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2\u207a and EDTA\u2074\u207b before complexation.\n\nSo, if I let the initial [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c and [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c, then the total stoichiometric concentration would be 2c, but that doesn't match the given 0.02 M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stoichiometric concentration is the total concentration of Ca-EDTA complex present, which includes both free and bound forms.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the stoichiometric concentration is the total concentration of Ca bound to EDTA plus the free Ca, but since the complex is very stable, most of the Ca should be bound.\n\nLet me think differently. The total concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, which probably includes both the complexed and free Ca\u00b2\u207a.\n\nSo, total [Ca] = [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = 0.02 M\n\nSimilarly, total [EDTA] = [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = 0.02 M\n\nBut since the complexation is very strong, most of the Ca and EDTA are bound together.\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]) = 5 \u00d7 10^10\n\nLet me denote [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, then [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 - x, and [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = 0.02 - x\n\nPlugging into the equilibrium constant:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x)(0.02 - x)\n\nSince K is very large, (0.02 - x) is approximately 0.02, because x is very small compared to 0.02 M.\n\nSo, approximating:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = (0.02) / (x)(0.02)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's re-express the equation properly.\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]) = 5 \u00d7 10^10\n\nLet [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = x, then [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 - x, and [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = 0.02 - x\n\nSo,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x)(0.02 - x)\n\nGiven that K is very large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 0.02 / (x)(0.02)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the denominator should be x times (0.02 - x), not x times 0.02.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 (0.02 - x) / (x)(0.02 - x)\n\nSince x is much smaller than 0.02, (0.02 - x) \u2248 0.02 and (0.02 - x) in the denominator can be approximated as 0.02.\n\nSo,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 0.02 / (x)(0.02)\n\nWait, no. The denominator is x times (0.02 - x), which is approximately x times 0.02.\n\nSo,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 0.02 / (x * 0.02)\n\nSimplify:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 1 / x\n\nTherefore, x \u2248 1 / (5 \u00d7 10^10) = 2 \u00d7 10^-11 M\n\nBut this is extremely small, and the options provided are in the range of 10^-2 to 10^-7 M. So maybe this approximation is not accurate enough.\n\nLet me try to solve the quadratic equation more accurately.\n\nFrom the equilibrium expression:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x)(0.02 - x)\n\nLet me multiply both sides by x(0.02 - x):\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 * x(0.02 - x) = 0.02 - x\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should expand the left side:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 * [0.02x - x\u00b2] = 0.02 - x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02x - 5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 = 0.02 - x\n\nCalculate 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02 = 1 \u00d7 10^9 x\n\nSo:\n\n1 \u00d7 10^9 x - 5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 = 0.02 - x\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n-5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 + 1 \u00d7 10^9 x + x - 0.02 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 + (1 \u00d7 10^9 + 1) x - 0.02 = 0\n\n1 \u00d7 10^9 + 1 is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^9, so:\n\n-5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 + 1 \u00d7 10^9 x - 0.02 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 - 1 \u00d7 10^9 x + 0.02 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in the form of ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where:\n\na = 5 \u00d7 10^10\n\nb = -1 \u00d7 10^9\n\nc = 0.02\n\nI can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a)\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nD = (-1 \u00d7 10^9)\u00b2 - 4 * (5 \u00d7 10^10) * (0.02)\n\nCalculate (-1 \u00d7 10^9)\u00b2:\n\n(-1 \u00d7 10^9)\u00b2 = 1 \u00d7 10^18\n\nCalculate 4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02:\n\n4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02 = 4 * 10^11 * 0.02 = 8 \u00d7 10^9\n\nSo, D = 1 \u00d7 10^18 - 8 \u00d7 10^9\n\nThis is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^18, since 8 \u00d7 10^9 is negligible compared to 1 \u00d7 10^18.\n\nTherefore, \u221aD \u2248 \u221a(1 \u00d7 10^18) = 1 \u00d7 10^9\n\nNow, x = [1 \u00d7 10^9 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (2 * 5 \u00d7 10^10)\n\nFirst, calculate the two possible solutions:\n\nx\u2081 = [1 \u00d7 10^9 + 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = [2 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = 2 \u00d7 10^9 / 10 \u00d7 10^10 = 2/10 \u00d7 10^9 / 10^10 = 0.2 \u00d7 10^-1 = 2 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\nx\u2082 = [1 \u00d7 10^9 - 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = [0] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = 0 M\n\nSo, x = 2 \u00d7 10^-2 M or x = 0 M\n\nSince x represents [Ca\u00b2\u207a], and it can't be zero, x = 2 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\nBut wait, this is higher than the total concentration of 0.02 M, which doesn't make sense because if [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = 0.02 M, then [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] would be 0 M, which contradicts the fact that the complexation constant is high.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the quadratic equation setup.\n\nWe have:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 x\u00b2 - 1 \u00d7 10^9 x + 0.02 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [1 \u00d7 10^9 \u00b1 \u221a( (1 \u00d7 10^9)^2 - 4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02)] / (2 * 5 \u00d7 10^10)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nD = (1 \u00d7 10^9)^2 - 4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02\n\n= 1 \u00d7 10^18 - 4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02\n\nFirst, calculate 4 * 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.02:\n\n4 * 5 = 20\n\n20 * 10^10 = 2 \u00d7 10^11\n\n2 \u00d7 10^11 * 0.02 = 4 \u00d7 10^9\n\nSo, D = 1 \u00d7 10^18 - 4 \u00d7 10^9 = 9.9996 \u00d7 10^17 (approximately)\n\nThen, \u221aD \u2248 \u221a(1 \u00d7 10^18) = 1 \u00d7 10^9\n\nNow, x = [1 \u00d7 10^9 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10)\n\nSo, x\u2081 = [1 \u00d7 10^9 + 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = 2 \u00d7 10^9 / 10 \u00d7 10^10 = 0.2 \u00d7 10^-1 = 2 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\nx\u2082 = [1 \u00d7 10^9 - 1 \u00d7 10^9] / (10 \u00d7 10^10) = 0 M\n\nBut x = 2 \u00d7 10^-2 M seems too high because it's equal to the total concentration. Maybe I misinterpreted the total stoichiometric concentration.\n\nWait, perhaps the total stoichiometric concentration is the sum of Ca and EDTA, not their individual concentrations.\n\nLet me revisit the problem statement: \"the total stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.\"\n\nI think this refers to the total concentration of Ca and EDTA that can form the complex, which would be [Ca\u00b2\u207a] + [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b].\n\nBut in the ICE table approach, I assumed that the total concentration is [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [Ca\u00b2\u207a].\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stoichiometric concentration is the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex before any complexation occurs.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that initially, we have [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c M and [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c M, since they form a 1:1 complex.\n\nAfter complexation, we have:\n\n[Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c - x\n\n[EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c - x\n\n[Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = x\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] / ([Ca\u00b2\u207a][EDTA\u2074\u207b]) = 5 \u00d7 10^10\n\nSo,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = x / [(c - x)(c - x)]\n\nGiven that x is much smaller than c (because K is large), we can approximate c - x \u2248 c.\n\nThus,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 x / c\u00b2\n\nTherefore, x \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^10 c\u00b2\n\nBut this doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I need to express c in terms of the total concentration.\n\nThe total concentration is [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [Ca\u00b2\u207a] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x + (c - x) + (c - x) = 2c - x\n\nBut I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total stoichiometric concentration is equal to the initial concentration of Ca and EDTA, which would be c + c = 2c = 0.02 M, so c = 0.01 M.\n\nThen, at equilibrium:\n\n[Ca\u00b2\u207a] = 0.01 - x\n\n[EDTA\u2074\u207b] = 0.01 - x\n\n[Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] = x\n\nAnd the equilibrium constant:\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 = x / [(0.01 - x)(0.01 - x)]\n\nSince K is very large, x is much smaller than 0.01, so 0.01 - x \u2248 0.01\n\nThus,\n\n5 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 x / (0.01)^2 = x / 0.0001\n\nTherefore, x \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^10 * 0.0001 = 5 \u00d7 10^6 M\n\nBut this is impossible, as x cannot be larger than the initial concentrations.\n\nI must have made another mistake.\n\nLet me try to set up the equilibrium expression properly.\n\nGiven that the reaction is:\n\nCa\u00b2\u207a + EDTA\u2074\u207b \u21cc Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b\n\nInitial concentrations: [Ca\u00b2\u207a] = c, [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = c\n\nChange: -x, -x, +x\n\nEquilibrium concentrations: c - x, c - x, x\n\nTotal concentration: [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [Ca\u00b2\u207a] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b] = x + (c - x) + (c - x) = 2c - x\n\nBut the problem states that the total stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, which might refer to the total concentration of Ca and EDTA that can form the complex, which would be 2c.\n\nWait, perhaps the stoichiometric concentration is the sum of the concentrations of species that can form the complex, which would be [Ca\u00b2\u207a] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b] + [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b].\n\nBut in this case, since Ca and EDTA are present in equal amounts initially, their sum would be 2c.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up how to handle such problems.\n\nIn complexation reactions, the total analytical concentration is often defined as the sum of all species containing the metal ion or the ligand.\n\nIn this case, the total concentration of Ca is [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [Ca\u00b2\u207a], and the total concentration of EDTA is [Ca-EDTA\u00b2\u207b] + [EDTA\u2074\u207b].\n\nGiven that the reaction is 1:1, and assuming that Ca and EDTA are present initially in equal concentrations, their total concentration would be [Ca-EDTA"
