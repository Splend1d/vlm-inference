                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's been a while since I've dealt with quantum mechanics, but I'll try to wrap my head around it. So, we have a system in a state at time t, represented by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). That means the state vector is:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNow, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. Let's denote the matrix for P as P_matrix and for Q as Q_matrix.\n\nFirst, let's write down P_matrix based on the description:\n\nP_matrix = [ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\nAnd Q_matrix is:\n\nQ_matrix = [ 1 0 0 ]\n\n[ 0 0 0 ]\n\n[ 0 0 -1 ]\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of measuring P as 0 and then Q as -1, in that order.\n\nFirst, I need to find the probability of measuring P as 0. Since P is an observable, its possible measurements are the eigenvalues of the P_matrix, and the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo, step 1: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P_matrix.\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues first. The characteristic equation is given by det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, P - \u03bbI = [ 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb ]\n\nWait, this looks like a 3x3 matrix, but the way it's described seems a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the description seems to indicate that P_matrix is a 3x3 matrix with the following elements:\n\nFirst row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSecond row: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nThird row: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nSo, P_matrix = [ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\nNow, to find its eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, det([ -\u03bb 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 -\u03bb 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 -\u03bb ]) = 0\n\nLet's compute this determinant.\n\nFirst, expand along the first row:\n\n= -\u03bb * det([ -\u03bb 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 -\u03bb ]) - (1/\u221a2) * det([ 1/\u221a2 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 -\u03bb ]) + 0 * det([ 1/\u221a2 -\u03bb ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 ])\n\nCompute the 2x2 determinants:\n\ndet([ -\u03bb 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 -\u03bb ]) = (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2\n\ndet([ 1/\u221a2 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 -\u03bb ]) = (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n= -\u03bb(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) + 0\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (1/2)\u03bb\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb: \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 \u03bb = \u00b11\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = -1, 0, 1.\n\nWait, but according to the options, it seems like we're dealing with discrete measurements, and the question mentions measuring P as 0. But from the eigenvalues, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb = 0:\n\n(P - 0*I)X = 0 \u21d2 [ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ] [x]\n\n[y]\n\n[z] = [0]\n\n[0]\n\n[0]\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n1/\u221a2 y = 0\n\n1/\u221a2 x + 1/\u221a2 z = 0\n\n1/\u221a2 y = 0\n\nFrom the first and third equations, y = 0.\n\nFrom the second equation, x = -z\n\nSo, eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb = 0 are of the form [ -z ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ z ] = z [ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNormalize this eigenvector.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector for \u03bb = 0 is (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = 1:\n\n(P - I)X = 0 \u21d2 [ -1 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 -1 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 -1 ] [x]\n\n[y]\n\n[z] = [0]\n\n[0]\n\n[0]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n-1x + 1/\u221a2 y = 0\n\n1/\u221a2 x -1 y + 1/\u221a2 z = 0\n\n0 x + 1/\u221a2 y -1 z = 0\n\nLet's solve this system.\n\nFrom the first equation: -x + (1/\u221a2)y = 0 \u21d2 x = (1/\u221a2)y\n\nFrom the third equation: (1/\u221a2)y - z = 0 \u21d2 z = (1/\u221a2)y\n\nSo, eigenvectors are of the form [ (1/\u221a2)y ]\n\n[ y ]\n\n[ (1/\u221a2)y ] = y [ 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nNormalize this:\n\nNorm = sqrt( (1/\u221a2)^2 + 1^2 + (1/\u221a2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, normalized eigenvector for \u03bb = 1 is (1/\u221a2)[ 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 ] = [1/2]\n\n[1/\u221a2]\n\n[1/2]\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -1:\n\n(P + I)X = 0 \u21d2 [1 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2 1 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0 1/\u221a2 1 ] [x]\n\n[y]\n\n[z] = [0]\n\n[0]\n\n[0]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\nx + (1/\u221a2)y = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2)x + y + (1/\u221a2)z = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2)y + z = 0\n\nFrom the third equation: (1/\u221a2)y + z = 0 \u21d2 z = -(1/\u221a2)y\n\nFrom the first equation: x = -(1/\u221a2)y\n\nFrom the second equation: (1/\u221a2)(-(1/\u221a2)y) + y + (1/\u221a2)(-(1/\u221a2)y) = 0\n\nSimplify: -(1/2)y + y - (1/2)y = 0 \u21d2 0 = 0, which is always true.\n\nSo, eigenvectors are of the form [ -(1/\u221a2)y ]\n\n[ y ]\n\n[ -(1/\u221a2)y ] = y [ -1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\n[ -1/\u221a2 ]\n\nNormalize this:\n\nNorm = sqrt( (-1/\u221a2)^2 + 1^2 + (-1/\u221a2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, normalized eigenvector for \u03bb = -1 is (1/\u221a2)[ -1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\n[ -1/\u221a2 ] = [ -1/2 ]\n\n[ 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ -1/2 ]\n\nNow, we have the eigenvalues and their corresponding normalized eigenvectors for P.\n\nNext, the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nWe need to express |\u03c8\u27e9 in terms of the eigenvectors of P.\n\nFirst, find the coefficients for each eigenvector.\n\nFor \u03bb = 0: eigenvector |v\u2080\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nCoefficient c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1 + 1) = (1/\u221a2)(2) = \u221a2\n\nWait, that can't be right because eigenvectors are supposed to be normalized, and the coefficients should be such that the sum of their squares equals 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in normalization.\n\nLet me double-check the normalization of |v\u2080\u27e9.\n\n|v\u2080\u27e9 = z[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nSet z = 1/\u221a2 to normalize.\n\nThen, |v\u2080\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNow, c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1 + 0 + 1) = (1/\u221a2)(2) = \u221a2\n\nBut that can't be, because |c\u2080|^2 should be less than or equal to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the eigenvectors need to be orthonormal basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize the eigenvectors.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in finding the eigenvectors.\n\nLet me revisit the eigenvectors.\n\nFor \u03bb = 0:\n\nWe had [ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNormalized to (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nBut perhaps I need to normalize it properly.\n\nThe norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nSimilarly for \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = -1, we have their normalized eigenvectors.\n\nNow, express |\u03c8\u27e9 as a linear combination of these eigenvectors.\n\nCompute c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1 + 0 + 1) = \u221a2\n\nBut that's not possible because |c\u2080|^2 should be less than or equal to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to normalize the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 first.\n\nCalculate the norm of |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n||\u03c8|| = sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9_norm = (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNow, compute c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1/sqrt(6))(-1 + 0 + 1) = (1/\u221a2)(1/sqrt(6))(0) = 0\n\nWait, that's 0. So, c\u2080 = 0\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = 1:\n\nc\u2081 = \u27e8v\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = [1/2 1/\u221a2 1/2 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/sqrt(6))( -1/2 + 2/\u221a2 + 1/2 ) = (1/sqrt(6))( -1/2 + \u221a2 + 1/2 ) = (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -1:\n\nc\u208b\u2081 = \u27e8v\u208b\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = [ -1/2 1/\u221a2 -1/2 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/sqrt(6))(1/2 + 2/\u221a2 -1/2) = (1/sqrt(6))(2/\u221a2) = (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2\n\nSo, c\u2081 = c\u208b\u2081 = (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2\n\nTherefore, |\u03c8\u27e9_norm = c\u2080|v\u2080\u27e9 + c\u2081|v\u2081\u27e9 + c\u208b\u2081|v\u208b\u2081\u27e9 = 0*|v\u2080\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2 |v\u2081\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2 |v\u208b\u2081\u27e9\n\nNow, the probability of measuring P as 0 is |c\u2080|^2 = 0, which is impossible, but according to the problem, we are measuring P as 0.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, c\u2080 = 0, which means the state has no component along |v\u2080\u27e9, so the probability of measuring P as 0 is 0.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that we can measure P as 0, so maybe I made a mistake in the normalization or the eigenvectors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state vector is not normalized to begin with, and I should proceed without normalizing it.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nExpress |\u03c8\u27e9 = c\u2080|v\u2080\u27e9 + c\u2081|v\u2081\u27e9 + c\u208b\u2081|v\u208b\u2081\u27e9\n\nCompute c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1 + 0 + 1) = \u221a2\n\nSimilarly, c\u2081 = \u27e8v\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9 = [1/2 1/\u221a2 1/2 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/2)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(2) + (1/2)(1) = -1/2 + 2/\u221a2 + 1/2 = 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2\n\nAnd c\u208b\u2081 = \u27e8v\u208b\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2 1/\u221a2 -1/2 ] [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/2)(-1) + (1/\u221a2)(2) + (1/2)(1) = -1/2 + 2/\u221a2 + 1/2 = 2/\u221a2 = \u221a2\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u221a2 |v\u2080\u27e9 + \u221a2 |v\u2081\u27e9 + \u221a2 |v\u208b\u2081\u27e9\n\nBut this can't be right because the state vector would have norm sqrt( (\u221a2)^2 + (\u221a2)^2 + (\u221a2)^2 ) = sqrt(6), which is not 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the eigenvectors are not correctly normalized.\n\nLet me check the normalization of |v\u2080\u27e9.\n\n|v\u2080\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 ]\n\n[ 0 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nIts norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ) / \u221a2 = sqrt(2)/\u221a2 = 1, so it's normalized.\n\nSimilarly for |v\u2081\u27e9 and |v\u208b\u2081\u27e9.\n\nWait, perhaps the coefficients are not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.\n\nGiven that, the coefficients should satisfy the normalization condition.\n\nBut in this case, the coefficients are \u221a2 each, leading to |c\u2080|^2 + |c\u2081|^2 + |c\u208b\u2081|^2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \u2260 1.\n\nThis suggests an error in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to normalize the state vector first.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nState vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nIts norm is sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)\n\nSo, normalized state vector |\u03c8\u27e9_norm = (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNow, compute c\u2080 = \u27e8v\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = (1/\u221a2)[ -1 0 1 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/\u221a2)(1/sqrt(6))(-1 + 0 + 1) = (1/\u221a2)(1/sqrt(6))(0) = 0\n\nSimilarly, c\u2081 = \u27e8v\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = [1/2 1/\u221a2 1/2 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/sqrt(6))( -1/2 + 2/\u221a2 + 1/2 ) = (1/sqrt(6))(2/\u221a2) = (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2\n\nAnd c\u208b\u2081 = \u27e8v\u208b\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9_norm = [ -1/2 1/\u221a2 -1/2 ] (1/sqrt(6))[-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ] = (1/sqrt(6))(1/2 + 2/\u221a2 -1/2) = (1/sqrt(6))(2/\u221a2) = (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9_norm = 0*|v\u2080\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2 |v\u2081\u27e9 + (1/sqrt(6))\u221a2 |v\u208b\u2081\u27e9\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring P as 0 is |"
