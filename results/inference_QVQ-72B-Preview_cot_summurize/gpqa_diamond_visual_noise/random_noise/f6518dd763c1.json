                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a door with four forces applied to it, and I need to figure out which statement is correct regarding the net force and net torque. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on with these forces. There's a top view of a door with four forces labeled F1, F2, F3, and F4. The door has a hinge on the left side, so it's free to rotate about that point. The forces are acting in different directions: F1 and F4 are acting upwards, F3 is acting to the right, and F2 is acting to the left.\n\nThe question is asking which statement is correct:\n\na) Both the net force and the net torque are zero.\n\nb) The net force is zero, but the net torque is not zero.\n\nc) The net force is not zero, but the net torque is zero.\n\nd) Neither the net force nor the net torque is zero.\n\nAlright, so I need to analyze both the net force and the net torque on the door.\n\nLet's start with the net force.\n\nI should add up all the force vectors. If they cancel each other out, the net force is zero. Otherwise, it's not zero.\n\nSo, F1 is upwards, F4 is also upwards, F3 is to the right, and F2 is to the left.\n\nIf I consider their directions:\n\n- F1 and F4 are both in the positive vertical direction.\n\n- F3 is in the positive horizontal direction.\n\n- F2 is in the negative horizontal direction.\n\nAssuming that F3 and F2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, their horizontal components would cancel each other out.\n\nSimilarly, if F1 and F4 are equal in magnitude and direction, their vertical components would add up.\n\nWait, but in the diagram, F1 and F4 are both upwards, but they are applied at different points on the door.\n\nSo, if F1 and F4 are both upwards, their vertical components will add up, assuming they are equal in magnitude.\n\nBut, if F1 and F4 are not necessarily equal in magnitude, then their vertical components might not cancel out.\n\nSimilarly, if F3 and F2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, their horizontal components will cancel out.\n\nSo, if F1 and F4 are equal in magnitude, and F3 and F2 are equal in magnitude and opposite, then the net force would be zero.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the magnitudes of these forces, so I can't assume that.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look back at the problem.\n\nOh, wait, the problem says: \"A horizontal door is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its left edge (the hinge). Four forces of equal magnitude act on the door as shown in the top view.\"\n\nAh, so all four forces have equal magnitude.\n\nThat changes things.\n\nSo, F1, F2, F3, and F4 all have the same magnitude.\n\nGiven that, I can assume that each force has the same magnitude, say, F.\n\nNow, to find the net force, I need to add up all these vectors.\n\nLet's assign coordinates to make this easier.\n\nLet's assume the door is horizontal, with the hinge at the left end, say at the origin (0,0).\n\nLet's say the door extends from x=0 to x=L, where L is the length of the door.\n\nF1 is applied at the top right corner, upwards.\n\nF4 is applied somewhere along the top edge, also upwards.\n\nF3 is applied towards the right, and F2 is applied towards the left.\n\nWait, I need to be more precise about their positions.\n\nLooking at the diagram, F1 is at the top right corner, F4 is at the top left corner, F3 is somewhere in the middle towards the right, and F2 is towards the bottom center, pointing left.\n\nBut to simplify, maybe I can consider their positions relative to the hinge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the forces in terms of their components.\n\nSince all forces have the same magnitude F, I need to find the vector sum of F1, F2, F3, and F4.\n\nGiven their directions:\n\nF1: upwards (positive y-direction)\n\nF4: upwards (positive y-direction)\n\nF3: to the right (positive x-direction)\n\nF2: to the left (negative x-direction)\n\nSo, the net force in the x-direction is F3 + F2.\n\nSince F3 and F2 have the same magnitude but opposite directions, they cancel out, so net force in x-direction is zero.\n\nThe net force in the y-direction is F1 + F4.\n\nSince both F1 and F4 are upwards and of equal magnitude, their sum is 2F in the positive y-direction.\n\nTherefore, the net force is not zero; it's 2F upwards.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the door should be in equilibrium under these forces, right?\n\nWait, no, the door is free to rotate about the hinge, but it's horizontal and presumably at rest.\n\nBut according to this calculation, there's a net upward force of 2F, which would make the door accelerate upwards, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps there are other forces acting on the door, like gravity, which isn't shown here.\n\nAssuming the door has weight, which acts downward at the center of mass.\n\nIf that's the case, then the net force would be the sum of the four forces plus the weight.\n\nBut in the diagram, only the four forces are shown, so maybe weight is being balanced by one of them.\n\nWait, no, the hinge might be providing additional forces to balance the weight.\n\nBut the problem says the door is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its left edge, and there are four forces of equal magnitude acting on it.\n\nBut the hinge itself can exert forces to balance other forces and torques.\n\nSo, perhaps the hinge is providing additional forces to keep the door in equilibrium.\n\nIn that case, the net force on the door, considering only the four applied forces, might not be zero, but the hinge reaction forces would balance that out.\n\nBut the problem is asking about the net force considering only these four forces.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the hinge can exert forces only in certain directions.\n\nSince the hinge is fixed along the left edge, it can exert forces perpendicular to the door to prevent translation, but it can also exert torques to prevent rotation.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to rephrase this.\n\nThe door is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its left edge.\n\nThere are four forces applied to it, all of equal magnitude.\n\nI need to find the net force and the net torque about the hinge.\n\nFirst, the net force.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the net force is 2F upwards.\n\nBut if the door is in equilibrium, there must be another force, perhaps from the hinge, acting downwards to balance this net upward force.\n\nSo, if I consider only the four applied forces, the net force is not zero; it's 2F upwards.\n\nBut including the hinge reaction force, the net force should be zero for equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the hinge must be exerting a downward force of 2F to balance the net upward force from the four applied forces.\n\nSo, in this case, the net force considering only the four applied forces is not zero; it's 2F upwards.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the applied forces, not the hinge reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hinge doesn't exert any force in the horizontal plane, only in the vertical direction.\n\nWait, no, hinges can exert forces in multiple directions, depending on how they're constructed.\n\nIn this case, since the door is free to rotate about a vertical axis, the hinge can exert forces in the horizontal and vertical directions to prevent translation.\n\nSo, perhaps the hinge is providing a downward force to balance the net upward force from F1 and F4.\n\nBut the problem is asking about the net force and net torque considering only the four applied forces.\n\nSo, net force is 2F upwards.\n\nNow, for the net torque about the hinge.\n\nTorque is given by \u03c4 = r \u00d7 F, where r is the position vector from the hinge to the point of application of the force, and F is the force vector.\n\nSince the hinge is at the left edge, the position vectors for each force can be determined relative to that point.\n\nLet's assign coordinates:\n\nLet's say the hinge is at (0,0).\n\nAssume the door has length L and width W.\n\nF1 is at (L, W/2), acting upwards.\n\nF4 is at (0, W/2), acting upwards.\n\nF3 is at (L/2, 0), acting to the right.\n\nF2 is at (L/2, W), acting to the left.\n\nNow, to find the torque due to each force about the hinge.\n\nTorque \u03c4 = r \u00d7 F.\n\nFor F1: position vector r1 = (L, W/2). Force F1 is upwards, say (0, F, 0). Then \u03c41 = r1 \u00d7 F1 = (L, W/2, 0) \u00d7 (0, F, 0) = (0, 0, L*(F) - (W/2)*0) = (0, 0, LF)\n\nFor F4: position vector r4 = (0, W/2). Force F4 is upwards, (0, F, 0). Then \u03c44 = r4 \u00d7 F4 = (0, W/2, 0) \u00d7 (0, F, 0) = (0, 0, 0 - (W/2)*F) = (0, 0, - (W/2)F)\n\nFor F3: position vector r3 = (L/2, 0). Force F3 is to the right, (F, 0, 0). Then \u03c43 = r3 \u00d7 F3 = (L/2, 0, 0) \u00d7 (F, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 0 - 0*F) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nFor F2: position vector r2 = (L/2, W). Force F2 is to the left, (-F, 0, 0). Then \u03c42 = r2 \u00d7 F2 = (L/2, W, 0) \u00d7 (-F, 0, 0) = (0, 0, W*(-F) - 0*0) = (0, 0, -WF)\n\nNow, net torque \u03c4_net = \u03c41 + \u03c44 + \u03c43 + \u03c42 = (0,0,LF) + (0,0,-(W/2)F) + (0,0,0) + (0,0,-WF) = (0,0,LF - (W/2)F - WF)\n\nSimplify: LF - (W/2)F - WF = L F - (W/2) F - W F = [L - W - W/2] F = [L - (3W/2)] F\n\nSo, the net torque is (0,0,[L - (3W/2)]F)\n\nThis suggests that the net torque is not zero, unless L = (3W/2).\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any relationship between L and W, so generally, the net torque is not zero.\n\nTherefore, considering both net force and net torque:\n\n- Net force is 2F upwards.\n\n- Net torque is (0,0,[L - (3W/2)]F), which is generally not zero.\n\nSo, according to this, both net force and net torque are not zero.\n\nBut the problem gives options where one or both are zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the net force.\n\nEarlier, I thought the net force is 2F upwards, but maybe I need to consider the directions more carefully.\n\nLet me double-check the force components.\n\nF1: upwards (positive y)\n\nF4: upwards (positive y)\n\nF3: to the right (positive x)\n\nF2: to the left (negative x)\n\nSo, net force in x-direction: F3 + F2 = F + (-F) = 0\n\nNet force in y-direction: F1 + F4 = F + F = 2F\n\nNet force in z-direction: 0 (since all forces are in the xy-plane)\n\nTherefore, the net force is indeed 2F upwards.\n\nNow, for the net torque, I calculated \u03c4_net = (0,0,[L - (3W/2)]F), which is generally not zero.\n\nSo, both net force and net torque are not zero.\n\nBut the problem gives option D: neither the net force nor the net torque is zero.\n\nHowever, I feel like there might be something missing here.\n\nPerhaps the hinge exerts additional forces to balance the net force and torque, maintaining equilibrium.\n\nIf that's the case, then considering only the four applied forces, the net force and net torque are not zero, but including the hinge reactions, they would be zero.\n\nBut the problem seems to be considering only the four applied forces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hinge doesn't affect the net force and torque calculations in this context.\n\nI'm a bit unsure here.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose the door is in equilibrium, meaning both net force and net torque are zero.\n\nIn that case, the sum of all forces and the sum of all torques about any point must be zero.\n\nGiven that, the four applied forces plus any hinge reaction forces must result in zero net force and zero net torque.\n\nSo, if I consider only the four applied forces, their net force is 2F upwards, and net torque is (0,0,[L - (3W/2)]F), which is generally not zero.\n\nTherefore, to achieve equilibrium, the hinge must exert a downward force of 2F to balance the net upward force, and a torque equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the net torque from the four forces.\n\nTherefore, considering only the four applied forces, the net force is not zero, and the net torque is not zero.\n\nHence, option D: neither the net force nor the net torque is zero.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hinge exerts forces that exactly balance the net force and torque from the four applied forces, resulting in zero net force and zero net torque.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the correct answer is A: both net force and net torque are zero.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because earlier calculations show that net force is 2F upwards and net torque is generally not zero.\n\nUnless the hinge reaction forces and torques are being considered implicitly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to include the hinge reaction forces in the calculation.\n\nLet's denote the hinge reaction force as F_hinge, which can have components in x, y, and possibly z directions.\n\nFor equilibrium:\n\n\u03a3F_x = F3 + F2 + F_hinge,x = 0\n\n\u03a3F_y = F1 + F4 + F_hinge,y = 0\n\n\u03a3F_z = F_hinge,z = 0 (assuming no forces in z-direction)\n\nFrom \u03a3F_x = 0:\n\nF3 + F2 + F_hinge,x = 0\n\nSince F3 = F and F2 = -F, then F_hinge,x = 0\n\nFrom \u03a3F_y = 0:\n\nF1 + F4 + F_hinge,y = 0\n\nSince F1 = F and F4 = F, then F_hinge,y = -2F\n\nFrom \u03a3F_z = 0:\n\nF_hinge,z = 0\n\nSo, the hinge exerts only a downward force of 2F in the y-direction.\n\nNow, for the net torque about the hinge, since the hinge is at the origin, the torque due to F_hinge is zero.\n\nTherefore, the net torque is just the sum of the torques due to F1, F2, F3, and F4, which I calculated earlier as (0,0,[L - (3W/2)]F)\n\nThis suggests that even with the hinge reaction force, there is a net torque unless L = (3W/2)\n\nTherefore, the door would rotate unless something else prevents it.\n\nBut the problem states that the door is free to rotate about a vertical axis through its left edge, so perhaps the hinge can exert a torque to prevent rotation.\n\nIn that case, maybe the hinge exerts a torque equal and opposite to the net torque from the four forces, resulting in zero net torque.\n\nIf that's the case, then the net torque considering only the four applied forces is not zero, but including the hinge reaction torque, it becomes zero.\n\nTherefore, considering only the four applied forces, the net torque is not zero.\n\nHence, the correct answer would be D: neither the net force nor the net torque is zero.\n\nBut I feel like there's something I'm missing here.\n\nMaybe I should look at the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider the general conditions for equilibrium:\n\n1. The sum of all forces is zero.\n\n2. The sum of all torques about any point is zero.\n\nGiven that, if I have four forces applied to the door, and the hinge can exert forces and torques to maintain equilibrium, then the net force and net torque considering only the four applied forces would not be zero, and the hinge reactions would balance them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: neither the net force nor the net torque is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the hinge reactions balance the net force and torque, so effectively, the net force and net torque are zero.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be A: both net force and net torque are zero.\n\nBut that seems contradictory to my earlier calculations.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nPerhaps the hinge can exert both translational and rotational constraints.\n\nGiven that, the hinge can provide forces in the x and y directions, as well as a torque about the vertical axis.\n\nTherefore, the hinge can supply the necessary forces and torques to balance the net force and torque from the four applied forces.\n\nIn that scenario, the net force and net torque would be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: both net force and net torque are zero.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider that the hinge can indeed provide the necessary reactions.\n\nGiven that, the sum of all forces and torques would be zero, meaning that the net force and net torque are zero when considering all external forces and torques acting on the door.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: both net force and net torque are zero.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
