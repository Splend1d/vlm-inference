                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I have this circuit diagram here, and I need to find the expressions for i1(t) and i2(t) for t \u2265 0. The circuit includes a voltage source v(t) = u(t), which I believe is the unit step function, so it turns on at t=0. There are two switches that close at t=0, connecting the source to the circuit. The circuit consists of resistors, inductors, and a capacitor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit configuration. There's a 4\u03a9 resistor in series with a 1H inductor on the left side, and another 1H inductor in parallel with a 4\u03a9 resistor on the right side. There's also a 0.5F capacitor in the middle, connected between the two inductor branches.\n\nSince the switches close at t=0, the initial conditions might be important. I need to determine the initial currents and voltages before the switches close and then find the differential equations that govern the circuit behavior for t \u2265 0.\n\nLet me try to analyze the circuit step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine initial conditions**\n\nBefore t=0, the switches are open, so no current is flowing through the circuit. Therefore, at t=0-, the currents through the inductors and the voltage across the capacitor are zero.\n\n- i1(0-) = 0 A\n\n- i2(0-) = 0 A\n\n- vC(0-) = 0 V\n\nSince the capacitor acts like an open circuit for DC, and inductors act like short circuits for DC, at steady state before t=0, the circuit is essentially open, and no current flows.\n\n**Step 2: At t=0, switches close**\n\nWhen the switches close, the voltage source is connected to the circuit. The voltage source is v(t) = u(t), which is 1 V starting at t=0.\n\nNow, I need to find the expressions for i1(t) and i2(t) for t \u2265 0.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Kirchhoff's laws**\n\nLet's apply Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws to the circuit.\n\nFirst, consider the loop containing the voltage source, the 4\u03a9 resistor, and the 1H inductor.\n\nThe voltage around this loop is:\n\nv(t) = 4*i1 + L*di1/dt\n\nWhere L = 1 H.\n\nSimilarly, for the loop containing the 1H inductor, the capacitor, and the 4\u03a9 resistor:\n\n0 = L*di2/dt + (1/C)*\u222bi2 dt + 4*i2\n\nWhere C = 0.5 F.\n\nBut since the capacitor voltage is vC, and i2 is the current through the capacitor, we have:\n\ni2 = C*dvC/dt\n\nAnd the voltage across the inductor is:\n\nvL = L*di2/dt\n\nAlso, the voltage across the capacitor is vC, and the voltage across the 4\u03a9 resistor is 4*i2.\n\nSo, the equation for this loop is:\n\nvL + vC + 4*i2 = 0\n\nSubstituting vL and vC in terms of i2:\n\nL*(d\u00b2i2/dt\u00b2) + (1/C)*\u222bi2 dt + 4*i2 = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the capacitor is in parallel with the right-side inductor, and there's another inductor on the left, perhaps I can use nodal analysis or mesh analysis.\n\nLet me try mesh analysis.\n\nDefine two mesh currents: i1 through the left mesh and i2 through the right mesh.\n\nThe left mesh includes the voltage source, 4\u03a9 resistor, and 1H inductor.\n\nThe right mesh includes the 1H inductor, 4\u03a9 resistor, and the capacitor.\n\nThere is also a connection between the two meshes through the capacitor.\n\nWait, actually, the capacitor is between the two meshes, so it will appear in both meshes.\n\nThis might get tricky. Maybe I should use nodal analysis instead.\n\nLet's try nodal analysis.\n\nIdentify the nodes:\n\n- Node 1: Between the 4\u03a9 resistor and the 1H inductor\n\n- Node 2: Between the two inductors and the capacitor\n\n- Node 3: Between the capacitor and the 4\u03a9 resistor\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to consider the entire loop and write the loop equations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the left loop:\n\nv(t) = 4*i1 + L*di1/dt\n\nFor the right loop:\n\n0 = L*di2/dt + (1/C)*\u222bi2 dt + 4*i2\n\nBut these are two separate loops, and they are connected through the capacitor.\n\nI need to relate i1 and i2.\n\nLooking at the capacitor, the current through the capacitor is i2, and the voltage across the capacitor is vC.\n\nThe current through the capacitor is:\n\ni2 = C*dvC/dt\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is also related to the voltage drops in the circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the loop equations considering the shared components.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the circuit as a whole and try to reduce it or find equivalent components.\n\nLooking at the circuit, the two inductors are in parallel, and the capacitor is in series with the right-side inductor and resistor.\n\nWait, no, the capacitor is connected between the two inductors.\n\nThis seems like a multi-loop circuit with coupled elements due to the capacitor.\n\nPerhaps I can write the differential equations for the circuit using state variables.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nDefine the state variables as:\n\nx1 = i1\n\nx2 = i2\n\nx3 = vC\n\nThen, I can write the state equations.\n\nFirst, for x1:\n\nThe voltage across the left inductor is L*dx1/dt\n\nThe voltage across the 4\u03a9 resistor is 4*x1\n\nThe voltage source is v(t) = u(t) = 1 V for t \u2265 0\n\nSo, the voltage across the capacitor plus the voltage across the right inductor and resistor must equal the voltage across the left inductor and resistor.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to write KVL around the loop.\n\nLet me try writing KVL for the loop that includes the voltage source, the 4\u03a9 resistor, the left inductor, the capacitor, and the right inductor and resistor.\n\nThis seems too complex. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Laplace transforms to solve this circuit.\n\nLaplace transforms can simplify the differential equations into algebraic equations.\n\nFirst, I need to find the Laplace transforms of i1(t) and i2(t), assuming zero initial conditions since i1(0-) = 0, i2(0-) = 0, and vC(0-) = 0.\n\nThe Laplace transform of v(t) = u(t) is 1/s.\n\nThe Laplace transform of i1(t) is I1(s)\n\nThe Laplace transform of i2(t) is I2(s)\n\nThe Laplace transform of vC(t) is Vc(s)\n\nFor the left loop:\n\nv(t) = 4*i1 + L*di1/dt\n\nTaking Laplace transforms:\n\n1/s = 4*I1(s) + 1*I1(s)\n\nSo, 1/s = 5*I1(s)\n\nTherefore, I1(s) = 1/(5s)\n\nFor the right loop:\n\n0 = L*di2/dt + (1/C)*\u222bi2 dt + 4*i2\n\nTaking Laplace transforms:\n\n0 = 1*I2(s) + (1/(0.5))*[1/s * I2(s)] + 4*I2(s)\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = I2(s) + (2/s) I2(s) + 4*I2(s)\n\nCombine terms:\n\n0 = I2(s) (1 + 2/s + 4)\n\nThis implies I2(s) = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe left loop has the voltage source, 4\u03a9 resistor, and 1H inductor.\n\nThe voltage across the left inductor is L*di1/dt = 1*di1/dt\n\nThe voltage across the 4\u03a9 resistor is 4*i1\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is vC\n\nThe right loop has the 1H inductor, 4\u03a9 resistor, and the capacitor.\n\nThe voltage across the right inductor is L*di2/dt = 1*di2/dt\n\nThe voltage across the 4\u03a9 resistor is 4*i2\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is vC\n\nBut since the capacitor is connected between the two loops, its voltage is the same for both loops.\n\nSo, for the left loop:\n\nv(t) = 4*i1 + L*di1/dt + vC\n\nFor the right loop:\n\n0 = L*di2/dt + 4*i2 + vC\n\nNow, since both loops share vC, I can set up the equations accordingly.\n\nFrom the left loop:\n\n1 = 4*i1 + di1/dt + vC\n\nFrom the right loop:\n\n0 = di2/dt + 4*i2 + vC\n\nNow, I have two equations with three variables: i1, i2, and vC.\n\nI need another equation to relate vC to i1 and i2.\n\nRecall that the current through the capacitor is i2, and i2 = C*dvC/dt\n\nSo, dvC/dt = i2 / C = 2*i2 (since C = 0.5 F)\n\nNow, I can substitute dvC/dt into the equations.\n\nFrom the left loop:\n\n1 = 4*i1 + di1/dt + vC\n\nFrom the right loop:\n\n0 = di2/dt + 4*i2 + vC\n\nAnd from the capacitor:\n\ndvC/dt = 2*i2\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1) 4*i1 + di1/dt + vC = 1\n\n2) di2/dt + 4*i2 + vC = 0\n\n3) dvC/dt = 2*i2\n\nThis is a system of differential equations.\n\nI can try to solve this system using Laplace transforms.\n\nTaking Laplace transforms of all equations, assuming zero initial conditions:\n\n1) 4*I1(s) + s*I1(s) + Vc(s) = 1/s\n\n2) s*I2(s) + 4*I2(s) + Vc(s) = 0\n\n3) s*Vc(s) = 2*I2(s)\n\nNow, I have:\n\nEquation 1: (s + 4)*I1(s) + Vc(s) = 1/s\n\nEquation 2: (s + 4)*I2(s) + Vc(s) = 0\n\nEquation 3: s*Vc(s) = 2*I2(s)\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\nVc(s) = (2*I2(s))/s\n\nSubstitute Vc(s) into equations 1 and 2:\n\nEquation 1: (s + 4)*I1(s) + (2*I2(s))/s = 1/s\n\nEquation 2: (s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s = 0\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables, I1(s) and I2(s).\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for I2(s):\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s = 0\n\nFactor I2(s):\n\nI2(s)*[(s + 4) + (2/s)] = 0\n\nSo, I2(s)*[(s^2 + 4s + 2)/s] = 0\n\nTherefore, I2(s) = 0 or (s^2 + 4s + 2)/s = 0\n\nBut (s^2 + 4s + 2)/s = 0 implies s^2 + 4s + 2 = 0, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should solve equation 2 for I2(s):\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s = 0\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nI2(s)*[(s + 4) + (2/s)] = 0\n\nI2(s)*[(s^2 + 4s + 2)/s] = 0\n\nSo, I2(s) = 0, which doesn't make sense because current should flow through the circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the setup.\n\nLet me go back and check the original circuit diagram.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, I see that the capacitor is connected between the two inductor branches.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the currents through each component more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using nodal analysis would be better.\n\nLet me try nodal analysis.\n\nDefine nodes:\n\n- Node A: The junction between the 4\u03a9 resistor and the left inductor\n\n- Node B: The junction between the two inductors and the capacitor\n\n- Node C: The junction between the capacitor and the 4\u03a9 resistor\n\nAssuming the bottom node is ground.\n\nThen, the voltage at node A is vA, at node B is vB, and at node C is vC.\n\nThe voltage source is connected between node A and ground.\n\nThe left inductor is between node A and node B.\n\nThe right inductor is between node B and node C.\n\nThe capacitor is between node B and node C.\n\nThe 4\u03a9 resistor is between node C and ground.\n\nNow, write KCL at each node.\n\nAt node A:\n\n(i1 entering, assuming current through 4\u03a9 resistor is i1)\n\ni1 = (v(t) - vA)/4\n\nAt node B:\n\ni1 - i2 = C*d(vB - vC)/dt\n\nWhere i2 is the current through the right inductor.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider using superposition or some other circuit analysis technique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the circuit using state variables and solve the differential equations.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nDefine state variables:\n\nx1 = i1\n\nx2 = i2\n\nx3 = vC\n\nThen, the state equations can be written as:\n\ndx1/dt = (-R/L)*x1 + (1/L)*v(t)\n\ndx2/dt = (-R/L)*x2 - (1/LC)*x3\n\ndx3/dt = x2 - (1/C)*x3\n\nBut I need to relate these equations to each other.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I need to set up the state-space representation properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Laplace transforms more effectively.\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\nEquation 1: (s + 4)*I1(s) + Vc(s)/s = 1/s\n\nEquation 2: (s + 4)*I2(s) + Vc(s)/s = 0\n\nEquation 3: s*Vc(s) = 2*I2(s)\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\nVc(s) = (2*I2(s))/s\n\nSubstitute Vc(s) into equations 1 and 2:\n\nEquation 1: (s + 4)*I1(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 1/s\n\nEquation 2: (s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nWait, in equation 1, Vc(s)/s = (2*I2(s))/s^2\n\nSimilarly in equation 2.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\n(s + 4)*I1(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 1/s\n\nEquation 2:\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nNow, I can solve equation 2 for I2(s):\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nFactor I2(s):\n\nI2(s)*[(s + 4) + (2/s^2)] = 0\n\nSo, I2(s)*[(s^3 + 4s^2 + 2)/s^2] = 0\n\nTherefore, I2(s) = 0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the setup.\n\nLet me check the Laplace transform of the right loop equation.\n\nThe right loop equation is:\n\ndi2/dt + 4*i2 + vC = 0\n\nTaking Laplace transforms:\n\ns*I2(s) - i2(0-) + 4*I2(s) + Vc(s)/s = 0\n\nAssuming i2(0-) = 0:\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + Vc(s)/s = 0\n\nSimilarly, from the left loop:\n\n4*I1(s) + s*I1(s) + Vc(s)/s = 1/s\n\nAnd from the capacitor:\n\nVc(s) = (2*I2(s))/s\n\nSubstituting Vc(s) into the left loop equation:\n\n4*I1(s) + s*I1(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 1/s\n\nAnd into the right loop equation:\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nNow, I have:\n\nEquation 1: (s + 4)*I1(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 1/s\n\nEquation 2: (s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for I2(s):\n\n(s + 4)*I2(s) + (2*I2(s))/s^2 = 0\n\nFactor I2(s):\n\nI2(s)*[(s + 4) + (2/s^2)] = 0\n\nSo, I2(s)*[(s^3 + 4s^2 + 2)/s^2] = 0\n\nTherefore, I2(s) = 0, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term (2/s^2) is incorrect.\n\nWait, the Laplace transform of vC is Vc(s)/s, assuming zero initial conditions.\n\nBut vC is also equal to (2*I2(s))/s, from dvC/dt = 2*i2.\n\nWait, dvC/dt = 2*i2, so vC = \u222b2*i2 dt = 2*\u222bi2 dt\n\nTherefore, Vc(s) = 2*I2(s)/s\n\nSo, Vc(s)/s = 2*I2(s)/s^2\n\nTherefore, in equation 1:\n\n4*I1(s)"
