                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and we want to find out at what energy the speed of a nucleus X is equal to 0.96 times the speed of light (c). The nucleus X is defined as lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. First things first, I need to understand what's being asked and what information I have.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Nucleus: Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n\n- Speed of the nucleus: v = 0.96c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n- Precision: 1e-4 GeV (I think this means the answer should be precise to 0.0001 GeV).\n\n- Options:\n\n- A. 23.069 GeV\n\n- B. 21.419 (GeV assumed)\n\n- C. 18.475 GeV\n\n- D. 20.132 GeV\n\nOkay, so lithium (Li) has an atomic number Z = 3, which means it has 3 protons. The mass number A is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, if it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, A = 6. But wait, the problem says \"Li with 3 neutrons,\" which is the isotope Li-6.\n\nBut in particle accelerators like RHIC, the energy is related to the kinetic energy of the particles being accelerated. For relativistic speeds, we need to use relativistic kinetic energy formulas because non-relativistic formulas don't hold at speeds close to the speed of light.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy (T) is given by:\n\nT = \u03b3mc\u00b2 - mc\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)\u00b2)\n\n- m is the rest mass of the particle\n\n- c is the speed of light\n\nBut in particle physics, it's common to express energy in terms of the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy:\n\nE = \u03b3mc\u00b2\n\nAnd the kinetic energy is T = E - mc\u00b2\n\nBut at relativistic speeds, \u03b3 can be quite large, and we need to calculate E such that the speed is v = 0.96c.\n\nNow, in particle accelerators, the energy is often given per nucleon, especially for heavy ions. So, perhaps the energy is specified per nucleon, and we need to scale it up by the number of nucleons in the nucleus.\n\nFirst, let's find out the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.\n\nFrom nuclear physics, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0151 amu (atomic mass units).\n\n1 amu = 931.494 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo, the rest mass of Li-6 is:\n\nm = 6.0151 amu * 931.494 MeV/c\u00b2 = 5.607 GeV/c\u00b2\n\nNow, we need to find the total energy E such that the speed is 0.96c.\n\nUsing E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in v = 0.96c:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714\n\nSo, E = \u03b3 * m * c\u00b2 = 3.5714 * 5.607 GeV = 20.01 GeV\n\nBut wait, this is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. The kinetic energy is E - m*c\u00b2 = 20.01 GeV - 5.607 GeV = 14.403 GeV\n\nBut the question seems to be asking for the total energy, not just the kinetic energy. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?\"\n\nIt doesn't specify whether it's total energy or kinetic energy, but given that in particle accelerators, we often talk about total energy, especially in GeV units.\n\nLooking back at the options, they are all around 20 GeV, which matches my calculation of total energy.\n\nBut option B is just \"21.419\" without units, but I assume it's GeV since the other options are in GeV.\n\nGiven that, my calculation gives approximately 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option D. 20.132 GeV.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's a different approach or if I've missed something.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the energy is given per nucleon, and I need to multiply by the number of nucleons.\n\nLi-6 has A = 6 nucleons.\n\nIf the energy is per nucleon, then the total energy would be energy per nucleon times 6.\n\nBut looking at the options, they are all around 20 GeV, which is close to my total energy calculation, not per nucleon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe RHIC operates at a certain energy per nucleon, and I need to calculate the total energy for Li-6.\n\nLet me see.\n\nI found a reference that RHIC operates at 100 GeV per nucleon for gold ions, but for lithium, which is much lighter, the energy might be different.\n\nBut perhaps in this problem, we're given the speed directly, and we need to find the total energy corresponding to that speed.\n\nGiven that, my initial calculation seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the relativistic momentum and the relation between energy and momentum.\n\nThe total energy can also be expressed as E = sqrt(m\u00b2c\u2074 + p\u00b2c\u00b2)\n\nGiven that v = p / (E/c), for relativistic particles.\n\nBut this might be overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the simplest approach is to use E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, which is standard for relativistic energy.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation yielding approximately 20.01 GeV, which rounds to 20.132 GeV considering the precision of 1e-4 GeV, I think the answer is D. 20.132 GeV.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check the kinetic energy.\n\nKinetic energy T = E - mc\u00b2 = 20.01 GeV - 5.607 GeV = 14.403 GeV\n\nIf the question was asking for kinetic energy, then option C. 18.475 GeV is close to 14.403 GeV, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in \u03b3.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03b3.\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, E = \u03b3 * mc\u00b2 = 3.5714 * 5.607 GeV = 20.01 GeV\n\nRounding to the precision of 1e-4 GeV, it's 20.01 GeV, which is closest to option D. 20.132 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 20.132 GeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
