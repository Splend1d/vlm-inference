                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the expectation value of the y-component of spin for an electron in a given spin state. The state is (3i, 4), and I need to find <S_y>. I remember that the spin operators for electrons can be represented using Pauli matrices, and sigma_y is one of them. The problem even provides the matrix for sigma_y:\n\n\u03c3_y = [0, -i; i, 0]\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the expectation value of an operator is. In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator O in a state |\u03c8> is given by <\u03c8| O |\u03c8>. So, in this case, O is S_y, which is related to \u03c3_y.\n\nWait, but I think there's a relationship between S_y and \u03c3_y. I believe that S_y is actually (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y for an electron, since \u03c3_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, and the spin angular momentum is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli matrix.\n\nLet me confirm that. Yes, for an electron with spin 1/2, the y-component of the spin operator is S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nSo, to find <S_y>, I need to calculate <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = <\u03c8| (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>.\n\nGiven that the state is (3i, 4), I need to represent this state as a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8> = [3i; 4]\n\nNow, <\u03c8| is the Hermitian conjugate of |\u03c8>, which is [ -3i, 4 ]\n\nBecause the conjugate of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4.\n\nNow, I need to compute <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i, 4 ] * \u03c3_y * [3i; 4]\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03c3_y * [3i; 4]:\n\n\u03c3_y = [0, -i; i, 0]\n\nSo, \u03c3_y * [3i; 4] = [0*(3i) + (-i)*4 ; i*(3i) + 0*4] = [-i*4 ; i*3i] = [-4i ; 3i^2]\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes [-4i ; -3]\n\nNow, multiply <\u03c8| by this result:\n\n[ -3i, 4 ] * [-4i; -3] = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12*(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n\nSo, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = -24\n\nTherefore, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (-24) = -12\u0127\n\nBut looking at the options, they have hbar (\u0127) in the numerator, so -12\u0127 is the same as -12*hbar.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 12*hbar/25\n\nB. 25*hbar/2\n\nC. -25*hbar/2\n\nD. -12*hbar/25\n\nHmm, my calculation gives -12\u0127, but that's not matching any of the options directly. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nFirst, the state |\u03c8> = [3i; 4]\n\n<\u03c8| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n\n\u03c3_y = [0, -i; i, 0]\n\n\u03c3_y * [3i; 4] = [-i*4 ; i*3i] = [-4i ; -3]\n\nThen, [ -3i, 4 ] * [-4i; -3] = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12*(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = -24\n\nThen, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (-24) = -12\u0127\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Maybe there's a mistake in the relationship between S_y and \u03c3_y.\n\nWait, I think S_y is actually (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y for spin 1/2 particles like electrons.\n\nLet me confirm that.\n\nYes, the spin operators for an electron are S_x = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, and S_z = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z.\n\nSo, my calculation should be correct: <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) * (-24) = -12\u0127\n\nBut the options seem to have different denominators. Maybe I need to express it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the state is not normalized. Maybe I need to normalize it first.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8> = [3i; 4]\n\nThe norm is ||\u03c8|| = sqrt( |3i|^2 + |4|^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5\n\nSo, the normalized state is |\u03c8_norm> = (1/5) [3i; 4]\n\nThen, <\u03c8_norm| = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]\n\nNow, <\u03c8_norm| \u03c3_y |\u03c8_norm> = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * \u03c3_y * [3i/5; 4/5]\n\nFirst, \u03c3_y * [3i/5; 4/5] = [0, -i; i, 0] * [3i/5; 4/5] = [-i*(4/5); i*(3i/5)] = [-4i/5 ; 3i^2/5] = [-4i/5 ; -3/5]\n\nThen, [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [-4i/5; -3/5] = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i^2)/(25) - 12/25 = (12*(-1))/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nSo, <\u03c8_norm| \u03c3_y |\u03c8_norm> = -24/25\n\nTherefore, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nSo, the expectation value of S_y is -12\u0127/25\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12*hbar/25\n\nB. 25*hbar/2\n\nC. -25*hbar/2\n\nD. -12*hbar/25\n\nYes, option D is -12*hbar/25, which matches my calculation.\n\nI must have forgotten that the state needs to be normalized. Without normalization, I got the wrong result.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. -12*hbar/25\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. -12 \\hbar /25} \\]"
