                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water. Bromine water decolorization typically indicates the presence of compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds, like alkenes, because bromine adds across the double bond.\n\nSo, mixture X contains two different alkenes, present in equal moles.\n\nWhen this mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. These new liquids don't decolorize bromine water, meaning they don't have any double bonds.\n\nHydrogenation of both mixture X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, a hydrocarbon Z, which is also a component of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and it doesn't react further with hydrogen, indicating it's saturated.\n\nAlso, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X, which is good to know because conjugated systems can sometimes behave differently.\n\nLet's start by figuring out what Z is. Since Z is a hydrocarbon and its mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, we can determine its molecular formula.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the molecular formula of Z as \\(\\mathrm{C}_{n} \\mathrm{H}_{2n+2}\\), since it's saturated (no double bonds).\n\nThe mass of hydrogen in Z is \\(2n+2\\) grams per mole, and the total mass is \\(14n + 2n+2 = 16n + 2\\) grams per mole.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is \\(\\frac{2n+2}{16n+2}\\), which is given as 0.1428 (14.28%).\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n+2}{16n+2} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nSolve for n:\n\n\\[\n2n + 2 = 0.1428 \\times (16n + 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2n + 2 = 2.2848n + 0.2856\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 - 0.2856 = 2.2848n - 2n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.7144 = 0.2848n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1.7144}{0.2848} \\approx 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Z is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\), which is hexane.\n\nNow, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids formed by disproportionation of X, and one of them is Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)), which is saturated.\n\nDisproportionation typically involves oxidizing and reducing components of a mixture. In this context, starting from alkenes (X), treating with platinum and heat might involve some kind of hydrogenation or isomerization, but disproportionation suggests something else.\n\nPerhaps, the alkenes are being transformed into more saturated and less saturated compounds, but since Z is fully saturated, maybe one component is fully hydrogenated, and the other is something else.\n\nBut the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, and Y already contains Z, so maybe Y is a mixture of Z and another compound that can be further hydrogenated to Z.\n\nWait, the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, and Y already contains Z, so the other component of Y must be something that hydrogenates to Z.\n\nBut Z is already fully saturated, so the other component must be something that, upon hydrogenation, turns into Z.\n\nGiven that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z, and the other is something that hydrogenates to Z, perhaps it's a monoene that can be hydrogenated to Z.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the disproportionation from X (two different alkenes) to Y (Z and another alkene) is interesting.\n\nWait, but the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, and Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is Z. So, the other liquid must be something that hydrogenates to Z.\n\nSince Z is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\), and it's formed from X, which is two different alkenes, both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, since hydrogenation of X gives Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)).\n\nWait, let's confirm the molecular formulas.\n\nX is a mixture of two alkenes, both presumably \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), since hydrogenation adds two hydrogens to give \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, X is an equimolar mixture of two different \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, say A and B, both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\).\n\nWhen treated with platinum and heat, they undergo disproportionation to form Y, which is an equimolar mixture of Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)) and another compound, say C, which is also \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), since hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n\nWait, but Y is an equimolar mixture of Z and C, and C must be \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), because hydrogenation of C gives Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)).\n\nSo, C is another \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene.\n\nBut X already contains two different \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, A and B, and Y contains Z and C, where C is another \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene.\n\nSo, the disproportionation seems to be converting A and B into Z and C.\n\nBut wait, if A and B are both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), and they disproportionate to Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)) and C (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\)), that suggests that some hydrogen is being transferred from A to B, or something similar.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\n\nMaybe some of the alkenes are being hydrogenated to Z, and others are being dehydrogenated to a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene with more double bonds, but that would require addition of hydrogen for one and removal for the other, which seems energetically unfavorable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation where some alkenes are fully hydrogenated to Z, and others remain as alkenes.\n\nBut the problem mentions disproportionation, which suggests a redox process where one component is reduced and the other is oxidized.\n\nIn this case, perhaps one alkene is hydrogenated to Z, and the other is dehydrogenated to a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkane with less hydrogen, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rearrangement or isomerization catalyzed by platinum.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSince X is an equimolar mixture of two \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, A and B, both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), and Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)) and C (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\)), it seems that some hydrogen is being transferred from A to B to form Z and C.\n\nBut that still doesn't make much sense.\n\nPerhaps the disproportionation involves a hydrogen shift or some other mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two alkenes in X are such that upon treatment with platinum and heat, they can form Z and C via some catalytic cycle.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet me consider the properties of the compounds.\n\nZ is hexane (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)), a saturated alkane.\n\nC is a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\)) that doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning it doesn't have any double bonds conjugated or isolated double bonds that can react with bromine.\n\nWait, but \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) is an alkene, so it should have a double bond.\n\nUnless it's a cycloalkane, but cyclohexane is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), which doesn't decolorize bromine water because the double bond is part of a ring and doesn't react with bromine.\n\nBut the problem states that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, but C is a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene, which should decolorize bromine water unless it's cyclic or has some special structure.\n\nWait, perhaps C is a cyclic alkene that doesn't react with bromine water.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a dialkene, but that would be \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{10}\\), not \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\).\n\nWait, no, \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) is a monoalkene.\n\nSo, C must be a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene that doesn't decolorize bromine water, perhaps because it's part of a ring or has some steric hindrance.\n\nBut cyclohexene should react with bromine water, so maybe it's cyclohexane, but that's \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), which is saturated.\n\nWait, cyclohexane is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), but it doesn't have a double bond; it's saturated.\n\nBut earlier, I thought C is an alkene, but if it doesn't decolorize bromine water, maybe it's a cycloalkane without a double bond.\n\nBut then, \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) is actually cyclohexane, which is saturated.\n\nWait, no, cyclohexane is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), but it doesn't have a double bond; it's saturated.\n\nBut according to the problem, Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)) and C (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\)), and C doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning it doesn't have a double bond that can react with bromine.\n\nBut \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) is cyclohexane, which is saturated.\n\nWait, but cyclohexane is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), which is saturated, so it doesn't have a double bond.\n\nBut earlier, I thought C is an alkene, but if it's \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) and doesn't decolorize bromine water, it must be cyclohexane, which is saturated.\n\nBut then, why is it called an alkene? Maybe it's a misassumption.\n\nPerhaps C is a different compound, not necessarily an alkene.\n\nWait, the problem says that Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water.\n\nGiven that Z is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\), and C is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), which is cyclohexane, which doesn't decolorize bromine water because it's saturated.\n\nBut then, why is C called an alkene? Maybe it's not an alkene; maybe it's just another saturated compound.\n\nBut earlier, I thought C is an alkene, but if it doesn't decolorize bromine water, it can't be an alkene.\n\nSo, perhaps C is cyclohexane, which is saturated and doesn't decolorize bromine water.\n\nBut then, why is it formed from the disproportionation of two alkenes?\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that X is an equimolar mixture of two different \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, say hex-1-ene and hex-2-ene, both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\).\n\nUpon treatment with platinum and heat, they undergo some reaction to form Y, which is an equimolar mixture of Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\), hexane) and C (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), cyclohexane).\n\nBut why would alkenes form cyclohexane upon platinum-catalyzed reaction?\n\nPerhaps it's a catalytic hydrogenation where some alkenes are fully hydrogenated to hexane, and others undergo cyclization to form cyclohexane.\n\nBut that seems unlikely under those conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a catalytic dehydrogenation or some other reaction.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at the options provided.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 18\n\nD. 16\n\nGiven that X is a mixture of two \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, each with the formula \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), meaning each molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, for two molecules, total hydrogen atoms would be 24.\n\nBut that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids, considering their molar amounts.\n\nSince it's an equimolar mixture, if each molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms, then per mole of mixture, there are 12 hydrogen atoms per mole of each component, so total per mole of mixture would be 24 hydrogen atoms.\n\nBut again, that's not among the options.\n\nMaybe I miscounted the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\nWait, \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) has 6 carbon atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms per molecule.\n\nSo, for two molecules, it's 24 hydrogen atoms.\n\nBut the options are 22, 12, 18, 16.\n\nNone of these match 24.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in my assumption about the molecular formulas.\n\nWait, maybe the alkenes in X are not both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), but one is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) and the other is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{H}_{10}\\), or something else.\n\nBut the problem says that hydrogenation of X gives Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)), so both components must be \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes.\n\nWait, no.\n\nIf X is a mixture of two alkenes, and hydrogenation gives Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)), that means both alkenes are \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), because hydrogenation adds two hydrogens to each alkene to give \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\).\n\nSo, yes, both are \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, total hydrogen atoms in two molecules of \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\) are 24.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nPerhaps the mixture X contains one alkene and one diene.\n\nBut if that's the case, then hydrogenation would add different numbers of hydrogens, but the problem states that hydrogenation of X gives only Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)).\n\nSo, both components must be \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkenes, each hydrogenating to \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\).\n\nWait, maybe one of them is a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkene and the other is a \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\) alkane, but that wouldn't make sense because alkane doesn't decolorize bromine water, but the mixture X does decolorize bromine water.\n\nWait, the problem says that X decolorizes bromine water, meaning it contains compounds with double bonds.\n\nSo, both components must have double bonds, meaning both are alkenes.\n\nTherefore, both are \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), and total hydrogen atoms are 24.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are not both \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), but one is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{H}_{10}\\) and the other is \\(\\mathrm{C}_{7} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\), but that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of \\(\\mathrm{C}_{7} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\) would give \\(\\mathrm{C}_{7} \\mathrm{H}_{16}\\), not \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\).\n\nWait, perhaps there's a rearrangement during hydrogenation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alkenes in X are \\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{12}\\), but upon disproportionation, they form Z (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}\\)) and C (\\(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H"
