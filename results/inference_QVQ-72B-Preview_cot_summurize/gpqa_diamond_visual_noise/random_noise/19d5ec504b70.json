                    "text": "So I've got this compound with the formula C9H11NO2, and I need to identify it from the given IR and 1H NMR data. The options are ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, 3-ethoxybenzamide, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, and 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the IR spectrum is telling me. There are medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. I remember that IR spectroscopy helps identify functional groups based on the vibrations of bonds.\n\nStarting with the bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, these are likely due to stretching vibrations of N-H bonds in amines or amides. Specifically, the 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 could be the symmetric stretch and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 the asymmetric stretch of the N-H bonds.\n\nThe strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This could indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid, ester, amide, or ketone. Given that there's no indication of an O-H stretch typically associated with carboxylic acids, and considering the molecular formula includes an oxygen but not necessarily two, it's likely an ester or an amide.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely the methyl group of an ethyl ester or ether, showing a triplet pattern due to coupling with the adjacent methylene protons.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons suggests this could be an amide NH2 group, which often appears around this region and can be broad due to hydrogen bonding.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): This is probably the methylene group of the ethyl ester or ether, showing a quartet pattern due to coupling with the methyl protons.\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): This could be aromatic protons, possibly ortho to each other, given the doublet pattern.\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, possibly meta or para to the first set.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:\n\n- This has an ethyl ester group, which matches the 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals.\n\n- It has an amino group on the benzene ring, which could account for the broad signal at 4.0 ppm.\n\n- The aromatic protons would be two identical protons para to each other, which could account for the doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n\nB. 3-Ethoxybenzamide:\n\n- This has an ethoxy group, which would give signals for the methyl and methylene protons, similar to the ester in option A.\n\n- It has an amide group, which could account for the NH2 protons at 4.0 ppm.\n\n- The aromatic protons would be in a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which might not account for the simple doublet patterns observed.\n\nC. N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide:\n\n- This has an ethoxy group on the benzene ring and an amide group attached to the nitrogen.\n\n- Again, the ethoxy group gives the methyl and methylene protons, matching the 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm signals.\n\n- The amide NH could appear around 4.0 ppm, but it's often a singlet or doublet depending on the structure.\n\n- The aromatic protons would be in a 1,4-substitution pattern, which could account for the doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n\nD. 4-Aminophenyl propionate:\n\n- This has an amino group and a propionate ester group.\n\n- The ester methyl group would likely appear around 1.0 ppm, which doesn't match the 1.20 ppm signal.\n\n- The methylene protons next to the ester would appear around 2.0-2.5 ppm, which isn't present in the given spectrum.\n\n- The aromatic protons would be similar to option A, but the ester positioning might differ.\n\nGiven the molecular formula C9H11NO2, all options have this formula, so I need to look closer at the spectral data.\n\nLet's consider the IR data again. The presence of N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggests a secondary amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.\n\nIn option A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, there is an ester and an amino group. The amino group could give rise to N-H stretches, and the ester provides the carbonyl stretch.\n\nOption B, 3-ethoxybenzamide, has an amide group, which would have N-H stretches and a carbonyl stretch, but the ethoxy group is present instead of an ester.\n\nOption C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, also has an amide group and an ethoxy group, similar to option B.\n\nOption D, 4-aminophenyl propionate, has an amino group and a propionate ester group.\n\nLooking back at the NMR data, the methyl group is at 1.20 ppm, which is typical for an ethyl group. The methylene group is at 4.5 ppm, which is shifted downfield, possibly due to the proximity of the carbonyl group in an ester.\n\nIn option D, the propionate ester would have a methyl group around 1.0 ppm and methylenes around 2.0-2.5 ppm, which doesn't match the observed NMR data.\n\nOption A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, has an ester with the ethyl group's methyl at 1.20 ppm and methylenes at 4.5 ppm, which matches the NMR data.\n\nOption C, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, has an ethoxy group with methyl at 1.20 ppm and methylenes at 4.5 ppm, and an amide group, which could account for the broad signal at 4.0 ppm.\n\nHowever, in option C, the formamide would have a formyl hydrogen, which might show up in the NMR, but it's not accounted for in the given peaks.\n\nOption B, 3-ethoxybenzamide, also has an ethoxy group and an amide group, but the aromatic substitution pattern might not match the simple doublets observed.\n\nConsidering all this, option A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, seems to fit the NMR data best, with the ethyl group's methyl at 1.20 ppm, methylenes at 4.5 ppm, and the amino protons as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons are consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring, with one set of protons at 7.0 ppm and the other at 8.0 ppm.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the coupling constants. The doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm suggest a para relationship, with a coupling constant of around 8-9 Hz, which is typical for para-displaced aromatic protons.\n\nAdditionally, the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is likely the amino protons, which can be broad due to exchange with water or other factors.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
