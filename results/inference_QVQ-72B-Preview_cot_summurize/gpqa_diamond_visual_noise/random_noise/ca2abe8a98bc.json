                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. It's given that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum has specific signals: two for aromatic-H, two for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for -CH3 groups. There are no signals for -CH2 groups. The options for the chemical formula are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring means. A 6-membered aromatic ring is likely benzene, which has the formula C6H6. Di-substitution means that there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring.\n\nGiven that the FTIR shows an ester group, which is -COO-, I need to incorporate that into the structure. However, an ester group typically consists of a carbonyl group and an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nLooking at the NMR spectrum information:\n\n- Two signals for aromatic-H: this suggests there are two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring that are equivalent.\n\n- Two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl-H typically refers to hydrogen atoms on a carbon double bond, like in CH=CH2.\n\n- Two signals for -CH3 groups: these are methyl groups.\n\n- No signals for -CH2 groups: so there are no methylene groups in the structure.\n\nGiven this information, I need to construct a molecule that fits these descriptions and matches one of the provided formulas.\n\nLet me consider the benzene ring first. It's di-substituted, meaning two substituents are attached to it. One of them is likely the ester group. Let's assume one substituent is an ester group, and the other is another group that fits with the NMR data.\n\nGiven that there are vinyl-H and -CH3 groups, it seems like there's a vinyl group (CH=CH2) or something similar attached to the benzene ring.\n\nWait, but vinyl-H are present, which suggests a double bond is present somewhere in the molecule.\n\nLet me think about the ester group. It's -COO-, so it could be part of a larger group attached to the benzene ring.\n\nPerhaps one substituent is an ester group directly attached to the benzene ring, like -COO-, and the other substituent is a group that includes the vinyl and methyl groups.\n\nBut I need to see how that fits with the NMR data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a substituted vinyl group with methyl groups.\n\nI need to consider the degrees of unsaturation to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nFirst, calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DU) for each option:\n\nFor C11H12O2:\n\nDU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 + (2/2) = 11 - 6 + 1 + 1 = 7\n\nFor C11H14O2:\n\nDU = 11 - (14/2) + 1 + (2/2) = 11 - 7 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nFor C12H12O2:\n\nDU = 12 - (12/2) + 1 + (2/2) = 12 - 6 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\nFor C12H14O2:\n\nDU = 12 - (14/2) + 1 + (2/2) = 12 - 7 + 1 + 1 = 7\n\nBenzene has 4 rings and 2 double bonds, so DU = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nIf it's di-substituted, the substituents could add additional double bonds or rings.\n\nGiven that there's an ester group, which contributes one double bond equivalent (the carbonyl double bond), and possibly more if there are other double bonds in the substituents.\n\nSo, for example, for C11H12O2 with DU=7, if benzene contributes 6 DU, the substituents contribute 1 DU.\n\nSimilarly, C11H14O2 with DU=6, benzene contributes 6 DU, so substituents contribute 0 DU.\n\nC12H12O2 with DU=8, benzene contributes 6 DU, substituents contribute 2 DU.\n\nC12H14O2 with DU=7, benzene contributes 6 DU, substituents contribute 1 DU.\n\nBut since there are vinyl groups present, which have double bonds, the substituents must have at least one double bond.\n\nSo, C11H14O2 has substituents with no additional double bonds beyond what's already in benzene, which might not align with the presence of vinyl groups.\n\nLet me consider C11H12O2:\n\nTotal carbon: 11, hydrogen: 12, oxygen: 2.\n\nBenzene: C6H6.\n\nSo, substituents contribute 5 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nIf there are two substituents, let's see possible combinations.\n\nOne substituent could be an ester group, like -COO-, which is -COO-.\n\nThat's two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom.\n\nSo, the other substituent would be C4H7.\n\nGiven that there are vinyl-H and methyl groups, perhaps the other substituent is a substituted vinyl group.\n\nVinyl is CH2=CH-, which is C2H3.\n\nTo make C4H7 from that, I need to add C2H4, which is ethyl, but that's C2H5.\n\nWait, C2H3 (vinyl) + C2H4 would be C4H7, but C2H4 is ethylene, which is C2H4.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a vinyl group with a methyl substitution, like isopropenyl, which is CH2=C(CH3)-, that's C4H7.\n\nYes, that fits C4H7.\n\nSo, one substituent is -COO-, and the other is -CH2=C(CH3)-.\n\nWait, but -COO- needs to be connected to something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent.\n\nLet me consider methacrylate, which is CH2=C(CH3)-COO-, that's a common ester group in polymers.\n\nThat would be C4H6O2.\n\nSo, if I have benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is -CH2=C(CH3)-, but that would be C7H10O2, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the ester group spans both substituents or is part of a larger group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one substituent is -COO- and the other is -CH2=C(CH3)-, but that would be C7H8O2, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that one substituent includes both the ester group and the vinyl group.\n\nFor example, the methacrylate group I mentioned earlier: CH2=C(CH3)-COO-.\n\nThat's C4H6O2.\n\nIf I have benzene with one methacrylate group and one -H, that would be C6H5 - plus C4H6O2, which is C10H11O2, but that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both substituents are methacrylate groups: C6H4(C4H6O2)2, which would be C14H16O4, which is way beyond the options.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the ester group is part of a larger ring or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is formed between the benzene ring and another group.\n\nWait, maybe one substituent is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.\n\nBut I need to see how that fits the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a cyclic structure.\n\nLet me consider that the molecule has a six-membered ring, di-substituted, with an ester group present.\n\nGiven the NMR data, there are two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl groups.\n\nLet me try to sketch a possible structure.\n\nSuppose I have benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH2.\n\nBut that would be C6H4(CO2H)(CH=CH2), which is C8H6O2, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if one substituent is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH(CH3), that's C8H7O2.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the ester group is part of a five-membered or six-membered ring including the benzene ring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester group is formed between the benzene ring and another carbon chain.\n\nLet me consider that the ester group is part of a side chain attached to the benzene ring.\n\nFor example, benzene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3): C6H5COOCH3, which is C7H7O2, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, ethoxycarbonyl: C6H5COOCH2CH3, which is C8H9O2, still not matching.\n\nPerhaps larger alkyl chains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester group is part of a cyclic structure.\n\nWait, perhaps a lactone or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has a six-membered ring with two substituents that include the ester group.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a five-membered ring fused to the benzene ring.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nGiven that there are two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl groups, perhaps the molecule has symmetry, with two identical substituents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.\n\nBut I need to see how that fits the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent.\n\nLet me consider that the molecule is a substituted benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.\n\nFor example, benzene with -COO- and -CH=CH(CH3)-.\n\nThat would be C6H4(CO2H)(CH=CH(CH3)), which is C9H10O2, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a five-membered ring including the benzene ring.\n\nWait, maybe a coumarin derivative or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is a substituted benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch, and there's a ring closure.\n\nBut that seems too complicated.\n\nLet me consider that the molecule has a six-membered ring with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH(CH3)-.\n\nThat would be C6H4(CO2H)(CH=CH(CH3)), which is C9H10O2, still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a side chain that is attached to the benzene ring via a single bond.\n\nFor example, benzene with a side chain like -CH2-COO-.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent, like a carboxylic acid derivative.\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch, and there's an additional carbon atom somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in counting the hydrogens.\n\nLet me consider that the molecule has a six-membered ring with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH(CH3)-, but that's C9H10O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH(CH3)-, but that's already C9H10O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger ring structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule has a six-membered ring with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch, and there's an additional carbon atom in the ester group.\n\nFor example, if the ester group is -COOCH3, that's one carbon, or -COOCH2CH3, that's two carbons, etc.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to align with the NMR data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a cyclic structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule is a coumarin derivative, which is a benzopyrone, but that's a seven-membered ring fused to benzene, which doesn't fit the description of a six-membered ring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a chromene or something similar.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the degrees of unsaturation again.\n\nFor C11H12O2, DU=7.\n\nBenzene contributes 6 DU, so the substituents contribute 1 DU.\n\nFor C11H14O2, DU=6, benzene contributes 6 DU, so substituents contribute 0 DU.\n\nFor C12H12O2, DU=8, benzene contributes 6 DU, so substituents contribute 2 DU.\n\nFor C12H14O2, DU=7, benzene contributes 6 DU, so substituents contribute 1 DU.\n\nGiven that there are vinyl groups present, which are double bonds, the substituents must have at least one double bond.\n\nSo, C11H14O2 has substituents with no additional double bonds, which might not align with the presence of vinyl groups.\n\nSimilarly, C12H14O2 has substituents contributing 1 DU, which could accommodate one double bond, fitting the vinyl group.\n\nC11H12O2 has substituents contributing 1 DU, which could also accommodate one double bond.\n\nC12H12O2 has substituents contributing 2 DU, which could accommodate two double bonds.\n\nBut based on the NMR data, there are vinyl-H present, indicating at least one double bond.\n\nAdditionally, there are two methyl groups and two vinyl-H, suggesting the presence of a vinyl group with methyl substitution.\n\nLet me consider C12H12O2.\n\nTotal carbon: 12, hydrogen: 12, oxygen: 2.\n\nBenzene: C6H6.\n\nSubstituents contribute 6 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms, 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nIf one substituent is -COO-, that's one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\nSo, the other substituent would be C5H6.\n\nPossible substituent: -CH=CH-CH=CH-CH3, which is penta-1,3-dien-5-yl, but that's C5H8.\n\nWait, that doesn't match C5H6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a cyclopentenyl group, like -CH2=CH-C5H7, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent.\n\nWait, maybe the molecule is benzene with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is -CH=CH(CH3)-, which is C9H10O2, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a side chain that includes the vinyl and methyl groups.\n\nFor example, benzene with a side chain like -CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-COO-, but that would be C11H12O2, which is one of the options.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nBenzene: C6H4 (assuming two hydrogens are replaced by substituents).\n\nSide chain: -CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-COO-, which is C6H9O2.\n\nTotal: C6H4 + C6H9O2 = C12H13O2, which is close but not exactly matching any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side chain is -CH=CH(CH3)-COO-, which is C4H5O2.\n\nThen, benzene with two substituents: -COO- and -CH=CH(CH3)-, which is C9H10O2, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule is benzene with one substituent that includes both the ester group and the vinyl and methyl groups.\n\nFor example, benzene with a side chain like -CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-COO-, which is C6H9O2, and another -H, totaling C6H6 + C6H9O2 = C12H15O2, which is not matching.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try to think about the NMR data again.\n\nThere are two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons, and two methyl protons.\n\nAdditionally, there are no -CH2- groups, which suggests that any methylene groups are part of larger substituents or rings.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the molecule has a six-membered ring with two substituents: one is -COO- and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a larger ring structure that includes the benzene ring.\n\nWait, perhaps the molecule is a coumarin derivative, which is a benzopyrone, but that's a seven-membered ring fused to benzene, which doesn't fit the description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a chromene or something similar.\n\nThis is too speculative.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: C12H12O2\n\nOption B: C11H12O2\n\nOption C: C12H14O2\n\nOption D: C11H14O2\n\nGiven that there are vinyl-H and methyl groups present, and considering the degrees of unsaturation, perhaps C12H12O2 is the correct formula.\n\nLet me see:\n\nC12H12O2 has DU=8.\n\nBenzene contributes 6 DU, so substituents contribute 2 DU.\n\nThis could accommodate two double bonds in the substituents.\n\nPerhaps one substituent is -COO- (which is one double bond equivalent), and the other is a vinyl group with another double bond.\n\nFor example"
