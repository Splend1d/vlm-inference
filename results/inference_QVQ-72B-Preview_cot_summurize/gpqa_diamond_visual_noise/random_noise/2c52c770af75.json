So, we have a metric given by:\n\n\\[ ds^{2} = \\frac{32}{\\left(4 - x^{2} - y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2} + dy^{2}\\right) \\]\n\nAnd we're supposed to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius \\( r = 2 \\). The options are:\n\nA. \\( 4\\pi\\left(x^{2} - y^{2}\\right) \\)\n\nB. \\( +\\infty \\)\n\nC. \\( 4\\pi\\left(x^{2} + y^{2}\\right) \\)\n\nD. 0\n\nHmm, first things first, I need to understand what a pseudosphere is. A pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature, often modeled by a surface of revolution of a tractrix. But in this context, it seems like we're dealing with a specific metric that defines this pseudosphere.\n\nGiven the metric, it looks like we're working in a plane with coordinates \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and this metric is defining a geometry on that plane. The term \\( ds^{2} \\) represents the square of the infinitesimal distance between two points in this space.\n\nSo, to find the area of the pseudosphere, I think I need to integrate the area element over the region of interest. In differential geometry, the area element is given by:\n\n\\[ dA = \\sqrt{g} \\, dx \\, dy \\]\n\nWhere \\( g \\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. In our case, the metric tensor \\( g_{ij} \\) is diagonal with entries \\( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\), so:\n\n\\[ g = \\text{det}(g_{ij}) = \\left( \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the square root of \\( g \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{g} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\]\n\nSo, the area element \\( dA \\) is:\n\n\\[ dA = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy \\]\n\nNow, to find the area of the pseudosphere with radius \\( r = 2 \\), I need to integrate \\( dA \\) over the region where \\( 4 - x^{2} - y^{2} > 0 \\), because the denominator must be positive (otherwise, the metric wouldn't make sense). So, the region of integration is:\n\n\\[ x^{2} + y^{2} < 4 \\]\n\nThis is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\nLet me set up the integral:\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{x^{2} + y^{2} < 4} \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy \\]\n\nTo evaluate this integral, it might be helpful to switch to polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, \\( x = r \\cos\\theta \\), \\( y = r \\sin\\theta \\), and \\( dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\).\n\nThe region \\( x^{2} + y^{2} < 4 \\) becomes \\( 0 < r < 2 \\), and \\( \\theta \\) goes from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nSubstituting into the integral:\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4 - r^{2}} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\]\n\nFirst, let's integrate with respect to \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4 - r^{2}} \\, dr \\]\n\nLet me make a substitution to simplify this integral. Let \\( u = 4 - r^{2} \\), so \\( du = -2r \\, dr \\), or \\( r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} du \\).\n\nWhen \\( r = 0 \\), \\( u = 4 \\), and when \\( r = 2 \\), \\( u = 4 - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} du \\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{du}{u} = 16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nWait a minute, \\( \\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\ln|u| + C \\), so:\n\n\\[ 16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{0}^{4} \\]\n\nBut \\( \\ln|u| \\) at \\( u = 0 \\) is undefined, approaching \\( -\\infty \\). So, this integral diverges to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the pseudosphere with radius \\( r = 2 \\) is infinite.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is \\( +\\infty \\), so that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the metric is:\n\n\\[ ds^{2} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} (dx^{2} + dy^{2}) \\]\n\nThe area element is indeed \\( dA = \\sqrt{g} \\, dx \\, dy \\), and \\( g = \\left( \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\right)^2 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{g} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\).\n\nThe integral for the area is:\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{x^{2} + y^{2} < 4} \\frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy \\]\n\nIn polar coordinates, this becomes:\n\n\\[ A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4 - r^{2}} \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\]\n\nThe inner integral with respect to \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4 - r^{2}} \\, dr \\]\n\nUsing the substitution \\( u = 4 - r^{2} \\), \\( du = -2r \\, dr \\), the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ -16 \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{du}{u} = 16 \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\int \\frac{du}{u} = \\ln|u| + C \\), so:\n\n\\[ 16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{0}^{4} = 16 (\\ln|4| - \\ln|0|) \\]\n\nSince \\( \\ln|0| \\) is undefined, approaching \\( -\\infty \\), the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 16 (\\ln|4| - (-\\infty)) = 16 (\\ln|4| + \\infty) \\]\n\nThis is still divergent to \\( +\\infty \\). Therefore, the area is infinite.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps considering the behavior near the boundary \\( x^{2} + y^{2} = 4 \\), where the denominator \\( 4 - x^{2} - y^{2} \\) approaches zero, causing the integrand to become very large, which leads to the integral diverging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to interpret this integral differently or to find a known function that it represents.\n\nWait, option A is \\( 4\\pi(x^{2} - y^{2}) \\), which doesn't make sense because area should be a scalar value, not dependent on \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nOption C is \\( 4\\pi(x^{2} + y^{2}) \\), which also seems dependent on variables, whereas area should be a constant for a given pseudosphere.\n\nOption D is 0, which doesn't make sense because the area can't be zero unless it's a single point.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible option is B. \\( +\\infty \\).\n\nI think my calculation is correct, and the area of the pseudosphere with radius \\( r = 2 \\) is indeed infinite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}"
