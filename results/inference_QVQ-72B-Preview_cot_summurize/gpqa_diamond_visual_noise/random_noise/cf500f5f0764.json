                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got five exoplanets in orbital resonance, with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They all have the same albedo, and we need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, specifically between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what equilibrium temperature means for a planet. I think it's the temperature a planet reaches when the energy it receives from its star is balanced by the energy it radiates back into space. There's a formula for that, right? Something like:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( T \\) is the equilibrium temperature\n\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the star\n\nBut wait, albedo comes into play here too. If the planet has an albedo, it reflects some of the incident light back into space without absorbing it. So, the actual absorbed energy is reduced by the albedo. I think the formula adjusts to:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nWhere \\( A \\) is the albedo.\n\nIn this problem, all planets have the same albedo, so \\( A \\) is the same for all of them. That means the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures shouldn't depend on \\( A \\), right? Because \\( A \\) will cancel out when we take the ratio.\n\nSo, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\) would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nWait, why \\( D_2/D_4 \\)? Let's see.\n\nActually, since \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\), the ratio should be \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\). But let's confirm this.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equilibrium temperature formulas for both planets:\n\n\\[ T_2 = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D_2^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\n\\[ T_4 = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nOkay, so yes, the ratio is \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\).\n\nBut we have orbital periods given, not distances. However, for circular orbits, there's a relationship between orbital period and distance from the star, right? Something like \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), but I might be mixing this up with Kepler's third law.\n\nWait, Kepler's third law states that \\( \\frac{T^2}{D^3} = \\text{constant} \\), assuming the same units.\n\nSo, \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\).\n\nTherefore, if we can find the ratio of distances \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\), we can find the ratio of temperatures.\n\nGiven the period ratio is 2 for Planet_2 and 3.5 for Planet_4, the ratio of their periods is \\( \\frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3} \\)\n\nWait, actually, from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = (1.75)^{2/3} \\)\n\nNow, we need \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{(1.75)^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} = (1.75)^{-1/3} \\)\n\nSo, the ratio of temperatures is \\( (1.75)^{-1/3} \\)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1.75 is the same as 7/4.\n\nSo, \\( (7/4)^{-1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3} \\)\n\nNow, to find the cube root of 4/7.\n\nFirst, find the cube root of 4 and the cube root of 7, then divide.\n\nCube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874.\n\nCube root of 7 is approximately 1.9129.\n\nSo, \\( (4/7)^{1/3} \\approx \\frac{1.5874}{1.9129} \\approx 0.829 \\)\n\nBut looking back, I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier step.\n\nWait, the ratio of temperatures is \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = (1.75)^{-1/3} \\), which I calculated as approximately 0.829.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them are exactly this, but option B is ~0.83, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I feel like I might have missed something here.\n\nLet me double-check the relationship between temperature and distance.\n\nGiven that \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\), then \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\).\n\nAnd since \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), then \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\).\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nGiven \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), then \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\).\n\nWait, but earlier I had \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\), which is the same as \\( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} = \\left( \\frac{D_4}{D_2} \\right)^{1/2} \\).\n\nI think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ D \\propto T^{2/3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( D = k T^{2/3} \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nThen, \\( D^2 = k^2 T^{4/3} \\).\n\nPlugging back into the temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma (k^2 T^{4/3})} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), then \\( T \\propto D^{3/2} \\).\n\nWait, no. From \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), then \\( T \\propto D^{3/2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( T \\propto D^{3/2} \\), meaning \\( T = c D^{3/2} \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant.\n\nBut earlier, I have \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\), which contradicts this.\n\nI must be making a mistake here.\n\nLet me recall that in the equilibrium temperature formula, \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\), assuming albedo is constant.\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\).\n\nSo, combining these, \\( T \\propto (T^{2/3})^{-1/2} = T^{-1/3} \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nClearly, I'm mixing things up.\n\nMaybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet's consider that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to \\( D^{-1/2} \\), and \\( D \\) is proportional to \\( T^{2/3} \\).\n\nSo, \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\propto (k T^{2/3})^{-1/2} = k^{-1/2} T^{-1/3} \\).\n\nThis suggests that \\( T \\propto T^{-1/3} \\), which again doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I need to be more careful with my variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ D = k T^{2/3} \\]\n\nWhere \\( k \\) is a constant that includes the gravitational constant and the mass of the star.\n\nSo, substituting \\( D \\) in the temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma (k T^{2/3})^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma k^2 T^{4/3}} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to find an expression for \\( T \\) in terms of \\( T \\), which seems circular, I should consider the ratio between two planets.\n\nLet's denote the constants as \\( K = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma} \\right)^{1/4} \\), which is the same for both planets since \\( A \\), \\( L \\), and \\( \\sigma \\) are the same.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ T = K D^{-1/2} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ D = k T^{2/3} \\]\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\[ T = K (k T^{2/3})^{-1/2} = K k^{-1/2} T^{-1/3} \\]\n\nThen, \\( T^{4/3} = K k^{-1/2} \\), so \\( T = (K k^{-1/2})^{3/4} \\)\n\nThis seems too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that since all planets are in resonance and have the same albedo, their equilibrium temperatures are directly related to their distances, which are related to their periods via Kepler's third law.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the ratio of temperatures is simply the inverse square root of the ratio of distances, and the ratio of distances is the periods raised to the 2/3 power.\n\nSo, if \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( T_4 / T_2 = (T_2 / T_4)^{1/3} \\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( T_4 \\):\n\n\\[ T_4^2 = (T_2)^{1/3} \\]\n\nThis doesn't seem right. I must be making a mistake in the algebra.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFrom the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ D = k T^{2/3} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( D \\) into the temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma (k T^{2/3})^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma k^2 T^{4/3}} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nThis still seems circular. Maybe I need to consider the ratio between two planets.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( T_1 \\) and \\( D_1 \\) for Planet_1, and so on.\n\nThen, for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\n\\[ T_2 = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D_2^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\n\\[ T_4 = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nTaking the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nThen, \\( T_4^4 = T_2^{1/3} \\), which seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of logarithms or another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should accept that \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\), and since \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\), then \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\), which implies \\( T_4^4 = T_2^{1/3} \\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm stuck in a loop here. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to \\( D^{-1/2} \\), and \\( D \\) is proportional to \\( T^{2/3} \\).\n\nSo, \\( T \\propto D^{-1/2} \\propto (k T^{2/3})^{-1/2} = k^{-1/2} T^{-1/3} \\)\n\nThis suggests that \\( T = c T^{-1/3} \\), which implies \\( T^{4/3} = c \\), so \\( T = c^{3/4} \\)\n\nThis still doesn't help me find the ratio between \\( T_4 \\) and \\( T_2 \\).\n\nPerhaps I should give up on trying to derive the exact relationship and instead plug in the given period ratio.\n\nGiven that the period ratio is \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = 1.75 \\), and \\( D \\propto T^{2/3} \\), then \\( \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} = \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_4} \\right)^{2/3} = (1/1.75)^{2/3} = (0.5714)^{2/3} \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( (0.5714)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = (0.5714)^{1/3} \\)\n\nSo, \\( (0.5714)^{1/3} \\) is approximately 0.83, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere because the earlier steps seemed inconsistent"
