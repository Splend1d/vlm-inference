                    "text": "Let's tackle this astronomy problem. It's been a while since I've done any stellar astrophysics, but I remember some basic principles that should help here.\n\nSo, we have two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius that's 1.5 times larger than Star_2's radius, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which both stars emit their peak radiation are the same, which suggests they have the same surface temperatures since that's what determines the peak wavelength according to Wien's displacement law.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature, specifically, luminosity (L) is proportional to the radius squared times the temperature to the fourth power (L \u221d R\u00b2 T\u2074). Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio should depend only on the radius ratio squared.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that both stars have the same peak wavelength, implying the same temperature. So, if T1 = T2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.\n\nBut hold on, the options are given with decimal places, and 2.25 is one of them. However, maybe there's more to it, considering the masses and radial velocities.\n\nRadial velocity is related to the star's motion towards or away from us, which affects the Doppler shift of its spectrum. But since Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, it's not moving relative to us, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the luminosity comparison.\n\nMass can affect luminosity in stars because more massive stars are generally more luminous. But in this case, both stars have the same temperature and different masses, but the problem states that their luminosities differ by a certain factor, specifically asking for the factor by which L1 is greater than L2.\n\nGiven that temperature is the same, and assuming both stars are on the main sequence and follow the mass-luminosity relationship, but since they have the same temperature, perhaps they're at different stages of evolution.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the mass-luminosity relationship. The mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence stars is roughly L \u221d M^x, where x is about 3.5 for stars like the Sun. But in this case, both stars have the same temperature, and their masses are scaled by 1.5.\n\nBut the problem states that they radiate as black bodies, so perhaps the Stefan-Boltzmann law is more directly applicable here.\n\nStefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074\n\nGiven that T1 = T2 (since peak wavelength is the same), then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be D. ~2.25\n\nBut let's see if there's more to it. Maybe the mass affects the luminosity in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the luminosity per unit mass or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the Eddington limit, where luminosity is related to mass and opacity, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radial velocities indicate that one star is moving away from us, affecting its apparent luminosity due to the Doppler effect, but that seems unlikely since luminosity is an intrinsic property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that the luminosity depends on mass, but since both stars have the same temperature and different masses, but the same radius ratio, perhaps the luminosity ratio is just the radius ratio squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the mass-luminosity relationship.\n\nFor main-sequence stars, L \u221d M^x, where x is about 3.5\n\nGiven that M1 = 1.5 M2, then L1 = (1.5)^3.5 * L2\n\nBut (1.5)^3.5 is approximately 3.35, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nBut this assumes that both stars are on the main sequence and follow the mass-luminosity relationship, which may not be the case if they have the same temperature but different masses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the temperature is the same because they have the same peak wavelength, but their luminosities differ based on their radii.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that both stars have the same temperature, and Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, then its luminosity should be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times that of Star_2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. ~2.25\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
