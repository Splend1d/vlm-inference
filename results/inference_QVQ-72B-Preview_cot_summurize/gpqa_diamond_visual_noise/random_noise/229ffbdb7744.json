                    "text": "So I'm looking at this problem about hydrogen atom transitions. It says that the |3,0,0\u27e9 state in the hydrogen atom, using the standard notation |n,l,m\u27e9, decays to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the transition route and the corresponding probability. The options are given, but I want to understand why one of them is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about atomic physics and quantum mechanics, particularly regarding the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions.\n\nThe hydrogen atom is described by quantum numbers: n (principal quantum number), l (angular momentum quantum number), and m (magnetic quantum number). Dipole transitions follow certain selection rules because they involve the emission or absorption of a photon, which carries angular momentum.\n\nThe selection rules for dipole transitions are:\n\n1. \u0394l = \u00b11: The angular momentum changes by one unit.\n\n2. \u0394m = 0, \u00b11: The magnetic quantum number can stay the same or change by one unit.\n\n3. \u0394n is not restricted, but usually, transitions with larger \u0394n are less probable due to energy differences.\n\nGiven that, the problem states that the |3,0,0\u27e9 state decays to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions. So, I need to find a path consisting of two transitions where each transition follows the selection rules, and the final state is |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nLet's look at the initial and final states:\n\n- Initial state: |3,0,0\u27e9\n\n- Final state: |1,0,0\u27e9\n\nDirect transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 would violate the \u0394l rule since l would change from 0 to 0, which doesn't satisfy \u0394l = \u00b11. Therefore, a direct transition isn't allowed, and we need to consider two steps.\n\nNow, let's consider possible intermediate states.\n\nFirst transition: from |3,0,0\u27e9 to some |2,l,m\u27e9.\n\nLooking at the selection rules:\n\n- \u0394l = \u00b11, so l can be 1 or -1. But l has to be non-negative, so l=1.\n\n- \u0394m = 0, \u00b11, so m can be 0, -1, or 1.\n\nTherefore, possible intermediate states are |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,-1\u27e9, and |2,1,1\u27e9.\n\nSecond transition: from one of these intermediate states to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nLooking at the selection rules again:\n\n- \u0394l = \u00b11, so from l=1 to l=0.\n\n- \u0394m = 0, \u00b11.\n\nFrom |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9:\n\n- \u0394l = 1 \u2192 0, which is \u0394l = -1, allowed.\n\n- \u0394m = 0 - 0 = 0, allowed.\n\nFrom |2,1,-1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9:\n\n- \u0394l = 1 \u2192 0, \u0394l = -1, allowed.\n\n- \u0394m = 0 - (-1) = +1, allowed.\n\nFrom |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9:\n\n- \u0394l = 1 \u2192 0, \u0394l = -1, allowed.\n\n- \u0394m = 0 - 1 = -1, allowed.\n\nSo, all three intermediate states can transition to |1,0,0\u27e9 via allowed dipole transitions.\n\nNow, the problem is to determine which of these paths is the correct one, and what's the probability associated with it.\n\nI need to calculate the probability for each possible path and see which one matches the options given.\n\nFirst, let's consider the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nSimilarly, |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 and |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nI need to find the probability for each of these paths and see which one matches the given options.\n\nTo find the probability of a two-step transition, I need to multiply the probabilities of each step, assuming they are independent.\n\nBut first, I need to find the transition probabilities for each step.\n\nThe transition probability between two states is given by Fermi's golden rule:\n\nA = (2\u03c0/\u0127) |\u27e8\u03c8_f|H'|\u03c8_i\u27e9|^2 \u03c1\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the transition probability per unit time.\n\n- H' is the interaction Hamiltonian.\n\n- \u03c8_i and \u03c8_f are the initial and final wave functions.\n\n- \u03c1 is the density of final states.\n\nFor dipole transitions in atoms, the matrix element involves the electric dipole moment operator, which is proportional to r.\n\nHowever, calculating these matrix elements directly is quite involved and requires knowledge of the wave functions.\n\nThere's a simpler way using the concept of oscillator strength and transition probabilities, but that might be beyond what's expected here.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that in atomic transitions, the probability of transition depends on the square of the matrix element and the density of states.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for this problem.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude for a transition is given by the product of the amplitudes for each step in a multi-step process.\n\nThen, the total probability is the square of the magnitude of the total amplitude.\n\nSo, if I have two steps, the amplitude is the product of the amplitudes of each step, and the probability is the square of that product.\n\nBut I need to find the amplitudes for each transition.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of decay rates and branching ratios.\n\nFirst, I need to find the decay rate from |3,0,0\u27e9 to the intermediate states, and then from there to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nBut again, this seems complicated without knowing the specific decay rates.\n\nPerhaps there's a more straightforward way.\n\nLooking back at the options, they provide the transition routes and the corresponding probabilities.\n\nI need to match the correct route with the correct probability.\n\nOption A: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3\n\nOption B: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nOption C: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3\n\nOption D: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nWait, option C is the same as option A except for the probability value.\n\nThis seems confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the probability depends on the number of possible m states involved.\n\nFor example, if there are multiple m states that the atom can transition to, the probability might be distributed among them.\n\nIn that case, the total probability would be the sum over the probabilities of each possible path.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are three possible intermediate states, each with its own transition probability, the total probability for the two-step decay would involve summing over these paths.\n\nHowever, the options suggest that only one path is taken, or perhaps the probability is dominated by one path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability is the same for each path, depending on the number of m states.\n\nWait, perhaps the probability is proportional to the number of m states that can be accessed in the intermediate step.\n\nFor example, from |3,0,0\u27e9, there are three possible m states in |2,1,m\u27e9: m=-1,0,1.\n\nIf each of these transitions has an equal probability, then the total probability for decaying through any of these paths would be higher.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the probability of decaying specifically through one particular path.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability is the same for each path, assuming that the transitions are equally likely to each m state.\n\nBut looking at the options, they have different probabilities: 2/3, 1/4, 1/3, 1/4.\n\nThis suggests that some paths are more probable than others.\n\nMaybe the probability depends on the change in m.\n\nFor example, \u0394m = 0 might have a different probability than \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nI need to recall if there's any difference in transition probabilities based on the change in m.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, transitions with \u0394m = 0 are often more probable than those with \u0394m = \u00b11, depending on the orientation of the electric field vector.\n\nHowever, in the absence of an external magnetic field, all m states are degenerate, and transitions between them should be equally probable.\n\nBut in the hydrogen atom, the magnetic field is usually negligible, so perhaps all m transitions are equally likely.\n\nGiven that, perhaps each path has an equal probability.\n\nBut that doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability depends on the specific matrix elements involved in each transition.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude for a sequence of transitions is the product of the amplitudes for each transition, and the probability is the square of the magnitude of the total amplitude.\n\nSo, if I can find the amplitude for each step, I can multiply them and then square to get the probability.\n\nBut I don't know the amplitudes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of decay rates.\n\nThe decay rate from one state to another is proportional to the square of the matrix element between the states.\n\nSo, the probability for a two-step process would be proportional to the product of the matrix elements for each step.\n\nBut again, without knowing the matrix elements, this is not helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that the total decay rate from |3,0,0\u27e9 to all possible states includes decays to other states besides |1,0,0\u27e9, but in this problem, it's specified that it decays to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions.\n\nWait, but |3,0,0\u27e9 can decay to other states as well, not just to |2,1,m\u27e9.\n\nFor example, it can decay to |2,0,0\u27e9 via a quadrupole transition, but the problem specifies dipole transitions.\n\nSo, perhaps decaying to |2,1,m\u27e9 is the only dipole-allowed transition from |3,0,0\u27e9.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nFrom |3,0,0\u27e9:\n\n- \u0394l = \u00b11, so l can be 1 or -1 (but l is non-negative, so l=1).\n\n- \u0394m = 0, \u00b11, so m can be 0, -1, or 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible dipole transitions are to |2,1,0\u27e9, |2,1,-1\u27e9, and |2,1,1\u27e9.\n\nFrom there, as previously established, each of these can transition to |1,0,0\u27e9 via dipole-allowed transitions.\n\nSo, no other dipole transitions are possible from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 besides these three paths.\n\nNow, perhaps the probability for each path is equal, but that doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability depends on the change in m.\n\nFor example, transitioning with \u0394m = 0 might have a different probability than transitioning with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nI need to recall if there's any preference for \u0394m = 0 in dipole transitions.\n\nIn atomic physics, transitions with \u0394m = 0 are often more probable because they correspond to electric dipole transitions along the field direction, while \u0394m = \u00b11 correspond to transitions with polarization perpendicular to the field direction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps transitions with \u0394m = 0 have higher probability than those with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nIf that's the case, then the path |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9, which involves \u0394m = 0 in both steps, would have a higher probability compared to paths involving \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3\n\nOption B: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nOption C: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3\n\nOption D: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nIf transitions with \u0394m = 0 are more probable, then option A with both steps having \u0394m = 0 would have a higher probability, which is 2/3, while options involving \u0394m = \u00b11 have lower probabilities, such as 1/4.\n\nHowever, option C also has the same path as option A but with a different probability, which is confusing.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in option C, or maybe the probabilities are calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the probability is determined by the number of possible paths.\n\nFor example, there are three possible paths, each with equal probability, so the probability for each path would be 1/3.\n\nBut option A has 2/3, which suggests that perhaps two paths contribute to this probability.\n\nWait, maybe the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths leading to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem specifies \"via two dipole transition[s]\", implying a specific path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is for the sequence of transitions, considering the branching ratios at each step.\n\nThis is getting too complicated without more specific knowledge.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, the probability amplitude for a sequence of transitions is the product of the amplitudes for each
