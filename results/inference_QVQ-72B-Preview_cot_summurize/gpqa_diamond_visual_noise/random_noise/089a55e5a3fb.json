                    "text": "So I have this problem here about quantum mechanics. It talks about a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function of each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, where 'i' is the imaginary unit, and 'sqrt()' denotes the square root. The particles are only found between x = 1 and x = 3 when their positions are measured. I need to find the numerical value of 'a' from the given options: A. 0.6, B. 1.1, C. 0.85, D. 0.35.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles of quantum mechanics. The wave function, \u03c8(x), describes the state of a quantum system. The probability density of finding the particle at position x is given by the modulus squared of the wave function, |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2.\n\nGiven that the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, I need to ensure that it is normalized over the interval x = 1 to x = 3, since no particles are found outside this region.\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the integral of |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 from x = 1 to x = 3 is equal to 1:\n\n\u222b |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 dx from 1 to 3 = 1\n\nSo, I need to compute |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 and integrate it over the given interval, then set the result equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.\n\nFirst, let's write down the wave function:\n\n\u03c8(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i\n\nTo find |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2, I need to multiply \u03c8(x) by its complex conjugate, \u03c8*(x).\n\nThe complex conjugate of \u03c8(x) is:\n\n\u03c8*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, multiply \u03c8(x) and \u03c8*(x):\n\n|\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = \u03c8(x) * \u03c8*(x) = [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i] * [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i]\n\nThis is a difference of squares, so:\n\n|\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = [(a / sqrt(1 + x))]\u00b2 - (0.5*i)\u00b2\n\n= (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) - (0.25 * i\u00b2)\n\nSince i\u00b2 = -1,\n\n|\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) - (0.25 * (-1)) = (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25\n\nNow, set the integral of |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 from x = 1 to x = 3 equal to 1:\n\n\u222b from 1 to 3 of [(a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nLet's integrate term by term.\n\nFirst, integrate (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) dx from 1 to 3.\n\nLet u = 1 + x, then du = dx.\n\nWhen x = 1, u = 2; when x = 3, u = 4.\n\nSo, \u222b (a\u00b2 / u) du from u = 2 to u = 4 = a\u00b2 * \u222b (1/u) du from 2 to 4 = a\u00b2 * [ln|u|] from 2 to 4 = a\u00b2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a\u00b2 * ln(2)\n\nSecond, integrate 0.25 dx from x = 1 to x = 3.\n\n= 0.25 * [x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\nNow, combine the two integrals:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSolve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\na\u00b2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nNow, calculate the numerical value of ln(2). I know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 0.5 / 0.6931 \u2248 0.722\n\nThen, a = sqrt(0.722) \u2248 0.85\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.6\n\nB. 1.1\n\nC. 0.85\n\nD. 0.35\n\nSo, the closest value is C. 0.85.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.85.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
