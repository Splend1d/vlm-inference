                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have two planets, both detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2, specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Both planets have the same mass, and both have circular orbits. The host stars have different masses but the same radius, with Planet_2's host being slightly evolved.\n\nThe goal is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting its star, given that we can only observe one of them. Transits are when a planet passes directly between its star and the observer, and the probability of that happening depends on the geometry of the orbit and the size of the star.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the transit probability. I think it's generally given by:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{R_*}{a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin(i)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( R_* \\) is the radius of the star,\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit,\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nBut since both planets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis is just the orbital radius. Also, for circular orbits, the transit probability simplifies because the impact parameter is zero.\n\nWait, actually, the exact formula for the transit probability is:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{R_* + R_p}{a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin(i)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( R_p \\) is the radius of the planet. But since both planets are Earth-like and presumably have similar radii, and given that \\( R_p \\) is much smaller than \\( R_* \\), especially for main-sequence stars, we can approximate \\( R_p \\) as negligible compared to \\( R_* \\). So, the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[ p \\approx \\frac{R_*}{a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin(i)} \\]\n\nNow, the inclination \\( i \\) is the angle between the planet's orbital plane and the plane perpendicular to the line of sight. For a transit to occur, the inclination must be such that the planet's orbit is edge-on from our perspective, which is why the probability involves \\( \\sin(i) \\).\n\nBut here's the thing: for exoplanets detected by the RV method, we don't directly know the inclination unless we have additional information. The RV method measures the star's wobble along our line of sight, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital parameters, but the inclination enters as a sine function. That is:\n\n\\[ v_{rad} = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin(i)}{P} \\times \\frac{m_p}{m_*} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v_{rad} \\) is the radial velocity amplitude,\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis,\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period,\n\n- \\( m_p \\) is the planet's mass,\n\n- \\( m_* \\) is the star's mass.\n\nSince we detect the radial velocity amplitude, and it depends on \\( \\sin(i) \\), the measured minimum mass is \\( m_p \\sin(i) \\). Without knowing \\( i \\), we only know \\( m_p \\sin(i) \\), not \\( m_p \\) itself unless we assume \\( i = 90^\\circ \\), which is the case for transiting planets.\n\nBut in this problem, both planets are detected by RV, so we have their minimum masses, which are equal. Since both planets have the same mass (assuming they are Earth-like), their actual masses should be equal, and thus \\( \\sin(i) \\) must be the same for both.\n\nWait, but if both planets have the same minimum mass, and assuming they are both planets, their actual masses should be equal, provided that \\( \\sin(i) \\) is the same for both. But since they are detected by RV, and we assume they are both planets, perhaps we can proceed with that.\n\nNow, the transit probability depends on \\( R_*/a \\), and possibly on \\( \\sin(i) \\), but since both planets are detected by RV, and assuming similar \\( \\sin(i) \\), perhaps the difference in transit probability is mainly due to the different orbital periods.\n\nLet's think about the orbital period and the semi-major axis. For circular orbits, the period \\( P \\) is related to the semi-major axis \\( a \\) by Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G (m_* + m_p)} \\]\n\nFor planets much less massive than their stars, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G m_*} \\]\n\nSo, \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\)\n\nGiven that Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2, its semi-major axis is smaller. Specifically, if Planet_2 has period \\( P \\), then Planet_1 has period \\( P/3 \\), so its semi-major axis is:\n\n\\[ a_1 = a_2 \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} = a_2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{2/3} \\approx a_2 \\times 0.63 \\]\n\nSo, \\( a_1 = 0.63 a_2 \\)\n\nNow, the transit probability is \\( p \\approx R_*/a \\), assuming \\( R_p \\) is negligible and \\( \\sin(i) = 1 \\) for transiting planets.\n\nGiven that both stars have the same radius \\( R_* \\), the transit probability ratio for Planet_1 to Planet_2 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_*/a_1}{R_*/a_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{1}{0.63} \\approx 1.587 \\]\n\nSo, Planet_2 has a higher transit probability by about 1.587 times.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this. The formula for transit probability is indeed \\( p \\approx R_*/a \\), assuming \\( R_p \\) is negligible and \\( \\sin(i) = 1 \\).\n\nGiven that both stars have the same radius \\( R_* \\), and \\( a_1 = 0.63 a_2 \\), then \\( p_1 = R_*/a_1 = R_*/(0.63 a_2) \\), and \\( p_2 = R_*/a_2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( p_1 / p_2 = a_2 / (0.63 a_2) = 1 / 0.63 \\approx 1.587 \\), meaning Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by this factor.\n\nBut wait, that would suggest that Planet_1 has a higher probability, but according to the options, it's the other way around.\n\nLet me see if I'm missing something. Maybe the masses of the stars play a role.\n\nOh, right! The stars have different masses but the same radius.\n\nPlanet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star.\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\n- \\( m_{*1} = 2 m_{*2} \\)\n\n- \\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \\)\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, \\( P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G m_*} \\), so \\( a = \\left( \\frac{G m_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\)\n\nGiven that Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2, i.e., \\( P_1 = P_2 / 3 \\)\n\nBut also, the stellar masses are different: \\( m_{*1} = 2 m_{*2} \\)\n\nSo, let's compute the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{m_{*1} P_1^2}{m_{*2} P_2^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{2 m_{*2} (P_2 / 3)^2}{m_{*2} P_2^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (2/9)^{1/3} \\):\n\nFirst, \\( 2/9 \\approx 0.222 \\), and its cube root is approximately 0.606.\n\nSo, \\( a_1 = 0.606 a_2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the transit probability ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{R_{*1}/a_1}{R_{*2}/a_2} = \\frac{R_{*1}}{R_{*2}} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{0.606} \\approx 1.65 \\]\n\nSo, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by about 1.65 times.\n\nWait, but according to the options, A says Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher probability, B says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability, C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability, and D says Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.\n\nSo, my calculation suggests that Planet_1 has a higher probability by about 1.65 times, which matches option B.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( m_{*1} = 2 m_{*2} \\)\n\n- \\( P_1 = P_2 / 3 \\)\n\n- \\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \\)\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ a = \\left( \\frac{G m_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{m_{*1} P_1^2}{m_{*2} P_2^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{2 m_{*2} (P_2 / 3)^2}{m_{*2} P_2^2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( (2/9)^{1/3} \\):\n\nFirst, \\( 2/9 \\approx 0.222 \\), and its cube root is approximately 0.606.\n\nSo, \\( a_1 = 0.606 a_2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( p_1 / p_2 = 1 / 0.606 \\approx 1.65 \\)\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability by about 1.65 times.\n\nSo, the answer should be B: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor that could influence this.\n\nFor example, the radius of the planet. Both are Earth-like, so presumably similar radii, and since \\( R_p \\) is much smaller than \\( R_* \\), it's negligible in the probability formula.\n\nAlso, the inclination angle. Since both planets are detected by RV, and we don't know their inclinations, but since we're comparing the probabilities relative to each other, and assuming similar \\( \\sin(i) \\), the ratio should hold.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting by about 1.65 times.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
