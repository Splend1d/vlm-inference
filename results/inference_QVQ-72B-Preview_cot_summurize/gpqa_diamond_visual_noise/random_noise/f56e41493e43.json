They were discovered using the TTV method, which I believe stands for Transit Timing Variations. That's probably how astronomers detected these planets by observing how they pass in front of their star, causing slight dips in the star's brightness at regular intervals.\n\nThe problem gives us some ratios involving the equilibrium temperatures and masses of these planets. Specifically:\n\n- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4.\n\n- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3.\n\n- Similarly, for masses:\n\n- The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15.\n\n- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35.\n\nWe're also told that all three planets have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth's. Albedo is the measure of how much light (in this case, stellar radiation) is reflected by a planet's surface. So, higher albedo means less absorption of energy, which in turn affects the planet's temperature.\n\nOur goal is to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. We need to find the factor by which P3 is larger than P1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its distance from the star (which is related to its orbital period), and other factors like albedo.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet can be given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nT=\\left(\\frac{L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^{2} A}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(L\\) is the luminosity of the star.\n\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n- \\(D\\) is the distance from the star to the planet.\n\n- \\(A\\) is the planet's bond albedo.\n\nGiven that all planets have the same albedo (A = 0.3), this simplifies things because the albedo terms will cancel out when we take ratios of temperatures.\n\nWe know that the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star, and since the orbits are circular, we can relate the distance to the orbital period using Kepler's third law.\n\nKepler's third law states that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P^{2}}{a^{3}}=k\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(P\\) is the orbital period.\n\n- \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis, which for circular orbits is equal to the distance \\(D\\).\n\n- \\(k\\) is a constant for a given star.\n\nSo, \\(P^{2} \\propto D^{3}\\), or \\(P \\propto D^{3/2}\\).\n\nGiven that, if we can find the ratio of distances \\(D_{3} / D_{1}\\), we can find the ratio of periods \\(P_{3} / P_{1}\\).\n\nBut first, let's consider the equilibrium temperatures.\n\nGiven that \\(T \\propto \\frac{1}{D}\\), because \\(T\\) is inversely proportional to the square root of \\(D\\) from the temperature formula, but actually, from the formula above, \\(T \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/2}}\\), wait no:\n\nFrom the formula:\n\n\\[\nT \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(T \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/2}}\\), not \\(\\frac{1}{D}\\).\n\nWait, let's look back at the formula:\n\n\\[\nT=\\left(\\frac{L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^{2} A}\\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(T \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/2}}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(D \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{2}}\\).\n\nSo, \\(D \\propto T^{-2}\\).\n\nAnd since \\(P \\propto D^{3/2}\\), then \\(P \\propto T^{-3}\\).\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's double-check that.\n\nGiven \\(D \\propto T^{-2}\\), and \\(P \\propto D^{3/2}\\), then \\(P \\propto (T^{-2})^{3/2} = T^{-3}\\).\n\nYes, so \\(P \\propto T^{-3}\\).\n\nBut we have ratios of temperatures between the planets.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\(T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}\\) as the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, respectively.\n\n- \\(D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}\\) as their distances from the star.\n\n- \\(P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}\\) as their orbital periods.\n\nGiven that \\(T \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/2}}\\), then \\(D \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{2}}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(D_{1} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{1}^{2}}\\), \\(D_{2} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{2}^{2}}\\), and \\(D_{3} \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{3}^{2}}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(P \\propto D^{3/2}\\), so \\(P_{1} \\propto D_{1}^{3/2}\\), \\(P_{2} \\propto D_{2}^{3/2}\\), and \\(P_{3} \\propto D_{3}^{3/2}\\).\n\nWe can write the ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_{3}}{P_{1}} = \\left( \\frac{D_{3}}{D_{1}} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\(D \\propto \\frac{1}{T^{2}}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D_{3}}{D_{1}} = \\left( \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{3}} \\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_{3}}{P_{1}} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{3}} \\right)^{2} \\right)^{3/2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{3}} \\right)^{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(P_{3} / P_{1} = (T_{1} / T_{3})^{3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, we can express \\(T_{1}\\) and \\(T_{3}\\) in terms of \\(T_{2}\\).\n\nGiven the ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}} = 1.4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{T_{2}}{T_{3}} = 2.3\n\\]\n\nFrom the second ratio, \\(T_{3} = \\frac{T_{2}}{2.3}\\).\n\nFrom the first ratio, \\(T_{1} = 1.4 \\times T_{2}\\).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_{3}}{P_{1}} = \\left( \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{3}} \\right)^{3} = \\left( \\frac{1.4 T_{2}}{T_{2} / 2.3} \\right)^{3} = \\left( 1.4 \\times 2.3 \\right)^{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(1.4 \\times 2.3\\):\n\n\\[\n1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n(3.22)^{3} = 3.22 \\times 3.22 \\times 3.22\n\\]\n\nFirst, \\(3.22 \\times 3.22 = 10.3584\\)\n\nThen, \\(10.3584 \\times 3.22 \\approx 33.32\\)\n\nSo, \\(P_{3} / P_{1} \\approx 33.32\\)\n\nLooking back at the options, this corresponds to option C. ~33.4.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other factors we need to consider, such as the masses of the planets.\n\nThe problem mentions mass ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}} = 1.15 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{M_{2}}{M_{3}} = 1.35\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(M_{1} = 1.15 \\times M_{2}\\) and \\(M_{2} = 1.35 \\times M_{3}\\), which means \\(M_{3} = \\frac{M_{2}}{1.35}\\).\n\nBut in Kepler's third law for circular orbits, the orbital period is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^{3}}{G M}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis (distance \\(D\\) in this case).\n\n- \\(M\\) is the mass of the central star.\n\nAssuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets' masses, the planets' masses don't directly affect the orbital periods. Therefore, the mass ratios shouldn't impact the period ratio in this scenario.\n\nHowever, if the planets' masses are significant compared to the star's mass, their masses would affect the orbital periods. But since the problem doesn't specify, and given that exoplanets are typically much less massive than their stars, I'll assume that the star's mass dominates, and the planets' masses can be neglected in this context.\n\nTherefore, the period ratio is indeed approximately 33.32, which rounds to 33.4, matching option C.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if the planets' masses could have an effect through the TTV method. The TTV method detects planets by observing variations in the timing of transits, which can be caused by gravitational interactions between planets. If the planets have significant masses, their gravitational influences on each other could affect their orbital periods.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, and given the information provided, it seems that we're to consider the equilibrium temperatures and distances to determine the period ratios, assuming that the masses don't significantly affect the periods.\n\nMoreover, since the albedo is the same for all three planets, that factor cancels out when taking ratios.\n\nTherefore, the calculation based on the temperature ratios should suffice to determine the period ratio.\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
