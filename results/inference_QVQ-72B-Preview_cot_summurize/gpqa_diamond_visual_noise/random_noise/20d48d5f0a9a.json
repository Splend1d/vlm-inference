                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a star with certain properties: 1.5 solar radii, 1.1 solar masses, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 K when there are no dark spots. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the Teff drops to 5500 K. Additionally, there's information about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels, and this ratio decreases when spots are present. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes compared to when there are no spots.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the star's effective temperature and the population of atoms in different energy levels. The problem mentions that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. In LTE, the population of atomic energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution, which is described by the Saha equation for ionization equilibrium and the Boltzmann equation for excitation equilibrium.\n\nGiven that we're dealing with neutral titanium atoms and their energy levels, I think the Boltzmann equation is relevant here. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of an energy level to the exponential of the negative of the energy level divided by kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nThe problem also mentions a transition corresponding to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here, but it might be useful for understanding the energy difference between the two levels.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- N1: number density of neutral titanium atoms in level 1\n\n- N2: number density of neutral titanium atoms in level 2\n\n- E1: energy of level 1\n\n- E2: energy of level 2\n\n- \u0394E = E2 - E1\n\nIn LTE, the ratio N2/N1 is given by:\n\nN2/N1 = g2/g1 * exp(-\u0394E / (kT))\n\nwhere:\n\n- g2 and g1 are the degeneracies of level 2 and level 1, respectively\n\n- k is the Boltzmann constant\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nThe problem states that this ratio decreases when spots are present. Spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when they are present, the effective temperature decreases.\n\nWe are given two temperatures: 6000 K (no spots) and 5500 K (with spots covering 40% of the surface). We need to find the factor by which the ratio N2/N1 changes when going from 5500 K to 6000 K.\n\nAssuming that the degeneracies g1 and g2 remain constant, the ratio N2/N1 is proportional to exp(-\u0394E / (kT)). So, the factor by which the ratio changes can be found by taking the ratio of the two ratios at the two different temperatures.\n\nLet's denote the ratio at 6000 K as R1 and at 5500 K as R2.\n\nR1 = g2/g1 * exp(-\u0394E / (k*6000))\n\nR2 = g2/g1 * exp(-\u0394E / (k*5500))\n\nThe factor by which R1 changes to R2 is R1 / R2.\n\nR1 / R2 = [exp(-\u0394E / (k*6000))] / [exp(-\u0394E / (k*5500))] = exp[\u0394E / (k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)]\n\nSimplifying the exponent:\n\n1/5500 - 1/6000 = (12 - 11)/(5500*6000) = 1/(5500*6000)\n\nSo, R1 / R2 = exp[\u0394E / (k) * 1/(5500*6000)] = exp[\u0394E / (k*5500*6000)]\n\nBut I don't know \u0394E or k, so I need to find another way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can use the wavelength of the transition to find \u0394E.\n\nThe energy difference \u0394E is related to the wavelength \u03bb by:\n\n\u0394E = h*c / \u03bb\n\nwhere:\n\n- h is Planck's constant\n\n- c is the speed of light\n\nGiven \u03bb \u2248 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 * 10^-10 m\n\nSo, \u0394E = (6.626*10^-34 J*s) * (3*10^8 m/s) / (1448*10^-10 m) \u2248 (6.626*3*10^-26) / 1448*10^-10 \u2248 1.9878*10^-26 / 1.448*10^-7 \u2248 1.373*10^-19 J\n\nNow, k (Boltzmann constant) is approximately 1.3807*10^-23 J/K\n\nSo, \u0394E / k = 1.373*10^-19 / 1.3807*10^-23 \u2248 10000 K\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\n\u0394E = h*c / \u03bb = (6.626*10^-34) * (3*10^8) / (1448*10^-10) = (1.9878*10^-25) / (1.448*10^-7) \u2248 1.373*10^-18 J\n\nThen, \u0394E / k = 1.373*10^-18 / 1.3807*10^-23 \u2248 100000 K\n\nYes, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, \u0394E / k \u2248 100000 K\n\nNow, going back to the ratio R1 / R2:\n\nR1 / R2 = exp[\u0394E / (k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000)] = exp[\u0394E / (k) * (5/(55*6000))]\n\nBut \u0394E / k \u2248 100000 K, so:\n\nR1 / R2 = exp[100000 * (5/(55*6000))] = exp[100000 * (5/330000)] = exp[100000 * (1/66000)] = exp[(100000)/66000] \u2248 exp[1.515]\n\nexp(1.515) is approximately 4.556\n\nSo, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.56, which corresponds to option B. ~4.5\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. ~4.5\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\sim 4.5} \\]"
