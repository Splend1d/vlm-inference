                    "text": "Let's tackle this astronomy problem. So, I need to find the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstrom. And these clouds need to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A. 1.9, B. 2.4, C. 3, and D. 1.2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what redshift means in this context. Redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light from an object has been shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe. So, if an object is moving away from us, its light gets shifted to longer wavelengths, which is called redshift.\n\nThe Lyman alpha line is a specific wavelength in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, at about 1216 Angstrom. But optical telescopes typically detect light in the visible spectrum, which ranges from about 400 to 700 nanometers (nm). So, the Lyman alpha line is originally in the ultraviolet, but because of redshift, it can be shifted into the visible range where optical telescopes can detect it.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum redshift (z) such that the redshifted Lyman alpha wavelength falls within the visible light range detectable by optical telescopes.\n\nThe formula to calculate the redshifted wavelength is:\n\n\u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03bb_observed is the observed wavelength\n\n- \u03bb_rest is the rest wavelength (1216 Angstrom for Lyman alpha)\n\n- z is the redshift\n\nI need to find the smallest z such that \u03bb_observed is within the visible light range, which is approximately 400-700 nm.\n\nFirst, convert \u03bb_rest to nm, since the visible range is given in nm.\n\n1 Angstrom = 0.1 nm\n\nSo, 1216 Angstrom = 121.6 nm\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check that conversion.\n\n1 Angstrom (\u00c5) = 0.1 nm\n\nSo, 1216 \u00c5 = 1216 * 0.1 nm = 121.6 nm\n\nBut the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet, which is around 121.6 nm, yes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, optical telescopes detect visible light, which is from about 400 nm to 700 nm.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest z such that:\n\n121.6 nm * (1 + z) \u2265 400 nm\n\nBecause anything below 400 nm is still ultraviolet and wouldn't be detected by optical telescopes.\n\nWait, but actually, the upper limit of visible light is 700 nm. So, to be detected by optical telescopes, the redshifted Lyman alpha line should be within 400 nm to 700 nm.\n\nSo, the condition should be:\n\n400 nm \u2264 121.6 nm * (1 + z) \u2264 700 nm\n\nTo find the lower limit of z, I should consider the lower wavelength limit of visible light, which is 400 nm.\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n121.6 nm * (1 + z) = 400 nm\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\n1 + z = 400 / 121.6\n\n1 + z = 3.289\n\nz = 3.289 - 1 = 2.289\n\nSo, the lower limit of z is approximately 2.289.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1.9\n\nB. 2.4\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 1.2\n\nSo, 2.289 is between B and C. But since 2.289 is closer to 2.4, I might be tempted to choose B. However, I should check if z=2.4 satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the upper limit of visible light, 700 nm, to find the upper limit of z, but the question asks for the lower limit on z, meaning the smallest z that allows detection.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, z=2.289 would be the minimum redshift required for the Lyman alpha line to be shifted into the visible range starting from 400 nm.\n\nBut let's check z=2.4:\n\n\u03bb_observed = 121.6 nm * (1 + 2.4) = 121.6 * 3.4 = 413.44 nm\n\nWhich is within the visible range (400-700 nm), slightly above 400 nm.\n\nSimilarly, z=3:\n\n\u03bb_observed = 121.6 * (1 + 3) = 121.6 * 4 = 486.4 nm, which is also within the visible range.\n\nBut z=1.9:\n\n\u03bb_observed = 121.6 * (1 + 1.9) = 121.6 * 2.9 = 352.64 nm, which is still in the ultraviolet range, below 400 nm.\n\nSo, z=1.9 wouldn't be sufficient for detection with optical telescopes.\n\nz=1.2:\n\n\u03bb_observed = 121.6 * (1 + 1.2) = 121.6 * 2.2 = 267.52 nm, which is still ultraviolet.\n\nSo, based on this, z needs to be at least around 2.289 for the Lyman alpha line to be shifted into the visible range.\n\nGiven that, the closest option is B. 2.4.\n\nBut the calculation gave me z\u22482.289, which is closer to 2.4 than to 3.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect this, like atmospheric absorption or the specific capabilities of ground-based optical telescopes.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems that z\u22482.289 is the minimum redshift required, and among the options, B. 2.4 is the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line needs to be within the atmospheric window for optical observations.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is relatively transparent from about 300 nm to 1100 nm, but optical telescopes typically operate in the visible range, 400-700 nm.\n\nSo, my initial approach should still hold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 2.4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
