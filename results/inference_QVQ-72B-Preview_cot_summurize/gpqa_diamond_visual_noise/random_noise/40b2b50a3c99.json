                    "text": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. It seems a bit complex at first glance, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, the question is about isomers and tautomerism. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. There are two main types: constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connections between atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connections but differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms.\n\nTautomerism is a type of constitutional isomerism where compounds can exist in different forms that rapidly interconvert, often involving the shift of a hydrogen atom and a double bond. For example, keto-enol tautomerism is common in organic chemistry.\n\nNow, the question mentions two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It asks which of these does not show tautomerism. Then, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, it asks which one will show optical isomerism.\n\nLet's address part A first: determining which compound does not show tautomerism.\n\n**A.1) Benzoquinone and Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: Which does not show tautomerism?**\n\n- **Benzoquinone:** This is a derivative of benzene with two ketone groups adjacent to each other. Its structure is quite rigid, and it doesn't typically exhibit tautomerism because the ketone groups are fixed in position.\n\n- **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups arranged in a cyclohexane ring. Given the symmetry and the arrangement of the ketone groups, it might be less prone to tautomerism compared to other compounds with more flexible positions for tautomeric shifts.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to recall if either of these compounds can exist in different tautomeric forms.\n\nUpon thinking, benzoquinone doesn't usually exhibit tautomerism because of its structure. However, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might also not show tautomerism due to the symmetric arrangement of ketone groups.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both don't show tautomerism? But that can't be, because the question asks which one does not show tautomerism, implying one does and one does not.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I need to consider the possibility of enol forms for these compounds.\n\nFor benzoquinone, introducing an enol form would likely disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, which is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, it's less likely to form an enol tautomer.\n\nSimilarly, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the cyclohexane ring is saturated, and introducing an enol form might not be as disruptive, but given the symmetric arrangement of ketone groups, it might not favor tautomerism either.\n\nI need to verify this. Maybe looking up the structures or recalling if these compounds are known to exhibit tautomerism.\n\nBenzoquinone is known to exist predominantly in its quinone form, without significant contribution from enol tautomers. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have some tautomeric forms, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exist in different tautomeric forms due to the positioning of the ketone groups, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me consider the structure of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. It's a symmetric compound with all three ketone groups equally spaced around the ring. Due to this symmetry, it's less likely to have different tautomeric forms because any shift of a hydrogen and a double bond would likely lead back to the same structure.\n\nTherefore, both compounds probably do not show significant tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\nBut since the question asks to identify which one does not show tautomerism, and given that both might not exhibit it, perhaps the answer is that neither shows tautomerism. However, the options provided suggest that one of them does show tautomerism.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nB. A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nC. A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nD. A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nIt seems that for part A, we need to choose which compound does not show tautomerism.\n\nGiven my earlier reasoning, both might not show tautomerism, but perhaps one of them does to a certain extent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that one of them does show tautomerism, and I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about benzoquinone again. Is there any possibility of it existing in different tautomeric forms?\n\nBenzoquinone has two ketone groups adjacent to each other in a benzene ring. If I try to shift a hydrogen and a double bond, it might lead to a different structure, but I think such a shift would disrupt the aromaticity of the ring, making it less favorable.\n\nTherefore, benzoquinone likely does not show significant tautomerism.\n\nWhat about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? Can it form enols or other tautomers?\n\nGiven its symmetric structure, any tautomeric shift might lead back to the same structure, so perhaps it doesn't show tautomerism either.\n\nBut if I consider that in some cyclic compounds, tautomerism can occur leading to different ring conformations or positions of double bonds, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exist in different tautomeric forms.\n\nHowever, I'm not confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can exist in different tautomeric forms depending on which ketone groups are shifted to enol forms.\n\nBut given its symmetric nature, these tautomers might be identical in energy and structure, making them indistinct.\n\nI think both compounds do not show significant tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\nBut since the question seems to suggest that one of them does, perhaps I need to consider that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have some tautomeric forms due to its flexibility, whereas benzoquinone is more rigid and doesn't.\n\nTherefore, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism, and benzoquinone does not.\n\nSo, for part A, A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n\nBut looking at the options, this would correspond to option B: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nWait, but the question is to identify which one does not show tautomerism, and according to my reasoning, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, so A should be benzoquinone.\n\nBut option A is A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nLet me check a reliable source or textbook to confirm if benzoquinone shows tautomerism.\n\nUpon recalling, benzoquinone is known to exist primarily in its quinone form, and while there might be some resonance structures, it doesn't typically exist in different tautomeric forms.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have some tautomeric possibilities, although they might not be stable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism, and benzoquinone does not.\n\nSo, A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism would be incorrect, but according to my reasoning, it might show tautomerism.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether these compounds can exist in different tautomeric forms, and based on that, choose the one that does not.\n\nGiven that, and considering that benzoquinone is less likely to show tautomerism due to aromaticity constraints, whereas cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione might have some tautomeric forms, perhaps A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism is the correct choice.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMoving on to part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one will show optical isomerism?\n\nOptical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs in molecules that have one or more chiral centers, meaning they lack symmetry and can exist as mirror images that are not superimposable.\n\nSo, I need to identify which of these compounds has a chiral center.\n\nLet's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate first.\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n\nThis compound is a derivative of propanoic acid with a hydroxyl group at the 2-position and esterified with methanol.\n\nIts structure can be represented as:\n\nCH3-CH(OH)-COO-CH3\n\nLooking at this structure, the carbon atom connected to the hydroxyl group is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, H, and COO-CH3.\n\nTherefore, this carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule can exist in two non-superimposable mirror image forms, which are enantiomers.\n\nHence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Dimethyl fumarate:**\n\nDimethyl fumarate is a derivative of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid.\n\nIts structure consists of two double bonds in a trans configuration, connected to two carboxylic acid groups, which are then esterified with methanol.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nCH3-O-C(O)-CH=CH-C(O)-O-CH3\n\nLooking at this structure, all the carbon atoms are either part of the double bonds or are sp3 hybridized carbons in methyl groups or ester groups.\n\nNone of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. For example, the carbon in the CH=CH group is bonded to two hydrogens and one carbon, making it sp2 hybridized and not a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate does not.\n\nNow, combining parts A and B, if A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, then the correct option is B.\n\nBut earlier, I was unsure about whether cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism or not.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism, which matches option C.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if benzoquinone indeed does not show tautomerism.\n\nUpon recalling, benzoquinone is known to exist predominantly in its quinone form, and while there might be some resonance structures, it doesn't typically exist in different tautomeric forms.\n\nTherefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\nSimilarly, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nB. A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nC. A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nD. A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nSo, option C corresponds to A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which aligns with my reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nBut earlier, I was confused about whether cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism or not. Perhaps it does show some tautomerism, making A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione incorrect for part A, hence option C is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
