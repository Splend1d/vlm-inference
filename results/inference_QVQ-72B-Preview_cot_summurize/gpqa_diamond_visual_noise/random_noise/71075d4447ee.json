                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a decay process \\(X^0 \\rightarrow Y^+ Z^-\\) with a proper lifetime \\(\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}\\) seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of \\(X^0\\) is 3.41 GeV.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what is meant by \"minimum resolution\" in this context. I think it refers to the spatial resolution needed to detect the decay products, meaning how precisely we can measure the position where the decay occurs.\n\nSince this is a high-energy physics experiment in a Bubble Chamber, the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, so we have to consider relativistic effects. The proper lifetime \\(\\tau_0\\) is the lifetime in the rest frame of the \\(X^0\\) particle. To observe the decay in the laboratory frame, we need to account for time dilation.\n\nThe relationship between the proper lifetime \\(\\tau_0\\) and the lifetime in the laboratory frame \\(\\tau\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, which is:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}\\]\n\nand \\(\\beta = v/c\\), with \\(v\\) being the velocity of the particle and \\(c\\) being the speed of light.\n\nBut since we're dealing with high energies, it's more convenient to work with the particle's gamma factor \\(\\gamma\\), which is also related to its total energy \\(E\\) and rest mass \\(m_0\\) by:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m_0 c^2\\]\n\nGiven that the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV and the mass of \\(X^0\\) is 3.41 GeV, we can find \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.92\\]\n\nNow, the lifetime in the laboratory frame is:\n\n\\[\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\approx 6.336 \\times 10^{-15}\\] seconds\n\nNext, I need to find the decay length, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the laboratory frame. The decay length \\(l\\) is given by:\n\n\\[l = v \\tau\\]\n\nBut since \\(v = \\beta c\\), and \\(\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}\\), we can write:\n\n\\[l = \\beta c \\tau = c \\tau \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\gamma\\) is large (7.92), \\(\\beta\\) is very close to 1, so \\(l\\) is approximately \\(c \\tau\\), but let's calculate it precisely.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\beta\\):\n\n\\[\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.92^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{62.7264}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.0159} \\approx \\sqrt{0.9841} \\approx 0.992\\]\n\nSo, the decay length is:\n\n\\[l = 0.992 \\times c \\times 6.336 \\times 10^{-15} \\approx 0.992 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\times 6.336 \\times 10^{-15}\\]\n\n\\[l \\approx 0.992 \\times 1.9008 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\n\\[l \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\] meters\n\nBut this is the average decay length. However, we need to find the resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nIn statistics, the decay process follows an exponential distribution, so the probability that a particle decays within a distance \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/l}\\]\n\nWe want this probability to be at least 30%, so:\n\n\\[1 - e^{-x/l} \\geq 0.3\\]\n\n\\[e^{-x/l} \\leq 0.7\\]\n\n\\[-x/l \\leq \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\n\\[x \\geq -l \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\nCalculating \\(-\\ln(0.7)\\):\n\n\\[-\\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.3567\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[x \\geq 0.3567 \\times l\\]\n\n\\[x \\geq 0.3567 \\times 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\n\\[x \\geq 0.676 \\times 10^{-5}\\] meters\n\n\\[x \\geq 6.76 \\times 10^{-6}\\] meters\n\n\\[x \\geq 6.76\\ \\mu\\text{m}\\]\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this value. This suggests I might have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needed is related to the uncertainty in position needed to observe the decay path clearly enough to identify 30% of the decays.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the decay rate and the detection efficiency. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the decay length and the resolution needed to measure it accurately enough to capture 30% of the decays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needed is related to the average decay distance multiplied by some factor to ensure that 30% of the decays are observable.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me look back at the problem.\n\nThe problem mentions a table showing the percentage of reactant remaining over time, but that seems unrelated to this part of the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is meant to illustrate a decay process, and I need to relate it to the resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nTime (days): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 10, ..., 20\n\n% Reactant remaining: 100, 79, 63, 50, 40, 31, 25, 20, 10, 1\n\nThis looks like an exponential decay process. Maybe this is a similar scenario to the particle decay we're considering.\n\nIn exponential decay, the amount remaining after time \\(t\\) is:\n\n\\[N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the decay constant, related to the half-life \\(t_{1/2}\\) by \\(\\lambda = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2}\\).\n\nBut in our case, we're dealing with time in days, and percentage remaining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is just an illustration of exponential decay and isn't directly related to the Bubble Chamber resolution question.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should set aside the table for now and focus on the Bubble Chamber part.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nIf the decay length is \\(l\\), and we want to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution needs to be less than or equal to the decay length times some factor related to the 30% probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution should be comparable to the average decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm of (1 - 0.3).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of the decay path in the Bubble Chamber.\n\nIn a Bubble Chamber, particles leave tracks, and we can measure the length of these tracks to determine if a decay occurred.\n\nIf the resolution is too low, we might not be able to detect short decay paths, meaning that some decays would go undetected.\n\nSo, the resolution needed is the minimum track length that can be reliably detected, which should correspond to the decay length at which 30% of decays are observed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the resolution needed is related to the decay length such that 30% of decays occur within a certain distance from the production point, and that distance is what the resolution needs to resolve.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution needs to be less than the decay length times the natural logarithm of (1 - 0.3).\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the error function or some statistical measure to relate the resolution to the probability of observing the decay.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the decay occurs after a certain distance, and we need to detect that distance with a certain resolution.\n\nIf the decay length is \\(l\\), then to observe 30% of the decays, the resolution \\(\\delta l\\) should be such that the detectable decays are those occurring within a distance \\(\\delta l\\), and this corresponds to 30% of the total decays.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needs to be less than or equal to the decay length multiplied by the probability, i.e., \\(\\delta l \\leq l \\times 0.3\\).\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the standard deviation of the decay length distribution.\n\nIn exponential decay, the decay length follows an exponential distribution, so the standard deviation is also \\(l\\).\n\nIf we want to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps the resolution needs to be less than or equal to some multiple of the standard deviation.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates the resolution to the probability of observing a decay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needed is such that it allows us to detect decays that occur within a certain fraction of the decay length.\n\nFor example, if we can detect decays that occur within one decay length, then the probability of detecting a decay is \\(1 - e^{-1} \\approx 0.632\\), which is approximately 63.2%.\n\nBut we need 30%, so perhaps we need to adjust the resolution accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the resolution as \\(\\delta l\\), and say that we can detect decays that occur within a distance \\(\\delta l\\).\n\nThen, the probability of detecting a decay is \\(1 - e^{-\\delta l / l}\\).\n\nWe want this to be at least 0.3:\n\n\\[1 - e^{-\\delta l / l} \\geq 0.3\\]\n\n\\[e^{-\\delta l / l} \\leq 0.7\\]\n\n\\[-\\delta l / l \\leq \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq -l \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\nAs calculated earlier, \\(-\\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.3567\\), so:\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq 0.3567 \\times l\\]\n\nFrom earlier, \\(l \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\) meters, so:\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq 0.3567 \\times 1.884 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 0.676 \\times 10^{-5}\\] meters\n\n\\[ \\delta l \\geq 6.76 \\times 10^{-6}\\] meters\n\n\\[ \\delta l \\geq 6.76\\ \\mu\\text{m}\\]\n\nBut none of the provided options match this value. This suggests that my approach might be incorrect or that I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nB. 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nC. 2.08*1e-9 m\n\nD. 2.08*1e-1 m\n\nThese are 2.08 mm, 2.08 \u03bcm, 2.08 nm, and 2.08 dm, respectively.\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 6.76 \u03bcm, which is closer to option B (2.08 \u03bcm), but not exactly the same.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in calculating the decay length.\n\nLet me recalculate \\(l\\):\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}\\] s\n\n\\[\\gamma = 7.92\\]\n\n\\[\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} = 63.36 \\times 10^{-16}\\] s\n\nWait, no:\n\n\\[\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} = 63.36 \\times 10^{-16} = 6.336 \\times 10^{-15}\\] s\n\nThen, \\(v = \\beta c = 0.992 c\\), so:\n\n\\[l = v \\tau = 0.992 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\times 6.336 \\times 10^{-15}\\]\n\n\\[l = 0.992 \\times 1.9008 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\n\\[l = 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\] m\n\nBut earlier, I calculated \\(\\delta l \\geq 0.3567 \\times l = 0.3567 \\times 1.884 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.676 \\times 10^{-5}\\] m or 6.76 \u03bcm.\n\nBut option B is 2.08 \u03bcm, which is smaller than my calculation.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconsider the relationship between the resolution and the decay length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution needs to be less than or equal to the decay length divided by some factor to ensure that 30% of decays are observed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the error function to model the probability of observing the decay within a certain resolution.\n\nThe error function, erf(z), is defined as:\n\n\\[\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^z e^{-t^2} dt\\]\n\nIn statistics, the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution can be approximated using the error function.\n\nIf I assume that the decay length follows a normal distribution with mean \\(l\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), then the probability of observing a decay within a certain resolution \\(\\delta l\\) can be expressed using the error function.\n\nBut this seems too involved for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needed is simply proportional to the decay length multiplied by the square root of the probability.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that my initial calculation doesn't match the options, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between the decay length and the resolution needed to observe a certain percentage of decays.\n\nIf the resolution is \\(\\delta l\\), then the probability of observing a decay is the fraction of decays that occur within \\(\\delta l\\) from the production point.\n\nAssuming an exponential decay distribution, the probability density is \\(e^{-x/l} / l\\), so the probability of decaying within \\(\\delta l\\) is:\n\n\\[P = \\int_0^{\\delta l} \\frac{e^{-x/l}}{l} dx = 1 - e^{-\\delta l / l}\\]\n\nWe want \\(P \\geq 0.3\\), so:\n\n\\[1 - e^{-\\delta l / l} \\geq 0.3\\]\n\n\\[e^{-\\delta l / l} \\leq 0.7\\]\n\n\\[-\\delta l / l \\leq \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq -l \\ln(0.7)\\]\n\nAs before, \\(-\\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.3567\\), so:\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq 0.3567 \\times l\\]\n\nGiven \\(l \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\) m, then:\n\n\\[\\delta l \\geq 0.3567 \\times 1.884 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 0.676 \\times 10^{-5}\\] m or 6.76 \u03bcm\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the resolution needs to be better than the decay length by a certain factor to achieve 30% observation probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula or concept I should be applying here.\n\nLet me think about the Bubble Chamber's detection capabilities.\n\nIn a Bubble Chamber, the resolution is limited by the bubble formation and the ability to resolve short tracks.\n\nPerhaps the resolution needed is related to the minimum detectable track length, which could be on the order of a few micrometers.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation yielding approximately 7 \u03bcm, maybe option B (2.08 \u03bcm) is the correct answer, but my calculation is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is different from what I calculated.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \\(l\\):\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}\\] s\n\n\\[\\gamma = 7.92\\]\n\n\\[\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.92 \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} = 63.36 \\times 10^{-16} = 6.336 \\times 10^{-15}\\] s\n\nThen, \\(v = \\beta c = 0.992 c\\), so:\n\n\\[l = v \\tau = 0.992 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^8 \\times 6.336 \\times 10^{-15} = 0.992 \\times 1.9008 \\times 10^{-5} = 1.884 \\times 10^{-5}\\] m\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut then, \\(\\delta l \\geq 0.356"
