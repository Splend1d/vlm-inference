                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0\\) state, which means it's in a singlet state with orbital angular momentum \\(L=0\\). They emit a particle \\(X\\) with intrinsic parity -1 . The final NN state has isospin \\(T(N N)=0\\), and we need to determine which of the given partial waves is not permitted based on conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basics. The term symbol for the initial state is \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0\\), which indicates that the total spin \\(S=0\\) (singlet), orbital angular momentum \\(L=0\\) (S-state), and thus total angular momentum \\(J=0\\). The parity of a state is \\((-1)^L\\), so for \\(L=0\\), parity is +1 .\n\nNow, particle \\(X\\) is emitted, and it has intrinsic parity -1 . We need to consider the parity and angular momentum conservation in this emission process.\n\nThe total angular momentum conservation requires that the angular momentum of the emitted particle \\(X\\) plus the angular momentum of the final NN state equals the initial angular momentum of the NN system.\n\nGiven that the initial state has \\(J=0\\), the final state must have \\(J=J_{X}+J_{N N}\\), where \\(J_{X}\\) is the angular momentum of particle \\(X\\) and \\(J_{N N}\\) is the angular momentum of the final NN state.\n\nBut wait, in the options, we see terms like \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3, 7 \\mathrm{D} 1,3 \\mathrm{P} 0,3 \\mathrm{~S} 1\\), followed by +f or +p, which likely represent the angular momentum states of particle \\(X\\).\n\nLet's decode the options:\n\nA. \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{D} 3+\\mathrm{f}\\)\n\nB. \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 7 \\mathrm{D} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nC. \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{P} 0+\\mathrm{s}\\)\n\nD. \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{~S} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nHere, the lowercase letters probably represent the angular momentum state of particle \\(X\\): f, p, s correspond to L=3,1,0 respectively.\n\nFirst, let's consider angular momentum conservation. Since the initial state has \\(J=0\\), the vector sum of \\(J_{X}\\) and \\(J_{N N}\\) must be 0 . Therefore, \\(J_{X}+J_{N N}=0\\), meaning \\(J_{X}\\) and \\(J_{N N}\\) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but since angular momenta are vectors, their sum can only be zero if both are zero or if they are equal and opposite in direction. However, in quantum mechanics, angular momenta are quantized, so their magnitudes are fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of possible angular momentum couplings.\n\nLet's consider the final NN state and the emitted particle \\(X\\).\n\nThe final NN state has \\(T(N N)=0\\), which means it's an isosinglet state.\n\nWe also have Pauli statistics imposing a condition: \\(T(N N)=S(N N)+L(N N)+1(\\bmod 2)\\).\n\nGiven \\(T(N N)=0\\), then \\(S(N N)+L(N N)+1\\) must be even, so \\(S(N N)+L(N N)\\) must be odd.\n\nNow, in the options, we have term symbols for the final NN state and the particle \\(X\\).\n\nLet's analyze each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{D} 3+\\mathrm{f}\\)\n\nHere, \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3\\) likely refers to the final NN state with \\(2 S+1=3\\) (triplet), \\(L=2\\) (D), and \\(J=3\\).\n\nThe particle \\(X\\) is in an f-state, which is \\(L=3\\).\n\nNow, the total angular momentum conservation: initial \\(J=0\\), so final \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=0\\). But \\(J_{N N}=3\\) and \\(J_{X}=3\\) (since L=3 for f-state, and assuming spin is coupled appropriately). So their vector sum could be from \\(|3-3|=0\\) to \\(3+3=6\\), but not zero. So this seems forbidden by angular momentum conservation.\n\nWait, but maybe the spins are coupled differently. Need to consider both orbital and spin angular momenta.\n\nIn the NN system, for the final state \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3\\), total spin \\(S=1\\) (triplet), orbital \\(L=2\\), total angular momentum \\(J=3\\).\n\nFor particle \\(X\\), if it's in an f-state, \\(L=3\\), and assuming it has some spin, need to know its total angular momentum \\(J_{X}\\).\n\nAssuming particle \\(X\\) is a fermion, it has spin \\(1 / 2\\), so total \\(J_{X}=L+S=3+1 / 2=7 / 2\\) or \\(3-1 / 2=5 / 2\\).\n\nBut in the option, it's written as \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3+\\mathrm{f}\\), which might imply \\(J_{X}=3\\) (f-state), but need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is ambiguous. Maybe the lowercase letter indicates the type of wave, i.e., f-wave corresponds to \\(L=3\\), and the uppercase letter before the plus sign represents the final NN state.\n\nSo, in option A, \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3\\) is the final NN state, and \\(f\\) is the emitted particle \\(X\\), which is an f-wave, \\(L=3\\).\n\nGiven that, the total angular momentum of \\(X\\) would be \\(J_{X}=L+S\\), where \\(L=3\\), and \\(S\\) depends on the particle.\n\nAssuming \\(X\\) is a fermion with spin \\(1 / 2\\), then \\(J_{X}=3+1 / 2=7 / 2\\) or \\(3-1 / 2=5 / 2\\).\n\nNow, the initial state has \\(J=0\\), so \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=0\\). But \\(J_{N N}=3\\) and \\(J_{X}=7 / 2\\) or \\(5 / 2\\), their sum cannot be zero. So this transition seems forbidden by angular momentum conservation.\n\nBut maybe particle \\(X\\) has different spin or angular momentum.\n\nNeed to consider parity conservation as well.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is +1 (since \\(L=0\\) ).\n\nThe parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of particle \\(X\\).\n\nGiven that particle \\(X\\) has intrinsic parity -1 , and its orbital parity is \\((-1)^{L_{X}}\\), where \\(L_{X}\\) is the orbital angular momentum of \\(X\\).\n\nIn option A, \\(X\\) is in an f-state, \\(L_{X}=3\\), so parity of \\(X\\) is \\((-1)^{3}=-1\\), plus intrinsic parity -1, so total parity of \\(X\\) is +1.\n\nThe final NN state is \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3\\), which has \\(L=2\\), parity \\((-1)^{2}=+1\\), and spin \\(S=1\\), which doesn't affect parity.\n\nSo total parity of the final state is +1.\n\nTherefore, parity of the initial state (+1) equals parity of the final state (+1), so parity is conserved.\n\nBut angular momentum conservation seems to be violated, as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of the entire final state, including particle \\(X\\).\n\nThe parity of the final state would be parity of NN state times parity of \\(X\\).\n\nGiven NN state parity +1 (from \\(L=2\\)), and \\(X\\) parity +1 (from \\(L_{X}=3\\) and intrinsic parity -1 ), so overall parity is +1 * +1 = +1, matching the initial parity of +1.\n\nSo parity is conserved.\n\nBut angular momentum conservation seems problematic.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the angular momentum of the final state is the sum of the angular momentum of NN and \\(X\\), so \\(J_{\\text {final }}=J_{N N}+J_{X}\\), and this should equal the initial \\(J=0\\).\n\nBut in option A, \\(J_{N N}=3\\) and \\(J_{X}=7 / 2\\) or \\(5 / 2\\), so their sum is not zero.\n\nTherefore, this transition is forbidden by angular momentum conservation.\n\nSo option A is not permitted.\n\nBut let's check the other options to confirm.\n\nOption B: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 7 \\mathrm{D} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nHere, \\(7 \\mathrm{D} 1\\) likely refers to the final NN state with \\(2 S+1=7\\) (septet?), but usually for nucleons, only singlet and triplet states are common. Maybe it's a higher spin state.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is different here. Maybe \\(7 \\mathrm{D} 1\\) means \\(L=2\\) (D), and \\(J=1\\), with multiplicity 7, which might correspond to a higher spin state.\n\nBut for nucleons, the total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). Wait, perhaps this is referring to a state with higher spin, but that seems unlikely for two nucleons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it should be \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 1\\), which is a common notation for triplet D state with \\(J=1\\).\n\nAssuming that, then \\(J_{N N}=1\\), and \\(X\\) is in a p-wave, \\(L_{X}=1\\).\n\nAssuming \\(X\\) is a fermion with spin \\(1 / 2\\), then \\(J_{X}=1+1 / 2=3 / 2\\) or \\(1-1 / 2=1 / 2\\).\n\nNow, \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=1+(3 / 2)=5 / 2\\) or \\(1+(1 / 2)=3 / 2\\), neither of which equals the initial \\(J=0\\). So angular momentum conservation is violated here as well.\n\nTherefore, option B is also forbidden by angular momentum conservation.\n\nOption C: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{P} 0+\\mathrm{s}\\)\n\nHere, \\(3 \\mathrm{P} 0\\) is the final NN state with \\(2 S+1=3\\) (triplet), \\(L=1\\) (P), and \\(J=0\\).\n\nParticle \\(X\\) is in an s-wave, \\(L_{X}=0\\).\n\nAssuming \\(X\\) is a fermion with spin \\(1 / 2\\), then \\(J_{X}=0+1 / 2=1 / 2\\).\n\nNow, \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=0+1 / 2=1 / 2\\), which does not equal the initial \\(J=0\\). So angular momentum conservation is violated here too.\n\nOption D: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{~S} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nHere, \\(3 \\mathrm{~S} 1\\) is the final NN state with \\(2 S+1=3\\) (triplet), \\(L=0\\) (S), and \\(J=1\\).\n\nParticle \\(X\\) is in a p-wave, \\(L_{X}=1\\).\n\nAssuming \\(X\\) is a fermion with spin \\(1 / 2\\), then \\(J_{X}=1+1 / 2=3 / 2\\) or \\(1-1 / 2=1 / 2\\).\n\nNow, \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=1+3 / 2=5 / 2\\) or \\(1+1 / 2=3 / 2\\), neither of which equals the initial \\(J=0\\). So angular momentum conservation is violated here as well.\n\nTherefore, all options seem to violate angular momentum conservation. But the question asks which one is not permitted based on conservation of both angular momentum and parity.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe particle \\(X\\) has different spin or angular momentum properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are written in a specific notation that I'm misinterpreting.\n\nLet me look back at the question. It says: \"Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?\"\n\nSo, the lowercase letter indicates the angular momentum state of particle \\(X\\), which is likely its orbital angular momentum.\n\nGiven that, and considering the term symbols for the final NN state, perhaps I need to consider the parity and angular momentum conservation more carefully.\n\nLet me try to summarize:\n\n- Initial state: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0\\), \\(J=0\\), parity +1.\n\n- Final state: NN state with certain \\(J\\), plus particle \\(X\\) with certain \\(L\\) and parity.\n\n- Parity conservation: parity_initial = parity_final.\n\n- Angular momentum conservation: \\(J_{\\text {initial }}=J_{N N}+J_{X}=0\\).\n\nGiven that, in all options, \\(J_{N N}+J_{X} \\neq 0\\), so all should be forbidden.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in assuming \\(J_{X}\\) for particle \\(X\\).\n\nMaybe particle \\(X\\) is a boson, not a fermion, which would change its spin.\n\nIf \\(X\\) is a boson, it has integer spin, say spin 0,1 , or 2.\n\nFor example, if \\(X\\) is a pion, which is a boson with spin 0, then for an s-wave, \\(L_{X}=0\\), and total \\(J_{X}=0+0=0\\).\n\nThen, in option C: \\(3 \\mathrm{P} 0+\\mathrm{s}\\), \\(J_{N N}=0\\) (from \\(3 \\mathrm{P} 0\\) ), \\(J_{X}=0\\) (from s-wave with spin 0), so \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=0+0=0\\), which matches the initial \\(J=0\\). So this satisfies both angular momentum and parity conservation.\n\nLet's check parity for option C:\n\nInitial parity: +1.\n\nFinal NN state: \\(3 \\mathrm{P} 0\\), \\(L=1\\), parity \\((-1)^{1}=-1\\), spin \\(S=1\\) (triplet), parity -1.\n\nParticle \\(X\\) in s-wave, \\(L_{X}=0\\), parity \\((-1)^{0}=+1\\), intrinsic parity -1 (given), so total parity of \\(X\\) is -1.\n\nTherefore, total parity of final state is (-1) * (-1) = +1, matching the initial parity of +1.\n\nSo option C seems permitted.\n\nLet's check option A again with \\(X\\) as a boson.\n\nOption A: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{D} 3+\\mathrm{f}\\)\n\nFinal NN state: \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 3\\), \\(J_{N N}=3\\), parity \\((-1)^{2}=+1\\), spin \\(S=1\\) (triplet), parity +1.\n\nParticle \\(X\\) in f-wave, \\(L_{X}=3\\), parity \\((-1)^{3}=-1\\), intrinsic parity -1, so total parity of \\(X\\) is +1.\n\nTherefore, total parity of final state is (+1) * (+1) = +1, matching initial parity.\n\nBut angular momentum: \\(J_{N N}=3\\), \\(J_{X}=0\\) if \\(X\\) is a boson with spin 0, so \\(J_{N N}+J_{X}=3+0=3 \\neq 0\\). So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nTherefore, option A is forbidden.\n\nOption B: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 7 \\mathrm{D} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nAssuming \\(7 \\mathrm{D} 1\\) is a typo and should be \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 1\\), which is a triplet D state with \\(J=1\\).\n\nFinal NN state: \\(3 \\mathrm{D} 1\\), \\(J_{N N}=1\\), parity \\((-1)^{2}=+1\\), spin \\(S=1\\), parity +1.\n\nParticle \\(X\\) in p-wave, \\(L_{X}=1\\), parity \\((-1)^{1}=-1\\), intrinsic parity -1, total parity of \\(X\\) is +1.\n\nTotal parity of final state: (+1) * (+1) = +1, matching initial parity.\n\nBut angular momentum: \\(J_{N N}=1\\), \\(J_{X}=0\\) (if \\(X\\) is a boson with spin 0), so \\(1+0=1 \\neq 0\\). So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nTherefore, option B is also forbidden.\n\nOption D: \\(1 \\mathrm{~S} 0 \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{~S} 1+\\mathrm{p}\\)\n\nFinal NN state: \\(3 \\mathrm{~S} 1\\), \\(J_{N N}=1\\), parity \\((-1)^{0}=+1\\), spin \\(S=1\\), parity +1.\n\nParticle \\(X\\) in p-wave, \\(L_{X}=1\\), parity \\((-1)^{1}=-1\\), intrinsic parity -1, total parity of \\(X\\) is +1.\n\nTotal parity of final state: (+1) * (+1) = +1, matching initial parity.\n\nAngular momentum: \\(J_{N N}=1\\), \\(J_{X}=0\\), so \\(1+0=1 \\neq 0\\). So angular momentum not conserved.\n\nTherefore, option D is also forbidden.\n\nSo, among the given options"
