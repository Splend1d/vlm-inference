                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I have this meson resonance called X, and I need to find its mean decay distance. I'm given the production energy (E_X = 8 GeV), the mass (m_X = 1.2 GeV), and the width (\u0393_X = 320 MeV). The options are in scientific notation, so I need to be careful with the units and the calculations.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the mean decay distance is. I think it's related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Specifically, the mean decay distance should be the product of the particle's velocity and its mean lifetime before it decays.\n\nSo, mean decay distance = velocity \u00d7 mean lifetime.\n\nI know that the mean lifetime (\u03c4) can be related to the width (\u0393) by the equation:\n\n\u03c4 = 1 / (\u0393 * h)\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant.\n\nBut wait, in particle physics, often people use natural units where \u0127 = c = 1. So, maybe I don't need to worry about including h explicitly if I'm consistent with units.\n\nGiven that, \u03c4 = 1 / \u0393.\n\nBut I should confirm that.\n\nLooking it up, in natural units, the relation is indeed \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * \u0393), but sometimes it's \u03c4 = 1 / \u0393, depending on the convention. To be safe, I'll use \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * \u0393).\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * 320 MeV).\n\nBut I need to make sure about the units here. The width \u0393 has units of energy, but time is inversely proportional to energy in natural units.\n\nNow, for the velocity. I have the production energy and the mass. The production energy is E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. Assuming this is the total energy, then the kinetic energy is E_kin = E_X - m_X = 8 GeV - 1.2 GeV = 6.8 GeV.\n\nIn natural units, velocity v can be related to kinetic energy through v^2 = 2 * E_kin / m_X.\n\nWait, in natural units where c=1, kinetic energy is \u03b3 m c^2 - m c^2, and v = \u03b2 c, where \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should use relativistic relations more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in natural units, v = p / E, where p is momentum and E is total energy.\n\nBut I need p for that. Since E^2 = p^2 + m^2, then p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2).\n\nGiven E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, then p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) GeV.\n\nSo, p \u2248 7.91 GeV.\n\nThen, v = p / E = 7.91 GeV / 8 GeV \u2248 0.98875.\n\nNow, the mean decay distance is v * \u03c4.\n\nWe have \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * \u0393) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 320 MeV).\n\nBut wait, \u0393 has units of energy, and \u03c4 should have units of time. In natural units, energy and time are related inversely, with a factor of \u0127, but since \u0127 = 1, \u03c4 has units of seconds.\n\nSimilarly, velocity is dimensionless in natural units (since c=1), and distance is in units of length.\n\nWait, in natural units, distances are often expressed in terms of inverse mass or inverse energy.\n\nBut the options are in meters, so I need to convert from natural units to SI units.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between natural units and SI units for time and distance.\n\nI know that in particle physics, distances are often given in terms of femtometers (fm), where 1 fm = 10^-15 m.\n\nAlso, in natural units, \u0127 = c = 1, so I need to restore \u0127 and c to find the correct conversion factors.\n\nLet's recall that in natural units:\n\n1 GeV^-1 = \u0127 / c * 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 (6.58 \u00d7 10^-16 eV s) / (1 GeV * 2.99792458 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) \u2248 2.067 \u00d7 10^-28 m.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, to convert time in GeV^-1 to seconds, it's t = \u03c4 / (\u0127 c), but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the conversion factor between GeV^-1 and meters.\n\nI recall that 1 GeV^-1 corresponds to approximately 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nGiven that \u0127 = 6.582119569 \u00d7 10^-16 eV s, and c = 2.99792458 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, then 1 GeV^-1 = (6.582119569 \u00d7 10^-16 eV s) / (1 GeV * 2.99792458 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) \u2248 2.1987 \u00d7 10^-28 m.\n\nHmm, that seems too small. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation that 1 GeV corresponds to a length scale of about 0.20676 fm, which is 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nBut that's for mass or energy scales, not necessarily for time.\n\nWait, in natural units, time is inversely proportional to energy, so \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393), and since \u0393 is in GeV, \u03c4 is in GeV^-1, which corresponds to femtoseconds or something similar.\n\nActually, I think I need to find a consistent way to handle units here.\n\nLet me try to compute \u03c4 first in natural units and then convert to SI units.\n\nGiven \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393), with \u0393 = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * 0.32 GeV) \u2248 1 / 1.0053 GeV \u2248 0.9947 GeV^-1.\n\nNow, to convert \u03c4 from GeV^-1 to seconds, I use \u03c4 = \u03c4 / (\u0127 c), where \u0127 c \u2248 197.327 eV m.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, to convert from GeV^-1 to seconds, I should use \u03c4 = \u03c4 * \u0127 / c, but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the conversion factor between GeV^-1 and seconds.\n\nI find that 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.6582 \u00d7 10^-24 s.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, \u03c4 \u2248 0.9947 GeV^-1 * 0.6582 \u00d7 10^-24 s/GeV^-1 \u2248 0.655 \u00d7 10^-24 s.\n\nNow, velocity v \u2248 0.98875, which is dimensionless.\n\nThen, the mean decay distance in natural units is v * \u03c4 \u2248 0.98875 * 0.655 \u00d7 10^-24 m.\n\nWait, but \u03c4 is in seconds, and v is dimensionless, so the product should be in meters.\n\nBut I need to convert \u03c4 to meters, not keep it in seconds.\n\nI think I need to find a consistent unit for \u03c4 in meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the decay length in natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nIn natural units, the decay length is indeed v * \u03c4.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that in natural units, distances are in terms of inverse mass or energy, I need to convert back to SI units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation that the decay length l = (\u0127 / m) * (E / p), but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, another approach: in relativistic particles, the mean decay length is given by l = \u03b3 * v * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can use that formula.\n\nFirst, find \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2).\n\nWe have v \u2248 0.98875, so \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.98875^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9775) = 1 / sqrt(0.0225) = 1 / 0.15 = 6.666...\n\nThen, l = \u03b3 * v * \u03c4.\n\nBut I need \u03c4 in seconds to compute l in meters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use l = (\u0127 / m) * (E / p), but I need to verify that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates the decay length to the particle's properties.\n\nI recall that in particle physics, the decay length is often given by l = (\u0127 / m) * (E / p), but I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps l = (\u0127 / p) * ln(\u03b3), but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since the width \u0393 is related to the lifetime \u03c4, and the velocity is known, perhaps I can use the relation l = v * \u03c4.\n\nGiven that \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393), and v = p / E, then l = v * \u03c4 = (p / E) / (\u03c0 \u0393).\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of measurable quantities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relation l = \u0127 * \u03b3 / (\u03c0 * m * \u0393), but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look up the formula for the mean decay length in particle physics.\n\nAfter some research, I find that the mean decay length is indeed given by l = \u03b3 * v * \u03c4, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nGiven that, I need to compute \u03b3, v, and \u03c4.\n\nWe have:\n\nv \u2248 0.98875 (from p / E = 7.91 GeV / 8 GeV \u2248 0.98875)\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2) \u2248 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.98875^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9775) = 1 / sqrt(0.0225) = 1 / 0.15 \u2248 6.666...\n\n\u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 320 MeV) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 0.32 GeV) \u2248 1 / 1.0053 GeV \u2248 0.9947 GeV^-1\n\nNow, to convert \u03c4 to seconds, use \u03c4 = \u03c4 * \u0127 / m c^2, but I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute l in natural units and then convert to meters.\n\nIn natural units, l = \u03b3 * v * \u03c4 \u2248 6.666... * 0.98875 * 0.9947 GeV^-1\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \u03b3 * v \u2248 6.666... * 0.98875 \u2248 6.599\n\nThen, l \u2248 6.599 * 0.9947 GeV^-1 \u2248 6.57 GeV^-1\n\nNow, to convert GeV^-1 to meters, use 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.20676 fm = 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nSo, l \u2248 6.57 * 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m \u2248 1.36 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nOption A is 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-16 m, option B is 5.0223 \u00d7 10^-16 m, option C is 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m, and option D is 5.0223 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the conversion factor between GeV^-1 and meters.\n\nI found that 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.20676 fm = 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that \u03c4 is in GeV^-1, and l is in GeV^-1 as well, but I need to relate it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay length is given by l = \u0127 * \u03b3 / (m * \u0393), but I need to check that.\n\nWait, another approach: in particle physics, the decay length is often given by l = (\u0127 c) / (m c^2 * \u0393), but I need to verify that.\n\nLet me try to derive the formula properly.\n\nThe proper lifetime \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393), but sometimes it's \u03c4 = 1 / \u0393, depending on the convention.\n\nIn any case, the mean decay length in the particle's rest frame is c * \u03c4.\n\nIn the lab frame, the particle is moving with velocity v, so the decay length is increased by the Lorentz factor \u03b3: l = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4.\n\nGiven that, perhaps l = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4.\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the given quantities.\n\nGiven that, l = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4, where \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393) or \u03c4 = 1 / \u0393.\n\nWait, I need to confirm the relationship between \u03c4 and \u0393.\n\nUpon checking, the relation is \u03c4 = h / (\u03c0 \u0393), where h is Planck's constant.\n\nIn natural units where h = 1, then \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393).\n\nBut sometimes, people use \u03c4 = 1 / \u0393 as well, so I need to be careful.\n\nLet me look up the exact relation.\n\nI find that the lifetime \u03c4 is indeed \u03c4 = h / (\u03c0 \u0393), so in natural units, \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393).\n\nGiven that, \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * 320 MeV) = 1 / (\u03c0 * 0.32 GeV) \u2248 1 / 1.0053 GeV \u2248 0.9947 GeV^-1.\n\nNow, \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2) \u2248 6.666..., and c = 1 in natural units.\n\nTherefore, l = \u03b3 * c * \u03c4 \u2248 6.666... * 1 * 0.9947 GeV^-1 \u2248 6.63 GeV^-1.\n\nNow, to convert GeV^-1 to meters, use 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.20676 fm = 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nThus, l \u2248 6.63 * 0.20676 \u00d7 10^-15 m \u2248 1.37 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nOption A is 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-16 m, option B is 5.0223 \u00d7 10^-16 m, option C is 4.0655 \u00d7 10^-15 m, and option D is 5.0223 \u00d7 10^-15 m.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the conversion factor.\n\nLet me verify the conversion from GeV^-1 to meters.\n\nI know that 1 GeV = 1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-10 J, since 1 eV = 1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nThen, 1 GeV^-1 = h / (1 GeV) = (6.62607015 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) / (1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-10 J) \u2248 4.134 \u00d7 10^-24 s.\n\nBut I need distance, not time.\n\nAlternatively, in natural units, distances are in terms of inverse mass or energy, so 1 GeV^-1 corresponds to a length scale of \u0127 / m c^2, but m is in GeV as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the Compton wavelength.\n\nThe Compton wavelength of a particle is \u03bb = h / (m c), which in natural units is \u03bb = 1 / m.\n\nGiven that, 1 GeV^-1 corresponds to \u03bb = \u0127 / (m c) = (\u0127 c) / (m c^2), where m is in GeV.\n\nGiven that, 1 GeV^-1 = (\u0127 c) / (1 GeV) \u2248 (1.973262 \u00d7 10^-14 eV m) / (1 GeV) \u2248 1.973262 \u00d7 10^-24 m.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake here. Maybe I should look up the exact conversion factor between GeV^-1 and meters.\n\nUpon checking, I find that 1 GeV^-1 \u2248 0.6582 \u00d7 10^-24 s, which is time, not distance.\n\nBut I need distance, so perhaps I need to use the relation l = \u03b2 c \u03c4, where \u03b2 = v / c.\n\nGiven that, l = \u03b2 c \u03c4, and \u03c4 is in seconds.\n\nGiven that \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 \u0393), and \u0393 is in GeV, I need to convert \u03c4 to seconds.\n\nUsing \u03c4 = 1 / (\u03c0 * 0.32 GeV) \u2248 1 / 1.0053 GeV \u2248 0.9947 GeV^-1.\n\n"
