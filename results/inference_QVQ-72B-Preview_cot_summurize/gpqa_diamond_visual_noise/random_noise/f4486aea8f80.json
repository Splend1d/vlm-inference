                    "text": "Let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. The task is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield, and we have to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Organic synthesis can be tricky, but if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. From the name, it's a substituted benzene ring with a tert-butyl group at the 2-position, an ethoxy group at the 1-position, and a nitro group at the 3-position. So, starting from benzene, I need to introduce these substituents in the correct positions.\n\nBenzene is symmetric, so the first substitution should be one that can be controlled to introduce one substituent first, and then the others in specific positions relative to the first substituent.\n\nLooking at the options, they all involve various electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, which are common in benzene derivatives. These include Friedel-Crafts alkylation, nitration, sulfonation, and diazonium salt reactions.\n\nLet's consider the sequence step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Introducing the tert-butyl group**\n\nFriedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 will introduce the tert-butyl group into benzene. This reaction typically favors the formation of para-substituted products, but without steric hindrance, some ortho-substitution might also occur. However, for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that the tert-butyl group is introduced at the desired position.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing the nitro group**\n\nNitration with HNO3 and H2SO4 will introduce the nitro group. If the tert-butyl group is already present, it will direct the nitro group to the ortho and para positions relative to the tert-butyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Reducing the nitro group**\n\nUsing Fe and HCl, I can reduce the nitro group to an amino group. This step is necessary to introduce functionality that can be further manipulated.\n\n**Step 4: Introducing the ethoxy group**\n\nThis might involve converting the amino group into a diazonium salt and then performing a coupling reaction or some other transformation to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nLet's look more closely at the options:\n\n**Option A:**\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3\n\nii) HNO3/H2SO4\n\niii) Fe/HCl\n\niv) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nv) NaNO2/HCl\n\nvi) H3O+, H2O/Heat\n\nvii) NaOH/EtBr\n\nviii) SO3/H2SO4\n\nix) dilute H2SO4\n\nThis sequence starts by introducing the tert-butyl group, then nitration, reduction to amino, another nitration, diazoniation, hydrolysis, reaction with NaOH and EtBr, sulfonation, and finally treating with dilute H2SO4. It seems a bit involved, but perhaps it leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option B:**\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3\n\nii) SO3/H2SO4\n\niii) HNO3/H2SO4\n\niv) Fe/HCl\n\nv) NaNO2/HCl\n\nvi) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nvii) H3O+, H2O/Heat\n\nviii) dilute H2SO4\n\nix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nSimilar to option A, but introduces sulfonic acid group before nitration. Sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivators and direct subsequent substitutions to the meta position. This might not be desirable for directing the substituents to the correct positions.\n\n**Option C:**\n\ni) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nii) Fe/HCl\n\niii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3\n\niv) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nv) NaNO2/HCl\n\nvi) SO3/H2SO4\n\nvii) dilute H2SO4\n\nviii) H3O+, H2O/Heat\n\nix) NaOH/EtBr\n\nThis option starts with nitration, reduces the nitro group to amino, then introduces tert-butyl group, another nitration, diazoniation, sulfonation, treating with dilute H2SO4, hydrolysis, and finally reaction with NaOH and EtBr. The sequence is different, but it might still lead to the desired product.\n\n**Option D:**\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3\n\nii) HNO3/H2SO4\n\niii) SO3/H2SO4\n\niv) NaNO2/HCl\n\nv) dilute H2SO4\n\nvi) H3O+, H2O/Heat\n\nvii) NaOH/EtBr\n\nviii) Fe/HCl\n\nix) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nThis sequence introduces tert-butyl, nitro, sulfonic acid, diazoniation, treating with dilute H2SO4, hydrolysis, reaction with NaOH and EtBr, reducing another nitro group, and finally another nitration. It's quite different from the others.\n\nNow, I need to think about which sequence would most efficiently lead to 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n\nLet me try to sketch the intermediate steps for one of the options to see how it progresses.\n\n**Taking Option A:**\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 \u2192 introduces tert-butyl group at para position (let's say para for simplicity)\n\nii) HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 nitration at ortho and para to tert-butyl; since para position is already occupied, it will nitrate at ortho position\n\niii) Fe/HCl \u2192 reduce nitro to amino group\n\niv) HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 nitration again, but now there are amino and tert-butyl groups; amino group directs to ortho and para, tert-butyl to ortho and para; need to see where the nitro group goes\n\nv) NaNO2/HCl \u2192 diazoniation of amino group\n\nvi) H3O+, H2O/Heat \u2192 hydrolysis of diazonium salt; might lead to loss of the amino group or some other reaction\n\nvii) NaOH/EtBr \u2192 reaction with ethyl bromide in basic conditions; possibly Williamson ether synthesis to introduce ethoxy group\n\nviii) SO3/H2SO4 \u2192 sulfonation\n\nix) dilute H2SO4 \u2192 possibly deprotecting or modifying the sulfonic acid group\n\nThis seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it directly leads to the desired product.\n\n**Alternative approach:**\n\nPerhaps it's better to introduce the tert-butyl group first, then nitrate, then introduce the ethoxy group selectively.\n\nBut introducing the ethoxy group directly might not be straightforward. Maybe I need to introduce a hydroxyl group first and then etherify it with ethyl bromide.\n\nLet's consider introducing a nitro group first, reduce it to amino, convert amino to hydroxyl via diazoniation and nucleophilic substitution, and then etherify with ethyl bromide.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the substituents are in the correct positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can introduce the tert-butyl group first, then nitrate, and then introduce the ethoxy group by some other means.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n**Retrosynthetic analysis:**\n\nStarting from 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, I can think of removing the ethoxy group to get 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol or something similar.\n\nBut that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ethoxy group is at the 1-position, and the nitro at 3-position, with tert-butyl at 2-position.\n\nPerhaps I can introduce the tert-butyl group first, then nitrate at the ortho position (position 3), and then introduce the ethoxy group at position 1.\n\nTo introduce the ethoxy group, I might need a phenol or some other functionality that can be etherified.\n\nSo, maybe after introducing the tert-butyl and nitro groups, I can reduce the nitro to amino, convert amino to hydroxyl via diazoniation, and then etherify with ethyl bromide.\n\nLet's try to outline this sequence:\n\n1. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 \u2192 para-tert-butylbenzene\n\n2. HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 2-(tert-butyl)-nitrobenzene (nitro at ortho to tert-butyl)\n\n3. Fe/HCl \u2192 2-(tert-butyl)aniline\n\n4. NaNO2/HCl \u2192 diazonium salt of 2-(tert-butyl)aniline\n\n5. CuCN or some other coupling reaction to introduce the desired substituent\n\nWait, maybe instead of diazoniation, I can perform a Ullmann condensation or some other method to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can introduce the ethoxy group early on, say on benzene itself, and then introduce the other substituents.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n1. Benzene + EtBr/NaOH \u2192 ethoxybenzene (anisole)\n\n2. tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 \u2192 para-tert-butyl-ethoxybenzene\n\n3. HNO3/H2SO4 \u2192 nitrate at ortho to tert-butyl or ethoxy\n\nBut this might not give the desired substitution pattern.\n\n**Another approach:**\n\nPerhaps I can introduce the tert-butyl group first, then nitrate, then introduce the ethoxy group via some reaction that allows selective introduction at the desired position.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A seems to follow a similar logic:\n\n- Introduce tert-butyl\n\n- Nitrate\n\n- Reduce nitro to amino\n\n- Nitrate again\n\n- Diazoniate\n\n- Hydrolyze\n\n- Introduce ethoxy group\n\n- Sulfonate\n\n- Treat with dilute H2SO4\n\nThis seems like a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if the sulfonation and subsequent treatments are necessary for this specific synthesis.\n\nMaybe the sulfonation is a protective group or something, but it's not clear.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n- Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene\n\n- Reduce to aniline\n\n- Introduce tert-butyl group\n\n- Nitrate again\n\n- Diazoniate\n\n- Sulfonate\n\n- Treat with dilute H2SO4\n\n- Hydrolyze\n\n- Introduce ethoxy group\n\nThis also seems involved, and I'm not sure if it leads directly to the desired product.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n- Introduce tert-butyl group\n\n- Sulfonate\n\n- Nitrate\n\n- Reduce nitro to amino\n\n- Diazoniate\n\n- Nitrate again\n\n- Hydrolyze\n\n- Treat with dilute H2SO4\n\n- Introduce ethoxy group\n\nAgain, similar to the others, but with sulfonation before nitration.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n- Introduce tert-butyl group\n\n- Nitrate\n\n- Sulfonate\n\n- Diazoniate\n\n- Treat with dilute H2SO4\n\n- Hydrolyze\n\n- Introduce ethoxy group\n\n- Reduce another nitro group\n\n- Nitrate again\n\nThis seems to have extra steps, like reducing another nitro group and nitrating again.\n\nGiven all this, I need to think about which sequence minimizes side reactions and leads directly to the desired product.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to start with introducing the tert-butyl group, then nitrate, reduce to amino, and then introduce the ethoxy group via diazoniation and nucleophilic substitution.\n\nLooking at option A, it seems to follow this logic, although it has additional steps like another nitration and sulfonation.\n\nBut maybe those steps are necessary to protect certain groups or to direct the substitution patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis after having the hydroxyl group in place.\n\nIn that case, I need to have a phenol with the correct substitution pattern before etherifying with ethyl bromide.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has a step involving NaOH and EtBr, which could be the Williamson ether synthesis to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the correct sequence.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the intermediate steps lead to the desired functionalities in the correct positions.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming for this format. Maybe I should look for a similar synthesis in a textbook or online to get a better understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can eliminate some options based on logical inconsistencies.\n\nFor example, in option B, sulfonating benzene first might not be desirable because the sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivator and directs subsequent substitutions to the meta position, which might not align with the desired substitution pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, starting with nitration and then reducing to amino, which directs meta substitution, again possibly leading to incorrect positioning of subsequent substituents.\n\nOption D also includes sulfonation and multiple nitration steps, which might complicate the substitution pattern.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most straightforward, introducing the tert-butyl group first, then nitrating, reducing to amino, and then proceeding with diazoniation and nucleophilic substitution to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nHence, the answer is likely option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
