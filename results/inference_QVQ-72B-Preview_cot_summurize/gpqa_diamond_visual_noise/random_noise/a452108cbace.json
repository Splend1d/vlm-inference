                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let's see, we have two stars that are identical in mass, similar to our Sun, and each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. These planets are in circular orbits, which might simplify things.\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method is used to detect these planets by observing the wobble of the star caused by the planet's gravity. The wobble causes a shift in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. So, the periodic shift in the wavelength of a spectral line indicates the presence of a planet and gives us information about its orbit.\n\nFor planet #1, there's a periodic shift of up to 5 milliangstroms in a spectral line. For planet #2, the shift is 7 milliangstroms. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.\n\nFirst, I should recall the relationship between the radial velocity shift and the orbital period. In the RV method, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K) is related to the planet's mass and orbital period.\n\nThe formula for the semi-amplitude is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P \\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period\n\n- \\( e \\) is the eccentricity of the orbit\n\nSince both orbits are circular, \\( e = 0 \\), which simplifies the formula to:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut since the orbits are circular and presumably face-on (or we're not given inclination), maybe this simplifies further.\n\nWait, actually, the wavelength shift corresponds to the radial velocity shift. So, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is proportional to the radial velocity amplitude K.\n\nGiven that, if a spectral line shifts by up to 5 miliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 miliangstroms for planet #2, I can relate these shifts to their radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nBut I need to relate this to the orbital periods.\n\nLet me think about Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G (M + m)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis\n\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the star\n\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the planet\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant\n\nSince both stars have the same mass M and both planets have similar masses m (Neptune-like), this equation should apply similarly to both systems.\n\nBut I need to relate the radial velocity shift to the orbital period.\n\nI recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\left( \\frac{m \\sin i}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nGiven that both orbits are circular and presumably face-on (sin i = 1), and both planets have the same mass, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\]\n\nBut from Kepler's third law, \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\), so:\n\n\\[ K \\propto P^{2/3 - 1} = P^{-1/3} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem directly helpful. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, from the radial velocity equation, K is also related to the mass of the planet and the mass of the star:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\left( \\frac{m}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nBut since a = (G M P^2 / (4 pi^2))^{1/3}, substituting back:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}}{P} \\left( \\frac{m}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ K = \\left( \\frac{G m}{4 \\pi} \\right)^{1/3} P^{-1/3} \\]\n\nSo, K is proportional to P^{-1/3}\n\nTherefore, if I have two planets with the same m and M, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSo, taking logs:\n\n\\[ \\log \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\log \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right) \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\log \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right) = 3 \\log \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nBut K is proportional to the radial velocity amplitude, which is related to the wavelength shift.\n\nIf the wavelength shift is proportional to K, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{\\text{shift}_1}{\\text{shift}_2} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nGiven that shift_1 = 5 miliangstroms and shift_2 = 7 miliangstroms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\left( 0.714 \\right)^3 \\approx 0.357 \\]\n\nSo, P_2 is approximately 0.357 times P_1, which would correspond to option D. ~0.36.\n\nBut wait, the question is \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which implies P_2 / P_1.\n\nGiven that, if P_2 / P_1 = 0.357, that means P_2 is 0.357 times P_1, which is shorter, not longer.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to take the reciprocal.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nIf P_2 / P_1 = 0.357, that means P_2 is 0.357 times P_1, which means P_2 is shorter than P_1. But the question asks how many times longer P_2 is than P_1.\n\nSo, P_2 is 0.357 times P_1, which is the same as P_1 being approximately 2.8 times longer than P_2, but that's not what's being asked.\n\nWait, no. If P_2 is 0.357 times P_1, then P_2 is shorter than P_1, so it's not longer. Maybe I need to interpret this correctly.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the relationship between K and P.\n\nLet me revisit the relationship.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G (M + m)} \\]\n\nAssuming M >> m, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G M} \\]\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\left( \\frac{m}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nAgain, assuming sin i = 1 and m is the same for both planets, then:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\]\n\nFrom Kepler's equation:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3} \\]\n\nSo, K is proportional to P^{-1/3}\n\nTherefore, P is proportional to K^{-3}\n\nThus, P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3\n\nGiven that, and K proportional to wavelength shift, then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{shift}_1}{\\text{shift}_2} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3 = \\left( 0.714 \\right)^3 \\approx 0.357 \\]\n\nSo, P_2 is approximately 0.357 times P_1, meaning P_2 is shorter than P_1, not longer.\n\nBut the question asks \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which seems to suggest P_2 / P_1, but according to my calculation, P_2 is shorter than P_1.\n\nMaybe I misinterpreted the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the wavelength shift is inversely proportional to the radial velocity, since redshift indicates moving away and blueshift indicates moving towards, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. The Doppler effect relates the wavelength shift to the radial velocity: delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the radial velocity.\n\nSo, the wavelength shift delta_lambda is proportional to the radial velocity v.\n\nTherefore, the radial velocity amplitude K is proportional to the wavelength shift.\n\nSo, my previous reasoning should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the actual radial velocity, not just the wavelength shift.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of radial velocity.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the orbital parameters as before.\n\nGiven that, and knowing K for both planets, I can relate their orbital periods.\n\nBut I need to find a way to relate the wavelength shift to K.\n\nGiven that delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, then K = v_max, the maximum radial velocity, which corresponds to delta_lambda / lambda = v_max / c.\n\nTherefore, K is proportional to delta_lambda / lambda.\n\nAssuming lambda is constant, then K is proportional to delta_lambda.\n\nTherefore, K_1 / K_2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2 = 5 / 7.\n\nThen, as before, P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364, which is approximately 0.36.\n\nSo, P_2 is approximately 0.36 times P_1, meaning P_2 is shorter than P_1.\n\nBut the question asks how many times longer P_2 is than P_1, which would imply P_2 / P_1, but P_2 / P_1 is 0.36, which is less than 1, meaning P_2 is shorter.\n\nPerhaps the question has a typo, and it should ask how many times shorter P_2 is than P_1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the wavelength shift corresponds to the radial velocity, and thus K is directly proportional to the shift.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the units.\n\nGiven that delta_lambda = K * lambda / c, and K is in m/s, lambda in meters, c in m/s.\n\nBut in practice, for small velocities, delta_lambda is proportional to K.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the actual radial velocity amplitude K, and relate it to the orbital period via Kepler's laws.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G (M + m)} } \\]\n\nAssuming M >> m, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P \\approx 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G M} } \\]\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\left( \\frac{m}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nAgain, assuming sin i = 1 and m is the same for both planets, then:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\]\n\nFrom Kepler's equation:\n\n\\[ P \\propto a^{3/2} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{a}{a^{3/2}} = a^{-1/2} \\]\n\nSo, K is proportional to a^{-1/2}\n\nAnd P is proportional to a^{3/2}\n\nTherefore, P is proportional to (1/K)^{3} = K^{-3}\n\nThus, P_2 / P_1 = (K_1 / K_2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 \u2248 0.364\n\nSo, P_2 is approximately 0.36 times P_1, meaning P_2 is shorter than P_1.\n\nTherefore, P_2 is not longer than P_1, but shorter.\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the wavelength shift corresponds to the radial velocity, and thus higher shift means higher radial velocity, which implies a shorter period.\n\nWait, no. Higher radial velocity corresponds to a shorter period, because the star is wobbling more rapidly.\n\nTherefore, if planet #2 has a larger shift (7 miliangstroms vs. 5), it has a higher radial velocity, which implies a shorter period.\n\nTherefore, P_2 is shorter than P_1, which aligns with my calculation of P_2 / P_1 \u2248 0.36.\n\nBut the question asks \"how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which would imply P_2 / P_1, but since P_2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\nHowever, the question seems to suggest that P_2 is longer than P_1, but according to my calculations, P_2 is shorter.\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the masses of the planets.\n\nWait, both planets are Neptune-like, so their masses are similar.\n\nBut perhaps there is a difference in their masses that affects the calculation.\n\nLet me check.\n\nThe formula for K is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\left( \\frac{m}{M} \\right) \\]\n\nIf m is different, it would affect K.\n\nBut the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and both stars have masses similar to the Sun.\n\nTherefore, m/M is approximately the same for both systems.\n\nTherefore, the difference in K is primarily due to differences in a and P.\n\nGiven that, and the relationship P \u221d a^{3/2}, and K \u221d a^{-1/2}, as derived earlier, my previous calculation should hold.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that P_2 is approximately 0.36 times P_1, meaning P_2 is shorter than P_1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. ~0.36.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from misreading the question, but based on the calculation, D seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. ~ 0.36} \\]"
