                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a point charge \\( q \\) moving with a trajectory \\( \\vec{s}(t) \\), and we're supposed to find the scalar potential \\( V(\\vec{r}, t) \\) and the vector potential \\( \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) \\) at time \\( t \\) and position \\( \\vec{r} \\), given that \\( t > t_r \\), where \\( t_r \\) is the retarded time.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what retarded time is. Retarded time is the time at which the field was generated that reaches the observation point at time \\( t \\). It's given by:\n\n\\[ t_r = t - \\frac{r}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the charge to the observation point, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, they've defined \\( \\vec{d} \\) as the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at time \\( t_r \\) to the observation point \\( \\vec{r} \\). So, \\( d \\) would be the magnitude of \\( \\vec{d} \\), which is the distance between the field generation point and the observation point.\n\nGiven that, the retarded time should be:\n\n\\[ t_r = t - \\frac{d}{c} \\]\n\nNow, the scalar potential \\( V(\\vec{r}, t) \\) for a moving point charge is given by the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential. From my electromagnetism class, I remember that the scalar potential is:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\hat{d} \\cdot \\hat{v}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{d} \\) is the unit vector in the direction of \\( \\vec{d} \\), \\( \\hat{v} \\) is the unit vector in the direction of the velocity \\( \\vec{v} \\), and \\( v \\) is the speed of the charge at time \\( t_r \\).\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential \\( \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\hat{d} \\cdot \\hat{v}} \\]\n\nBut I need to express these in terms of the given notation. They have defined \\( \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} \\) in the denominator, which seems similar to what I have above.\n\nLet me simplify the denominator in the scalar potential:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\hat{d} \\cdot \\hat{v} = 1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d v} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c} \\]\n\nSo, the scalar potential becomes:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{d c}} = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is:\n\n\\[ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi d} \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\hat{d} \\cdot \\hat{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\]\n\nLooking at the options, option D seems to match this:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\]\n\n\\[ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\]\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A has a similar form but with a plus sign in the denominator, which doesn't make sense because the retarded time should involve subtraction, not addition.\n\nOption B gives:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\]\n\n\\[ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}^2}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t) \\]\n\nThis seems like the static potential for \\( V \\), but since the charge is moving, it shouldn't be static. Also, the expression for \\( \\vec{A} \\) doesn't seem to align with the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential.\n\nOption C has:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\]\n\n\\[ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t) \\]\n\nAgain, this seems like a static potential for \\( V \\), and the \\( \\vec{A} \\) expression doesn't match the retarded potential formula.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct one based on my derivation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm the signs in the denominator. The retarded time is \\( t_r = t - \\frac{d}{c} \\), and the denominator in the potential expressions should reflect this relationship.\n\nIn the scalar potential:\n\n\\[ V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\]\n\nThis makes sense because if the charge is moving towards the observer, \\( \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} \\) would be negative (since \\( \\vec{d} \\) points from the charge to the observer), and the denominator would be larger, making the potential smaller, which aligns with the relativistic Doppler effect.\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential, the expression in option D matches my derivation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
