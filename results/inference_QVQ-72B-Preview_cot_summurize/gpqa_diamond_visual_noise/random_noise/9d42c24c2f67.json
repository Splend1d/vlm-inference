As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a star that's just like the Sun in terms of radius, and one side of it is covered with dark spots that cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and these spots are 1000K cooler than the surrounding areas. Because only one hemisphere has these spots, when we observe the star over time, its brightness changes periodically as it rotates, and this can be mistaken for the presence of an exoplanet.\n\nThe question is asking for the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots, expressed as a ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar). So, I need to figure out how much the spots dim the star's light and then find out what size of a planet would cause a similar dimming.\n\nFirst, let's understand the spot coverage. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Since the star has two hemispheres, but only one is spotty, the total spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the entire star's surface area. Wait, no. If only one hemisphere is spotty, then the spotted area is indeed 20% of that hemisphere, but since the star has two hemispheres, the total spotted area is still just 20% of one hemisphere, not of the entire star. So, the spotted area is 20% of half the star's surface area, which is 10% of the total surface area. But I think it's better to consider that only one hemisphere is affected, so the spotted area is 20% of that hemisphere.\n\nNow, the brightness of the star is proportional to its total emitted flux, which depends on its surface area and its temperature. The spots are cooler, so they emit less flux per unit area compared to the surrounding regions.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- R_star: radius of the star (same as the Sun)\n\n- T_eff: effective temperature of the star = 6000K\n\n- T_spot: temperature of the spots = T_eff - 1000K = 5000K\n\n- Filling factor: 20% of one hemisphere\n\nThe total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the flux from the unspotted area.\n\nThe flux from the spotted area is:\n\nF_spot = A_spot * \u03c3 * T_spot^4\n\nWhere:\n\n- A_spot = 0.20 * (1/2) * 4\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.20 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2\n\n- \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\nThe flux from the unspotted area is:\n\nF_unspotted = A_unspotted * \u03c3 * T_eff^4\n\nWhere:\n\n- A_unspotted = (1 - 0.20) * (1/2) * 4\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.80 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 1.6\u03c0R_star^2\n\nSo, total flux from the star is:\n\nF_total = F_spot + F_unspotted = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nNow, if there were no spots, the total flux would be:\n\nF_no_spots = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nThe brightness variation due to spots is the difference between these two:\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total\n\nBut actually, since the spots make the star dimmer, the brightness variation is:\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total\n\nNow, if there were a planet transiting the star, it would block a certain fraction of the star's light, causing a dimming that we can observe as a brightness variation.\n\nThe flux variation due to the planet is:\n\n\u0394F_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F_no_spots\n\nBecause the planet blocks a circular area of the star's disk, and the flux is proportional to the area.\n\nWe need to find R_planet such that \u0394F_planet = \u0394F\n\nSo,\n\n(R_planet / R_star)^2 * F_no_spots = \u0394F\n\nBut \u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total\n\nSo,\n\n(R_planet / R_star)^2 = (F_no_spots - F_total) / F_no_spots\n\nNow, let's plug in the expressions for F_total and F_no_spots:\n\nF_no_spots = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4 - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [2*(6000)^4 - 0.4*(5000)^4 - 1.6*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, no. Actually, F_total is the sum of the spotted and unspotted areas:\n\nF_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_no_spots = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4 - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(2 - 1.6)*(6000)^4 - 0.4*(5000)^4]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recast this:\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 - 0.8*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nF_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.4*(5000)^4 - 1.6*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the signs.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nF_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_no_spots = 2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [2\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 1.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.4*(5000)^4 - 1.6*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, but (6000)^4 - 1.6*(6000)^4 = -0.6*(6000)^4, which would make \u0394F negative, which doesn't make sense because the spots are making the star dimmer, so \u0394F should be positive (since F_no_spots is larger than F_total).\n\nI think I messed up the areas.\n\nLet me re-express the areas.\n\nThe total surface area of the star is 4\u03c0R_star^2.\n\nOne hemisphere is 2\u03c0R_star^2.\n\nThe spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2.\n\nThe unspotted area is the rest, which is 4\u03c0R_star^2 - 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 = 3.6\u03c0R_star^2.\n\nSo,\n\nF_total = F_spot + F_unspotted = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_no_spots = 4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nThen,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.1*(5000)^4 - 0.9*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nWait, F_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_no_spots = 4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.1*(5000)^4 - 0.9*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, that still doesn't make sense because (6000)^4 - 0.1*(5000)^4 - 0.9*(6000)^4 = (6000)^4 - (6000)^4 - 0.1*(5000)^4 = -0.1*(5000)^4, which is negative, but \u0394F should be positive because F_no_spots is larger than F_total.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the area calculations.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted area and the unspotted area.\n\nThe spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2, emitting at T_spot = 5000K.\n\nThe unspotted area is 80% of one hemisphere plus the entire other hemisphere, which is 0.8 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 + 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 3.6\u03c0R_star^2, emitting at T_eff = 6000K.\n\nSo,\n\nF_total = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nF_no_spots = 4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nThen,\n\n\u0394F = F_no_spots - F_total = [4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4] - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - 0.1*(5000)^4 - 0.9*(6000)^4]\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nWait, 4\u03c0R_star^2 * (6000)^4 - [0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * (5000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R_star^2 * (6000)^4]\n\nLet's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (6000)^4 and (5000)^4.\n\n(6000)^4 = 6000^4 = 6000 * 6000 * 6000 * 6000\n\nBut that's too big to calculate directly. Maybe I can work with ratios or simplify the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \u0394F in terms of the temperature difference and the area covered by spots.\n\nLet me consider the brightness variation due to the spots.\n\nThe spotted area emits less flux than the surrounding areas, so the total flux is reduced by the difference in flux between the spotted area at T_spot and what it would have emitted at T_eff.\n\nSo, the flux deficit due to the spots is:\n\n\u0394F_spots = A_spot * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - (5000)^4]\n\nWhere A_spot = 0.2 * (1/2) * 4\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.2 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394F_spots = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - (5000)^4]\n\nThis should be equal to the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star, which is:\n\n\u0394F_planet = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F_no_spots = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * 4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nSo,\n\n0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * [(6000)^4 - (5000)^4] = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * 4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 * (6000)^4\n\nWe can cancel out \u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 from both sides:\n\n0.4 * [(6000)^4 - (5000)^4] = 4 * (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (6000)^4\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\n0.1 * [(6000)^4 - (5000)^4] = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (6000)^4\n\nNow, solve for (R_planet / R_star)^2:\n\n(R_planet / R_star)^2 = [0.1 * ((6000)^4 - (5000)^4)] / (6000)^4\n\nLet me compute (6000)^4 - (5000)^4.\n\nFirst, (6000)^4 = 6000^4 = 6000 * 6000 * 6000 * 6000\n\nBut that's too big. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nRecall that a^4 - b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)(a^2 - b^2) = (a^2 + b^2)(a + b)(a - b)\n\nSo,\n\n(6000)^4 - (5000)^4 = (6000^2 + 5000^2)(6000^2 - 5000^2) = (36,000,000 + 25,000,000)(36,000,000 - 25,000,000) = (61,000,000)(11,000,000) = 671,000,000,000,000\n\nWait, that seems too large. Maybe I should compute it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute (6000/5000)^4 = (1.2)^4 = 2.0736\n\nSo, (6000)^4 = (5000 * 1.2)^4 = (5000)^4 * (1.2)^4 = (5000)^4 * 2.0736\n\nTherefore, (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 = (5000)^4 * (2.0736 - 1) = (5000)^4 * 1.0736\n\nSo, (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 = 1.0736 * (5000)^4\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation:\n\n(R_planet / R_star)^2 = [0.1 * 1.0736 * (5000)^4] / (6000)^4\n\nBut"
