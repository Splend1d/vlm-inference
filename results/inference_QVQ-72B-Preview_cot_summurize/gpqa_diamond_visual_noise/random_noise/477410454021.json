                    "text": "So I have this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given by \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/2mL\u00b2. The options are A, B, C, and D, with different multiples of E.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an infinite potential well is. It's a region where the potential energy is zero inside the well and infinite outside, so the particles can't escape. The wave functions are sine functions, and the energy levels are quantized.\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by:\n\nE_n = (n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2)/(2mL\u00b2), where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nGiven that E = \u03c0\u00b2\u0127\u00b2/(2mL\u00b2), then E_n = n\u00b2 E.\n\nSo for one particle, the energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, and so on.\n\nBut here, we have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and spin-1/2, they are fermions (like electrons), and they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nSo, I need to consider the possible energy levels for four fermions, respecting the Pauli principle.\n\nEach particle can be in a specific energy level, and since they are fermions, each energy level can hold up to two particles if they have different spins (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\nSo, for four particles, the lowest energy configuration would be:\n\n- Two particles in the lowest energy level (n=1), one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n- Two particles in the next energy level (n=2), one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\nSo, the ground state energy would be the sum of the energies of these two particles in the n=1 state and two particles in the n=2 state.\n\nE_ground = 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nWait, but that's option B, but let's check if this is correct.\n\nWait, actually, for four fermions, the lowest energy levels would be:\n\n- Two particles in n=1 (spin up and spin down), energy E.\n\n- Two particles in n=2 (spin up and spin down), energy 4E.\n\nSo, total ground state energy would be 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nBut option A says 4E, which seems incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFor four fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the ground state would indeed have two particles in the n=1 state and two in the n=2 state, due to the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nSo, E_ground = 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(2\u00b2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nThat matches option B's ground state energy.\n\nBut option B has 10E, 15E, 18E for ground, first excited, and second excited.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ground state is 10E.\n\nWhat would be the first excited state?\n\nTo get the first excited state, I need to promote one of the particles to a higher energy level while keeping the others in their current states.\n\nSo, possible configurations for the first excited state could be:\n\n- Two particles in n=1 (2E each), one particle in n=2 (4E), and one particle in n=3 (9E).\n\nTotal energy: 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 1*(2\u00b2 E) + 1*(3\u00b2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\nAlternatively, another configuration could be:\n\n- Two particles in n=1 (2E each), and two particles in n=3 (9E each).\n\nTotal energy: 2*(1\u00b2 E) + 2*(3\u00b2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nBut that's higher than 15E, so the lower energy excited state would be 15E.\n\nSimilarly, the second excited state could be:\n\n- Two particles in n=1 (2E each), two particles in n=4 (16E each).\n\nTotal energy: 2E + 32E = 34E.\n\nOr, two particles in n=1 (2E each), one particle in n=2 (4E), and one particle in n=4 (16E).\n\nTotal energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nAlternatively, two particles in n=2 (4E each), two particles in n=3 (9E each).\n\nTotal energy: 8E + 18E = 26E.\n\nSo, the lowest excited state after 15E would be 18E, which is option B.\n\nWait, but option B has 10E, 15E, 18E.\n\nOption C has 4E, 10E, 50E, which doesn't make sense because 4E is lower than 10E, but according to my calculation, the ground state should be 10E.\n\nOption D has 30E, 39E, 50E, which seems too high.\n\nOption A has 4E, 10E, 15E, but 4E is lower than 10E, which contradicts my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ground state energy.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFor four fermions:\n\n- n=1: two particles (spin up and down), energy E each.\n\n- n=2: two particles (spin up and down), energy 4E each.\n\nTotal ground state energy: 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider all particles in the n=1 state, but that would violate the Pauli principle because they are fermions.\n\nSo, no, that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the ground state must be 10E.\n\nThen, the first excited state would be 15E, as I calculated, by promoting one particle to n=3.\n\nAnd the second excited state would be 18E, by promoting one particle to n=4.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other possible configurations that could give lower energies for the excited states.\n\nFor example, could there be a configuration where only one particle is excited to a higher level, while the others remain in lower levels, but without violating the Pauli principle.\n\nWait, in my previous calculation, I considered promoting one particle to n=3 for the first excited state.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the particles to get a lower total energy for the excited state?\n\nLet me think.\n\nSuppose I promote one particle to n=2 (4E), but wait, that's already in the ground state.\n\nOr promote one particle to n=3 (9E), keeping the others in n=1 and n=2.\n\nTotal energy: 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\nAlternatively, promote one particle to n=4 (16E), keeping the others in n=1 and n=2.\n\nTotal energy: 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 15E.\n\nSo, 15E is the lowest excited state.\n\nThen, the next excited state would be 18E, by promoting one particle to n=4.\n\nSo, ground state: 10E, first excited: 15E, second excited: 18E.\n\nThat matches option B.\n\nOption A has 4E, which is lower than 10E, but that's not possible because 4E corresponds to two particles in n=2, but that would require at least 2E + 4E = 6E, but actually, with four particles, you can't have all particles in n=1 and n=2 without exceeding the Pauli limit.\n\nWait, no, with four particles, you can have two in n=1 and two in n=2, which is 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E, as I said.\n\nOption C has 4E, 10E, 50E, which doesn't make sense because 4E is lower than 10E.\n\nOption D has 30E, 39E, 50E, which is way higher than the others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: 10E, 15E, 18E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
