                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they produce two photons that have the same energy, and their directions are such that one goes upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between these two directions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about relativistic particles and energy-momentum conservation. Since the electron and positron are colliding and annihilating into photons, the total energy and momentum before and after the collision must be conserved.\n\nLet me denote the electron's motion from the left and the positron's from the right. Let's assume the horizontal axis is the x-axis, and the vertical axis is the y-axis.\n\nGiven that the electron is moving from the left with \\(\\gamma = 4\\), I can find its velocity \\(v_e\\) using the relation \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_e^2}{c^2}}}\\). Solving for \\(v_e\\), I get:\n\n\\(v_e = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{16}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\\)\n\nSimilarly, for the positron with \\(\\gamma = 2\\), its velocity \\(v_p\\) is:\n\n\\(v_p = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\)\n\nNow, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\nThe total energy before the collision is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\n\nThe energy of each particle is given by \\(E = \\gamma m c^{2}\\), where \\(m\\) is the rest mass.\n\nFor the electron and positron, \\(m = m_e\\) (the electron rest mass).\n\nSo, total energy before collision is:\n\n\\(E_{\\text{total}} = \\gamma_e m c^{2} + \\gamma_p m c^{2} = 4 m c^{2} + 2 m c^{2} = 6 m c^{2}\\)\n\nThe total momentum before collision is:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{total}} = p_{e} + p_{p}\\)\n\nThe momentum of the electron is:\n\n\\(p_{e} = \\gamma_{e} m v_{e} = 4 m \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\\right) = m \\sqrt{15} c\\)\n\nThe momentum of the positron is:\n\n\\(p_{p} = \\gamma_{p} m v_{p} = 2 m \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\right) = m \\sqrt{3} c\\)\n\nSince they are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis, the total momentum is:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{total}} = p_{e} - p_{p} = m \\sqrt{15} c - m \\sqrt{3} c = m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be the same as before.\n\nEach photon has energy \\(E_{\\gamma} = h f = h c / \\lambda\\), and momentum \\(p_{\\gamma} = h / \\lambda = E_{\\gamma} / c\\)\n\nGiven that both photons have the same energy, let's denote their energies as \\(E_{\\gamma}\\) each.\n\nSo, the total energy after annihilation is \\(2 E_{\\gamma}\\), and the total momentum is the vector sum of the momenta of the two photons.\n\nSince the directions are upper-right and lower-right, I can assume they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote the angles that the photons make with the x-axis as \\(\\theta\\) and \\(-\\theta\\), respectively.\n\nThen, their momenta components are:\n\nFor the upper-right photon:\n\n\\(p_{\\gamma x}=p_{\\gamma} \\cos \\theta\\)\n\n\\(p_{\\gamma y}=p_{\\gamma} \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nFor the lower-right photon:\n\n\\(p_{\\gamma x}=p_{\\gamma} \\cos (-\\theta)=p_{\\gamma} \\cos \\theta\\)\n\n\\(p_{\\gamma y}=p_{\\gamma} \\sin (-\\theta)=-p_{\\gamma} \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nSo, the total momentum in the x-direction is:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{total x}}=2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos \\theta\\)\n\nAnd in the y-direction:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{total y}}=0\\)\n\nBut from before, the total momentum was \\(p_{\\text{total}}=m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\) in the x-direction.\n\nTherefore, setting the x-components equal:\n\n\\(2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos \\theta=m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nAlso, the total energy before and after must be equal:\n\n\\(6 m c^{2}=2 E_{\\gamma}\\)\n\nSo, \\(E_{\\gamma}=3 m c^{2}\\)\n\nBut \\(E_{\\gamma}=p_{\\gamma} c\\), so \\(p_{\\gamma}=E_{\\gamma} / c=3 m c\\)\n\nPlugging this back into the momentum equation:\n\n\\(2 \\times 3 m c \\times \\cos \\theta=m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(6 m c \\cos \\theta=m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nDivide both sides by \\(m c\\):\n\n\\(6 \\cos \\theta=\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nNow, solve for \\(\\cos \\theta\\) :\n\n\\(\\cos \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\)\n\nI need to find the angle \\(\\theta\\), but the problem asks for the angle between the two photon directions, which is \\(2 \\theta\\) since one is at \\(\\theta\\) and the other at \\(-\\theta\\).\n\nSo, the angle between them is \\(2 \\theta\\).\n\nBut maybe I should check if my assumption about the angles is correct.\n\nWait, the problem says one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So, if I consider the x-axis as horizontal, then upper-right would be at some angle \\(\\theta\\) above the x-axis, and lower-right at the same magnitude angle below the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the angle between them is indeed \\(2 \\theta\\).\n\nSo, I need to find \\(2 \\theta\\), where \\(\\cos \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\)\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerical value of \\(\\cos \\theta\\):\n\n\\(\\cos \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\approx \\frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} \\approx \\frac{2.14093}{6} \\approx 0.35682\\)\n\nNow, find \\(\\theta=\\cos^{-1}(0.35682) \\approx 69.11^\\circ\\)\n\nThen, the angle between the two photons is \\(2 \\theta \\approx 138.22^\\circ\\), which rounds to \\(138^\\circ\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, A. 138 seems to be the closest.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found the velocities of the electron and positron using their Lorentz factors.\n\nFor electron: \\(v_e = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\\)\n\nFor positron: \\(v_p = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\)\n\nThen, their momenta:\n\n\\(p_e = \\gamma_e m v_e = 4 m \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4} c\\right) = m \\sqrt{15} c\\)\n\n\\(p_p = \\gamma_p m v_p = 2 m \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} c\\right) = m \\sqrt{3} c\\)\n\nTotal momentum before collision:\n\n\\(p_{\\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = m \\sqrt{15} c - m \\sqrt{3} c = m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nAfter annihilation, total energy:\n\n\\(E_{\\text{total}} = 6 m c^{2} = 2 E_{\\gamma} \\Rightarrow E_{\\gamma} = 3 m c^{2}\\)\n\nPhoton momentum:\n\n\\(p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma} / c = 3 m c\\)\n\nMomentum conservation in x-direction:\n\n\\(2 p_{\\gamma} \\cos \\theta = m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nPlugging in \\(p_{\\gamma}\\):\n\n\\(2 \\times 3 m c \\times \\cos \\theta = m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(6 m c \\cos \\theta = m c(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nDivide by \\(m c\\):\n\n\\(6 \\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}\\)\n\nNumerical approximation:\n\n\\(\\cos \\theta \\approx 0.35682\\)\n\n\\(\\theta \\approx 69.11^\\circ\\)\n\nThus, the angle between the two photons is \\(2 \\theta \\approx 138.22^\\circ\\), which is closest to option A. 138.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 138} \\]"
