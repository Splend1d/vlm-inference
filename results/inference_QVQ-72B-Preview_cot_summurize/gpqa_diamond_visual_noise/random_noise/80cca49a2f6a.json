                    "text": "So I've got this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what we have.\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams. These salts are heated to 200\u00b0C without air, resulting in a mixture of gases. This gas mixture is then passed through three tubes in sequence:\n\n1. Tube filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 - this likely absorbs water vapor, since Mg(ClO4)2 is known for its hygroscopic properties.\n\n2. Tube filled with Ca(OH)2 solution - this is probably to absorb carbon dioxide, as Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3.\n\n3. Tube filled with red-hot copper - this might be to remove any oxygen from the gas mixture, as copper oxidizes to CuO at high temperatures.\n\nAfter passing through these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\nAdditionally, the weights of tubes #1 and #3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively, while tube #2's weight didn't change.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what gases are being produced from the decomposition of salts A and B.\n\nSince we have an equimolar mixture, let's assume we have 1 mole each of A and B, but I'll need to adjust that based on the total mass.\n\nLet me denote the formulas of A and B as follows:\n\nLet A be M1X and B be M2Y, where M1 and M2 are metals, and X and Y are anions.\n\nAlternatively, they could be more complex, but let's start simple.\n\nUpon heating, these salts decompose into gases. Depending on the salts, this could be anything from oxides, to carbon dioxide, to water vapor, etc.\n\nGiven that tube #1 (Mg(ClO4)2) absorbs water, tube #2 (Ca(OH)2) is supposed to absorb CO2, and tube #3 (red-hot copper) removes oxygen.\n\nBut it says the weight of tube #2 didn't change, meaning no CO2 was present in the gas mixture.\n\nTube #1 increased by 3.60 g, which is presumably water absorbed.\n\nTube #3 increased by 0.80 g, which is CuO formed from oxygen in the gas mixture reacting with copper.\n\nFinally, after all that, there's 2.24 L of gas C left at STP.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many moles that is. At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n\nSo, 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol of gas C.\n\nNow, let's see what we can deduce from the mass changes.\n\nTube #1 absorbed 3.60 g of water. Since water is H2O, with a molar mass of 18 g/mol, the moles of water are:\n\n3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol H2O.\n\nTube #3 absorbed 0.80 g of CuO. CuO has a molar mass of approximately 79.55 g/mol, but let's use 80 g/mol for simplicity.\n\nWait, no, Cu is about 63.55 and O is 16, so 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol.\n\n0.80 g / 79.55 g/mol \u2248 0.010 mol CuO.\n\nThis means that 0.010 moles of oxygen reacted with copper to form CuO.\n\nNow, the total initial mass was 7.20 g, and we have information about the gases produced.\n\nLet me try to list out what we know:\n\n- 0.20 mol H2O (from tube #1)\n\n- 0.010 mol O2 (from tube #3)\n\n- 0.10 mol gas C (remaining after all absorptions)\n\nTotal moles from gases: 0.20 + 0.010 + 0.10 = 0.31 mol\n\nNow, since it's an equimolar mixture of A and B, let's assume 1 mole each, but the total mass is 7.20 g.\n\nWait, no. If they're equimolar, and the total mass is 7.20 g, then each salt has a mass of 3.60 g.\n\nBut that assumes they have the same molar mass, which may not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if they're equimolar but have different molar masses, the total mass is 7.20 g.\n\nLet me denote the molar masses of A and B as M_A and M_B, respectively.\n\nSince they're equimolar, let's say n moles each, so total mass = n*M_A + n*M_B = 7.20 g.\n\nBut without knowing n, it's hard to find M_A and M_B individually.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet's consider the decomposition reactions of A and B.\n\nSuppose A decomposes to form some gases, and B does the same.\n\nGiven that they're salts, they might decompose to form metal oxides, carbon dioxide, water, etc.\n\nBut since tube #2 didn't gain any mass, there's no CO2 present in the gas mixture.\n\nThat suggests that neither A nor B contains carbon.\n\nSo, A and B are likely composed of metals combined with non-metals like oxygen, hydrogen, etc., but no carbon.\n\nThat narrows things down a bit.\n\nNow, from the decomposition, we have:\n\n- 0.20 mol H2O\n\n- 0.010 mol O2\n\n- 0.10 mol gas C\n\nAnd the total initial mass is 7.20 g.\n\nLet me try to find the total mass of the gases produced.\n\nFirst, mass of H2O: 0.20 mol * 18 g/mol = 3.60 g\n\nMass of O2: 0.010 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.32 g\n\nMass of gas C: assuming it's a single gas, with 0.10 mol at STP being 2.24 L, which matches.\n\nTotal mass of gases: 3.60 g + 0.32 g + mass of gas C.\n\nBut I don't know the identity or molar mass of gas C yet.\n\nWait, the problem says \"only a mixture of gases was formed,\" and after passing through the tubes, only 2.24 L of gas C remains.\n\nSo, the gases initially were H2O, O2, and C.\n\nTotal mass of gases: 3.60 g + 0.32 g + mass of C = let's call it M_gases.\n\nBut the initial mixture was 7.20 g, which is the sum of the masses of A and B.\n\nWait, but A and B are decomposed into gases, so their original masses are converted entirely into the gases, assuming no residual solid is left.\n\nBut the problem says \"only a mixture of gases was formed,\" so perhaps the decomposition produces only gases, no residual solid.\n\nTherefore, the mass of A + B = 7.20 g, and this mass is converted entirely into the gases H2O, O2, and C.\n\nSo, M_gases = mass of H2O + mass of O2 + mass of C = 7.20 g.\n\nWe already know mass of H2O is 3.60 g and mass of O2 is 0.32 g.\n\nTherefore, mass of C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.32 g = 3.28 g.\n\nBut earlier, we have 0.10 mol of C, so molar mass of C is 3.28 g / 0.10 mol = 32.8 g/mol.\n\nNow, what could gas C be?\n\nCommon gases with molar masses around 32 g/mol include O2 (32 g/mol), SO2 (64 g/mol), but that's too high, N2O (44 g/mol), etc.\n\nWait, 32.8 g/mol is close to O2, but O2 is 32 g/mol. Maybe it's O2, but that seems unlikely because we already have O2 from the decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's SO2, which is 64 g/mol, but that's too high.\n\nWait, maybe it's a mixture of gases, but the problem says \"only 2.24 liters of gas C,\" implying a single gas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is CO, which has a molar mass of 28 g/mol, but that's lower than 32.8 g/mol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a noble gas like Ar, which is 39.9 g/mol, but that's higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule like F2, which is 38 g/mol, close to 32.8 g/mol.\n\nWait, but F2 is 38 g/mol, which is close to 32.8 g/mol. Maybe it's F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a combination of gases, but the problem seems to indicate a single gas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a compound like NO, which is 30 g/mol, still a bit low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mixture of N2 (28 g/mol) and O2 (32 g/mol), but that would complicate things.\n\nGiven that, perhaps C is O2, and the molar mass calculation is approximate.\n\nBut earlier, we calculated mass of C as 3.28 g, and moles as 0.10 mol, giving 32.8 g/mol, which is slightly higher than O2's 32 g/mol. Maybe it's a mixture, but let's assume it's O2 for now.\n\nNow, if C is O2, then the gases produced are:\n\n- 0.20 mol H2O\n\n- 0.010 mol O2\n\n- 0.10 mol O2 from C, totaling 0.11 mol O2.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because if C is O2, then total O2 would be 0.11 mol, not 0.10 mol.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is not O2. Maybe it's another gas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a different compound altogether.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\nThe options are 15, 17, 13, or 19.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find the total number of atoms in A and B combined.\n\nFirst, let's consider the decomposition reactions.\n\nAssuming A and B decompose to form H2O, O2, and C.\n\nFrom the decomposition, we have:\n\n- 0.20 mol H2O\n\n- 0.010 mol O2\n\n- 0.10 mol C (assuming it's a single gas)\n\nTotal moles of gas: 0.20 + 0.010 + 0.10 = 0.31 mol\n\nTotal mass of gases: 7.20 g\n\nMass of H2O: 0.20 mol * 18 g/mol = 3.60 g\n\nMass of O2: 0.010 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.32 g\n\nMass of C: 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.32 g = 3.28 g\n\nMolar mass of C: 3.28 g / 0.10 mol = 32.8 g/mol\n\nNow, if C is O2, which is 32 g/mol, then perhaps the discrepancy is due to measurement error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different gas with a molar mass of around 32.8 g/mol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of gases, but the problem seems to indicate a single gas.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that C is O2, and the slight discrepancy is acceptable.\n\nAssuming C is O2, then total O2 produced is 0.11 mol (0.010 mol from tube #3 and 0.10 mol from C).\n\nNow, let's think about the composition of A and B.\n\nSince no carbon is present in the gases (as tube #2 didn't gain mass), A and B don't contain carbon.\n\nSo, they're composed of other elements, likely metals combined with hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they contain halogens, like chlorine or fluorine.\n\nBut the problem mentions salts, so likely they're metal salts with hydroxides or oxides.\n\nWait, but if they're hydroxides, they could decompose to form H2O and O2.\n\nSimilarly, if they're oxides, they might form O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they contain hydrogen in some form.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to look at the total number of atoms.\n\nLet me try to find the total number of atoms in A and B.\n\nFirst, since it's an equimolar mixture, let's assume 1 mole each of A and B.\n\nTotal moles = 2 mol\n\nTotal mass = 7.20 g\n\nAverage molar mass = 7.20 g / 2 mol = 3.60 g/mol\n\nBut that seems too low for a salt. Maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the mixture is equimolar, but their individual molar masses are different.\n\nLet me denote molar masses as M_A and M_B, with n moles each.\n\nTotal mass: n*M_A + n*M_B = 7.20 g\n\nBut without knowing n, I can't find M_A and M_B individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the total number of atoms in terms of n.\n\nLet me consider the decomposition reactions.\n\nAssuming A decomposes to form H2O and O2, and B does the same.\n\nFrom the decomposition, we have:\n\n- 0.20 mol H2O\n\n- 0.010 mol O2\n\n- 0.10 mol C (assuming it's O2, making total O2 = 0.11 mol)\n\nBut this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a different gas, like nitrogen or something else.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to consider the total number of atoms directly.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of atoms from the gases produced.\n\nFirst, from 0.20 mol H2O:\n\nEach H2O molecule has 2 H and 1 O, so total atoms per mole: 3\n\nTotal atoms from H2O: 0.20 mol * 3 atoms/mol = 0.60 atoms\n\nBut wait, atoms aren't conserved like that. I need to consider the total mass and the elements involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of atomic masses.\n\nLet me calculate the total mass of each element from the gases.\n\nFirst, from H2O:\n\n0.20 mol H2O contains 0.40 mol H and 0.20 mol O\n\nMass of H: 0.40 mol * 1 g/mol = 0.40 g\n\nMass of O: 0.20 mol * 16 g/mol = 3.20 g\n\nFrom O2:\n\n0.010 mol O2 contains 0.020 mol O\n\nMass of O: 0.020 mol * 16 g/mol = 0.32 g\n\nFrom C:\n\nAssuming it's O2, 0.10 mol O2 contains 0.20 mol O\n\nMass of O: 0.20 mol * 16 g/mol = 3.20 g\n\nTotal mass of O from all sources: 3.20 g (from H2O) + 0.32 g (from O2 in tube #3) + 3.20 g (from C) = 6.72 g\n\nTotal mass of H: 0.40 g\n\nTotal mass of gases: 6.72 g (O) + 0.40 g (H) = 7.12 g\n\nBut the initial mass was 7.20 g. There's a discrepancy of 0.08 g.\n\nPerhaps I've misidentified C as O2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a different gas with a molar mass of 32.8 g/mol.\n\nIf C is SO2, which has a molar mass of 64 g/mol, but that's too high.\n\nAlternatively, if C is NO2, which has a molar mass of 46 g/mol, that's even higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a noble gas like Ar (39.9 g/mol), but again, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of gases.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I need to consider that the decomposition produces only H2O and O2, and C is O2.\n\nGiven that, total O2 is 0.11 mol, and H2O is 0.20 mol.\n\nTotal mass from O2: 0.11 mol * 32 g/mol = 3.52 g\n\nTotal mass from H2O: 0.20 mol * 18 g/mol = 3.60 g\n\nTotal mass: 3.52 g + 3.60 g = 7.12 g, which is close to 7.20 g.\n\nPerhaps the discrepancy is due to measurement error.\n\nNow, let's think about the composition of A and B.\n\nIf A and B decompose to form H2O and O2, they likely contain hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they contain a metal combined with hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nFor example, if A and B are metal hydroxides, like NaOH or KOH, they can decompose to form H2O and O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're peroxides or superoxides.\n\nBut the problem mentions salts, so maybe metal hydroxides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they contain sulfur or nitrogen, but the problem indicates no CO2 is produced, so no carbon is present.\n\nWait, but if they contain sulfur, decomposition could produce SO2 or SO3, which would be absorbed by Ca(OH)2, but tube #2 didn't gain any mass, so no sulfur compounds are present.\n\nSimilarly, if they contain nitrogen, it could produce N2 or NOx gases, which might not be absorbed by the tubes.\n\nBut the problem says only 2."
