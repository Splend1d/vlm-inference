                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a vector field \\(\\mathbf{f}(r)\\) that decreases with the square of the distance from the origin, like \\(f(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\), and it's only directed radially outward. We need to find the volume integral of its divergence over a sphere of radius \\(R\\) centered at the origin.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what divergence means in this context. Divergence measures how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a particular point. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 f_r \\right) + \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( f_\\theta \\sin \\theta \\right) + \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial f_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) has only a radial component, \\(f_r = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\), and \\(f_\\theta = f_\\phi = 0\\), the divergence simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (1) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the divergence of \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) is zero everywhere except possibly at \\(r = 0\\), where the field is undefined because division by zero would occur.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence inside a sphere of radius \\(R\\), including the origin. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at \\(r = 0\\), the integral over the entire volume should be zero, but I recall that there might be a delta function involved at \\(r = 0\\).\n\nLet me think about this again. If I have a vector field \\(\\mathbf{f}(r) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\\), its divergence is supposed to be zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's like a Dirac delta function. Specifically, in three dimensions, the divergence of \\(\\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\\) is \\(4\\pi \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\), where \\(\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSo, perhaps the divergence is not exactly zero; it's zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's infinite, behaving like \\(\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\).\n\nTherefore, the divergence can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = 4\\pi \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\n\nNow, if I integrate this divergence over the volume of a sphere of radius \\(R\\) centered at the origin, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\iiint_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} \\, dV = \\iiint_V 4\\pi \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dV\n\\]\n\nThe integral of the delta function over any volume that includes the origin is equal to 1. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:\n\n\\[\n4\\pi \\cdot 1 = 4\\pi\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer should be \\(4\\pi\\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this reasoning. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary of the volume. The theorem states:\n\n\\[\n\\iiint_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} \\, dV = \\iint_{S} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\mathbf{f}(r) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\\), on the surface of the sphere of radius \\(R\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot R^2 \\, d\\Omega = d\\Omega\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\Omega\\) is the differential solid angle. Integrating over the entire sphere:\n\n\\[\n\\iint_{S} \\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} d\\Omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin \\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = \\left[ -\\cos \\theta \\right]_{0}^{\\pi} \\cdot \\left[ \\phi \\right]_{0}^{2\\pi} = (2) \\cdot (2\\pi) = 4\\pi\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the volume integral of the divergence is indeed \\(4\\pi\\), reinforcing the earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the divergence in terms of the delta function, the integral effectively captures the \"strength\" of the delta function at the origin, which is \\(4\\pi\\), consistent with the result obtained.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(4\\pi\\), which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
