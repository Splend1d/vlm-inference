                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by \\(V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency, and \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the origin.\n\nFirst, I need to find the energy of the third excited state and determine how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator in three dimensions can be found using the quantum numbers \\(n_l\\), \\(n_m\\), and \\(n_n\\), corresponding to the oscillations in each of the three perpendicular directions. However, since the potential is isotropic, it's probably better to use spherical coordinates and consider the total angular momentum.\n\nWait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by \\(E = \\hbar \\omega (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\), where \\(n = n_l + n_m + n_n\\), but that's for Cartesian coordinates. In spherical coordinates, it might be different.\n\nActually, regardless of the coordinate system used, the energy levels for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\n\\[E_n = \\hbar \\omega \\left(n + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = n_r + l + 1\\), with \\(n_r\\) being the radial quantum number and \\(l\\) being the orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\nBut I think there's a simpler way to express the energy levels. Let me check.\n\nI found that the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are:\n\n\\[E_n = \\hbar \\omega (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = n_x + n_y + n_z\\), and \\(n_x\\), \\(n_y\\), \\(n_z\\) are the quantum numbers in each direction.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that it's in spherical coordinates. Maybe I should consider the radial part of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the energy levels are degenerate due to the symmetry of the potential.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the energy levels in terms of the total number quantum number \\(n\\):\n\n\\[E_n = \\hbar \\omega (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = n_r + l + \\frac{1}{2}\\), or something like that. I might be mixing things up.\n\nActually, I think the correct expression is:\n\n\\[E_n = \\hbar \\omega (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = n_r + l + 1\\), and \\(n_r\\) is the radial quantum number, and \\(l\\) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me look up the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\nAfter checking, I find that the energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[E_n = \\hbar \\omega (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = n_x + n_y + n_z\\), and \\(n_x\\), \\(n_y\\), \\(n_z\\) are non-negative integers.\n\nWait, but in spherical coordinates, it's often expressed in terms of \\(n_r\\) and \\(l\\).\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of quanta in each direction.\n\nGiven that, the ground state would have \\(n = 0\\), so \\(E_0 = \\hbar \\omega (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\).\n\nThen, the first excited state would have \\(n = 1\\), so \\(E_1 = \\hbar \\omega (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\).\n\nThe second excited state would have \\(n = 2\\), so \\(E_2 = \\hbar \\omega (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\).\n\nAnd the third excited state would have \\(n = 3\\), so \\(E_3 = \\hbar \\omega (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\).\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is \\(\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\).\n\nNow, I need to find out how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to this energy eigenvalue.\n\nThis involves determining the degeneracy of the energy level.\n\nFor a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of each energy level is given by:\n\n\\[g_n = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}\\]\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, I think the degeneracy is given by the number of ways to distribute the \\(n\\) quanta among the three directions.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy is:\n\n\\[g_n = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}\\]\n\nBut let's verify this for the first few levels.\n\nFor \\(n = 0\\), \\(g_0 = \\frac{(0 + 1)(0 + 2)}{2} = 1\\), which is correct, as the ground state is non-degenerate.\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\), \\(g_1 = \\frac{(1 + 1)(1 + 2)}{2} = 3\\), which is also correct.\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\), \\(g_2 = \\frac{(2 + 1)(2 + 2)}{2} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 3\\), \\(g_3 = \\frac{(3 + 1)(3 + 2)}{2} = 10\\).\n\nSo, the third excited state has 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\), 10\n\nWait, but option C has \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 3, which doesn't match what I just calculated.\n\nOption B has \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 3, but according to my calculation, the degeneracy for \\(n = 3\\) should be 10, not 3.\n\nOption C has \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 10, which matches my calculation.\n\nOption D has a different energy expression involving \\(\\pi\\) and \\(r\\), which doesn't seem relevant to this problem.\n\nOption A also has an expression involving \\(\\pi\\) and \\(r\\), which doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 10.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 10, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I should double-check the degeneracy formula to make sure I'm not mistaken.\n\nThe degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is indeed given by:\n\n\\[g_n = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}\\]\n\nFor \\(n = 3\\), \\(g_3 = \\frac{(3 + 1)(3 + 2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\\), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula is given as \\(g_n = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}\\), which is the same as above.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. \\((9/2) \\hbar \\omega\\), 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
