                    "text": "So I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I need to find the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The total time from the start is 200 minutes, right? And the overall decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%. Okay, let's try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, I know that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. That means the probability of decay is constant over time, and it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Wait, but that doesn't seem to directly apply here because the problem is conditional on it not having decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nLet me recall some basic probability concepts. If I have two events, and I know that one has occurred, I can use conditional probability to find the probability of the other event given the first one. In this case, the first event is that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, and the second event is that it decays in the next 150 minutes.\n\nSo, I need to find P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes).\n\nI think I can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).\n\nBut here, the events might not be directly \"and\"-able. Maybe I need to think in terms of probabilities over time intervals.\n\nGiven that the decay is exponential, the probability of decay in a time interval is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant, and t is time.\n\nBut I don't know \u03bb here. However, I do know that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32.\n\nSo, P(decay in 100 minutes) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 0.32.\n\nFrom this, I can solve for \u03bb.\n\nSo, e^(-\u03bb * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\nTake natural log on both sides: -\u03bb * 100 = ln(0.68).\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = -ln(0.68) / 100.\n\nSince decay constants are positive, \u03bb = ln(1/0.68) / 100.\n\nOkay, now I can find the probability of no decay in 50 minutes, which is e^(-\u03bb * 50).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, find \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = ln(1/0.68) / 100.\n\nCalculate ln(1/0.68):\n\n1/0.68 \u2248 1.4706\n\nln(1.4706) \u2248 0.386\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.00386 per minute.\n\nNow, probability of no decay in 50 minutes:\n\ne^(-\u03bb * 50) = e^(-0.00386 * 50) = e^(-0.193) \u2248 0.824\n\nSo, P(no decay in 50 minutes) \u2248 0.824.\n\nNow, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is the probability of decay in 200 minutes minus the probability of no decay in 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as P(decay in 150 minutes after time 50 | no decay in first 50 minutes).\n\nGiven the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, starting from time 50, is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time 0, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me recall that for an exponential process, the remaining time until decay is independent of how much time has already passed without decay.\n\nSo, if I know that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, then the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nBut actually, because of the memoryless property, it's equivalent to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 50, which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if I know it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be higher than if I didn't have that information.\n\nWait, no. Actually, because it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes should be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0, because the process is memoryless.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense intuitively. If it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, shouldn't the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes be higher than just the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0?\n\nWait, no. The memoryless property states that the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is equal to the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0.\n\nSo, P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes) = P(decay in 150 minutes).\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Let me double-check.\n\nThe memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that P(T > t + s | T > t) = P(T > s), where T is the time until decay.\n\nIn this case, if I let t = 50 minutes and s = 150 minutes, then P(T > 200 | T > 50) = P(T > 150).\n\nSo, the probability that it hasn't decayed in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, is equal to the probability that it hasn't decayed in 150 minutes starting from time 0.\n\nTherefore, P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes) = 1 - P(T > 150).\n\nBut I need to find this value.\n\nI already have P(decay in 100 minutes) = 0.32, which is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100).\n\nFrom earlier, \u03bb \u2248 0.00386 per minute.\n\nNow, P(T > 150) = e^(-\u03bb*150) = e^(-0.00386 * 150) \u2248 e^(-0.579) \u2248 0.562\n\nTherefore, P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438 or 43.8%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 44%.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, \u03bb = ln(1/0.68) / 100.\n\nln(1/0.68) = ln(\u22481.4706) \u2248 0.386\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.00386 per minute.\n\nThen, P(T > 150) = e^(-\u03bb*150) = e^(-0.00386 * 150) = e^(-0.579) \u2248 0.562\n\nTherefore, P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes) = 1 - 0.562 = 0.438, or 43.8%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
