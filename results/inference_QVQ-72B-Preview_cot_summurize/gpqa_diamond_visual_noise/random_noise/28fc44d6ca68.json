                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have an atomic nucleus with mass M that's at rest, and it has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value we'd get using classical, non-relativistic approximation.\n\nFirst, let's denote the masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2. Given that their rest masses sum up to 99% of M, we have:\n\nm1 + m2 = 0.99 M\n\nBut since m1 = 2 m2, we can substitute:\n\n2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M \u2192 3 m2 = 0.99 M \u2192 m2 = 0.33 M\n\nThen, m1 = 2 m2 = 0.66 M\n\nNow, since mass is conserved in the fission process, the total mass before and after the fission should be equal if we consider the rest masses. However, energy is also conserved, and since the products have kinetic energy, some of the initial mass is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nWait, but according to Einstein's equation, E=mc\u00b2, mass and energy are interchangeable. In nuclear reactions, the total energy is conserved, which includes both the rest mass energies and the kinetic energies.\n\nInitially, the nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is M c\u00b2, and we're given that this is 300 GeV.\n\nAfter fission, the total energy should still be 300 GeV, but now it's the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nE_initial = M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nE_final = m1 c\u00b2 + m2 c\u00b2 + T1 + T2\n\nAnd since energy is conserved:\n\nM c\u00b2 = m1 c\u00b2 + m2 c\u00b2 + T1 + T2\n\nWe can plug in the values for m1 and m2 in terms of M:\n\n300 GeV = (0.66 M) c\u00b2 + (0.33 M) c\u00b2 + T1 + T2\n\nSimplify:\n\n300 GeV = 0.99 M c\u00b2 + T1 + T2\n\nBut we know that M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, so 0.99 M c\u00b2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV\n\nSo:\n\n300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2\n\nTherefore:\n\nT1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nNow, we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, and then find the difference between its relativistic value and its classical approximation.\n\nFirst, let's recall the expressions for kinetic energy in relativistic and classical scenarios.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is:\n\nT = \u03b3 m c\u00b2 - m c\u00b2 = (\u03b3 - 1) m c\u00b2\n\nWhere \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nIn classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is:\n\nT_classical = (1/2) m v\u00b2\n\nNow, since the fragments are moving due to the fission, we need to relate their velocities and masses to their kinetic energies.\n\nBut first, let's consider the momentum conservation. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission should also be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, momentum is given by:\n\np = \u03b3 m v\n\nSo, for the two fragments:\n\np1 = \u03b31 m1 v1\n\np2 = \u03b32 m2 v2\n\nAnd since p1 + p2 = 0, we have:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 + \u03b32 m2 v2 = 0\n\nBut since they are moving in opposite directions, v2 = -v1\n\nSo:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 + \u03b32 m2 (-v1) = 0\n\n\u2192 v1 (\u03b31 m1 - \u03b32 m2) = 0\n\nSince v1 \u2260 0, we have:\n\n\u03b31 m1 = \u03b32 m2\n\nBut m1 = 2 m2, so:\n\n\u03b31 (2 m2) = \u03b32 m2 \u2192 \u03b31 = (1/2) \u03b32\n\nNow, let's express \u03b3 in terms of velocity. Recall that \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo, \u03b31 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nAnd \u03b32 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nBut v2 = -v1, so \u03b32 = \u03b31\n\nWait, that seems off. If v2 = -v1, then \u03b32 should equal \u03b31 because \u03b3 depends only on the magnitude of velocity, not its direction.\n\nSo, \u03b31 = \u03b32\n\nBut earlier, we had \u03b31 = (1/2) \u03b32\n\nThis suggests that \u03b31 = \u03b32, but \u03b31 = (1/2) \u03b32\n\nThere must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that \u03b3 is the same for both fragments because their speeds are related by the conservation of momentum.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\n\nm1 v1 = m2 v2\n\nBut m1 = 2 m2, so:\n\n2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 \u2192 v2 = 2 v1\n\nWait, but in relativistic mechanics, momentum is p = \u03b3 m v, so:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 + \u03b32 m2 v2 = 0\n\nSubstitute m1 = 2 m2:\n\n\u03b31 (2 m2) v1 + \u03b32 m2 v2 = 0 \u2192 2 \u03b31 v1 + \u03b32 v2 = 0\n\nBut v2 = -v1 (since they move in opposite directions):\n\n2 \u03b31 v1 - \u03b32 v1 = 0 \u2192 v1 (2 \u03b31 - \u03b32) = 0\n\nAgain, v1 \u2260 0, so:\n\n2 \u03b31 - \u03b32 = 0 \u2192 \u03b32 = 2 \u03b31\n\nNow, since v2 = -v1, and \u03b32 = 2 \u03b31, we can relate their velocities.\n\nRecall that \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo:\n\n\u03b32 = 2 \u03b31 \u2192 1 / sqrt(1 - v2\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2 * 1 / sqrt(1 - v1\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nBut v2 = -v1, so |v2| = |v1| = v\n\nThus:\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nThis implies that 1 = 2, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, this suggests I've made a mistake in assuming v2 = -v1 in relativistic mechanics.\n\nPerhaps I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula or consider that velocities are not simply additive in special relativity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that in relativistic mechanics, the momentum is conserved, and express the velocities in terms of the kinetic energies.\n\nLet me try expressing the kinetic energies in terms of \u03b3.\n\nFor fragment 1:\n\nT1 = (\u03b31 - 1) m1 c\u00b2\n\nFor fragment 2:\n\nT2 = (\u03b32 - 1) m2 c\u00b2\n\nAnd we have T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation:\n\n\u03b31 m1 v1 = \u03b32 m2 v2\n\nGiven m1 = 2 m2 and v2 = -v1, as they move in opposite directions.\n\nSo:\n\n\u03b31 (2 m2) v1 = \u03b32 m2 v1 \u2192 2 \u03b31 = \u03b32\n\nNow, let's express \u03b3 in terms of velocity.\n\n\u03b31 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\n\u03b32 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1\u00b2/c\u00b2), since v2 = -v1\n\nWait, this again leads to \u03b32 = \u03b31, but earlier we had \u03b32 = 2 \u03b31\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe I should consider the relativistic expression for kinetic energy and solve for v1 and v2.\n\nGiven that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and m1 = 2 m2, with m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, and M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the invariant mass concept or four-momentum conservation.\n\nLet me try a different strategy.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the rest masses of the fragments as m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.\n\nThe total energy before fission is M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nAfter fission, the total energy is \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) + \u221a(p2\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nSince p1 + p2 = 0, we can write the total energy as \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) + \u221a(p2\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 c\u2074) = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) + \u221a((-p1)\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 c\u2074) = 2 \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nWait, that can't be right because p2 = -p1.\n\nWait, no, since p2 = -p1, the total energy is \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) + \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 c\u2074)\n\nBut m2 = (1/2) m1, so let's express everything in terms of m1 and p1.\n\nGiven that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M and m1 = 2 m2, then m2 = 0.33 M and m1 = 0.66 M.\n\nNow, the total energy after fission is:\n\nE_final = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.66 M c)\u00b2) + \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.33 M c)\u00b2)\n\nAnd this must equal the initial energy, 300 GeV.\n\nSo:\n\n\u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.66 M c)\u00b2) + \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.33 M c)\u00b2) = 300 GeV\n\nThis looks quite complicated to solve for p1 directly.\n\nMaybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but that will lead to a messy equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion or some approximation.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that p1 is much smaller than M c, which might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the kinetic energy is T = \u221a(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074) - m c\u00b2\n\nSo for fragment 1:\n\nT1 = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.66 M c)\u00b2) - 0.66 M c\u00b2\n\nSimilarly for fragment 2:\n\nT2 = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.33 M c)\u00b2) - 0.33 M c\u00b2\n\nAnd T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nSo, \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.66 M c)\u00b2) - 0.66 M c\u00b2 + \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + (0.33 M c)\u00b2) - 0.33 M c\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nThis seems even more complicated.\n\nMaybe I can solve for p1 in terms of M.\n\nLet me denote a = 0.66 M c, b = 0.33 M c, so a = 2 b\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + a\u00b2) - a + \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + b\u00b2) - b = 3 GeV\n\nLet me set x = p1 c, a = 0.66 M c, b = 0.33 M c\n\nThen:\n\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + a\u00b2) - a + \u221a(x\u00b2 + b\u00b2) - b = 3 GeV\n\nThis is still quite complex.\n\nPerhaps I can make an approximation by assuming that x is much smaller or larger compared to a and b, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the kinetic energies are much smaller than the rest masses, which might not be the case here since 3 GeV is a significant fraction of 300 GeV.\n\nWait, 3 GeV is only 1% of 300 GeV, so perhaps the fragments are moving at non-relativistic speeds.\n\nBut the problem asks for the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation, so I need to consider both cases.\n\nLet me first find T1 relativistically and then find T1 classically, and then subtract the two.\n\nFirst, relativistic T1:\n\nFrom earlier, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and m1 = 2 m2\n\nAlso, from momentum conservation, p1 = -p2\n\nAnd T1 = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) - m1 c\u00b2\n\nT2 = \u221a(p2\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 c\u2074) - m2 c\u00b2\n\nGiven that p1 = -p2, and m1 = 2 m2\n\nLet me express p1 in terms of T1.\n\nFrom T1 = \u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) - m1 c\u00b2\n\nLet me solve for p1:\n\n\u221a(p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074) = T1 + m1 c\u00b2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np1\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074 = (T1 + m1 c\u00b2)\u00b2 = T1\u00b2 + 2 T1 m1 c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 c\u2074\n\nSo, p1\u00b2 c\u00b2 = T1\u00b2 + 2 T1 m1 c\u00b2\n\nThus, p1 = c \u221a(T1\u00b2 / c\u2074 + 2 T1 m1 / c\u00b2) = c \u221a(T1\u00b2 / c\u2074 + 2 T1 m1 / c\u00b2)\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider the center-of-mass frame.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, which it already is since the nucleus is at rest.\n\nThen, the kinetic energies can be found using the invariant mass concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is just the rest mass energy, which is M c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nAfter fission, this energy is divided into the kinetic energies of the fragments plus their rest mass energies.\n\nGiven that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M, and m1 = 2 m2, then m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.\n\nSo, the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M c\u00b2, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV, as we had before.\n\nNow, to find T1, I need another equation involving T1 and T2.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that the fragments move apart with relative velocity, and relate their kinetic energies through that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the kinetic energies are related to the masses inversely.\n\nWait, in the center-of-mass frame, for two particles moving apart, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to their masses.\n\nSo, T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2\n\nTherefore, T1 = (1/2) T2\n\nBut we also have T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nSo, T1 + 2 T1 = 3 GeV \u2192 3 T1 = 3 GeV \u2192 T1 = 1 GeV\n\nWait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check if this is correct.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, for two particles moving apart with equal and opposite momenta, their kinetic energies are indeed inversely proportional to their masses.\n\nGiven that m1 = 2 m2, then T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2, so T1 = T2 / 2\n\nGiven T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, then T1 + 2 T1 = 3 GeV \u2192 3 T1 = 3 GeV \u2192 T1 = 1 GeV\n\nT2 = 2 GeV\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's find the classical approximation for T1.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = (1/2) m v\u00b2\n\nFrom momentum conservation, m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 \u2192 m1 v1 = - m2 v2\n\nGiven m1 = 2 m2, then v2 = - (m1 / m2) v1 = -2 v1\n\nNow, total kinetic energy classically is:\n\nT_classical_total = (1/2) m1 v1\u00b2 + (1/2) m2 v2\u00b2 = (1/2) * 2 m2 * v1\u00b2 + (1/2) m2 * ( -2 v1 )\u00b2 = m2 v1\u00b2 + m2 * 4 v1\u00b2 = 5 m2 v1\u00b2\n\nBut in relativistic case, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nNow, in classical mechanics, the total kinetic energy should also be 3 GeV, so:\n\n5 m2 v1\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nBut in relativistic case, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV\n\nWait, but in classical mechanics, T1 = (1/2) m1 v1\u00b2 and"
