                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how much of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid I need to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083 in 100 cm\u00b3 of solution, and also find the pH of that resulting solution. The options are given, but I want to understand how to get there step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some chemistry here. Fe(OH)\u2083 is iron(III) hydroxide, which is a base. A monobasic strong acid will react with it to form some salt and water. Since it's a strong acid, it will completely dissociate in water, providing H\u207a ions that can react with the OH\u207b ions from Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nBut wait, Fe(OH)\u2083 is not just a simple hydroxide; it's a sparingly soluble salt. So, its solubility might be limited, and I need to consider that.\n\nLet me start by finding the molar mass of Fe(OH)\u2083. Iron is approximately 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1 g/mol. So, Fe(OH)\u2083 would be 55.85 + (3 \u00d7 16) + (3 \u00d7 1) = 55.85 + 48 + 3 = 106.85 g/mol.\n\nI have 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083, so that's 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = approximately 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nNow, Fe(OH)\u2083 is a sparingly soluble salt, so its solubility product constant, K_sp, should be relevant here. But I don't have that value off the top of my head, and I'm not sure if it's necessary for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the reaction between Fe(OH)\u2083 and the acid. Since it's a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, providing H\u207a ions. Fe(OH)\u2083 can react with H\u207a to form Fe\u00b3\u207a and water.\n\nThe reaction would be: Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O.\n\nFrom this, I can see that 1 mole of Fe(OH)\u2083 reacts with 3 moles of H\u207a.\n\nSo, if I have 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)\u2083, I would need 3 \u00d7 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H\u207a.\n\nSince the acid is monobasic and strong, each mole of acid provides 1 mole of H\u207a.\n\nTherefore, I need 0.002808 moles of acid to react with the Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required would be moles / molarity = 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm\u00b3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B shows pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm\u00b3, which is very close to what I calculated.\n\nBut I need to also consider the pH of the resulting solution.\n\nAfter the reaction, the Fe(OH)\u2083 would be dissolved, forming Fe\u00b3\u207a ions in solution.\n\nBut I need to consider if there's any excess acid left, which would determine the pH.\n\nLet's see: I needed 0.002808 moles of acid to react with the Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nIf I add exactly 28.08 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid, that would provide exactly 0.002808 moles of acid, which would completely react with the Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nBut in reality, to ensure all Fe(OH)\u2083 is dissolved, maybe I need a slight excess of acid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider a buffer or something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the solubility of Fe(OH)\u2083 and how acid affects it.\n\nI recall that adding acid can increase the solubility of metal hydroxides by consuming OH\u207b ions, shifting the equilibrium to dissolve more of the solid.\n\nThe solubility equilibrium for Fe(OH)\u2083 is: Fe(OH)\u2083 (s) \u2194 Fe\u00b3\u207a (aq) + 3OH\u207b (aq).\n\nAdding acid (H\u207a) will react with OH\u207b, shifting the equilibrium to the right and dissolving more Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nSo, in the presence of acid, the solubility of Fe(OH)\u2083 increases.\n\nTherefore, by adding acid, I can dissolve more Fe(OH)\u2083 than would be possible just from its normal solubility.\n\nBut I need to calculate how much acid is needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nI think my initial calculation is a reasonable starting point, but perhaps I need to consider the equilibrium constants or something similar for a more precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the solubility product, K_sp, for Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nI found that K_sp for Fe(OH)\u2083 is approximately 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078.\n\nSo, without acid, the solubility would be very low due to this small K_sp.\n\nBut with acid, the OH\u207b ions are consumed, reducing their concentration and allowing more Fe(OH)\u2083 to dissolve.\n\nLet me try to set up an equilibrium expression considering the addition of acid.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the concentration of Fe\u00b3\u207a as s, and the concentration of OH\u207b as [OH\u207b].\n\nThe solubility product expression is:\n\nK_sp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s * (3s)^3 = 27s^4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078.\n\nSo, s^4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 / 27 \u2248 1.48 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079.\n\nTherefore, s \u2248 (1.48 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079)^(1/4) \u2248 6.3 \u00d7 10\u207b10 M.\n\nThat's the solubility without any acid added.\n\nBut with acid added, the [OH\u207b] is reduced, which allows more Fe(OH)\u2083 to dissolve.\n\nIf I add acid, which provides H\u207a, it will react with OH\u207b to form water, reducing [OH\u207b].\n\nThe reaction is: H\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O.\n\nSo, if I add x moles of H\u207a, [OH\u207b] will decrease by x moles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the initial [OH\u207b] from Fe(OH)\u2083 as s, which is very small.\n\nAfter adding acid, [OH\u207b] = s - x.\n\nBut since s is very small compared to x, [OH\u207b] \u2248 -x (but that doesn't make sense).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the protonation of OH\u207b by H\u207a.\n\nActually, in the presence of acid, the equilibrium shifts to dissolve more Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the acid provides a certain [H\u207a], which reacts with OH\u207b, reducing their concentration and shifting the solubility equilibrium to the right.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the concentration of H\u207a added as [H\u207a] = x.\n\nThen, the concentration of OH\u207b remaining is [OH\u207b] = K_w / x, where K_w is the ion product of water, approximately 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, the solubility product expression becomes:\n\nK_sp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s * (K_w / x)^3 = s * (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 / x)^3 = s * (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2 / x\u00b3) = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078.\n\nSo, s = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2 / x\u00b3) = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * (x\u00b3 / 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2) = 4x\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u2076.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, K_sp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = s * (K_w / x)^3.\n\nSo, K_sp = s * (K_w)^3 / x\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, s = K_sp * x\u00b3 / (K_w)^3.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074)^3 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2) = 4x\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u2074.\n\nWait, that can't be right because dimensions don't match.\n\nWait, K_sp has units of mol\u2074/L\u2074, and s is in mol/L.\n\nWait, no, K_sp is in mol\u2074/L\u2074, but in this expression, s should be in mol/L.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rearrange this.\n\nActually, K_sp = s * (K_w / x)^3.\n\nSo, s = K_sp / (K_w / x)^3 = K_sp * x\u00b3 / K_w\u00b3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, s = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074)^3 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2) = 4x\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u2074.\n\nBut I need s to be equal to the concentration of Fe\u00b3\u207a ions needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083 in 100 cm\u00b3 (0.1 L).\n\nFirst, convert 0.1 g to moles: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol \u2248 0.000936 mol.\n\nSo, s = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.\n\nTherefore, 0.00936 = 4x\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u2074.\n\nSo, 4x\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u2074 = 0.00936.\n\nThen, x\u00b3 = 0.00936 / (4 \u00d7 10\u2074) = 0.00936 / 40000 = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077.\n\nTherefore, x = (2.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077)^(1/3) \u2248 6.16 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M.\n\nSo, [H\u207a] = 6.16 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M.\n\nNow, pH = -log([H\u207a]) \u2248 -log(6.16 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3) \u2248 2.21.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them have pH 2.21.\n\nOption A has pH 2.69, option B has pH 2.04, option C has pH 4.94, and option D has pH 3.16.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nI had s = K_sp * x\u00b3 / K_w\u00b3.\n\nGiven s = 0.00936 M, K_sp = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078, K_w = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074.\n\nSo, s = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074)^3 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, 0.00936 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * x\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2).\n\nSolving for x\u00b3: x\u00b3 = (0.00936 * 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2) / (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) = (0.00936 / 4) \u00d7 10\u2076 = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3.\n\nThen, x = (2.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3)^(1/3) \u2248 0.0133 M.\n\npH = -log(0.0133) \u2248 1.87, which is closer to option B's pH 2.04.\n\nMaybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the volume change when adding the acid.\n\nInitially, I have 100 cm\u00b3 (0.1 L) of solution, and I'm adding some volume of acid.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the volume of acid added as V (in liters), with a concentration of 0.1 M.\n\nTherefore, the total moles of H\u207a added are 0.1 V moles.\n\nThe total volume becomes (0.1 + V) L.\n\nThe concentration of H\u207a is then [H\u207a] = (0.1 V) / (0.1 + V).\n\nNow, using the solubility product expression:\n\ns = K_sp * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 / K_w\u00b3.\n\nWe know s = 0.00936 M.\n\nSo, 0.00936 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074)^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.00936 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by 1 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2:\n\n0.00936 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3.\n\nSimplify left side: 0.00936 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2 = 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3.\n\nSo, 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3.\n\nLet\u2019s denote (0.1 V / (0.1 + V)) as X for simplicity.\n\nThen, 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 * X\u00b3.\n\nSolve for X\u00b3: X\u00b3 = (9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3) / (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b9.\n\nThen, X = (2.34 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b9)^(1/3) \u2248 6.16 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nBut this seems unreasonably large, suggesting I've made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rearrange the equation differently.\n\nStarting from:\n\n0.00936 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074)^3.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.00936 = (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 / (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by 1 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2:\n\n0.00936 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3.\n\nCalculate left side: 0.00936 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b2 = 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3.\n\nSo, 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078 * (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for (0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3:\n\n(0.1 V / (0.1 + V))\u00b3 = 9.36 \u00d7 10\u00b3 / (4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2078) = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b9.\n\nTaking cube root:\n\n0.1 V / (0.1 + V) = (2.34 \u00d7 10\u2074\u00b9)^(1/3) \u2248 6.16 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b3.\n\nThis is clearly unrealistic, as it suggests an impossibly high ratio of V to (0.1 + V).\n\nI must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nPerhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the acid provides H\u207a ions, which react with OH\u207b from Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nThe reaction is: Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O.\n\nSo, for every mole of Fe(OH)\u2083 dissolved, 3 moles of H\u207a are consumed.\n\nI have 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)\u2083, so I need 3 \u00d7 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H\u207a.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is 0.002808 moles / 0.1 M = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3.\n\nThis matches option B's volume of 28.05 cm\u00b3.\n\nNow, for the pH, if I add 28.08 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid to 100 cm\u00b3 of solution, the total volume is approximately 128.08 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe moles of H\u207a added are 0.02808 moles.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of H\u207a is 0.02808 moles / 0.12808 L \u2248 0.219 M.\n\npH = -log(0.219) \u2248 0.66.\n\nBut this"
