                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It seems a bit overwhelming at first glance, but I'll take it step by step. There are four companies, each with incomplete financial data, and I need to fill in the missing values. The table provides various pieces of information like units sold, sales revenue, total variable expenses, contribution margin per unit, total fixed expenses, and net operating income or loss. My goal is to use the information given to find the missing values for each company.\n\nStarting with Company A:\n\n- Units sold: 600\n\n- Sales in dollars: \\$30,000\n\n- Total variable expenses: \\$7,200\n\n- Per unit C/M: ?\n\n- Total fixed expenses: \\$20,000\n\n- Net operating income (loss): ?\n\nI need to find the contribution margin per unit and the net operating income.\n\nFirst, I recall that contribution margin (CM) is sales minus variable expenses. Since total sales are \\$30,000 and total variable expenses are \\$7,200, the total CM is \\$30,000 - \\$7,200 = \\$22,800.\n\nNext, contribution margin per unit is total CM divided by the number of units sold. So, CM per unit = \\$22,800 / 600 units = \\$38 per unit.\n\nNow, net operating income is total CM minus total fixed expenses. So, net operating income = \\$22,800 - \\$20,000 = \\$2,800.\n\nMoving on to Company B:\n\n- Units sold: ?\n\n- Sales in dollars: \\$70,000\n\n- Total variable expenses: ?\n\n- Per unit C/M: \\$80\n\n- Total fixed expenses: \\$50,000\n\n- Net operating income (loss): \\$6,000\n\nHere, I need to find the units sold and the total variable expenses.\n\nI know that net operating income is total CM minus total fixed expenses. Given that net operating income is \\$6,000 and total fixed expenses are \\$50,000, I can set up the equation:\n\nTotal CM = net operating income + total fixed expenses = \\$6,000 + \\$50,000 = \\$56,000\n\nSince CM per unit is \\$80, the number of units sold is total CM divided by CM per unit: \\$56,000 / \\$80 = 700 units.\n\nNow, total variable expenses are sales minus total CM: \\$70,000 - \\$56,000 = \\$14,000.\n\nOn to Company C:\n\n- Units sold: ?\n\n- Sales in dollars: \\$240,000\n\n- Total variable expenses: ?\n\n- Per unit C/M: \\$270\n\n- Total fixed expenses: \\$145,000\n\n- Net operating income (loss): (\\$10,000)\n\nAgain, I need to find units sold and total variable expenses.\n\nFirst, net operating income is negative \\$10,000, so there's a loss. Total CM is net operating income plus total fixed expenses: (\\$10,000) + \\$145,000 = \\$135,000.\n\nThen, units sold are total CM divided by CM per unit: \\$135,000 / \\$270 \u2248 500 units.\n\nTotal variable expenses are sales minus total CM: \\$240,000 - \\$135,000 = \\$105,000.\n\nFinally, Company D:\n\n- Units sold: 900\n\n- Sales in dollars: ?\n\n- Total variable expenses: \\$144,000\n\n- Per unit C/M: \\$140\n\n- Total fixed expenses: ?\n\n- Net operating income (loss): (\\$24,000)\n\nThis one has missing sales revenue, total fixed expenses, and net operating income is a loss of \\$24,000.\n\nFirst, find total CM: net operating income plus total fixed expenses equals total CM.\n\nGiven net operating income is (\\$24,000), and total CM is total CM.\n\nI need to find total fixed expenses.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nI know that total CM is per unit CM multiplied by units sold: \\$140 * 900 = \\$126,000.\n\nThen, net operating income is total CM minus total fixed expenses: (\\$24,000) = \\$126,000 - total fixed expenses.\n\nSo, total fixed expenses = \\$126,000 - (\\$24,000) = \\$150,000.\n\nNow, sales revenue is total CM plus total variable expenses: \\$126,000 + \\$144,000 = \\$270,000.\n\nAlternatively, sales revenue can be calculated as per unit CM plus per unit variable expense, multiplied by units sold.\n\nWait, I don't have per unit variable expense directly, but I can find it.\n\nPer unit CM is \\$140, and per unit variable expense is per unit CM minus per unit sales price.\n\nWait, no. Per unit CM is sales price per unit minus variable expense per unit.\n\nSo, per unit sales price = per unit CM + per unit variable expense.\n\nBut I don't have per unit sales price or per unit variable expense individually.\n\nAlternatively, sales revenue is per unit sales price times units sold.\n\nTotal variable expenses are per unit variable expense times units sold.\n\nGiven total variable expenses are \\$144,000 and units sold are 900, per unit variable expense is \\$144,000 / 900 = \\$160 per unit.\n\nThen, per unit sales price is per unit CM plus per unit variable expense: \\$140 + \\$160 = \\$300 per unit.\n\nTherefore, sales revenue is \\$300 * 900 = \\$270,000.\n\nAlternatively, sales revenue can be calculated as total CM plus total variable expenses: \\$126,000 + \\$144,000 = \\$270,000, which matches.\n\nSo, the missing values are:\n\nCompany A:\n\n- Per unit C/M: \\$38\n\n- Net operating income: \\$2,800\n\nCompany B:\n\n- Units sold: 700\n\n- Total variable expenses: \\$14,000\nCompany C:\n\n- Units sold: 500\n\n- Total variable expenses: \\$105,000\nCompany D:\n\n- Sales in dollars: \\$270,000\n\n- Total fixed expenses: \\$150,000\n\n- Net operating income (loss): (\\$24,000) (already given)\n\nWait, for Company D, net operating income is given as (\\$24,000), and I calculated total fixed expenses as \\$150,000.\n\nI think that's all correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the question: \"Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Classical Electrodynamics\n\nB. Superstring Theory\n\nC. Quantum Chromodynamics\n\nD. Quantum Electrodynamics\n\nI need to choose the theory that doesn't require regularization at high energies.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what regularization means in this context. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to assign values to divergent integrals or sums that arise when calculating particle interactions at very high energies or very small distances. Essentially, it's a way to handle infinities that appear in the mathematical expressions.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these theories does not suffer from these infinities at high energies and, therefore, doesn't need regularization.\n\nLet's briefly go over each option:\n\nA. Classical Electrodynamics: This is the classical theory of electromagnetic interactions, developed primarily by Maxwell. It describes how electric and magnetic fields interact with charges and currents. However, classical electrodynamics does not deal with quantum mechanics or the behavior of particles at high energies. It's a classical theory and doesn't encounter the infinities that plague quantum field theories at high energies. Therefore, it doesn't require regularization.\n\nB. Superstring Theory: This is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. Superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, unifying all fundamental forces and particles. One of its key features is that it is finite at all orders in perturbation theory, meaning that it doesn't suffer from the infinities that affect quantum field theories. Therefore, it doesn't require regularization.\n\nC. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): This is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. QCD does encounter infinities in its calculations at high energies, similar to other quantum field theories like Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). These infinities are handled through the process of renormalization, which is a type of regularization technique. So, QCD does require regularization.\n\nD. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetic interactions between electrically charged particles. QED is known for its extreme precision in predicting experimental results. However, like QCD, QED also encounters infinities in its calculations at high energies, which are addressed through renormalization. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that both Classical Electrodynamics and Superstring Theory do not require regularization at high energies. However, since the question asks for the single correct answer, and considering that Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and doesn't deal with quantum effects or high energies in the same way as quantum field theories, it might not be the best choice.\n\nSuperstring Theory, on the other hand, is specifically designed to be free from infinities at all energy scales, which makes it the most accurate answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Superstring Theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
