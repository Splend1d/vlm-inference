                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 \u00c5 (Angstroms) and all angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 equal to 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal is. A rhombohedral crystal is a type of crystal system where the lattice has three equal axes that intersect at angles that are all the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, which is unusual because typically, in a rhombohedral lattice, the angles are equal but greater than 90 degrees or less than 90 degrees depending on the specific crystal.\n\nGiven that the interatomic distance is 10 \u00c5, I assume this refers to the distance between nearest neighbor atoms, which in a rhombohedral lattice, might correspond to the edge length of the unit cell, denoted as 'a'. So, a = 10 \u00c5.\n\nThe interplanar spacing, often denoted as 'd', for a given set of Miller indices (hkl) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk\\cos\\alpha - 2kl\\cos\\beta - 2lh\\cos\\gamma}{a^2}\n\\]\n\nBut since this is a rhombohedral lattice with \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, and for simplicity, sometimes it's easier to use the formula specific to rhombohedral lattices.\n\nAlternatively, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic lattice is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{h^2 a^*^2 + k^2 b^*^2 + l^2 c^*^2 + 2hk a^* b^* \\cos\\gamma^* + 2kl b^* c^* \\cos\\alpha^* + 2lh c^* a^* \\cos\\beta^*}{1}\n\\]\n\nWhere a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors, and \u03b1*, \u03b2*, \u03b3* are the angles in the reciprocal lattice.\n\nHowever, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nI recall that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can also be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha + 4(hkl)\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta\\cos\\gamma}}\n\\]\n\nBut since \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3, and in this problem, all angles are 30 degrees, perhaps this simplifies.\n\nWait, actually, in a rhombohedral lattice, the angles are all equal, so maybe there's a better formula.\n\nLet me consider the specific case of (111) planes. In a cubic lattice, the interplanar spacing for (111) is a/sqrt(3), but since this is not a cubic lattice, I need to adjust for the rhombohedral distortion.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic lattice, but that seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Bravais lattice parameters for a rhombohedral lattice to express the interplanar spacing.\n\nLet me try to find a formula specific to rhombohedral lattices for interplanar spacing.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing for Miller indices (hkl) can be given by:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \u03b1 = 30 degrees, and h = k = l = 1 for the (111) plane, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ)}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the cosine of 30 degrees:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.8660\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the expression under the square root:\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ) = 2(1 + 1 + 1)(0.8660) = 2*3*0.8660 = 6*0.8660 \\approx 5.196\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3 - 5.196} = \\sqrt{-2.196}\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. The square root of a negative number is imaginary, which doesn't make sense in this context. There must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nUpon further research, I find that the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha + 4(hkl)\\cos^2\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nThis additional term with 4(hkl)cos\u00b2\u03b1 might be what's missing in my previous attempt.\n\nSo, plugging in h = k = l = 1, \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, and a = 10 \u00c5:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ) + 4(1*1*1)\\cos^2(30^\\circ)}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ) = 2(1 + 1 + 1)(0.8660) = 6*0.8660 \\approx 5.196\n\\]\n\\[\n4(1*1*1)\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = 4(1)(0.8660)^2 = 4(0.75) = 3\n\\]\n\nNow, the denominator under the square root becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 - 5.196 + 3 \\approx 0.804\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{0.804}} \\approx \\frac{10}{0.8966} \\approx 11.15 \\text{ \u00c5}\n\\]\n\nBut this result doesn't match any of the provided options, which are all around 9-10 \u00c5. There must be another mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me check the formula again. It seems I might have misremembered the formula. Perhaps the correct formula doesn't include the 4(hkl)cos\u00b2\u03b1 term.\n\nAfter consulting a reliable source, I find that the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is indeed given by:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk\\cos\\alpha + kl\\cos\\alpha + lh\\cos\\alpha)}}\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I had before, but without the extra term I included earlier.\n\nLet me try this formula:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1*1\\cos(30^\\circ) + 1*1\\cos(30^\\circ) + 1*1\\cos(30^\\circ))}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 2(3 \\times 0.8660)}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 5.196}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{-2.196}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I end up with a negative value under the square root, which is physically impossible. There must be an error in the formula I'm using.\n\nPerhaps the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic lattice is necessary here. The triclinic lattice general formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{h^2 a^*^2 + k^2 b^*^2 + l^2 c^*^2 + 2hk a^* b^* \\cos\\gamma + 2kl b^* c^* \\cos\\alpha + 2lh c^* a^* \\cos\\beta}{1}\n\\]\n\nBut this seems too complicated to handle without knowing the reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the lattice vectors:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{2V}{a h + b k + c l}\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the scalar product formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice.\n\nLet me recall that the interplanar spacing can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{V}{a h \\cdot (b \\times c)}\n\\]\n\nBut this seems too vague. I need a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet me try to look up the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice again.\n\nUpon further research, I find that for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing for Miller indices (hkl) is given by:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nThis is similar to what I had before, but without the extra terms that led to negative values.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cosine term. Let's try again with this formula.\n\nGiven h = k = l = 1, \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, and a = 10 \u00c5:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ)}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 2(1 + 1 + 1)(0.8660)}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 6*0.8660}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 5.196}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{-2.196}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get a negative value under the square root, which suggests that there's something wrong with the formula or my understanding of it.\n\nMaybe the formula should have a plus sign instead of a minus sign in front of the cosine term. Let's try that:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)\\cos(30^\\circ)}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 + 2(1 + 1 + 1)(0.8660)}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 + 6*0.8660}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 + 5.196}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{8.196}} \\approx \\frac{10}{2.863} \\approx 3.5 \\text{ \u00c5}\n\\]\n\nThis value is much smaller than the given options, which are around 9-10 \u00c5. So, this can't be right either.\n\nThere must be a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet me consider the volume of the unit cell and the relationship between the lattice parameters.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the volume V is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = a^3 \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos^2\\alpha - 3\\cos^2\\alpha}\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me look it up.\n\nActually, the volume of a rhombohedral unit cell is:\n\n\\[\nV = a^3 \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos^2\\alpha - 3\\cos^2\\alpha} = a^3 \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\alpha}\n\\]\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, then:\n\n\\[\nV = 10^3 \\sqrt{1 - (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2} = 1000 \\sqrt{1 - 0.75} = 1000 \\sqrt{0.25} = 1000 * 0.5 = 500 \\text{ \u00c5}^3\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps me find the interplanar spacing.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the reciprocal lattice and the relationship between the direct lattice and the reciprocal lattice.\n\nIn crystallography, the interplanar spacing is related to the reciprocal lattice vector by:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|g_{hkl}|}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( g_{hkl} \\) is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.\n\nHowever, calculating the reciprocal lattice vector for a rhombohedral lattice seems complicated without more advanced knowledge.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the geometry of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nIn a cubic lattice, the (111) plane has an interplanar spacing of \\( a / \\sqrt{3} \\), but since this is not a cubic lattice, the spacing will be different.\n\nPerhaps I can scale the cubic lattice result by a factor that accounts for the distortion in the rhombohedral lattice.\n\nGiven that the angles are 30 degrees, which is significantly different from 90 degrees, this might not be a straightforward scaling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the reciprocal lattice spacing in reciprocal space.\n\nIn reciprocal space, the distance between lattice points corresponds to the interplanar spacing in real space.\n\nFor a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, with angles equal to 120 degrees.\n\nBut this seems too involved for my current level of understanding.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the (111) plane and try to find the perpendicular distance between two adjacent planes.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell is defined by vectors a, b, and c, all of equal length a, and all making angles \u03b1 with each other.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can express the (111) plane in terms of these vectors and find the perpendicular distance.\n\nHowever, this approach seems too vague and might not lead to a straightforward solution.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the interplanar spacing for (111) in a rhombohedral lattice is approximately equal to the interatomic distance divided by the square root of 3, similar to the cubic case, but adjusted for the angle.\n\nIf I take a = 10 \u00c5, and assume that the interplanar spacing is roughly a / sqrt(3) = 10 / 1.732 \u2248 5.77 \u00c5, but this is not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for interplanar spacing in terms of the lattice parameters and Miller indices.\n\nLet me try to use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic lattice, which is the most general case.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{h^2 a^*^2 + k^2 b^*^2 + l^2 c^*^2 + 2hk a^* b^* \\cos\\gamma + 2kl b^* c^* \\cos\\alpha + 2lh c^* a^* \\cos\\beta}{1}\n\\]\n\nFor a rhombohedral lattice, a = b = c, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3.\n\nFirst, I need to find the reciprocal lattice vectors a*, b*, c*.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c}}{V}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{c} \\times \\mathbf{a}}{V}, \\quad \\mathbf{c}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}}{V}\n\\]\n\nWhere V is the volume of the unit cell.\n\nGiven that a = b = c = 10 \u00c5, and angles \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30\u00b0, I can compute the volume V:\n\n\\[\nV = a^3 \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos^2\\alpha - 3\\cos^2\\alpha} = a^3 \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\alpha} = 10^3 \\sqrt{1 - (\\sqrt{3}/2)^2} = 1000 \\sqrt{1 - 0.75} = 1000 \\sqrt{0.25} = 1000 * 0.5 = 500 \\text{ \u00c5}^3\n\\]\n\n"
