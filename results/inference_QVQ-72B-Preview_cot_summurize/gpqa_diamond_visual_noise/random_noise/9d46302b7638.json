                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit dense, but I'll take it step by step. We have two planets orbiting a star, and we're supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. They both have the same albedo, which is important because that means they reflect the same fraction of incoming sunlight.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what determines a planet's equilibrium temperature. From astronomy classes, I remember that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the planet to the star\n\nHowever, since both planets have the same albedo, and we're dealing with equilibrium temperatures, I think I can simplify this.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the equilibrium temperature, considering the albedo, is:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the albedo. But since both planets have the same albedo, their \\( (1 - A) \\) term is the same. So, if I take the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, the albedo should cancel out.\n\nLet me denote \\( T_{\\text{eq1}} \\) for Planet1 and \\( T_{\\text{eq2}} \\) for Planet2. Then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nWait, but that seems off because I think I might have missed something.\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance squared and the luminosity. But in this problem, I don't have the luminosity directly, but I have the star's effective temperature (T_eff = 6300 K), its mass (1.5 times the Sun's mass), and its radius (1.2 times the Sun's radius).\n\nMaybe I should first find the luminosity of the star based on its effective temperature and radius.\n\nI recall that the luminosity of a star is given by:\n\n\\[ L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T_{\\text{eff}}^4 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the star\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\nGiven that the star has a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun and an effective temperature of 6300 K, I can plug in the values.\n\nFirst, find the Sun's radius and luminosity for reference.\n\nI know that the Sun's radius is approximately 6.96 \u00d7 10^8 meters, and its luminosity is about 3.828 \u00d7 10^26 watts.\n\nBut maybe I don't need the actual values if I'm just finding ratios.\n\nLet me see.\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, the luminosity \\( L \\) is the same for both.\n\nSo, going back to the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nSince both planets have the same albedo \\( A \\), and the same \\( L \\), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSo, if I can find the ratio of their orbital distances, I can find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nNow, how do I find the orbital distances of the two planets?\n\nThe problem mentions that both planets are in circular orbits and that their gravitational impacts on the star's spectral lines are observed via the radial velocity method.\n\nSpecifically, Planet1 causes a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 causes a periodic shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5 in the same line.\n\nThe radial velocity method measures the star's movement towards or away from us caused by the planets' gravitational pull.\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift in the spectral lines indicates the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.\n\nThe formula relating the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) (the maximum Doppler shift) to the planet's properties is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P \\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period\n\n- \\( e \\) is the eccentricity of the orbit\n\nBut since both planets are in circular orbits, \\( e = 0 \\), and the formula simplifies.\n\nHowever, I don't have the orbital periods or the inclinations.\n\nWait, the problem states that both planets are in circular orbits, which means \\( e = 0 \\), and thus the orbits are not elliptical, but circular.\n\nIn circular orbits, the semi-major axis \\( a \\) is equal to the orbital distance \\( D \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = D \\).\n\nAlso, in circular orbits, the velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the orbital distance and the orbital period.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to relate the Doppler shift to the orbital distance.\n\nI recall that the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the orbital distance.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\]\n\nBut since \\( a = D \\) and \\( e = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the radial velocity and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nBut in practice, the Doppler shift is related to the radial velocity by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta \\lambda \\) is the shift in wavelength and \\( \\lambda \\) is the rest wavelength.\n\nIn this problem, the shifts are given in angstroms (\u00c5), and the rest wavelength is 6300 \u00c5.\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_1}{c} = \\frac{0.03}{6300} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_2}{c} = \\frac{0.04}{6300} \\]\n\nBut I need to relate these velocities to the orbital distances.\n\nWait, in the radial velocity method, the star's velocity towards or away from us is \\( v = K \\), the radial velocity amplitude.\n\nAnd \\( K \\) is related to the planet's orbital parameters.\n\nSpecifically, for a circular orbit:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut again, without knowing the inclination \\( i \\) or the period \\( P \\), this seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at the relationship between the Doppler shift and the orbital distance directly.\n\nI think there's a formula that relates the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) to the planet's mass and orbital distance.\n\nLet me recall:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} = \\frac{2 \\pi D}{P} \\]\n\nBut I don't know \\( P \\), so that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the orbital distance:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 D^3}{G M} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant\n\n- \\( M \\) is the mass of the star\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( P \\), this seems tricky.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a relationship that allows me to express \\( D \\) in terms of \\( K \\), the radial velocity amplitude.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI know that the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the planet's mass and orbital distance via:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut in circular orbits, \\( a = D \\), and \\( e = 0 \\), so perhaps I can express \\( P \\) in terms of \\( D \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{D^3}{G M} } \\]\n\nThen, plugging this into the expression for \\( K \\):\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi D \\sin i}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{D^3}{G M} }} = \\frac{D \\sin i}{\\sqrt{ \\frac{D^3}{G M} }} = \\frac{D \\sin i}{D^{3/2} / \\sqrt{G M}} = \\frac{\\sin i}{D^{1/2}} \\sqrt{G M} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{\\sin i}{D^{1/2}} \\sqrt{G M} \\]\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nIf I rearrange this, I get:\n\n\\[ D^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sin i}{K} \\sqrt{G M} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ D = \\left( \\frac{\\sin i}{K} \\sqrt{G M} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sin^2 i}{K^2} G M \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ D \\propto \\frac{1}{K^2} \\]\n\nassuming that \\( \\sin i \\) is constant for both planets.\n\nWait, but \\( \\sin i \\) is the inclination, which might not be the same for both planets.\n\nHowever, in many observations, it's assumed that the orbits are coplanar, meaning they have the same inclination.\n\nIf that's the case, then \\( \\sin i \\) would be the same for both planets, and I can write:\n\n\\[ D_1 \\propto \\frac{1}{K_1^2} \\]\n\n\\[ D_2 \\propto \\frac{1}{K_2^2} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_1}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nThis is great because it allows me to find the ratio of distances based on the ratio of radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nNow, I need to find \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\), the radial velocity amplitudes for Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{0.03}{6300} \\]\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{0.04}{6300} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{0.04}{0.03} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_1}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16} \\]\n\nSo, \\( D_1 / D_2 = 9/16 \\).\n\nNow, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{16}{9} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333 \\]\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them are exactly 1.333. The closest is option D: ~1.30.\n\nHowever, I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I derived that \\( D \\propto 1/K^2 \\), assuming constant inclination.\n\nThen, \\( D_1 / D_2 = (K_2 / K_1)^2 = (4/3)^2 = 16/9 \\).\n\nThen, \\( T_{\\text{eq1}} / T_{\\text{eq2}} = (D_2 / D_1)^{1/2} = (9/16)^{1/2} = 3/4 = 0.75 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match my earlier conclusion.\n\nHold on, I think I messed up the relationship between temperature and distance.\n\nLet me revisit the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nGiven that both planets have the same albedo, the ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSo, if \\( D_1 / D_2 = 16/9 \\), then \\( D_2 / D_1 = 9/16 \\), and \\( (9/16)^{1/2} = 3/4 = 0.75 \\).\n\nBut that would correspond to option B: ~0.98, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the relationship between temperature and distance.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for the equilibrium temperature.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for the equilibrium temperature is:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nSo, the ratio should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nWait, no:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was \\( (D_2 / D_1)^{1/2} \\), which would be \\( (9/16)^{1/2} = 3/4 = 0.75 \\), but that's not matching any option closely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the stellar luminosity.\n\nWait, maybe I need to express the luminosity in terms of the star's properties.\n\nGiven that the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, a radius of 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K.\n\nThe luminosity of a star is given by:\n\n\\[ L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T_{\\text{eff}}^4 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ L = 4 \\pi (1.2 R_{\\odot})^2 \\sigma (6300)^4 \\]\n\nBut I think this might not be necessary because we're dealing with ratios, and the luminosity should cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual values to get a more accurate ratio.\n\nLet me compute \\( D_1 / D_2 = 16/9 \\), as previously found.\n\nThen, \\( D_2 / D_1 = 9/16 \\), and \\( (9/16)^{1/4} = (3/4)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866 \\), which is still not matching any option closely.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI know that for two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is related to the fourth root of the inverse square of their distances.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( D_1 / D_2 = 16/9 \\), then \\( D_2 / D_1 = 9/16 \\), and \\( (9/16)^{1/2} = 3/4 = 0.75 \\), which again gives me 0.75.\n\nBut that's not matching any option closely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual masses of the planets.\n\nPlanet1 has 7 Earth masses, and Planet2 has 5 Earth masses.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that affects the equilibrium temperature directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the gravitational binding energy or something similar, but that seems unrelated to equilibrium temperature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the albedo more carefully.\n\nThe problem states that both planets have the same albedo, but perhaps I need to account for the fact that they have different sizes.\n\nWait, Planet1 has a radius 1.7 times Earth's, and Planet2 has a radius 1.3 times Earth's.\n\nMaybe the surface area affects the equilibrium temperature.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula assumes that the planet is a blackbody, absorbing all incoming radiation and re-emitting it based on its surface area.\n\nBut if the albedo is the same, and they're both in circular orbits, perhaps the difference in radius doesn't affect the equilibrium temperature directly, at least in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equilibrium temperature should be adjusted by the planet's radius.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the surface area of the planet in the equilibrium temperature formula.\n\nLet me look that up.\n\nUpon checking, the standard equilibrium temperature formula assumes that the planet is a sphere absorbing and emitting radiation uniformly.\n\nThe formula I have is:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nBut perhaps it should be adjusted for the planet's radius.\n\nWait"
