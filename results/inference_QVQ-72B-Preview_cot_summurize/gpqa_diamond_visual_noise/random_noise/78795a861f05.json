                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about quantum states and their energy differences. We have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is, which of the given options for the energy difference would allow these two levels to be clearly resolved?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved.\" I think it has something to do with the uncertainty principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation. That principle says that the energy of a system can't be known precisely if we know the time very precisely, and vice versa. The formula for this is:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\geq \\hbar\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\Delta E\\) is the uncertainty in energy, \\(\\Delta t\\) is the uncertainty in time, and \\(\\h h\\) is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{eV} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nIn this problem, the lifetimes of the states are given, which I believe correspond to the uncertainties in time, \\(\\Delta t\\). So, for each state, I can calculate the uncertainty in their energies, \\(\\Delta E\\), using the formula above.\n\nLet's start with state 1, which has a lifetime of \\(10^{-9} \\mathrm{~s}\\).\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{1} \\cdot 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~s} \\geq \\hbar\\]\\\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{1} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{10^{-9} \\mathrm{~s}}\\]\\\n\nPlugging in the value of \\(\\hbar\\):\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{1} \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{eV} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}{10^{-9} \\mathrm{~s}} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{eV}\\]\n\nNow, for state 2, with a lifetime of \\(10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}\\):\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{2} \\cdot 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s} \\geq \\hbar\\]\\\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{2} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}}\\]\\\n\nAgain, plugging in \\(\\hbar\\):\n\n\\[\\Delta E_{2} \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-16} \\mathrm{eV} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}{10^{-8} \\mathrm{~s}} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV}\\]\n\nNow, to resolve two energy levels, their energy difference needs to be significantly larger than the uncertainties of their individual energies. Otherwise, they would blur together and not be distinguishable.\n\nSo, the energy difference \\(\\Delta E =|E_{2}-E_{1}|\\) should be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, or at least greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, depending on how the uncertainties add up.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the larger uncertainty, which is \\(\\Delta E_{1}=6.626 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{eV}\\).\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than this value to be clearly resolved.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}=0.0001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nB. \\(10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV}=0.00000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nC. \\(10^{-11} \\mathrm{eV}=0.00000000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nD. \\(10^{-9} \\mathrm{eV}=0.000000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nComparing these to \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{eV}=0.0000006626 \\mathrm{eV}\\), we see that option A (\\(0.0001 \\mathrm{eV})\\) is larger than \\(0.0000006626 \\mathrm{eV}\\), while options B, C, and D are smaller.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty to be resolved, so option A, \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}\\), seems like a viable choice.\n\nBut wait a minute, is there a better way to approach this? Maybe I should consider the resolution condition more carefully.\n\nI recall that to resolve two lines in a spectrum, their separation should be greater than the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the lines. In quantum mechanics, the width of a spectral line is related to the uncertainty in energy.\n\nThe relationship between the uncertainty in energy \\(\\Delta E\\) and the FWHM \\(\\Gamma\\) is approximately \\(\\Gamma \\approx 2 \\Delta E\\).\n\nSo, for state 1:\n\n\\[\\Gamma_{1} \\approx 2 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{eV} = 1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\]\n\nFor state 2:\n\n\\[\\Gamma_{2} \\approx 2 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV} = 1.3252 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{eV}\\]\n\nNow, to resolve two lines, their separation \\(\\Delta E\\) should be greater than the larger of the two FWHM values, which in this case is \\(\\Gamma_{1}=1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}=0.0001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nB. \\(10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV}=0.00000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nC. \\(10^{-11} \\mathrm{eV}=0.00000000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nD. \\(10^{-9} \\mathrm{eV}=0.000000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\)\n\nOption A is \\(0.0001 \\mathrm{eV}\\), which is much larger than \\(1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\), so it should be easily resolvable.\n\nOption B is \\(0.00000001 \\mathrm{eV}\\), which is smaller than \\(1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\), so it may not be resolvable.\n\nSimilarly, options C and D are even smaller, so they are less likely to be resolvable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}\\).\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. Maybe there's a more precise condition for resolution.\n\nI recall the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two spectral lines can be resolved if their separation is at least equal to the FWHM of one of the lines. In this case, since \\(\\Gamma_{1}\\) is larger, we should have \\(\\Delta E \\geq \\Gamma_{1}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\Gamma_{1}=1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\), and option A is \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}=1 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}\\), which is indeed much larger than \\(1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\), it should be easily resolvable.\n\nOption B is \\(1 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV}=1 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{eV}\\), which is smaller than \\(1.3252 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV}\\), so it wouldn't meet the resolution criterion.\n\nSimilarly, options C and D are even smaller, so they are definitely not sufficient for resolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option A: \\(10^{-4} \\mathrm{eV}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
