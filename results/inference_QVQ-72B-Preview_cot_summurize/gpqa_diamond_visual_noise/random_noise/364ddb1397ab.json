                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a p + p\u0305 (proton plus antiproton) annihilating into two A\u207a and two A\u207b particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and each A particle has a mass energy of 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A.\n\nFirst off, since it's an annihilation process, conservation laws should apply here. Specifically, conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- m_p: mass of proton\n\n- m_p\u0305: mass of antiproton\n\n- m_A: mass of A particle (given as 300 MeV/c\u00b2, since E=mc\u00b2)\n\n- v_p\u0305: velocity of antiproton (slow, so probably non-relativistic)\n\n- v_A: velocity of A particle (what we need to find)\n\nAssuming the proton is at rest (since it's a collision problem and often one particle is at rest in the center-of-mass frame), then the antiproton has a small velocity, but it's moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass.\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's rest energy plus its kinetic energy. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy.\n\nSo, total energy before annihilation \u2248 2 * m_p * c\u00b2\n\nAfter annihilation, the total energy should be equal to the sum of the energies of the four A particles.\n\nSo, 2 * m_p * c\u00b2 = 4 * (\u03b3 * m_A * c\u00b2)\n\nWait, but I think I need to be careful here. The A particles are produced in pairs, and momentum must also be conserved.\n\nLet me think about the center-of-mass frame. Since the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, the center-of-mass frame is close to the proton's rest frame.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum should be zero after annihilation because it was zero before annihilation (assuming the proton is at rest).\n\nSo, the two A\u207a and two A\u207b particles must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out.\n\nProbably, they are emitted in pairs opposite to each other to conserve momentum.\n\nBut since we have four particles, maybe they are emitted with momenta that add up to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to use the invariant mass square of the system.\n\nBut let's try to use energy and momentum conservation directly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the four A particles as A1, A2, A3, A4.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total energy (E_total) is equal to the rest masses of the proton and antiproton plus any kinetic energy of the antiproton.\n\nBut since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so E_total \u2248 2 * m_p * c\u00b2\n\nThe total momentum (p_total) is zero.\n\nNow, for each A particle, its energy is E_A = \u03b3 * m_A * c\u00b2, and its momentum is p_A = \u03b3 * m_A * v_A / c.\n\nSince p_total = 0, the vector sum of the momenta of the four A particles must be zero.\n\nIn practice, this means that the A particles are emitted in pairs back-to-back in opposite directions.\n\nSo, we can consider two pairs of A particles, each pair consisting of one A\u207a and one A\u207b moving in opposite directions.\n\nThen, the total energy is E_total = 4 * \u03b3 * m_A * c\u00b2\n\nAnd the total momentum is p_total = 0.\n\nBut since p_total = 0, for each pair, their momenta must cancel each other out.\n\nWait, but if we have two pairs, and each pair has one particle going in one direction and the other in the opposite direction, then yes, the net momentum is zero.\n\nBut actually, since there are four particles, their momenta vectors must sum to zero.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the energy and momentum are related by:\n\nE_total\u00b2 = (p_total * c)\u00b2 + (total rest mass)\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nBut since p_total = 0, then E_total = total rest mass * c\u00b2\n\nWait, but the total rest mass includes the proton and antiproton, but antiproton is moving.\n\nActually, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is still the sum of the rest masses times c\u00b2, but adjusted for the motion.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should use the invariant mass square.\n\nThe invariant mass square of the system is:\n\nM\u00b2 = E_total\u00b2 - (p_total * c)\u00b2\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, p_total = 0, so M = E_total / c\u00b2\n\nBut E_total is the sum of the rest masses of proton and antiproton plus their kinetic energies.\n\nGiven that the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is negligible, so M \u2248 2 * m_p / c\u00b2\n\nNow, after annihilation, the four A particles have a total invariant mass equal to M.\n\nSo, M\u00b2 = (4 * m_A / c\u00b2)\u00b2 + 8 * m_A / c\u00b2 * p_total * c\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe it's better to use four-vector conservation.\n\nThe four-momentum before annihilation is p_initial = (E_initial/c, p_initial), where E_initial \u2248 2 * m_p * c and p_initial \u2248 0 (since the antiproton is moving slowly).\n\nAfter annihilation, p_final = sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.\n\nSo, p_final = (E_final/c, p_final)\n\nConservation of four-momentum gives:\n\np_initial = p_final\n\nSo, E_initial = E_final\n\nAnd p_initial = p_final\n\nGiven that p_initial \u2248 0, then p_final \u2248 0\n\nTherefore, the sum of the momenta of the four A particles must be zero.\n\nNow, for each A particle, its four-momentum is (E_A/c, p_A), where E_A = \u03b3 * m_A * c and p_A = \u03b3 * m_A * v_A / c\n\nSo, the total energy is E_total = 4 * \u03b3 * m_A * c\n\nAnd the total momentum is p_total = sum of p_A vectors, which must be zero.\n\nBut since p_total = 0, then the vector sum of the momenta must cancel out.\n\nThis implies that the A particles are emitted in pairs back-to-back.\n\nSo, perhaps we can consider two pairs of A particles, each pair consisting of one A\u207a and one A\u207b moving in opposite directions.\n\nThen, for each pair, the momenta cancel out, and the energies add up.\n\nSo, for two pairs, the total energy is E_total = 4 * \u03b3 * m_A * c\n\nAnd since p_total = 0, then the total momentum is zero.\n\nBut E_total = 2 * m_p * c\u00b2 (approximately)\n\nTherefore, 4 * \u03b3 * m_A * c = 2 * m_p * c\u00b2\n\nSolving for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = (2 * m_p * c\u00b2) / (4 * m_A * c) = (2 * m_p * c\u00b2) / (4 * 300 MeV / c * c) = (2 * m_p * c\u00b2) / (1200 MeV)\n\nWait, but m_p is in MeV/c\u00b2, right? The proton mass is approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = (2 * 938 MeV/c\u00b2) / (1200 MeV / c\u00b2) = (1876 MeV/c\u00b2) / (1200 MeV/c\u00b2) = 1.56333...\n\nNow, \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1.56333...\n\nSo, 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1.56333...\n\nSolving for v:\n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 / (1.56333)\u00b2 \u2248 1 / 2.44 \u2248 0.4098\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 0.4098 = 0.5902\n\nSo, v/c = sqrt(0.5902) \u2248 0.768 or about 0.77c\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.96c\n\nB. 0.86c\n\nC. 0.77c\n\nD. 0.91c\n\nSo, the closest answer is C. 0.77c\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I assumed that E_initial \u2248 2 * m_p * c\u00b2, which should be correct since the antiproton is moving slowly and its kinetic energy is negligible.\n\nThen, E_final = 4 * \u03b3 * m_A * c, which should be equal to E_initial.\n\nThen, \u03b3 = E_initial / (4 * m_A * c)\n\nPlugging in m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2 and m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2:\n\n\u03b3 = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 = 1.56333...\n\nThen, 1 / \u03b3 = 1 / 1.56333 \u2248 0.639\n\nThen, v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/\u03b3)\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 0.639\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 0.408) = sqrt(0.592) \u2248 0.769 or 0.77c\n\nYes, that matches with option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.77c\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
