                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. Particles are being produced at the center and moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. We need to find out what Lorentz factor would be required for approximately two thirds of these particles to reach the detector walls.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Lorentz factor is. In special relativity, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is defined as \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the velocity of the particle and c is the speed of light. For ultra-relativistic particles, where v is very close to c, \u03b3 is approximately equal to E/mc\u00b2, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass of the particle.\n\nNow, the particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel in straight lines due to their high velocity. The distance they need to travel to reach the detector walls is equal to the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters.\n\nGiven that one third of the particles reach the detector walls at a Lorentz factor of 20, I need to find the Lorentz factor that would allow two thirds of them to reach the walls.\n\nI think the key here is to relate the Lorentz factor to the particle's lifetime and the distance they need to travel. The proper lifetime of the particle (\u03c4) and the observed lifetime (t) are related by t = \u03b3\u03c4.\n\nThe distance a particle travels before decaying is d = vt. Since v \u2248 c for ultra-relativistic particles, d \u2248 ct.\n\nFor a particle to reach the detector walls, the distance it needs to travel (30 meters) must be less than or equal to the distance it can travel before decaying, i.e., 30 \u2264 ct.\n\nGiven that one third of the particles reach the walls at \u03b3 = 20, I can assume that the decay probability is related to the fraction that reaches the walls.\n\nLet me think about the decay probability. If a particle has a certain lifetime, the probability that it decays within a certain distance is related to that lifetime and the distance traveled.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays within a distance d is 1 - e^(-d/d\u2080), where d\u2080 = ct\u03c4.\n\nBut since v \u2248 c, d \u2248 ct, so d/d\u2080 = t/\u03c4 = \u03b3.\n\nTherefore, the probability P = 1 - e^(-\u03b3).\n\nGiven that one third of the particles reach the walls at \u03b3 = 20, we have P = 1/3.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-20) = 1/3.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because e^(-20) is a very small number, so 1 - e^(-20) is very close to 1, which is not equal to 1/3.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my assumption.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the particles are moving with a velocity v, and their observed lifetime is \u03b3\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nThe distance they travel before decaying is d = v * \u03b3\u03c4.\n\nSince v \u2248 c, d \u2248 c\u03b3\u03c4.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays within a distance d is 1 - e^(-d/d\u2080), where d\u2080 = c\u03c4.\n\nSo, P = 1 - e^(-\u03b3).\n\nGiven that at \u03b3 = 20, P = 1/3.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-20) = 1/3.\n\nBut e^(-20) is negligible, so 1 - e^(-20) \u2248 1, which is not 1/3.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my assumption about the decay probability is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the fact that the particles are moving, so the decay occurs in flight, and the observed decay rate is affected by time dilation.\n\nThe decay rate observed in the lab frame is \u03bb = \u03bb\u2080/\u03b3, where \u03bb\u2080 is the decay rate in the particle's rest frame.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a particle decays within time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/\u03c4\u03b3), where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut since v \u2248 c, t = d/v \u2248 d/c.\n\nSo, P = 1 - e^(-d/(c\u03c4\u03b3)).\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the decay probability per unit time in the lab frame is \u03bb = \u03bb\u2080/\u03b3, where \u03bb\u2080 = 1/(\u03c4\u03b3).\n\nWait, no. Let's recall that in the rest frame of the particle, the decay time is \u03c4, so \u03bb\u2080 = 1/\u03c4.\n\nIn the lab frame, the decay rate is \u03bb = \u03bb\u2080/\u03b3 = 1/(\u03b3\u03c4).\n\nTherefore, the probability that a particle decays within time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/(\u03b3\u03c4)).\n\nBut t = d/v \u2248 d/c.\n\nSo, P = 1 - e^(-d/(c\u03b3\u03c4)).\n\nGiven that d = 30 meters, and we want P = 1/3 at \u03b3 = 20.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nLet me solve for \u03c4.\n\nFirst, e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, -30/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = ln(2/3).\n\nTherefore, \u03c4 = -30 / (c\u03b3 ln(2/3)).\n\nPlugging in \u03b3 = 20 and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\n\u03c4 = -30 / (3 x 10^8 * 20 * ln(2/3)).\n\nCalculating ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = -30 / (3 x 10^8 * 20 * (-0.4055)) = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 20 * 0.4055).\n\nSimplify: \u03c4 = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 20 * 0.4055) = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 8.11) = 30 / (2.433 x 10^10) \u2248 1.23 x 10^-9 seconds.\n\nNow, we need to find the Lorentz factor \u03b3 such that P = 2/3.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nSo, -30/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = ln(1/3).\n\nln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nTherefore, 30/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = 1.0986.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / (c\u03c4 * 1.0986).\n\nPlugging in c = 3 x 10^8 m/s and \u03c4 \u2248 1.23 x 10^-9 s.\n\n\u03b3 = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 1.23 x 10^-9 * 1.0986).\n\nFirst, calculate 3 x 10^8 * 1.23 x 10^-9 = 3 x 1.23 x 10^-1 \u2248 3.69 x 10^-1.\n\nThen, 3.69 x 10^-1 * 1.0986 \u2248 0.405.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / 0.405 \u2248 74.07.\n\nBut this is not among the options provided, which are 40, 54, 28, and 68.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, I derived \u03c4 from the condition that at \u03b3 = 20, P = 1/3.\n\nI found \u03c4 \u2248 1.23 x 10^-9 s.\n\nThen, for P = 2/3, I solved for \u03b3 and got \u03b3 \u2248 74.07, which isn't matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated \u03c4.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03c4.\n\nFrom 1 - e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 1/3 at \u03b3 = 20.\n\nSo, e^(-30/(c*20*\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nTake natural log on both sides:\n\n-30/(c*20*\u03c4) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nTherefore, 30/(c*20*\u03c4) = 0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 30 / (c*20*0.4055).\n\nPlugging c = 3 x 10^8 m/s:\n\n\u03c4 = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 20 * 0.4055) = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 8.11) = 30 / (2.433 x 10^10) \u2248 1.23 x 10^-9 s.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, for P = 2/3:\n\n1 - e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, e^(-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-30/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = ln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nTherefore, 30/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = 1.0986.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / (c\u03c4 * 1.0986).\n\nPlugging in c = 3 x 10^8 m/s and \u03c4 = 1.23 x 10^-9 s:\n\n\u03b3 = 30 / (3 x 10^8 * 1.23 x 10^-9 * 1.0986).\n\nCalculate numerator and denominator:\n\nDenominator: 3 x 1.23 = 3.69, then 3.69 x 10^-1 (since 10^8 * 10^-9 = 10^-1).\n\nThen, 3.69 x 10^-1 * 1.0986 \u2248 0.405.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / 0.405 \u2248 74.07.\n\nBut this doesn't match the options. The closest option is 68, but that's still not matching.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating \u03c4.\n\nLet me check the calculation for \u03c4 again.\n\nGiven that at \u03b3 = 20, P = 1/3.\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-30/(c*20*\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, e^(-30/(3x10^8*20*\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, -30/(3x10^8*20*\u03c4) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nThus, \u03c4 = -30 / (3x10^8*20*(-0.4055)) = 30 / (3x10^8*20*0.4055).\n\nCalculate denominator: 3x10^8*20 = 6x10^9.\n\nThen, 6x10^9 * 0.4055 = 2.433x10^9.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 30 / 2.433x10^9 \u2248 1.23x10^-8 s.\n\nWait, earlier I had \u03c4 \u2248 1.23x10^-9 s, but it seems I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03c4 properly.\n\nGiven:\n\n1 - e^(-30/(c*\u03b3*\u03c4)) = 1/3 at \u03b3=20.\n\nSo, e^(-30/(c*20*\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-30/(c*20*\u03c4) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nTherefore, 30/(c*20*\u03c4) = 0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = 30 / (c*20*0.4055).\n\nWith c = 3x10^8 m/s:\n\n\u03c4 = 30 / (3x10^8 * 20 * 0.4055) = 30 / (3x10^8 * 8.11) = 30 / 2.433x10^9 = 1.23x10^-8 s.\n\nOkay, so \u03c4 \u2248 1.23x10^-8 s.\n\nNow, for P = 2/3:\n\n1 - e^(-30/(c*\u03b3*\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, e^(-30/(c*\u03b3*\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-30/(c*\u03b3*\u03c4) = ln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nTherefore, 30/(c*\u03b3*\u03c4) = 1.0986.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / (c*\u03c4*1.0986).\n\nPlugging in c = 3x10^8 m/s and \u03c4 = 1.23x10^-8 s:\n\n\u03b3 = 30 / (3x10^8 * 1.23x10^-8 * 1.0986).\n\nCalculate denominator:\n\n3x10^8 * 1.23x10^-8 = 3*1.23 = 3.69, then 3.69x10^(8-8)=3.69.\n\nThen, 3.69 * 1.0986 \u2248 4.05.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = 30 / 4.05 \u2248 7.407.\n\nWait, that's much smaller than my previous calculation.\n\nWait, I must have messed up the units or the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nGiven \u03c4 = 1.23x10^-8 s, c = 3x10^8 m/s, then c*\u03c4 = 3x10^8 * 1.23x10^-8 = 3.69 m.\n\nThen, \u03b3 = 30 / (3.69 * 1.0986) \u2248 30 / 4.05 \u2248 7.407.\n\nBut earlier I thought \u03b3 was around 74, which was a mistake.\n\nSo, \u03b3 \u2248 7.407, but this is not matching any of the options provided: 40, 54, 28, 68.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the fact that the particles are moving in three dimensions, and the distance they need to travel to reach the detector walls is not just the radial distance but could be along any direction.\n\nHowever, since the detector is spherical and particles are emitted isotropically, the average distance traveled by a particle before decaying should still be related to the radius.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the solid angle and the fact that particles are emitted in all directions.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it's necessary for this problem.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is equal to the probability that a particle decays after traveling a distance greater than the radius of the detector.\n\nIn other words, P(reach wall) = P(T > t), where T is the time to decay, and t is the time to travel the radius.\n\nGiven that particles are ultra-relativistic, t = R/c, where R is the radius.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays within time t is P(T < t) = 1 - e^(-t/\u03c4\u03b3), where \u03c4 is the proper lifetime.\n\nTherefore, P(T > t) = e^(-t/\u03c4\u03b3).\n\nGiven that at \u03b3 = 20, P(T > t) = 1/3.\n\nSo, e^(-R/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, -R/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = ln(1/3) \u2248 -1.0986.\n\nSo, R/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = 1.0986.\n\nThus, \u03c4 = R / (c\u03b3 * 1.0986).\n\nGiven R = 30 m, c = 3x10^8 m/s, \u03b3 = 20:\n\n\u03c4 = 30 / (3x10^8 * 20 * 1.0986) = 30 / (6.5916x10^9) \u2248 4.55x10^-9 s.\n\nNow, for P(T > t) = 2/3, we have e^(-R/(c\u03b3\u03c4)) = 2/3.\n\nSo, -R/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = ln(2/3) \u2248 -0.4055.\n\nTherefore, R/(c\u03b3\u03c4) = 0.4055.\n\nSo, \u03b3 = R / (c\u03c4 * 0.4055).\n\nPlugging in R = 30 m, c = 3x10^8 m/s, \u03c4 \u2248 4.55x10^-9 s:\n\n\u03b3 = 30 / (3x10^8 * 4.55x10^-9 * 0.4055) = 30 / (3*4.55*0.4055*10^{-8+8}) = 30 / (5.52 \u2248) 5.52 \u2248 5.43.\n\nAgain, this is not matching the options.\n\nI must be making a consistent mistake in my approach.\n\nPerhaps the relationship between the fraction reaching the walls and the Lorentz factor isn't simply exponential decay probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction reaching the walls is related to the solid angle"
