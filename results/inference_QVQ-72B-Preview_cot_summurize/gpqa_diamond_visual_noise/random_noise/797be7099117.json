                    "text": "So I've got this titration problem here, and I need to find the pH at two different points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, and then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25\u00b0C. The acid dissociation constant, K\u2090, for acetic acid is 1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075. I need to choose from four options:\n\nA. 3.17; 6.73\n\nB. 4.57; 6.92\n\nC. 4.26; 8.52\n\nD. 4.73; 7.00\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. We start with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3. Dilution doesn't change the amount of solute, so the new concentration, C\u2082, can be found using the dilution formula:\n\nC\u2081V\u2081 = C\u2082V\u2082\n\nWhere C\u2081 is the initial concentration, V\u2081 is the initial volume, C\u2082 is the final concentration, and V\u2082 is the final volume.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n(0.05 M)(20.00 cm\u00b3) = C\u2082(40.00 cm\u00b3)\n\nSo, C\u2082 = (0.05 M \u00d7 20.00 cm\u00b3) / 40.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.025 M\n\nOkay, so the concentration of acetic acid before titration is 0.025 M.\n\nNow, for the titration, we're using 0.1 M NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, and acetic acid is a weak acid, so this is a typical weak acid-strong base titration.\n\nFirst, I need to find the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, the number of moles of acid equals the number of moles of base.\n\nThe number of moles of acetic acid initially is:\n\nmoles acid = C\u2082 \u00d7 V\u2082 = 0.025 M \u00d7 40.00 cm\u00b3 = 1.00 mmol (since 1 cm\u00b3 = 1 mL, and 1 L = 1000 mL)\n\nThe number of moles of NaOH needed to react with 1.00 mmol of acetic acid is also 1.00 mmol, because the reaction is:\n\nCH\u2083COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH\u2083COONa + H\u2082O\n\nSo, moles of NaOH = 1.00 mmol\n\nVolume of NaOH needed = moles NaOH / concentration NaOH = 1.00 mmol / 0.1 M = 10.00 mL\n\nSo, the equivalence point is at 10.00 mL of NaOH added.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration. That means at 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is 25% of 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL of NaOH added.\n\nAt this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form acetate (CH\u2083COO\u207b). The remaining acetic acid and the formed acetate will create a buffer solution, and I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much acetic acid has been neutralized and how much remains.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid = 1.00 mmol\n\nMoles of NaOH added at 2.50 mL = 0.1 M \u00d7 2.50 mL = 0.25 mmol\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid reacted = 0.25 mmol\n\nMoles of acetic acid remaining = 1.00 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol\n\nMoles of acetate formed = 0.25 mmol\n\nNow, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:\n\npH = pK\u2090 + log([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nWhere [A\u207b] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid).\n\nThe pK\u2090 of acetic acid is -log(K\u2090) = -log(1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075) \u2248 4.73\n\nSo,\n\npH = 4.73 + log(0.25 / 0.75)\n\nCalculating the log part:\n\nlog(0.25 / 0.75) = log(1/3) \u2248 -0.477\n\nTherefore,\n\npH = 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253, or roughly 4.25\n\nLooking at the options, at 25% titration, the pH should be around 4.25.\n\nNow, at the equivalence point, which is at 10.00 mL of NaOH added, all the acetic acid has been converted to acetate, and the solution contains sodium acetate (CH\u2083COONa).\n\nAt the equivalence point, the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. Since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it will react with water to form some acetic acid and OH\u207b ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH\u2083COO\u207b + H\u2082O \u21cc CH\u2083COOH + OH\u207b\n\nThe base dissociation constant, K\u1d47, for acetate can be found from K\u2090:\n\nK\u1d47 = Kw / K\u2090 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 / 1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 \u2248 5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070\n\nAt the equivalence point, the concentration of acetate is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid divided by the total volume at equivalence point.\n\nInitial moles of acetic acid = 1.00 mmol\n\nVolume at equivalence point = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL\n\nSo, [CH\u2083COO\u207b] = 1.00 mmol / 50.00 mL = 0.020 M\n\nUsing the approximation for the hydrolysis equilibrium:\n\n[OH\u207b] \u2248 \u221a(K\u1d47 \u00d7 [CH\u2083COO\u207b])\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n[OH\u207b] \u2248 \u221a(5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 \u00d7 0.020) \u2248 \u221a(1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9) \u2248 1.04 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075.5 M\n\nThen, pOH = -log(1.04 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075.5) \u2248 5.5\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 5.5 = 8.5\n\nSo, at the equivalence point, the pH should be around 8.5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.17; 6.73\n\nB. 4.57; 6.92\n\nC. 4.26; 8.52\n\nD. 4.73; 7.00\n\nMy calculations suggest that at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.25, and at the equivalence point, it's approximately 8.5. The closest option is C. 4.26; 8.52.\n\nHowever, I should check if my approximations are valid. Especially at 25% titration, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation assumes that the concentrations are roughly equal, which may not be entirely accurate here, but it's a common approximation.\n\nFor the equivalence point, the calculation is also an approximation, assuming that the hydrolysis is small compared to the initial concentration, which should be valid for a 0.020 M solution.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
