                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given its speed and the uncertainty in its position. The electron is traveling with a speed of \\(v = 2 \\times 10^8\\) m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position is \\(\\Delta x = 0.1\\) nm. I need to find \\(\\Delta E\\), the minimum uncertainty in its energy.\n\nFirst, I recall that the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position (\\(\\Delta x\\)) and the uncertainty in momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)) of a particle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that:\n\n\\[\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}\\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant.\n\nI need to find \\(\\Delta p\\), the uncertainty in momentum, which can be related to the uncertainty in energy (\\(\\Delta E\\)) through the particle's velocity.\n\nBut before that, I should express all units consistently. I know that \\(1 \\mathrm{~nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}\\), so:\n\n\\[\\Delta x = 0.1 \\mathrm{~nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m} = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nNext, I need to find \\(\\Delta p\\). From the uncertainty principle:\n\n\\[\\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta x}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\Delta p \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}}{4 \\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}}\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[4 \\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^{-10} = 12.5664 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\\Delta p \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{12.5664 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 0.527 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\Delta p \\approx 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nNow, I need to relate this uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy. For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the momentum and \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty in momentum is:\n\n\\[\\Delta E = \\frac{\\Delta p^2}{2m}\\]\n\nBut wait, this seems incomplete. I think I need to consider the full expression for energy in relation to momentum, especially since the electron's speed is quite high, \\(2 \\times 10^8\\) m/s, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (\\(c = 3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s). This suggests that relativistic effects might be important here.\n\nIn special relativity, the total energy \\(E\\) of a particle is given by:\n\n\\[E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(p\\) is the momentum\n\n- \\(m\\) is the rest mass of the particle\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light\n\nGiven that, the uncertainty in energy \\(\\Delta E\\) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum \\(\\Delta p\\) through this expression. However, differentiating this expression to find \\(\\Delta E\\) in terms of \\(\\Delta p\\) might be complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation that for small uncertainties, the relative uncertainty in energy is approximately equal to the relative uncertainty in momentum:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta p}{p}\\]\n\nBut I need to be careful with this approximation, especially since we're dealing with relativistic speeds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the momentum \\(p\\) of the electron using the relativistic formula:\n\n\\[p = \\gamma m v\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\)\n\n- \\(m\\) is the rest mass of the electron\n\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the electron\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light\n\nGiven that, I can find \\(p\\) and then \\(E\\), and finally relate \\(\\Delta E\\) to \\(\\Delta p\\).\n\nFirst, find \\(\\gamma\\):\n\nGiven \\(v = 2 \\times 10^8\\) m/s and \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8\\) m/s,\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{3 \\times 10^8}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4}{9}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{9}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5}} \\approx \\frac{3}{2.236} \\approx 1.3416\\]\n\nNow, the rest mass of the electron \\(m \\approx 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg.\n\nThus, the momentum \\(p\\) is:\n\n\\[p = \\gamma m v = 1.3416 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 2 \\times 10^8\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\(9.109 \\times 2 = 18.218\\)\n\nThen, \\(18.218 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 10^8 = 18.218 \\times 10^{-23}\\)\n\nFinally, \\(1.3416 \\times 18.218 \\times 10^{-23} \\approx 24.43 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ kg m/s}\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the multiplication:\n\n\\(1.3416 \\times 18.218\\):\n\nFirst, \\(1.3416 \\times 18 = 24.1488\\)\n\nThen, \\(1.3416 \\times 0.218 = 0.29247\\)\n\nAdding up: \\(24.1488 + 0.29247 = 24.44127 \\approx 24.44\\)\n\nSo, \\(p \\approx 24.44 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ kg m/s} = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ kg m/s}\\)\n\nNow, the total energy \\(E\\) is:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m c^2\\]\n\nBut since we already have \\(\\gamma\\), \\(m\\), and \\(v\\), and we have \\(p\\), we can also use:\n\n\\[E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m c^2\\]\n\nGiven that, let's calculate \\(E\\):\n\nFirst, find \\(m c^2\\):\n\n\\[m c^2 = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2 = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 9 \\times 10^{16} = 81.981 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ J} = 8.1981 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[E = \\gamma \\times m c^2 = 1.3416 \\times 8.1981 \\times 10^{-13} \\approx 11.00 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ J} = 1.100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nNow, going back to the uncertainty relation, I need to relate \\(\\Delta p\\) to \\(\\Delta E\\). Since \\(E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\), differentiating both sides with respect to \\(p\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{p c^2}{\\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}} = \\frac{p c^2}{E}\\]\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in energy is:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp} \\right| \\Delta p = \\frac{p c^2}{E} \\Delta p\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFirst, find \\(p c^2\\):\n\n\\[p c^2 = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2 = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\times 9 \\times 10^{16} = 22.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's check the units. \\(p\\) is in kg m/s, and \\(c^2\\) is in m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so \\(p c^2\\) should be in kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2, which is Joules (J). So,\n\n\\[p c^2 = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\times 9 \\times 10^{16} = 22.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ J} = 2.200 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\\Delta E = \\frac{p c^2}{E} \\Delta p = \\frac{2.200 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J}}{1.100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ J}} \\times 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. The units are not matching up. Let's carefully check the units.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[\\Delta E = \\frac{p c^2}{E} \\Delta p\\]\n\nUnits:\n\n- \\(p\\) is kg m/s\n\n- \\(c^2\\) is m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\n- \\(E\\) is J = kg m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\n- \\(\\Delta p\\) is kg m/s\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\Delta E = \\frac{(kg \\, m/s) \\times (m^2/s^2)}{J} \\times (kg \\, m/s) = \\frac{kg \\, m^2/s^2}{J} \\times (kg \\, m/s) = J \\times (kg \\, m/s)\\]\n\nThat doesn't make sense because \\(\\Delta E\\) should be in Joules. There must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nLet me revisit the relationship between \\(\\Delta E\\) and \\(\\Delta p\\). In quantum mechanics, for a free particle, the uncertainty in energy and momentum are related through the time-energy uncertainty principle, which states:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\]\n\nHowever, this relates energy uncertainty to time uncertainty, not directly to position uncertainty. I need a relation that connects \\(\\Delta E\\) directly to \\(\\Delta p\\), especially in the context of the uncertainty in position.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the kinetic energy in terms of wavelength, using de Broglie's relation. The de Broglie wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) is related to momentum by:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\]\n\nGiven that, and knowing that \\(\\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\Delta p}\\), perhaps I can relate \\(\\Delta E\\) through the wavelength.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the energy of the electron in terms of its momentum:\n\n\\[E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\]\n\nAnd since \\(\\Delta p \\approx \\frac{h}{\\Delta x}\\), I can substitute that into the energy expression.\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the non-relativistic approximation first, even though the speed is relativistic. In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\]\n\nThen, the uncertainty in energy would be:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{2 p \\Delta p}{2m} = \\frac{p \\Delta p}{m}\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is accurate in the relativistic regime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the uncertainty in velocity to find the uncertainty in energy. The kinetic energy is \\(E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\\), so:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx m v \\Delta v\\]\n\nGiven that \\(v = 2 \\times 10^8\\) m/s and I need to find \\(\\Delta v\\).\n\nFrom the uncertainty principle, \\(\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}\\), and \\(\\Delta p = m \\Delta v\\), so:\n\n\\[\\Delta x m \\Delta v \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\\Delta v \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi m \\Delta x}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\Delta v \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{4 \\pi \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-10}}\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[4 \\pi \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-10} = 1.145 \\times 10^{-39} \\text{ kg m}\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\Delta v \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{1.145 \\times 10^{-39}} \\approx 5.78 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ m/s}\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\Delta E \\approx m v \\Delta v = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 2 \\times 10^8 \\times 5.78 \\times 10^5\\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \\(9.109 \\times 2 = 18.218\\)\n\nThen, \\(18.218 \\times 5.78 = 105.22 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 10^8 \\times 10^5 = 105.22 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ J} = 1.052 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}\\)\n\nThis seems to match one of the options, C. ~10^(-16) J.\n\nHowever, I'm still unsure because I used the non-relativistic approximation for kinetic energy, even though the speed is relativistic. Maybe I should consider the relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m c^2 - m c^2 = (\\gamma - 1) m c^2\\]\n\nGiven that, the uncertainty in energy would be:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\left( \\frac{dE}{d\\gamma} \\right) \\Delta \\gamma\\]\n\nBut this seems too involved. Perhaps the non-relativistic approximation is acceptable for the purpose of this problem, given the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the uncertainty in momentum directly in the relativistic energy formula.\n\nGiven that \\(E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\), then:\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{p c^2}{E} \\Delta p\\]\n\nEarlier, I had issues with the units in this approach. Let me try again.\n\nGiven that \\(E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\\), then:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta p}{p} \\frac{c^2}{E}\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to use differentials.\n\nLet me take the differential of \\(E\\):\n\n\\[dE = \\frac{p c^2}{\\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}} d p = \\frac{p c^2}{E} d p\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{p c^2}{E} \\Delta p\\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\nFirst, find \\(p c^2\\):\n\n\\[p c^2 = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2 = 2.444 \\times 10^{-22} \\times 9 \\times 10^{16} = 22.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ J} = 2.200 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{2.200 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J}}{1.100 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ J}} \\times 5.27 \\times 10^{-25} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense because the units don't match.
