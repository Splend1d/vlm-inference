                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem about optical isomerism in organic compounds. So, first things first, optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where molecules are mirror images of each other and not superimposable. These are also known as enantiomers. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it needs to have one or more chiral centers.\n\nA chiral center is an atom (usually carbon) that is bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has at least one chiral center, it can exist as two non-superimposable mirror images, which are its enantiomers.\n\nSo, my task here is to identify which of the given compounds have at least one chiral center, thereby exhibiting optical isomerism.\n\nLet's look at each compound one by one.\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit complicated. It's a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions, both esterified with methanol.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize or draw the structure of this compound to identify any potential chiral centers.\n\nBiphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In this compound, the phenyl rings have substituents at the 2 and 6 positions.\n\nSpecifically, there are nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions, and these carboxylates are methyl esters.\n\nI need to check if any of the carbons in these substituents are bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet's consider the carbon atoms in the phenyl rings. In a substituted benzene ring, the carbon atoms are all sp2 hybridized and bonded to three groups: two bonds to other carbons in the ring and one bond to a substituent.\n\nUnless there's a substituent that itself has a chiral center, the carbon atoms in the ring itself are not chiral.\n\nNow, looking at the carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions: these are part of the phenyl ring, so their carbon atoms are part of the aromatic system and not chiral.\n\nThe methyl esters are attached to the carboxylate groups, but the carbon in the methyl group is bonded to three hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so it's not chiral.\n\nSimilarly, the oxygen atoms in the esters are bonded to two different groups: one carbon from the carboxylate and one carbon from the methyl group.\n\nWait, actually, the oxygen atoms in the esters are not chiral centers because they are bonded to only two different groups.\n\nSo, in this compound, I don't see any carbon atoms that are bonded to four different groups. Therefore, it likely does not have any chiral centers and thus does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nMoving on to the next compound.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis sounds more straightforward. Let's break it down.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a derivative of propanoic acid with a hydroxyl group at the 2-position and esterified with methanol.\n\nSo, the structure would be:\n\nCH3 - CH(OH) - COO - CH3\n\nNow, let's identify the chiral centers.\n\nLooking at the carbon atoms:\n\n- The first carbon (CH3): bonded to three H and one C \u2192 not chiral.\n\n- The second carbon (CH(OH)): bonded to H, CH3, COO-, and OH \u2192 four different groups \u2192 this is a chiral center.\n\n- The third carbon (COO-): part of the carboxylate group, bonded to O and CH(OH) \u2192 not chiral.\n\nSo, the second carbon is a chiral center because it's bonded to four different groups: H, CH3, COO-, and OH.\n\nTherefore, this compound has one chiral center and can exist as enantiomers, meaning it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nAlright, next compound.\n\n3. Benzophenone\n\nBenzophenone is a compound that consists of two phenyl rings connected by a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nSo, its structure is:\n\nPh - C(O) - Ph\n\nWhere Ph represents a phenyl ring (C6H5).\n\nIn this compound, the central carbon atom in the carbonyl group is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n\nIs this carbon atom a chiral center?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl rings and an oxygen atom, but the oxygen is double-bonded, so it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to three groups: two phenyl rings and one oxygen.\n\nSince the two phenyl rings are identical, this carbon is not a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, benzophenone does not have any chiral centers and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nLastly,\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate\n\nFumarate is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically trans-butenedioic acid.\n\nThe structure of fumarate is:\n\nHOOC - CH=CH - COOH\n\nWhen esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would have both carboxylic acid groups esterified to methyl esters:\n\nCH3 - O - C - CH=CH - C - O - CH3\n\n|\n\n|\n\nO\n\nO\n\nNow, let's identify any potential chiral centers in this molecule.\n\nLooking at the carbon atoms:\n\n- The two carboxylate carbons are part of the double bond and are sp2 hybridized, bonded to three groups each: one oxygen from the carbonyl, one oxygen from the ester group, and the adjacent carbon.\n\n- The central carbon in the CH=CH group is also sp2 hybridized and bonded to two different groups: one hydrogen, one carbon, and the adjacent carbon.\n\nNone of these carbons are bonded to four different groups, so they are not chiral centers.\n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Compound 1: no chiral centers \u2192 no optical isomerism\n\n- Compound 2: one chiral center \u2192 exhibits optical isomerism\n\n- Compound 3: no chiral centers \u2192 no optical isomerism\n\n- Compound 4: no chiral centers \u2192 no optical isomerism\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 3 and 4\n\nB. 2 and 3\n\nC. 1 and 2\n\nD. 1, 2 and 4\n\nBased on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, so none of the provided options match this conclusion.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's something I'm missing. Maybe I need to consider other types of stereoisomerism beyond optical isomerism.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOptical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism involving chiral molecules, specifically enantiomers.\n\nBut there are other types of stereoisomerism, such as cis-trans isomerism or geometric isomerism, which involve differences in spatial arrangement due to restricted rotation around double bonds or rings.\n\nHowever, optical isomerism specifically refers to molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images due to chirality.\n\nPerhaps one of the other compounds exhibits optical isomerism through a different mechanism, such as axial chirality or planar chirality, but that seems unlikely in these structures.\n\nLet me consider compound 1 again.\n\nDimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\nIs there any possibility of axial chirality in the biphenyl system?\n\nBiphenyl can exhibit atropisomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism due to restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings, leading to enantiomeric forms that are stable at room temperature.\n\nHowever, for atropisomerism to occur, the substitution pattern needs to be such that rotation around the central bond is hindered, typically by bulky groups ortho to the connection point.\n\nIn this compound, the phenyl rings have substituents at the 2 and 6 positions.\n\nIf the substituents are bulky enough, they could restrict rotation around the central bond, leading to enantiomeric forms.\n\nGiven that there are nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions, these are relatively large substituents.\n\nIt's possible that these substituents could cause sufficient steric hindrance to restrict rotation around the central bond, leading to atropisomerism.\n\nIf that's the case, then compound 1 could exhibit optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.\n\nFumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate, meaning the two carboxylate groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nIn general, trans double bonds can exhibit cis-trans isomerism, but this is not optical isomerism.\n\nHowever, if the double bond is part of a larger structure that imposes chirality, perhaps through cyclic constraints or other factors, but in this case, it's an open-chain molecule.\n\nI don't think dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nCompound 3: benzophenone.\n\nThis is a symmetric molecule with two identical phenyl rings connected by a carbonyl group.\n\nUnless there's some asymmetry introduced by substitution, which isn't the case here, benzophenone should not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism due to atropisomerism, and compound 2 does as well due to the presence of a chiral center.\n\nBut compound 3 and 4 do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might be C: 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm whether compound 1 indeed exhibits optical isomerism through atropisomerism.\n\nLooking back at compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.\n\nGiven that there are bulky nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions, it's plausible that rotation around the central bond is restricted, leading to enantiomeric forms.\n\nTherefore, compound 1 likely does exhibit optical isomerism through atropisomerism.\n\nCompound 2 clearly has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\nCompounds 3 and 4 do not have chiral centers and do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 3 and 4\n\nB. 2 and 3\n\nC. 1 and 2\n\nD. 1, 2 and 4\n\nGiven that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, and compounds 3 and 4 do not, the correct choice is C: 1 and 2.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
