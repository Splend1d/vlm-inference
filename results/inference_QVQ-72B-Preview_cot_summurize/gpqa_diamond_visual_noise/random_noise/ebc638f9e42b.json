So, we have an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud that's built a spaceship capable of traveling at an insane speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. They're heading towards Earth, and we need to figure out how long it will take for their 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some basics about relativity because speeds close to the speed of light involve some interesting effects, like time dilation. Time dilation means that time passes slower for someone moving at high speeds compared to someone who's stationary. So, from the astronaut's point of view, the trip will seem shorter than it would if they were traveling at a slower speed.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( t' \\) is the proper time (the time measured by the astronaut), \\( t \\) is the coordinate time (the time measured by someone stationary), and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nGiven that the spaceship is traveling at \\( v = 0.99999987c \\), I need to calculate \\( \\gamma \\) first.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2 = 0.999999740000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
