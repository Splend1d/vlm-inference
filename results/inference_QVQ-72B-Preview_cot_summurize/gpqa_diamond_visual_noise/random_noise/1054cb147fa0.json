                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4\u00d710^14 rad/s. We need to find the momentum of the photon that the molecule must absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. This model considers both the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule. The energy levels of such a molecule can be approximated by the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy levels.\n\nThe vibrational energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[E_v = \\hbar \\omega \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck's constant (\\(h/2\\pi\\))\n\n- \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of vibration\n\n- \\(v\\) is the vibrational quantum number (\\(v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\))\n\nThe rotational energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[E_r = \\frac{\\hbar^2 j (j + 1)}{2 I}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(j\\) is the rotational quantum number (\\(j = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\))\n\n- \\(I\\) is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\nBut in this problem, since we're dealing with the transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, I need to figure out which state that refers to. In the vibration-rotation spectrum, the fundamental state corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational levels, which are \\(v = 0\\) and \\(j = 0\\).\n\nThe next lowest energy state could either be the first vibrational excited state (\\(v = 1\\), \\(j = 0\\)) or the first rotational excited state (\\(v = 0\\), \\(j = 1\\)). The energy difference between these states and the fundamental state would correspond to different photon energies, and thus different photon momenta.\n\nI think I need to calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and then find the corresponding photon momenta. The problem asks for the momentum of the photon that should be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That probably refers to the transition with the smallest energy difference, which would be the pure rotational transition (\\(v = 0\\), \\(j = 0\\) to \\(v = 0\\), \\(j = 1\\)).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition (\\(v = 0\\) to \\(v = 1\\)).\n\nUsing the vibrational energy formula:\n\n\\[E_v = \\hbar \\omega \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nFor \\(v = 0\\):\n\n\\[E_{v=0} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\]\n\nFor \\(v = 1\\):\n\n\\[E_{v=1} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega\\]\n\nSo, the energy difference \\(\\Delta E_v = E_{v=1} - E_{v=0} = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega - \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega = \\hbar \\omega\\)\n\nNow, for the rotational transition (\\(j = 0\\) to \\(j = 1\\)):\n\nUsing the rotational energy formula:\n\n\\[E_r = \\frac{\\hbar^2 j (j + 1)}{2 I}\\]\n\nFor \\(j = 0\\):\n\n\\[E_{j=0} = 0\\]\n\nFor \\(j = 1\\):\n\n\\[E_{j=1} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 (1)(2)}{2 I} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\]\n\nSo, the energy difference \\(\\Delta E_r = E_{j=1} - E_{j=0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\)\n\nGiven that the rotational transition has a lower energy difference compared to the vibrational transition, I suspect that the problem is referring to the rotational transition as the next state with the lowest possible energy.\n\nTherefore, I need to calculate \\(\\Delta E_r = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\), and then find the momentum of the photon that corresponds to this energy difference.\n\nFirst, I need to find the moment of inertia \\(I\\) of the diatomic molecule. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is given by:\n\n\\[I = \\mu r^2\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass of the molecule\n\n- \\(r\\) is the bond length\n\nThe reduced mass \\(\\mu\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\\mu = \\frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y}\\]\n\nGiven that the masses are in atomic mass units (amu), I need to convert them to kilograms for consistency in units. The conversion factor is:\n\n\\[1 \\text{ amu} = 1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[m_X = 20 \\text{ amu} = 20 \\times 1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} = 3.32108 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}\\]\n\n\\[m_Y = 2 \\text{ amu} = 2 \\times 1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} = 3.32108 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nNow, the reduced mass:\n\n\\[\\mu = \\frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \\frac{(3.32108 \\times 10^{-26})(3.32108 \\times 10^{-27})}{3.32108 \\times 10^{-26} + 3.32108 \\times 10^{-27}}\\]\n\nLet's compute the numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator:\n\n\\[3.32108 \\times 10^{-26} \\times 3.32108 \\times 10^{-27} = 1.103 \\times 10^{-52} \\text{ kg}^2\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[3.32108 \\times 10^{-26} + 3.32108 \\times 10^{-27} = 3.32108 \\times 10^{-26} + 0.332108 \\times 10^{-26} = 3.653188 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\mu = \\frac{1.103 \\times 10^{-52}}{3.653188 \\times 10^{-26}} = \\frac{1.103}{3.653188} \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg}\\)\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{1.103}{3.653188}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.103}{3.653188} \\approx 0.299 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\mu \\approx 0.299 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} = 2.99 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}\\)\n\nNow, the moment of inertia \\(I = \\mu r^2\\), where \\(r = 2\\) angstroms. Converting angstroms to meters:\n\n\\[1 \\text{ angstrom} = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ meters}\\]\n\nSo, \\(r = 2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[I = 2.99 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2 = 2.99 \\times 10^{-27} \\times 4 \\times 10^{-20} = 11.96 \\times 10^{-47} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[11.96 \\times 10^{-47} = 1.196 \\times 10^{-45} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^2\\]\n\nNow, the energy difference for the rotational transition is:\n\n\\[\\Delta E_r = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\), and \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, which is approximately \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\hbar = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\\Delta E_r = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{1.196 \\times 10^{-45}} = \\frac{1.110 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.196 \\times 10^{-45}} \\approx 9.28 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nNow, the energy of a photon is given by:\n\n\\[E = h \\nu = h \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = p c\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant\n\n- \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength\n\n- \\(p\\) is the photon momentum\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light\n\nSo, the momentum of the photon is:\n\n\\[p = \\frac{E}{c}\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[p = \\frac{\\Delta E_r}{c} = \\frac{9.28 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 3.09 \\times 10^{-32} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nWait, that seems too small compared to the options provided. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, the reduced mass calculation:\n\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \\frac{20 \\text{ amu} \\times 2 \\text{ amu}}{20 \\text{ amu} + 2 \\text{ amu}} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{20}{11} \\text{ amu} \\approx 1.818 \\text{ amu}\\]\n\nConverting to kg:\n\n\\[1.818 \\text{ amu} \\times 1.66054 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} = 3.01 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nThen, moment of inertia:\n\n\\[I = \\mu r^2 = 3.01 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2 = 3.01 \\times 10^{-27} \\times 4 \\times 10^{-20} = 12.04 \\times 10^{-47} \\text{ kg m}^2 = 1.204 \\times 10^{-45} \\text{ kg m}^2\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\Delta E_r = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{1.204 \\times 10^{-45}} = \\frac{1.110 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.204 \\times 10^{-45}} \\approx 9.22 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}\\)\n\nThen, \\(p = \\frac{\\Delta E_r}{c} = \\frac{9.22 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 3.07 \\times 10^{-32} \\text{ kg m/s}\\)\n\nHmm, this is much smaller than the options provided. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider that the problem might be referring to the vibrational transition instead of the rotational one. Maybe the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" is the first vibrational excited state.\n\nLet's calculate the energy difference for the vibrational transition.\n\nGiven that \\(\\Delta E_v = \\hbar \\omega\\), and \\(\\omega = 4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}\\), then:\n\n\\[\\Delta E_v = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 4 \\times 10^{14} = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nThen, the photon momentum would be:\n\n\\[p = \\frac{\\Delta E_v}{c} = \\frac{4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}} \\approx 1.405 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. p = 2.3\u00d710^(-27) N*s\n\nB. p = 1.1\u00d710^(-27) N*s\n\nC. p = 1.4\u00d710^(-28) N*s\n\nD. p = 1.9\u00d710^(-28) N*s\n\nMy calculation for the vibrational transition gives approximately 1.4\u00d710^(-28) N*s, which matches option C.\n\nBut I also calculated a much smaller value for the rotational transition, which seems correct based on the formulas. However, the problem states that the molecule should switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would typically be the first rotational excited state.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the rotational transition corresponds to a much smaller momentum, whereas the vibrational transition corresponds to a larger momentum, which matches one of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition. Maybe it's the vibrational transition combined with the rotational one.\n\nLet me think about the selection rules for vibration-rotation transitions. The vibrational quantum number changes by one (\\(\\Delta v = \\pm 1\\)), and the rotational quantum number changes by one (\\(\\Delta j = \\pm 1\\)), with certain conditions.\n\nSo, possible transitions from the ground state (\\(v = 0\\), \\(j = 0\\)) could be to (\\(v = 1\\), \\(j = 1\\)), which would combine both vibrational and rotational changes.\n\nThe energy difference for such a transition would be:\n\n\\[\\Delta E = \\Delta E_v + \\Delta E_r = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\\Delta E = (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 4 \\times 10^{14}) + (9.22 \\times 10^{-24}) = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20} + 9.22 \\times 10^{-24} \\approx 4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nSo, the momentum would be:\n\n\\[p = \\frac{4.216 \\times 10^{-20}}{3.00 \\times 10^{8}} \\approx 1.405 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\n\nWhich again matches option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the molecule transitions to (\\(v = 1\\), \\(j = 0\\)), the energy difference would be only the vibrational part, which is \\(\\hbar \\omega\\), leading to the same momentum.\n\nIf it transitions to (\\(v = 0\\), \\(j = 1\\)), the energy difference is \\(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}\\), which gives a much smaller momentum, as calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\", I think it's referring to the first vibrational excited state, since rotational transitions typically involve much smaller energy changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: p = 1.4\u00d710^(-28) N*s.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible interpretation.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition in combination with the vibrational transition, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the units. Let's double-check the units conversion.\n\nGiven that 1 amu = 1.66054\u00d710^(-27) kg, and 1 angstrom = 1\u00d710^(-10) m, the calculations seem consistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the problem is using different units or expecting a different calculation.\n\nWait, the options are given in N*s, which is equivalent to kg m/s, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the momentum in terms of the reduced mass and bond length differently.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using the formula for the rotational constant B:\n\n\\[B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 \\mu I}\\]\n\nAnd the rotational energy levels are:\n\n\\[E_j = 2 B j (j + 1)\\]\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent with what I wrote earlier. Let me check.\n\nActually"
