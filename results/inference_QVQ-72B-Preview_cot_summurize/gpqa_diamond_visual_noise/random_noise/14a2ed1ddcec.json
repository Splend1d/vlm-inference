                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have Substance X, which is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its close analog are used in organic chemistry.\n\nOur task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, considering all isotopes.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the substances involved.\n\nGiven that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and it's used in organic chemistry, it likely contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen, as these are common in organic compounds and have isotopes.\n\nGas W has molecules containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about what that means. If the number of neutrons equals the number of protons, then the atomic number (protons) equals the mass number minus the atomic number (neutrons). So, if protons = neutrons, then protons = mass number - protons \u2192 2 protons = mass number. The only elements that fit this are hydrogen isotopes: protium (1H), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H). But deuterium has one proton and one neutron, and tritium has one proton and two neutrons. Wait, that doesn't fit our condition of protons = neutrons.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps W is a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of neutrons as protons.\n\nLet's consider hydrogen again. Protium has one proton and no neutrons, deuterium has one proton and one neutron, and tritium has one proton and two neutrons. So, only deuterium fits the condition of protons = neutrons.\n\nBut W is a gas, so it's likely a diatomic molecule like H\u2082, N\u2082, O\u2082, etc. If W is H\u2082 made from deuterium, then it would be D\u2082, which has two deuterium atoms, each with one proton and one neutron, so protons = neutrons per molecule.\n\nBut the problem says \"the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons,\" which would imply that the entire molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons in its atoms combined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each atom in the molecule has the same number of neutrons as protons. In that case, deuterium fits, as it has one proton and one neutron.\n\nBut W is a gas, so it's likely a diatomic molecule like D\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a molecule like CO, which has 6 protons in carbon and 8 protons in oxygen, and neutrons to match, but I don't see how that would have protons = neutrons overall.\n\nWait, nitrogen (N\u2082) has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in the most abundant isotope, so that fits protons = neutrons per atom. So, N\u2082 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons in total, which is protons = neutrons for the molecule.\n\nOxygen (O\u2082) has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the most abundant isotope, so similarly, protons = neutrons per atom and molecule.\n\nBut the problem specifies that W is a gas whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So, N\u2082 and O\u2082 fit this description.\n\nBut earlier, it says that Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release W and form G, which upon heating releases B with a melting point close to 277 K.\n\n277 K is about 4\u00b0C, which is near room temperature.\n\nSo, B is likely a substance with a melting point around 4\u00b0C.\n\nGiven that, and considering common chemicals, perhaps B is carbon dioxide (dry ice melts at about -78\u00b0C), but that's too low. Water melts at 0\u00b0C, but that's also not close to 4\u00b0C.\n\nMaybe B is a metal or another compound with a melting point around 4\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is a gas released upon heating G.\n\nWait, G forms upon reaction of X with Y, and when G is heated, it releases B.\n\nIf G is a carbonate, for example, heating it could release carbon dioxide.\n\nBut carbon dioxide has a melting point of -78\u00b0C, which is not close to 4\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, if G is a hydrate, heating could release water, but water melts at 0\u00b0C.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is oxygen, which melts at -218\u00b0C, or nitrogen at -210\u00b0C, both too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B is a noble gas like argon, but its melting point is -189\u00b0C.\n\nThis is getting tricky.\n\nLet's think about the reaction of X with Y releasing W and G, and G upon heating releases B.\n\nPerhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes to release carbon dioxide, but as mentioned, CO\u2082 melts at -78\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G is a hydrate that releases water upon heating, but water melts at 0\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G is a metal oxide that releases oxygen upon heating, but oxygen melts at -218\u00b0C.\n\nThis isn't adding up.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nGiven that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and it's used in organic chemistry, it likely contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen.\n\nAlso, the product of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n\nA keto acid typically contains a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group, so it would have at least one oxygen atom.\n\nIf it reacts with X to form a product with 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps X is something like hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), which has two oxygen atoms and is used in organic chemistry.\n\nBut hydrogen peroxide doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements in a typical sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a compound like D\u2082O (heavy water), which incorporates deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nD\u2082O is used in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope.\n\nBut D\u2082O doesn't contain oxygen, so if it reacts with a keto acid to form a product with 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps the oxygen comes from the keto acid itself.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction involves oxidation or something, but this is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's consider another angle.\n\nThe problem mentions that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X need to be calculated, considering all isotopes.\n\nSo, if X contains multiple instances of an element, we need to sum the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes.\n\nFirst, we need to identify what elements are in X.\n\nGiven that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and it's used in organic chemistry, likely it contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen.\n\nAlso, considering that it reacts with liquid Y to release a gas W and form a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B with a melting point close to 277 K (4\u00b0C), and that the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps X is involved in some oxidation reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a peroxide or something similar.\n\nGiven that, perhaps X is hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), which is used in organic chemistry and contains oxygen.\n\nBut hydrogen peroxide doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope; it's already a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is D\u2082O\u2082, which would be deuterium peroxide, incorporating deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDeuterium peroxide does exist and is used in some chemical reactions.\n\nSo, perhaps X is D\u2082O\u2082.\n\nNow, D\u2082O\u2082 contains deuterium (D), oxygen-16 (O), and possibly oxygen-18, but the problem specifies incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n\nDeuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen, so that fits.\n\nSo, X contains deuterium and oxygen.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.\n\nFirst, identify the elements: hydrogen (as deuterium) and oxygen.\n\nDeuterium is an isotope of hydrogen with mass approximately 2 amu.\n\nOxygen primarily has isotopes O-16 (16 amu), O-17 (17 amu), and O-18 (18 amu).\n\nNow, the lightest element in X is hydrogen (deuterium), with mass 2 amu.\n\nThe heaviest element is oxygen, with O-18 at 18 amu.\n\nBut the problem says to consider all isotopes, so for hydrogen, we have deuterium at 2 amu, and for oxygen, O-16 at 16 amu, O-17 at 17 amu, and O-18 at 18 amu.\n\nNow, the cumulative atomic masses would be the sum of the masses of all isotopes of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\nSo, for hydrogen (deuterium), it's just 2 amu.\n\nFor oxygen, it's 16 + 17 + 18 = 51 amu.\n\nSo, cumulative atomic masses would be 2 + 51 = 53 amu.\n\nBut that's not one of the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering their isotopes.\n\nSo, for hydrogen, the isotope present is deuterium at 2 amu.\n\nFor oxygen, the heaviest isotope is O-18 at 18 amu.\n\nSo, sum would be 2 + 18 = 20 amu.\n\nBut again, that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the atomic masses of all unique elements in X, considering their isotopes.\n\nSo, hydrogen (deuterium at 2 amu) and oxygen (16, 17, 18 amu), totaling 2 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 53 amu.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the molecular formula of X.\n\nIf X is D\u2082O\u2082, its molecular mass would be 2(D) + 2(O) = 2(2) + 2(16) = 4 + 32 = 36 amu.\n\nBut again, that's not directly relevant to the question asked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering all possible isotopes, meaning sum of the atomic masses of all isotopes of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\nSo, for hydrogen (deuterium), it's just 2 amu.\n\nFor oxygen, it's 16 + 17 + 18 = 51 amu.\n\nTotal sum: 2 + 51 = 53 amu.\n\nBut since 53 isn't an option, perhaps I'm misidentifying X.\n\nLet's consider another possibility.\n\nMaybe X is D\u2082O, heavy water, which contains deuterium and oxygen.\n\nBut D\u2082O doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope in the way described; it's just a different form of water.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide like D\u2082O\u2082, as previously thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a compound like D\u2082O\u2082, but considering that, I still arrive at the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and incorporates a heavier isotope like carbon-13 or oxygen-18.\n\nBut the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and it's used in organic chemistry.\n\nIf X contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps it's a labeled compound like [1-13C]glucose or something, but that seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is a simple compound like methanol (CH\u2083OH), and the heavier isotope is deuterium in place of hydrogen, like CH\u2083OD.\n\nBut CH\u2083OD still contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, with deuterium as a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nSo, elements present are carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen (including deuterium).\n\nNow, the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all isotopes.\n\nLightest element: hydrogen (including deuterium at 2 amu).\n\nHeaviest element: carbon (12 amu for C-12, 13 amu for C-13).\n\nSo, cumulative atomic masses would be sum of isotopes of hydrogen and carbon.\n\nHydrogen isotopes: protium (1 amu), deuterium (2 amu), tritium (3 amu), totaling 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 amu.\n\nCarbon isotopes: C-12 (12 amu), C-13 (13 amu), C-14 (14 amu), totaling 12 + 13 + 14 = 39 amu.\n\nSum: 6 + 39 = 45 amu.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering their most abundant isotopes.\n\nSo, hydrogen: 1 amu (protium), carbon: 12 amu (C-12), sum: 1 + 12 = 13 amu.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the sum of the atomic masses of all unique elements in X, considering their isotopes.\n\nSo, hydrogen: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 amu.\n\nCarbon: 12 + 13 + 14 = 39 amu.\n\nOxygen: 16 + 17 + 18 = 51 amu.\n\nTotal sum: 6 + 39 + 51 = 96 amu.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen, like methane (CH\u2084), and incorporates a heavier isotope like deuterium, making CH\u2083D, for example.\n\nThen, elements present are carbon and hydrogen (including deuterium).\n\nCumulative atomic masses of lightest and heaviest elements, considering all isotopes.\n\nLightest: hydrogen (1, 2, 3 amu).\n\nHeaviest: carbon (12, 13, 14 amu).\n\nSum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 45 amu.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing only oxygen and hydrogen, like hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082).\n\nIf X is H\u2082O\u2082 and incorporates deuterium, making D\u2082O\u2082.\n\nThen, elements present are hydrogen (including deuterium) and oxygen.\n\nCumulative atomic masses: hydrogen isotopes (1, 2, 3 amu) and oxygen isotopes (16, 17, 18 amu).\n\nSum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 16 + 17 + 18 = 57 amu.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider that X is a compound containing only one type of element with a heavier isotope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and the heavier isotope is oxygen-18.\n\nBut then, oxygen has isotopes O-16, O-17, O-18.\n\nSo, cumulative atomic masses would include oxygen isotopes.\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is a compound containing only carbon and oxygen, like carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), and incorporates a heavier isotope like carbon-13 or oxygen-18.\n\nBut again, that leads to similar sums.\n\nI think I'm missing something fundamental here.\n\nLet's look back at the problem.\n\nSubstance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n\nIt reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form precipitate G.\n\nHeating G releases B, with a melting point close to 277 K (4\u00b0C).\n\nThe product of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n\nX and its close analog are used in organic chemistry.\n\nWe need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes.\n\nPerhaps the key is to identify X based on the reactions and properties given.\n\nLet's consider that X reacts violently with liquid Y to release W and form G.\n\nIf Y is a liquid, it could be water, alcohol, etc.\n\nIf X is something like a peroxide, reacting with water could release oxygen or hydrogen gas.\n\nBut earlier, I considered W as a gas with protons = neutrons per molecule, which could be N\u2082 or O\u2082, but their melting points don't match B's melting point of ~4\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps W is a different gas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to lead us towards identifying X as a specific compound.\n\nGiven that X is used in organic chemistry and incorporates a heavier isotope, perhaps it's deuterium oxide (D\u2082O), which is heavy water.\n\nD\u2082O is used in organic chemistry and incorporates deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nNow, D\u2082O reacts with liquid Y to release W and form G.\n\nIf Y is another compound, say, a metal carbonate, D\u2082O could react to release carbon dioxide (W) and form a hydroxide precipitate (G).\n\nHeating G could release B, perhaps oxygen or another gas.\n\nBut again, carbon dioxide melts at -78\u00b0C, which doesn't match 4\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating it could release water, which melts at 0\u00b0C, still not matching 4\u00b0C.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is a ketone, and X is something that reacts with it to incorporate oxygen.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet's consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps X is a compound that contains oxygen and hydrogen, and incorporates deuterium.\n\nGiven that, and considering the reaction with Y to release W and form G, which upon heating releases B with a melting point close to 4\u00b0C.\n\nAlso, the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nPerhaps X is hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), and the heavier isotope is deuterium, making D\u2082O\u2082.\n\nH\u2082O\u2082 reacts with certain compounds to release oxygen and form other products.\n\nIf we consider that, then W could be oxygen gas (O\u2082), which melts at -218"
