                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a supernova that's occurred in our Galaxy, and part of its ejecta is heading straight towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. We need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.\n\nFirst off, since both frames are inertial, we can use special relativity to relate their measurements of distance and time. The key here is to understand the relative speeds and how time dilation might play a role.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\(v\\) = relative speed between the ejecta and the Galactic center = 60,000 km/s\n\n- \\(t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\) = time measured in the ejecta's frame = 50 seconds\n\nWe need to find \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}}\\), the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame during this time.\n\nBut wait a minute, in special relativity, distance and time are related through the velocity. The formula to relate the distances in two inertial frames moving relative to each other at constant velocity is:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}}\\]\n\nHowever, we have \\(t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), and we need to find \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}}\\). The relationship between these times involves time dilation:\n\n\\[t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nHere, \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately \\(300,000\\) km/s.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the values to find \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{60,000}{300,000}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{25}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{24}{25}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}} = \\frac{5}{2\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 1.051\\]\n\nSo, \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = 1.051 \\times 50 \\) seconds \\(= 52.55\\) seconds\n\nThen, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 52.55 \\, \\text{seconds} = 3,153,000 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nHmm, but none of the options match this result. Let's see if I've made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I need to consider the velocity addition formula or something else. Let me think differently.\n\nActually, in this scenario, since both the ejecta and the Galactic center are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s relative to each other, and we're dealing with speeds much less than the speed of light, maybe I can approximate without using full special relativity.\n\nBut no, at 60,000 km/s, which is one-fifth the speed of light, relativistic effects are significant, so I should stick with special relativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the proper time and the time in the moving frame differently. Let me recall that in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and time is dilated in the Galaxy's frame relative to the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, actually, the ejecta's frame is the one moving relative to the Galaxy's frame at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated relative to the ejecta's frame.\n\nBut in this problem, we're given the time in the ejecta's frame, and we need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nLet me try a different approach. In special relativity, the relative velocity between two inertial frames is handled by the velocity addition formula, but since they are moving directly towards each other, the relative velocity is simply \\(v\\).\n\nThe distance covered in the Galaxy's frame would be \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}}\\), where \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}}\\) is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nGiven that time dilation relates \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, which I already calculated as approximately 1.051, then:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 52.55 \\, \\text{seconds} = 3,153,000 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider length contraction instead.\n\nWait, in special relativity, length contraction applies to measured distances when observed from a moving frame. But in this case, we're dealing with the distance traveled over a certain time, not the spatial separation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance should be calculated using the ejecta's velocity and the time in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nLet me try to calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame again.\n\nGiven that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy, and time dilation factor \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\), which is approximately 1.051, as calculated earlier.\n\nThen, \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 1.051 \\times 50 = 52.55\\) seconds\n\nAnd \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}} = 60,000 \\times 52.55 = 3,153,000\\) km\n\nStill getting the same result, which doesn't match any options.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have the ejecta moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. Then, in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center would be approaching at the same speed, due to the symmetry of relative velocity in special relativity.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in special relativity, velocities don't add up the same way at speeds close to the speed of light. The relative velocity between two inertial frames moving towards each other is \\(v\\), and the velocity of the Galactic center in the ejecta's frame would be \\(-v\\), since they are moving towards each other at speed \\(v\\).\n\nBut perhaps I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula to find the relative velocity.\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition is:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{relative}} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}\\]\n\nIn this case, since both are moving towards each other at \\(v\\), and both are inertial frames, the relative velocity should indeed be \\(v\\).\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is approaching at \\(v = 60,000\\) km/s.\n\nNow, the distance covered in the ejecta's frame over time \\(t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 50\\) seconds would be:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{ejecta}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 60,000 \\times 50 = 3,000,000 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nBut this is the distance in the ejecta's frame. We need the distance in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame.\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, time is 50 seconds, and in the Galaxy's frame, time is dilated to \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the distance in the Galaxy's frame should be:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 60,000 \\times 1.051 \\times 50 = 3,153,000 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nAgain, I'm getting this result, which isn't matching any of the options. Maybe there's a mistake in the Lorentz factor calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate \\(\\gamma\\):\n\nGiven \\(v = 60,000\\) km/s, \\(c = 300,000\\) km/s,\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{60,000}{300,000}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{25}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{24}{25}}} = \\frac{5}{2\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 1.051\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = 1.051 \\times 50 = 52.55\\) seconds\n\nThen, \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}} = 60,000 \\times 52.55 = 3,153,000\\) km\n\nBut this isn't among the options. Maybe I need to consider length contraction instead.\n\nIn special relativity, lengths are contracted in the direction of motion. The formula for length contraction is:\n\n\\[L = L_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\]\n\nBut in this scenario, I'm not sure if this directly applies, because we're dealing with the distance traveled over time, not the measurement of a spatial length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance should be calculated using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame and the time in the ejecta's frame, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the proper time. In special relativity, the proper time is the time measured in the frame of the moving object, which in this case is the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, \\(t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 50\\) seconds is the proper time.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, time is dilated, so \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), which is what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach using the concept of simultaneity or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance in the Galaxy's frame is different due to length contraction.\n\nWait, if the ejecta travels a certain distance in its own frame, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame would be contracted.\n\nBut no, the distance traveled is along the relative velocity direction, so length contraction might apply.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. In the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is approaching at the same speed.\n\nNow, in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the Galactic center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s, and in 50 seconds, it would have decreased by 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut in the Galaxy's frame, this time interval would be dilated to \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), and the distance covered would be \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 60,000 \\times 1.051 \\times 50 = 3,153,000\\) km\n\nStill getting the same result. Maybe I need to consider that the distance is contracted in the ejecta's frame.\n\nWait, no. The ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, so the distance between them is changing over time. It's not a static length to contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance in the Galaxy's frame is less due to length contraction.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nIn special relativity, the distance between two points moving relative to each other is contracted in the direction of motion by a factor of \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nSo, the distance in the Galaxy's frame would be:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{ejecta}}}{\\gamma} = \\frac{3,000,000}{1.051} \\approx 2,854,748.6 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nThis is close to option A, 2,880,000 km.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive because if the ejecta travels 3,000,000 km in its own frame, how can it be less in the Galaxy's frame? Shouldn't it be more due to time dilation?\n\nI think I'm confusing distance with displacement.\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and in 50 seconds, it covers a distance of 3,000,000 km.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s, and the time interval corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is dilated to \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the distance covered in the Galaxy's frame should be:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}} = 60,000 \\times 1.051 \\times 50 = 3,153,000 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nBut according to the length contraction formula, the distance in the Galaxy's frame should be:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{ejecta}}}{\\gamma} = \\frac{3,000,000}{1.051} \\approx 2,854,748.6 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that I'm misunderstanding how to apply these concepts.\n\nPerhaps the distance covered is not directly related to length contraction. Length contraction applies to spatial lengths, not to distances traveled over time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the spacetime interval.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the invariant spacetime interval formula:\n\n\\[s^2 = d^2 - c^2 t^2\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the proper distance, but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to look up how to handle such problems in special relativity.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that when dealing with relative motion and time intervals, it's crucial to distinguish between spatial distances and the spacetime intervals.\n\nIn this case, the distance traveled is related to the relative velocity and the time interval in each frame.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center approaches at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, covering 3,000,000 km.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, the time interval is dilated to \\(t_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), and the distance covered should be \\(d_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot t_{\\text{galaxy}} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot t_{\\text{ejecta}}\\).\n\nHowever, this leads back to the earlier result of 3,153,000 km, which doesn't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance in the Galaxy's frame is less due to length contraction, as I previously considered, giving approximately 2,854,748.6 km, which is close to option A, 2,880,000 km.\n\nBut I need to confirm if length contraction is applicable here.\n\nLet me consider that the distance between the ejecta and the Galactic center is a spatial separation, and thus subject to length contraction when measured from a moving frame.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the initial distance to the Galactic center is \\(d_{\\text{ejecta}}\\), and it decreases by 3,000,000 km in 50 seconds.\n\nIn the Galaxy's frame, this distance should be contracted by a factor of \\(\\gamma\\), so:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{ejecta}}}{\\gamma}\\]\n\nBut in this case, \\(d_{\\text{ejecta}} = 3,000,000\\) km, so:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{galaxy}} = \\frac{3,000,000}{1.051} \\approx 2,854,748.6 \\, \\text{km}\\]\n\nThis is very close to option A, 2,880,000 km. The difference might be due to rounding errors in calculating \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct"
