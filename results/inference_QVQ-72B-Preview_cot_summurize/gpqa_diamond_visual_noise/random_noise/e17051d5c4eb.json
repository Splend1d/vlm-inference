                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. We have six different benzene derivatives, and we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo an electrophilic substitution with bromine. So, first things first, I need to understand what factors influence the direction of substitution in these compounds.\n\nI know that in electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituents already present on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to either the ortho and para positions or the meta position. Directing groups can be either activating or deactivating, which also affects the reactivity of the ring.\n\nLet me recall the general rules:\n\n1. **Activating groups** that are **ortho-para directors**: These groups increase the electron density at the ortho and para positions, making them more reactive towards electrophiles. Examples include alkyl groups, hydroxyl, amino, and halo groups (though less strongly activating).\n\n2. **Deactivating groups** that are **meta directors**: These groups decrease the electron density at the ortho and para positions, making them less reactive towards electrophiles. Examples include nitro, sulfonyl, carbonyl groups, and carboxylic acid groups.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\n1. C6H5-CH3 (toluene)\n\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)\n\n3. C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)\n\n4. C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)\n\n6. C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)\n\nNow, I need to determine the directing effect of each substituent and how that affects the formation of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's go through each one:\n\n1. **C6H5-CH3 (toluene)**:\n\n   - The methyl group is an activating group and directs incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n\n   - The para position in toluene is more substituted than the ortho positions, so the para position might be slightly less reactive due to steric hindrance, but generally, both ortho and para positions are favored.\n\n2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)**:\n\n   - The ester group is a deactivating group and directs incoming substituents to the meta position.\n\n   - Therefore, the para position is disfavored.\n\n3. **C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)**:\n\n   - The chlorine atom is a weak deactivator and directs incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions.\n\n   - However, it's slightly deactivating, so the para position might not be as favored as in toluene.\n\n4. **C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)**:\n\n   - The nitro group is a strong deactivating group and directs incoming substituents to the meta position.\n\n   - Thus, the para position is disfavored.\n\n5. **C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)**:\n\n   - The ethyl group is similar to the methyl group, being an activating group and directing to ortho and para positions.\n\n   - Since it's larger than methyl, there might be more steric hindrance at the para position.\n\n6. **C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)**:\n\n   - The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating group and directs incoming substituents to the meta position.\n\n   - Therefore, the para position is disfavored.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that compounds 1 (toluene), 3 (chlorobenzene), and 5 (ethylbenzene) have substituents that direct to ortho and para positions, while compounds 2 (ethyl benzoate), 4 (nitrobenzene), and 6 (benzoic acid) have substituents that direct to the meta position.\n\nHowever, within the ortho-para directing groups, there are differences in their activating abilities and potential steric effects.\n\nLet me consider the yield of the para-isomer in each case:\n\n- **Compounds with ortho-para directors**:\n\n  - Toluene (1): Methyl is activating, so para substitution is favored.\n\n  - Chlorobenzene (3): Chlorine is weakly deactivating but still directs to para.\n\n  - Ethylbenzene (5): Ethyl is more bulky than methyl, so para substitution might be slightly less favored due to steric hindrance.\n\n- **Compounds with meta directors**:\n\n  - Ethyl benzoate (2): Est\u0435\u0440 group directs to meta, disfavoring para.\n\n  - Nitrobenzene (4): Nitro group strongly directs to meta, strongly disfavoring para.\n\n  - Benzoic acid (6): Carboxylic acid group directs to meta, disfavoring para.\n\nSo, among the ortho-para directing compounds (1,3,5), we need to see which one gives the least para-isomer.\n\nSimilarly, among the meta directing compounds (2,4,6), we need to see which one might still give some para-isomer, perhaps due to statistical reasons or minor directation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ortho-para directing group compounds:\n\n1. Toluene: Methyl is a strong activator and directs to para.\n\n3. Chlorobenzene: Chlorine is a weaker activator and directs to para, but it's slightly deactivating.\n\n5. Ethylbenzene: Ethyl is a stronger activator than chlorine but more bulky, possibly causing some steric hindrance at para.\n\nI think the order for these would be: 5 < 1 < 3\n\nBecause ethylbenzene has a bulkier group, which might hinder para substitution more than toluene, and chlorobenzene has a weaker directing effect.\n\nNow, for the meta directing group compounds:\n\n2. Ethyl benzoate: Est\u0435r group directs to meta, disfavoring para.\n\n4. Nitrobenzene: Nitro group strongly directs to meta, strongly disfavoring para.\n\n6. Benzoic acid: Carboxylic acid group directs to meta, disfavoring para.\n\nHere, nitrobenzene has the strongest deactivation and meta direction, so it should give the least para-isomer.\n\nBenzoic acid and ethyl benzoate are both meta directors, but benzoic acid is more deactivating than the ester group, so it should give less para-isomer than ethyl benzoate.\n\nTherefore, the order for these would be: 4 < 6 < 2\n\nCombining both, the overall order should be: meta directors < ortho-para directors with weaker activation < ortho-para directors with stronger activation.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nB. 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nC. 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nBased on my reasoning:\n\n- Meta directors should have less para-isomer yield: 4, 6, 2\n\n- Ortho-para directors: 3, 1, 5\n\nBut within ortho-para directors, 5 (ethylbenzene) might have less para-isomer due to steric hindrance compared to 1 (toluene), and 3 (chlorobenzene) has weaker activation.\n\nSo, the order should be: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nWhich corresponds to option D.\n\nWait, but option D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which is similar but not exactly matching my order of 4<6<2<3<1<5.\n\nMaybe I need to double-check the order within the ortho-para directors.\n\nConsidering:\n\n- Chlorobenzene (3): Weak activation, slightly deactivating nature.\n\n- Toluene (1): Stronger activation.\n\n- Ethylbenzene (5): Stronger activation but more steric hindrance.\n\nSo, perhaps the order is 3 < 1 < 5, meaning chlorobenzene gives less para-isomer than toluene, and toluene gives less than ethylbenzene due to steric hindrance.\n\nBut earlier I thought ethylbenzene might have less para-isomer due to steric hindrance.\n\nLet me check a standard reference or recall if possible.\n\nI recall that in toluene, the methyl group directs to ortho and para, and the para position is slightly less substituted due to steric effects, but still, para substitution is favored.\n\nIn ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is bulkier, so perhaps para substitution is even more hindered.\n\nChlorobenzene, while the chlorine is ortho-para directing, it's slightly deactivating, so para substitution might be less favored compared to toluene.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the order is 3 < 1 < 5.\n\nBut in option D, it's 4<6<2<1<5<3, which has 1 before 5, suggesting that toluene gives more para-isomer than ethylbenzene, which contradicts my earlier thought that ethylbenzene might have less para-isomer due to steric hindrance.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink this.\n\nIf the ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group, it might hinder the approach of the electrophile to the para position more than to the ortho position, leading to a relatively lower yield of para-substituted product in ethylbenzene compared to toluene.\n\nTherefore, ethylbenzene would give less para-isomer than toluene.\n\nSo, the order should be: 4 (nitrobenzene) < 6 (benzoic acid) < 2 (ethyl benzoate) < 3 (chlorobenzene) < 1 (toluene) < 5 (ethylbenzene)\n\nWhich matches option D: 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nWait, but in option D, it's 4<6<2<1<5<3, which seems consistent with my corrected reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
