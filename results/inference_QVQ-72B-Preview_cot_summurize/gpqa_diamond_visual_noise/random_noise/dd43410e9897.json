                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, and we're ignoring their spin angular momenta. The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as |1, 1, 2, -1>. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because p orbitals have l = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the z-component m is -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -\u0127. To approach this, I need to recall how angular momenta couple and how to find probabilities in quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for two angular momenta l1 and l2, they can couple to give a total angular momentum l, where l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. In this case, l1 = 1 and l2 = 1, so l can be 0, 1, or 2. But here, it's specified as l = 2.\n\nThe coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is an eigenstate of L1^2, L2^2, L^2, and L_z. The eigenvalues are:\n\n- L1^2 = l1(l1 + 1) \u0127^2 = 2 \u0127^2\n\n- L2^2 = l2(l2 + 1) \u0127^2 = 2 \u0127^2\n\n- L^2 = l(l + 1) \u0127^2 = 6 \u0127^2\n\n- L_z = m \u0127 = -1 \u0127\n\nNow, to find the probabilities of measuring specific values of L1z and L2z, we need to express the coupled state in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, where m1 and m2 are the z-components of L1 and L2, respectively.\n\nThe relationship between the coupled states and the product states is given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For l1 = 1 and l2 = 1 coupling to l = 2, the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1> can be expanded as:\n\n|1, 1, 2, -1> = sum over m1 and m2 of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m> * |m1, m2>\n\nBut to find the probability of measuring specific m1 and m2, we need to look at the coefficients where m1 + m2 = m = -1.\n\nSo, possible combinations for m1 and m2 are:\n\n1. m1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 for l = 1 can only be -1, 0, 1 \u2192 not possible\n\n2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 \u2192 possible\n\n3. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 \u2192 possible\n\n4. m1 = -1, m2 = -1 \u2192 but m2 can't be -1 and -1 simultaneously\n\nWait, m1 and m2 are the z-components of L1 and L2, respectively, and each can take values -1, 0, or 1 for l = 1. Since they are independent, the possible combinations are:\n\n- (1, -2) \u2192 invalid\n\n- (0, -1) \u2192 valid\n\n- (-1, 0) \u2192 valid\n\n- (-1, -1) \u2192 invalid\n\nSo, only two valid combinations where m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients for these combinations in the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1>.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1 are:\n\n1. <1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1>\n\n2. <1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1>\n\nWe need to find these coefficients.\n\nFrom quantum mechanics tables or calculations, for l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2:\n\n<1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1> = -\u221a(1/3)\n\n<1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1> = \u221a(2/3)\n\nSo, the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1> can be written as:\n\n|1, 1, 2, -1> = -\u221a(1/3) |0, -1> + \u221a(2/3) |-1, 0>\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127. That would correspond to the product state |-1, -1>, but wait, that's not one of the valid combinations we have. The only valid combinations are |0, -1> and |-1, 0>. So, measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127 is not possible in this coupled state because there's no component in the state where both m1 and m2 are -1 simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nGiven that l1 = l2 = 1, and l = 2, m = -1, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are indeed (0, -1) and (-1, 0), as shown earlier. There is no contribution from (1, -2) or (-1, -1), because m2 can only be -1, 0, or 1.\n\nHence, the state |1, 1, 2, -1> is a superposition of |0, -1> and |-1, 0>, with coefficients -\u221a(1/3) and \u221a(2/3), respectively.\n\nTherefore, measuring L1z = -\u0127 and L2z = -\u0127 corresponds to the state |-1, -1>, which is not present in the expansion of |1, 1, 2, -1>. Thus, the probability is zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0} \\]"
