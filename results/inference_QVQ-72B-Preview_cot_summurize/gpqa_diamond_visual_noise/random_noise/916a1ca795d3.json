                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's been a while since I've dealt with binary star systems, but I remember that analyzing their orbits and radial velocities can give us information about their masses. So, we have two binary systems, system_1 and system_2, both with eclipses, and we're given their periods and the amplitudes of their radial velocity variations. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about binary star systems. In a binary system, the stars orbit around their common center of mass due to their mutual gravitational attraction. The period of their orbit is related to their masses and the distance between them. Specifically, for circular orbits, Kepler's third law tells us that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nBut here, we have eclipsing binaries, which means that the orbits are aligned in such a way that one star passes in front of the other from our perspective on Earth, causing periodic decreases in brightness known as eclipses. The period given (2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2) is likely the orbital period of the binary system.\n\nAdditionally, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations, which indicate that the stars are moving towards and away from us as they orbit each other. The amplitude of these RV variations gives us information about the stars' orbital velocities.\n\nI recall that for a binary system, the radial velocity amplitude (K) of a star is related to the mass of its companion and the orbital parameters. Specifically, for a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( K \\) is the radial velocity amplitude\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period\n\nWait, that doesn't seem quite right. Actually, a more accurate formula is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut I think there's a better way to relate the masses using Kepler's laws and the RV amplitudes.\n\nLet me consider the mass function, which relates the masses of the stars and their orbital parameters. For a binary system observed spectroscopically, the mass function is given by:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G P^2} a^3 \\sin^3 i = \\frac{M_2^3 \\sin^3 i}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are the masses of the two stars\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination angle\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant\n\nHowever, directly using the mass function might not be the most straightforward approach here, especially since we don't know the inclination angle.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars are related to their mass ratio. For a binary system, the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars are inversely proportional to their masses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are their masses\n\nThis makes sense because the more massive star will have a smaller orbit and thus a smaller radial velocity amplitude.\n\nBut I need to find the total mass of each system, which is \\( M_1 + M_2 \\), and then compare them.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's think about the masses in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period.\n\nI recall that the mass function can be expressed in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period. Specifically:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{M_2^3 \\sin^3 i}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G P^2} \\left( \\frac{a_1 \\sin i}{P} \\right)^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a_1 \\) is the semi-major axis of star 1's orbit.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and I don't have information about the inclination angle.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the mass ratio and the total mass.\n\nWait, another approach: using the fact that the sum of the masses can be expressed in terms of the period and the semi-major axis, via Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G P^2} \\]\n\nBut again, I don't know the inclination angle or the semi-major axis.\n\nMaybe I need to use the radial velocity amplitudes to find the ratio of the semi-major axes and then relate that to the masses.\n\nLet me think differently. Since both systems are eclipsing binaries, their orbits are edge-on from our perspective, meaning the inclination angle \\( i \\) is close to 90 degrees. For eclipsing binaries, we can assume \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), which simplifies things.\n\nThat's a helpful assumption.\n\nSo, if \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), then the radial velocity amplitudes are directly related to the orbital velocities:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, for a circular orbit:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut if \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[ K \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\]\n\nSo, the radial velocity amplitude is proportional to the orbital velocity.\n\nNow, from Kepler's laws, the orbital velocity \\( v \\) is related to the mass of the companion and the semi-major axis.\n\nBut I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nLet me look up the formula that relates the masses and the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nUpon checking, I find that for a binary system with known radial velocity amplitudes and period, the total mass can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{K_1 K_2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\left( \\frac{K_1 + K_2}{K_1 K_2} \\right) \\sin i \\]\n\nBut again, I don't know \\( \\sin i \\), although for eclipsing binaries, \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe formula for the total mass in terms of radial velocity amplitudes is:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify.\n\nActually, I think the correct formula is:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\sin i \\]\n\nBut again, for eclipsing binaries, \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), so we can use:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 \\approx \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nThat seems promising.\n\nLet me plug in the values for system_1 and system_2.\n\nFirst, system_1:\n\n- Period \\( P_1 = 2 \\) years\n\n- RV amplitudes: \\( K_{1a} = 10 \\) km/s, \\( K_{1b} = 5 \\) km/s\n\nSecond, system_2:\n\n- Period \\( P_2 = 1 \\) year\n\n- RV amplitudes: \\( K_{2a} = 15 \\) km/s, \\( K_{2b} = 10 \\) km/s\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nFor system_1:\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{(10 + 5)^2 \\times 2}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{15^2 \\times 2}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{225 \\times 2}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{450}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{225}{\\pi G} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for system_2:\n\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{(15 + 10)^2 \\times 1}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{25^2 \\times 1}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{625 \\times 1}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{625}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nNow, to find the ratio \\( \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{\\frac{225}{\\pi G}}{\\frac{625}{2 \\pi G}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{225}{\\pi G} \\times \\frac{2 \\pi G}{625} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{225 \\times 2}{625} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{450}{625} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{18}{25} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 0.72 \\]\n\nSo, system_1 is approximately 0.7 times as massive as system_2, which corresponds to option C. ~0.7.\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, if system_1 is 0.7 times as massive as system_2, that would mean system_1 is less massive than system_2, not more. Therefore, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.7.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that we need to find how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2, implying that system_1 is more massive. However, based on my calculations, system_1 is less massive than system_2.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor system_1:\n\n\\[ M_1 = \\frac{(10 + 5)^2 \\times 2}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{225 \\times 2}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{450}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{225}{\\pi G} \\]\n\nFor system_2:\n\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{(15 + 10)^2 \\times 1}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{625 \\times 1}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{625}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nRatio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{225}{\\pi G} \\div \\frac{625}{2 \\pi G} = \\frac{225 \\times 2}{625} = \\frac{450}{625} = 0.72 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, system_1 is 0.72 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive than system_2.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the question or the options provided. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe using the mass function directly.\n\nThe mass function is:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{M_2^3 \\sin^3 i}{(M_1 + M_2)^2} \\]\n\nBut without knowing the individual masses or the inclination, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a binary system, the total mass can be expressed in terms of the period and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nBut I think that's only valid if \\( \\sin i = 1 \\), which is approximately true for eclipsing binaries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\sin i \\]\n\nAnd since \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), we can use the approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting information here.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for the total mass in terms of radial velocity amplitudes and period.\n\nUpon checking, I find that the total mass is given by:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\sin i \\]\n\nBut again, for eclipsing binaries, \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), so we can use:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 \\approx \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula that doesn't involve \\( \\sin i \\).\n\nWait, another formula I recall is:\n\n\\[ M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{(K_1 + K_2)^2 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nBut I think this is only valid if \\( \\sin i = 1 \\), which is the case for eclipsing binaries.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial calculation, which suggests that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.72.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. ~0.7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
