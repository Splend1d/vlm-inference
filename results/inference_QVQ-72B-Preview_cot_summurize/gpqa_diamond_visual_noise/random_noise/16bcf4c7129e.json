                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. I've got an unknown compound, and I've used some spectroscopy techniques to characterize it: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out its chemical formula from these options: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H12O2, or C6H10O2.\n\nFirst up, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. I remember that FTIR helps identify functional groups based on the vibrations of bonds.\n\nLet's recall what these wavenumbers typically correspond to:\n\n- 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9: This is likely due to O-H stretching, which is often broad and strong. So, there's probably an alcohol or phenol group here.\n\n- 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9: This could be a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone or an aldehyde.\n\n- 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9: This might be a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), possibly in an alkene.\n\nSo, combining these, it seems like the compound has an O-H group, a C=O group, and a C=C double bond.\n\nNext, the 1H NMR spectrum mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a carbon in a C=C double bond. So, this confirms the presence of a double bond, which aligns with the FTIR data.\n\nLastly, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Mass spectrometry breaks down the molecule into fragments and measures their masses. A fragment at m/z = 45 could give us clues about part of the molecule's structure.\n\nNow, I need to look at the given options and see which one fits the described features:\n\nA. C6H10O2\n\nB. C6H12O2\n\nC. C6H12O\n\nD. C6H10O\n\nLet's consider the hydrogen count first. If there's a C=C double bond, that reduces the hydrogen count by 2 compared to a fully saturated compound. Each double bond or ring introduces a deficiency of 2 hydrogens.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- C6H12O: This has 12 hydrogens, which is consistent with a fully saturated compound (no double bonds or rings), minus one O atom.\n\n- C6H10O: This has 10 hydrogens, suggesting one double bond or one ring.\n\n- C6H12O2: This has 12 hydrogens and two O atoms.\n\n- C6H10O2: This has 10 hydrogens and two O atoms.\n\nFrom the FTIR and NMR data, we know there's at least one double bond (C=C), so options with fewer hydrogens are more likely.\n\nNow, considering the presence of O-H and C=O groups, the compound likely contains an alcohol and a ketone or aldehyde.\n\nLet's think about the molecular formula that can accommodate an O-H, a C=O, and a C=C double bond.\n\nOption A: C6H10O2\n\nThis could be a ketone or ester with a double bond. But if there's an O-H group as well, it might be a hydroxy ketone or a hydroxy ester.\n\nOption B: C6H12O2\n\nThis has two O atoms but more hydrogens, suggesting fewer double bonds. But according to FTIR, there's a double bond, so this might not fit.\n\nOption C: C6H12O\n\nThis is a fully saturated compound with one O atom, perhaps an alcohol or an ether. But FTIR indicates a double bond, so this is less likely.\n\nOption D: C6H10O\n\nThis has one double bond and one O atom, possibly a ketone or an aldehyde with a double bond.\n\nSo, between options A and D, both can accommodate the O-H, C=O, and C=C groups.\n\nBut option A has two O atoms, which might suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid or an ester, but the FTIR didn't mention a carboxylic acid peak (usually around 1710 cm\u207b\u00b9 for C=O in acids).\n\nGiven that there's an O-H group and a C=O group, and no carboxylic acid peak, maybe it's a hydroxy ketone or a hydroxy ester without a carboxylic acid group.\n\nOption D: C6H10O could be a ketone with a double bond and an O-H group, perhaps a hydroxy ketone.\n\nWait, but ketones have a C=O group, and if it's a hydroxy ketone, that fits the O-H and C=O groups.\n\nBut let's think about the mass spectrum. There's a fragment at m/z = 45.\n\nI need to see which fragment could produce m/z = 45 in these possible structures.\n\nLet's consider common fragments:\n\n- Methyl group: 15\n\n- Ethyl group: 29\n\n- Propyl group: 43\n\n- Isopropyl: 43\n\n- t-Butyl: 57\n\n- Acetate: 59\n\n- etc.\n\nBut 45 is a common fragment in aldehydes or ketones, possibly CH3COCH3 (acetone), which has a molecular weight of 58, but its fragment could be 43 or 29.\n\nWait, m/z = 45 might correspond to CH3CH=O (acetalddehyde), which has a molecular weight of 44, but that's close to 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a larger molecule.\n\nLet's think about option A: C6H10O2.\n\nIf it's a hydroxy ketone, like CH3COCH(OH)CH2CH2CH3, but that's C6H12O2, which is option B.\n\nWait, option B is C6H12O2, which is fully saturated with two O atoms.\n\nBut according to FTIR, there's a double bond, so option B might not fit.\n\nOption A is C6H10O2, which could be a hydroxy ester, like CH3CH2CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, but that has a double bond and two O atoms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a ketone with a hydroxyl group and an ester group, but that might exceed the hydrogen count.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the number of double bonds equivalent to check the degree of unsaturation.\n\nThe formula for the number of double bonds or rings (DBE) is:\n\nDBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms (which is zero here).\n\nFor option A: C6H10O2\n\nDBE = 6 - 10/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 6 - 5 + 0 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, two double bonds or rings.\n\nFor option B: C6H12O2\n\nDBE = 6 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 6 - 6 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\nFor option C: C6H12O\n\nDBE = 6 - 12/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 6 - 6 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\nFor option D: C6H10O\n\nDBE = 6 - 10/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 6 - 5 + 0 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, options A and D have DBE = 2, which could accommodate one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds.\n\nOptions B and C have DBE = 1, which could be one double bond or one ring.\n\nGiven that FTIR indicates a C=C double bond, options B and C would require that the double bond is the only unsaturation, while options A and D have an additional double bond or ring.\n\nBut from FTIR, we only know about one double bond, so options A and D are possible.\n\nNow, considering the presence of O-H and C=O groups, let's think about possible structures.\n\nOption A: C6H10O2\n\nPossible structure: a hydroxy ketone with a double bond, or a hydroxy ester.\n\nFor example, CH3COCH(OH)CH=CHCH3\n\nThis has C6H10O2, with O-H, C=O, and C=C groups.\n\nOption D: C6H10O\n\nPossible structure: a ketone with a double bond and an O-H group, but that would require three functional groups, which might not fit with the formula.\n\nWait, C6H10O only has one O atom, so it can have one O-H and one C=O, but that would require two O atoms, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, no: O-H is one O and one H, C=O is one O and one C=O bond.\n\nSo, O-H: one O and one H\n\nC=O: one O and one C=O bond\n\nTotal O atoms: two\n\nBut C6H10O only has one O atom, so it can't have both O-H and C=O unless there's another O somewhere.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't add up.\n\nOption D: C6H10O has only one O atom, but according to FTIR, there's an O-H and a C=O, which together require two O atoms.\n\nSo, option D is unlikely unless there's a different arrangement.\n\nTherefore, option A, C6H10O2, with two O atoms, can accommodate both O-H and C=O groups.\n\nOption B: C6H12O2 has two O atoms but is fully saturated, which contradicts the FTIR showing a double bond.\n\nOption C: C6H12O has only one O atom, which can't accommodate both O-H and C=O.\n\nOption D: C6H10O has only one O atom, same issue.\n\nTherefore, option A seems the most fitting: C6H10O2.\n\nBut to confirm, let's think about the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45.\n\nPossible fragments:\n\n- CH3CH=O (acetaldheyde): m/z = 44\n\n- CH3COCH3 (acetone): m/z = 58\n\n- CH3COOH (acetic acid): m/z = 60\n\n- CH3CH2CHO (propanal): m/z = 58\n\n- etc.\n\nSo, m/z = 45 could correspond to CH3CH=O (acetaldheyde), which has m/z = 44, or some other fragment.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a fragment from a larger molecule.\n\nIf the compound is C6H10O2, and it has an O-H and a C=O, perhaps it's a hydroxy ketone or a hydroxy ester.\n\nFor example, if it's CH3COCH(OH)CH=CHCH3, that would fit the formula C6H10O2, with O-H and C=O groups, and a double bond.\n\nIn this case, possible fragments could include CH3CO (43), CH3CH=O (44), or other fragments that could add up to m/z = 45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment corresponds to CH3CH=O (44), and the m/z = 45 is just an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3COOH (60), which is larger, but m/z = 45 doesn't match that.\n\nThis is a bit unclear, but given the options, C6H10O2 seems the most plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid, but the FTIR didn't mention a carboxylic acid peak.\n\nWait, carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O groups, but their FTIR spectra typically show a strong O-H peak around 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 and a C=O peak around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions a very broad O-H peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, which could correspond to C=O and C=C, respectively.\n\nIf it were a carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option A.\n\nBut perhaps it's a hydroxy ketone or a hydroxy ester, which also fit the formula C6H10O2.\n\nGiven that, and considering the degree of unsaturation, option A seems the best fit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. C6H10O2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
