                    "text": "So I'm looking at this problem about quantum mechanics. It talks about the state of a system at time t being given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And there's an observable represented by a matrix operator P, with specific elements provided. The question is asking for the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles of quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is represented by a state vector, which in this case is a column matrix. Observables are represented by operators, and the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of these operators.\n\nSo, to find the probability of measuring a particular value, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P and then use the Born rule to calculate the probability.\n\nLet me start by writing down the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 and the operator P.\n\nThe state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2]\n\n[ 1]\n\nAnd the operator P is:\n\nP = [ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\nOkay, so first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, P - \u03bbI is:\n\n[ 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb ]\n\nNow, I need to find the determinant of this matrix and set it to zero to find \u03bb.\n\nThis is a 3x3 matrix, and calculating its determinant can be a bit tricky, but let's try.\n\nUsing the first row:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = (0 - \u03bb) * [ (0 - \u03bb)(0 - \u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2)[ (1/\u221a2)(0 - \u03bb) - 0 ] + 0\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should expand it properly.\n\nLet me compute det(P - \u03bbI):\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = | 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2 0 |\n\n|1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb 1/\u221a2|\n\n| 0 1/\u221a2 0 - \u03bb |\n\nI can expand along the first row:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = (0 - \u03bb) * [ (0 - \u03bb)(0 - \u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(0 - \u03bb) - 0 ] + 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-\u03bb) * [ \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2 ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ -\u03bb/\u221a2 ]\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 \u03bb = \u00b11\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible measurement outcomes are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 at time t.\n\nSo, I need to find the probability that P yields 0 when measured on the state |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nAccording to the Born rule, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb associated with an eigenvector |\u03c6\u27e9 is |\u27e8\u03c6|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2, provided that the state is normalized.\n\nBut first, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n\nSo, I need to solve (P - 0*I)|\u03c6\u27e9 = 0.\n\nThat is, P|\u03c6\u27e9 = 0.\n\nSo, I need to solve the homogeneous system P|\u03c6\u27e9 = 0.\n\nLet me write down P:\n\nP = [ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2 0 1/\u221a2]\n\n[ 0 1/\u221a2 0 ]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n0*x + (1/\u221a2)*y + 0*z = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2)*x + 0*y + (1/\u221a2)*z = 0\n\n0*x + (1/\u221a2)*y + 0*z = 0\n\nFrom the first equation: (1/\u221a2)*y = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\nFrom the third equation: (1/\u221a2)*y = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\nFrom the second equation: (1/\u221a2)*x + (1/\u221a2)*z = 0 \u21d2 x + z = 0 \u21d2 z = -x\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0 is any vector of the form [x, 0, -x], which can be written as x*[1, 0, -1].\n\nThus, the eigenvector is |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9 = [1, 0, -1].\n\nNow, to find the probability of measuring \u03bb=0, I need to compute |\u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let's write down |\u03c8\u27e9 and |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2]\n\n[ 1]\n\n|\u03c6\u2080\u27e9 = [1]\n\n[0]\n\n[-1]\n\nNow, \u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1] = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2\n\nThen, |\u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 = |-2|\u00b2 = 4\n\nSo, the probability of measuring 0 is 4.\n\nBut wait, probabilities in quantum mechanics should be between 0 and 1. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh, right. The state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 needs to be normalized for the Born rule to give probabilities between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me check if |\u03c8\u27e9 is normalized.\n\nThe norm of |\u03c8\u27e9 is \u221a(|-1|\u00b2 + |2|\u00b2 + |1|\u00b2) = \u221a(1 + 4 + 1) = \u221a6\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9_norm = (1/\u221a6)*[-1, 2, 1]\n\nSimilarly, the eigenvector |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9 should also be normalized.\n\nThe norm of |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9 = [1, 0, -1] is \u221a(1 + 0 + 1) = \u221a2\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is |\u03c6\u2080\u27e9_norm = (1/\u221a2)*[1, 0, -1]\n\nNow, let's compute \u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 with the normalized vectors.\n\nFirst, \u27e8\u03c6\u2080| = (1/\u221a2)*[1, 0, -1]\n\nAnd |\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)*[-1, 2, 1]\n\nSo, \u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a6)*[1, 0, -1]\u00b7[-1, 2, 1] = (1/(\u221a2*\u221a6))*( (-1)*1 + 2*0 + 1*(-1) ) = (1/(\u221a12))*(-1 -1) = (1/(2\u221a3))*(-2) = -1/\u221a3\n\nThen, |\u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a3)\u00b2 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of measuring 0 is 1/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 1/3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found the eigenvalues of P, which are -1, 0, and 1.\n\nThen, I found the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0, which is [1, 0, -1].\n\nI normalized both the state vector and the eigenvector.\n\nThen, I computed the inner product \u27e8\u03c6\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9 and squared its magnitude to get the probability.\n\nEverything seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
