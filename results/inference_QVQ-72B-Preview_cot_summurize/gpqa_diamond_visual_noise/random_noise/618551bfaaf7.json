                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that seems a bit complex at first glance. It involves mixing different volumes and concentrations of acetic acid (CH3COOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total volume of the solution. We have 500 mL of CH3COOH, 400 mL of HCl, and 300 mL of Ba(OH)2. Adding those together: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL. So, the total volume is 1200 mL or 1.2 L.\n\nNext, I need to consider the moles of each substance present. Starting with CH3COOH: it's a weak acid with a concentration of 0.1 M in 500 mL. The molarity is moles per liter, so the moles of CH3COOH are:\n\nmoles CH3COOH = concentration \u00d7 volume (in L) = 0.1 M \u00d7 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.\n\nNow, HCl is a strong acid, and its concentration is 0.2 M in 400 mL. So, moles of HCl:\n\nmoles HCl = 0.2 M \u00d7 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.\n\nThen, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base with a concentration of 0.3 M in 300 mL. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH- ions, so the concentration of OH- is twice that of Ba(OH)2.\n\nmoles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M \u00d7 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.\n\nSince each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, total moles of OH- = 2 \u00d7 0.09 = 0.18 moles.\n\nNow, I need to consider the reactions between these substances. HCl is a strong acid and will react completely with the strong base Ba(OH)2. The reaction is:\n\nHCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + H2O\n\nBut since Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions, the balanced equation per OH- is:\n\nHCl + OH- \u2192 H2O\n\nSo, moles of HCl reacting with moles of OH-.\n\nMoles of HCl = 0.08 moles\n\nMoles of OH- = 0.18 moles\n\nReacting together:\n\n0.08 moles HCl + 0.08 moles OH- \u2192 0.08 moles H2O\n\nLeftover moles of OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.1 moles\n\nAdditionally, CH3COOH is a weak acid and will react with OH- to form CH3COO- and H2O:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O\n\nNow, moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 moles\n\nMoles of OH- left = 0.1 moles\n\nReacting together:\n\n0.05 moles CH3COOH + 0.05 moles OH- \u2192 0.05 moles CH3COO- + 0.05 moles H2O\n\nLeftover moles of OH- = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles\n\nNow, in the final solution, we have:\n\n- 0.05 moles of CH3COO- (from the reaction of CH3COOH with OH-)\n\n- 0.05 moles of OH- remaining\n\n- No remaining HCl or Ba(OH)2\n\nAlso, CH3COOH that didn't react: initially 0.05 moles, but it's a weak acid and only partially ionized, so most of it remains as CH3COOH.\n\nNow, to find the pH, I need to consider the equilibrium of the weak acid CH3COOH and the remaining OH- ions.\n\nThe pOH can be calculated from the concentration of OH-:\n\npOH = -log[OH-]\n\n[OH-] = moles of OH- / total volume = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0417 M\n\npOH = -log(0.0417) \u2248 1.38\n\nSince pH + pOH = 14 in water at 25\u00b0C:\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8.68\n\nB. 12.62\n\nC. 1.38\n\nD. 8.92\n\nThe closest option is B. 12.62.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's any buffer effect from the CH3COOH and CH3COO- present.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a buffer solution is:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nWhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (CH3COO-), and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\nFirst, I need to know the pKa of acetic acid. I recall that the pKa of acetic acid is approximately 4.76.\n\nNow, [CH3COO-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0417 M\n\n[CH3COOH] = 0.05 mooles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0417 M\n\nSo, pH = 4.76 + log(0.0417 / 0.0417) = 4.76 + log(1) = 4.76\n\nBut earlier, I calculated pOH and found pH \u2248 12.62, which is inconsistent with this buffer calculation.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that there is a buffer present. Let's re-examine the situation.\n\nAfter all reactions:\n\n- All HCl has reacted with OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n\n- Part of Ba(OH)2 OH- remains: 0.05 moles\n\n- CH3COOH has reacted with 0.05 moles of OH-, forming 0.05 moles of CH3COO-\n\n- Remaining OH-: 0.05 moles\n\nSo, in the final solution, we have:\n\n- CH3COO-: 0.05 moles\n\n- OH-: 0.05 moles\n\n- No CH3COOH left, because it's all reacted with the OH-\n\nWait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, and in the presence of excess OH-, it would be mostly ionized to CH3COO- and H2O.\n\nSo, perhaps there is no remaining CH3COOH in the solution, meaning that the buffer system isn't present.\n\nIn that case, the solution is mostly basic due to the remaining OH-, and the pH should be calculated based on the OH- concentration.\n\nSo, going back to the pOH calculation:\n\n[OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0417 M\n\npOH = -log(0.0417) \u2248 1.38\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 12.62\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 12.62.\n\nI think the initial buffer calculation was incorrect because there's no remaining CH3COOH to form a buffer system; it's all reacted with the OH-.\n\nSo, the final pH is approximately 12.62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 12.62} \\]"
