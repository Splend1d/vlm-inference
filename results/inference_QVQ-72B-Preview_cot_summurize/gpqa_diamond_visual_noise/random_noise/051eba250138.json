                    "text": "So I have this problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4\u20222H2O. The solution is 200.00 cm\u00b3, and each salt is 1.00 g. I'm given the pKa values for H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5\u00d710^-3, Ka2 = 6.2\u00d710^-8, and Ka3 = 1.8\u00d710^-12. The options for the answer are all in the range of 10^-7 M, so I need to be careful with my calculations.\n\nFirst, I need to find the molar concentrations of each salt in the solution. The molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4\u20222H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Since each salt is 1.00 g, I can calculate their moles and then the molar concentrations.\n\nFor KH2PO4:\n\nMoles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.00734 mol\n\nConcentration = moles / volume = 0.00734 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0367 M\n\nFor Na2HPO4\u20222H2O:\n\nMoles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.00561 mol\n\nConcentration = 0.00561 mol / 0.200 L = 0.0281 M\n\nNow, I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I assume are PO4\u00b3\u207b ions. In phosphoric acid, H3PO4, the orthophosphate ion is the fully deprotonated form.\n\nGiven that H3PO4 has three ionization steps:\n\n1. H3PO4 \u21cc H\u207a + H2PO4\u207b Ka1 = 7.5\u00d710^-3\n\n2. H2PO4\u207b \u21cc H\u207a + HPO4\u00b2\u207b Ka2 = 6.2\u00d710^-8\n\n3. HPO4\u00b2\u207b \u21cc H\u207a + PO4\u00b3\u207b Ka3 = 1.8\u00d710^-12\n\nIn the solution, KH2PO4 provides H2PO4\u207b ions, and Na2HPO4\u20222H2O provides HPO4\u00b2\u207b ions. So, I have a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4\u207b and HPO4\u00b2\u207b.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a buffer to the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid:\n\npH = pKa + log([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nIn this case, HA is H2PO4\u207b and A\u207b is HPO4\u00b2\u207b.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4\u00b2\u207b]/[H2PO4\u207b])\n\nBut I don't know the pH yet. Maybe I can find it using the ionization constants.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the equilibrium concentrations of all species.\n\nLet's think about the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nInitially:\n\n[H2PO4\u207b] = 0.0367 M (from KH2PO4)\n\n[HPO4\u00b2\u207b] = 0.0281 M (from Na2HPO4\u20222H2O)\n\nLet x be the change in concentration due to the ionization of H2PO4\u207b to HPO4\u00b2\u207b and H\u207a.\n\nThen:\n\n[H2PO4\u207b] = 0.0367 - x\n\n[HPO4\u00b2\u207b] = 0.0281 + x\n\n[H\u207a] = x\n\nUsing the second ionization constant Ka2:\n\nKa2 = [H\u207a][HPO4\u00b2\u207b]/[H2PO4\u207b] = x(0.0281 + x)/(0.0367 - x) = 6.2\u00d710^-8\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.0367 and 0.0281, we can approximate:\n\n6.2\u00d710^-8 = x(0.0281)/(0.0367)\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (6.2\u00d710^-8)(0.0367)/0.0281 \u2248 8.2\u00d710^-8 M\n\nSo, [H\u207a] \u2248 8.2\u00d710^-8 M\n\npH \u2248 -log(8.2\u00d710^-8) \u2248 7.09\n\nNow, to find [PO4\u00b3\u207b], I need to consider the third ionization step:\n\nHPO4\u00b2\u207b \u21cc H\u207a + PO4\u00b3\u207b Ka3 = 1.8\u00d710^-12\n\nBut I have [HPO4\u00b2\u207b] \u2248 0.0281 + x \u2248 0.0281 M (since x is very small)\n\nAnd [H\u207a] \u2248 8.2\u00d710^-8 M\n\nSo, [PO4\u00b3\u207b] \u2248 Ka3 * [HPO4\u00b2\u207b] / [H\u207a] = (1.8\u00d710^-12)(0.0281)/(8.2\u00d710^-8) \u2248 6.5\u00d710^-7 M\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options closely. The closest is D. 6.24\u00d710^-7 M, but that's higher than my calculation.\n\nMaybe I need to be more precise and not make the approximation.\n\nLet's try to solve the equilibrium equation without approximations.\n\nFrom Ka2:\n\n6.2\u00d710^-8 = [x][0.0281 + x]/[0.0367 - x]\n\nAssuming x is small might not be accurate enough, so let's solve the quadratic equation.\n\nLet y = x\n\nThen:\n\n6.2\u00d710^-8 = y(0.0281 + y)/(0.0367 - y)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.0367 - y):\n\n6.2\u00d710^-8 (0.0367 - y) = y(0.0281 + y)\n\nExpand:\n\n6.2\u00d710^-8 * 0.0367 - 6.2\u00d710^-8 y = 0.0281 y + y\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ny\u00b2 + (0.0281 + 6.2\u00d710^-8) y - (6.2\u00d710^-8 * 0.0367) = 0\n\nCalculate the coefficients:\n\na = 1\n\nb = 0.0281 + 6.2\u00d710^-8 \u2248 0.0281\n\nc = - (6.2\u00d710^-8)(0.0367) \u2248 -2.28\u00d710^-9\n\nNow, use the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nd = b\u00b2 - 4ac \u2248 (0.0281)^2 - 4(1)(-2.28\u00d710^-9) \u2248 0.00079 + 9.12\u00d710^-9 \u2248 0.00079\n\nSo, y \u2248 [-0.0281 \u00b1 sqrt(0.00079)] / 2 \u2248 [-0.0281 \u00b1 0.0281]/2\n\nThe positive root is y \u2248 0, which doesn't make sense in this context. The negative root is not physically possible. This suggests that my approach might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the overall protonation/deprotonation equilibria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a buffer solution of H2PO4\u207b and HPO4\u00b2\u207b, the pH is determined by pKa2 and the ratio of [HPO4\u00b2\u207b]/[H2PO4\u207b].\n\nGiven that pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2\u00d710^-8) \u2248 7.2\n\nAnd pH \u2248 pKa2 + log([HPO4\u00b2\u207b]/[H2PO4\u207b]) \u2248 7.2 + log(0.0281/0.0367) \u2248 7.2 - 0.1 \u2248 7.1\n\nNow, to find [PO4\u00b3\u207b], I can use the third ionization constant:\n\nKa3 = [H\u207a][PO4\u00b3\u207b]/[HPO4\u00b2\u207b]\n\nRearranged:\n\n[PO4\u00b3\u207b] = Ka3 * [HPO4\u00b2\u207b] / [H\u207a]\n\nBut I need [H\u207a], which I can find from pH:\n\n[H\u207a] = 10^-pH \u2248 10^-7.1 \u2248 7.94\u00d710^-8 M\n\nThen:\n\n[PO4\u00b3\u207b] \u2248 (1.8\u00d710^-12)(0.0281)/(7.94\u00d710^-8) \u2248 (1.8\u00d710^-12)(0.0281)/(7.94\u00d710^-8) \u2248 6.24\u00d710^-7 M\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nBut earlier, when I approximated x, I got a similar value, but I must have made a calculation error.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 6.24\u00d710^-7 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
