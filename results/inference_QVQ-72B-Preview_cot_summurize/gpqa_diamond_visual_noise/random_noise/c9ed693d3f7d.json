                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) parallel to the Oz axis, with a magnitude of 1 Tesla (T). We're dealing with small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number \\(m\\), and we're supposed to compare the paramagnetic coupling term \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\) with the transition energy \\(\\Delta E\\) of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of \\(0.4861 \\mu\\)m.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what paramagnetic coupling is. I think it's related to how certain materials respond to external magnetic fields due to the magnetic moments of their electrons. In quantum mechanics, this coupling is often described by the Zeeman effect, which is the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field.\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling term \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\) probably refers to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian that describes this coupling. For a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian includes the Zeeman interaction term.\n\nThe Zeeman energy is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_Z = g \\mu_B m J B\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(g\\) is the Land\u00e9 g-factor\n\n- \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton\n\n- \\(m_J\\) is the magnetic quantum number\n\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength\n\nFor hydrogen, the g-factor is approximately 2, and \\(m_J\\) can take values from \\(-J\\) to \\(+J\\), where \\(J\\) is the total angular momentum quantum number.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, it mentions small values of \\(m\\), which I assume is \\(m_l\\), the orbital magnetic quantum number. In hydrogen, \\(m_l\\) ranges from \\(-l\\) to \\(+l\\), where \\(l\\) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n\nHowever, in the expression above, it's \\(m_J\\) that's used, which includes both orbital and spin contributions.\n\nMaybe I need to be more precise here. Let's look up the expression for the Zeeman energy in hydrogen.\n\nUpon checking, the Zeeman energy for an electron in an atomic orbital is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_Z = g \\mu_B m_J B\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(g\\) is the Land\u00e9 g-factor, which for an electron is approximately 2.0023.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that \\(m_J\\) can range depending on the state, but for small \\(m_l\\), perhaps we can make some approximations.\n\nBut first, let's recall that in the absence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of hydrogen are degenerate in \\(m_l\\), but in the presence of a magnetic field, they split.\n\nNow, the problem mentions \"small values of \\(m\\)\", but doesn't specify what that means. Maybe it means \\(m_l\\) close to zero, or perhaps it's a typo and it should be \\(m_l\\), but it's written as \\(m\\).\n\nGiven that, I'll assume \\(m\\) refers to \\(m_l\\), the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n\nHowever, in the Zeeman effect, it's \\(m_J\\) that appears in the energy formula, not just \\(m_l\\). So perhaps I need to consider both orbital and spin contributions.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the diamagnetic term as well, but the problem specifies paramagnetic coupling, so perhaps only the Zeeman term is relevant here.\n\nAlright, moving on. The transition energy \\(\\Delta E\\) is given by the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photon. The relationship between energy and wavelength is:\n\n\\[\nE = h \\nu = h \\frac{c}{\\lambda}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant\n\n- \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength\n\nGiven \\(\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\)m, which is \\(4.861 \\times 10^{-7}\\) m, we can calculate \\(\\Delta E\\):\n\nFirst, convert all units to SI base units:\n\n- \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\) Js\n\n- \\(c = 3.00 \\times 10^8\\) m/s\n\n- \\(\\lambda = 4.861 \\times 10^{-7}\\) m\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = h \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{Js}) \\times \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{m/s}}{4.861 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}} = 4.087 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's estimate \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\), the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling.\n\nAssuming that \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\) is approximately equal to the Zeeman energy \\(\\Delta E_Z\\), we can use the expression above:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_Z = g \\mu_B m_J B\n\\]\n\nBut I need to know the values of \\(g\\), \\(\\mu_B\\), \\(m_J\\), and \\(B\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(g \\approx 2.0023\\)\n\n- \\(\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}\\) J/T\n\n- \\(B = 1\\) T\n\n- \\(m_J\\) depends on the state, but since it's small, let's assume \\(m_J = 0.5\\) (for \\(j = 1/2\\), \\(m_J = \\pm 1/2\\))\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_Z = 2.0023 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\text{J/T} \\times 0.5 \\times 1\\ \\text{T} = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nWait, but \\(m_J\\) can be \\(\\pm 1/2\\) for s-states, or higher for p, d, etc. states. Maybe I should consider the maximum possible \\(m_J\\), but the problem says small \\(m\\), so perhaps \\(m_J = 0.5\\) is acceptable.\n\nNow, comparing \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\) with \\(\\Delta E\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle H \\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\text{J} \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad \\Delta E = 4.087 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nClearly, \\(\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E\\), since \\(9.274 \\times 10^{-24}\\) is much smaller than \\(4.087 \\times 10^{-19}\\).\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I need to consider multiple electrons or higher angular momentum states. However, the problem specifies hydrogen atom, which has only one electron, so my previous calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term involves more than just the Zeeman energy, but given the information provided, I think assuming it's the Zeeman energy is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. \\(\\langle H \\rangle \\ll \\Delta E\\).\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other term that could make \\(\\langle H \\rangle\\) larger. For example, if there are multiple unpaired electrons, the paramagnetic coupling could be stronger, but again, in hydrogen, there's only one electron.\n\nAlso, considering the diamagnetic term, but the problem specifies paramagnetic coupling, so perhaps diamagnetic effects are negligible here.\n\nMoreover, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian corresponds to the energy of the system, so comparing it directly with \\(\\Delta E\\) seems appropriate.\n\nHence, based on this analysis, option D seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
