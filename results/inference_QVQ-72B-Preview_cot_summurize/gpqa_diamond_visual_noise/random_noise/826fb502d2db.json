                    "text": "So I've got this problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction, respectively. C is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how speeds add in special relativity because at these speeds, the classical velocity addition formula doesn't hold. In relativity, the relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nBut wait, in this problem, both astronauts are moving in the same direction, so v1 and v2 are both in the same frame of reference. Let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly.\n\nActually, the formula I wrote is for the velocity of one object relative to another when both are moving in the same direction. But in this problem, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so to find the relative velocity of one with respect to the other, I should use:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv1 = 0.6c\n\nv2 = 0.5c\n\nSo,\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\n\nAnd the denominator:\n\n1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2 = 1 - (0.3c^2) / c^2 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nTherefore,\n\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.1429c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, which matches option A and D for v_rel.\n\nNow, I need to find the total energy of the system. In special relativity, the total energy of an object is given by:\n\nE = gamma * m * c^2\n\nWhere gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nBut since there are two astronauts with different masses and velocities, I need to calculate the energy of each one separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the astronaut with mass 2m moving at 0.6c:\n\ngamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo, E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c^2 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5m c^2\n\nSecond, for the astronaut with mass 3m moving at 0.5c:\n\ngamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1 / 0.8660 \u2248 1.1547\n\nSo, E2 \u2248 gamma2 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 3.4641m c^2\n\nNow, total energy E_total = E1 + E2 \u2248 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \u2248 5.9641m c^2\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately 5.96m c^2, which matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: v_rel = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the relative velocity calculation:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2) = 0.1c / 0.7 \u2248 0.1429c\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSecond, the energy calculations:\n\nFor 2m at 0.6c:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\n\nFor 3m at 0.5c:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / 0.8660 \u2248 1.1547\n\nE2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m c^2 \u2248 3.4641m c^2\n\nTotal E \u2248 2.5 + 3.4641 \u2248 5.9641m c^2\n\nYes, that matches option D.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
