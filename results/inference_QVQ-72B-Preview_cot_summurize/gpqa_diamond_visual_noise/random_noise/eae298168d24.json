We have operators \\(P_x\\), \\(P_y\\), and \\(P_z\\), which seem to represent components of some momentum operator in a quantum mechanical system. The system is in a state that's an eigenstate of \\(P_x\\) with eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\), and we're given the explicit state vector as \\((-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)\\). We need to find the uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of uncertainty in quantum mechanics. The uncertainty of an operator \\(A\\) in a state \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle - \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle^2}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(A = P_z\\), and \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is the given state vector.\n\nSo, I need to calculate \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle^2\\), then take the square root of their difference.\n\nGiven that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of \\(P_z\\), I should probably express \\(P_z\\) in its matrix form and then compute these expectation values.\n\nLet me first write down the matrix for \\(P_z\\):\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAnd the state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll compute \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-1/2)(\\hbar)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar)(-1/2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = 0\\).\n\nNext, I'll compute \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle\\). First, I need to find \\(P_z^2\\):\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-1/2)(\\hbar^2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)(\\hbar^2)(-1/2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the uncertainty formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle - \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches with option C. \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming \\(P_z\\):\n\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, \\(P_z^2\\):\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (-1/2)(\\hbar) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar) = -\\hbar/2 + 0 + \\hbar/2 = 0\n\\]\n\nCorrect.\n\n\\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= (-1/2)(\\hbar^2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar^2) = -\\hbar^2/2 + 0 + -\\hbar^2/2 = -\\hbar^2\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that's negative? That can't be right because uncertainty can't be imaginary.\n\nLet me check that calculation again.\n\nActually, the matrix \\(P_z^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\nP_z^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, multiplying by the state vector:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = (-1/2)(\\hbar^2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar^2) = -\\hbar^2/2 + 0 - \\hbar^2/2 = -\\hbar^2\n\\]\n\nBut that can't be right because expectation values should be real numbers, and uncertainty should be positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, perhaps the state vector should be multiplied by the matrix correctly. Let's recompute \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\hbar^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1/2 \\\\\n1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n-1/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (-1/2)(\\hbar^2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1/2)(\\hbar^2)(-1/2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong earlier. I mistakenly wrote \\(-\\hbar^2/2 + 0 - \\hbar^2/2\\), but actually, it should be \\(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\). So, corrected.\n\nSo, \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\), and \\(\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = 0\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the eigenvalues of \\(P_x\\).\n\nGiven that the system is in an eigenstate of \\(P_x\\) with eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\), and the state vector is \\((-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)\\), perhaps I can find the eigenvalue corresponding to \\(P_z\\) in this state.\n\nBut no, since \\(P_x\\) and \\(P_z\\) don't commute (they are different components of momentum), their eigenstates are not the same, so this approach might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the commutation relations between \\(P_x\\), \\(P_y\\), and \\(P_z\\), but that might complicate things further.\n\nGiven that I've already calculated the uncertainty directly using the definition, and double-checked the calculations, I think the answer is indeed \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\\), which is option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. The uncertainty should have units of momentum, which is consistent with \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\\), since \\(\\hbar\\) has units of angular momentum, but in quantum mechanics, \\(\\hbar\\) is often used in place of momentum in expressions due to the definition \\(p = \\hbar k\\), where \\(k\\) is the wave number.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is option C. \\(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\]"
