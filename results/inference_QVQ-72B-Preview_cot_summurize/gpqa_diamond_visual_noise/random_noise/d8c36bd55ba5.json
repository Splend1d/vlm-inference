This reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond, resulting in the addition of the nucleophile to the molecule. It's widely used for building complex organic compounds with specific functional groups and stereochemistry, finding applications in pharmaceuticals, natural product synthesis, and chemical synthesis.\nThe final products of the following reactions are:\nmethyl 2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate + (NaOEt, THF, 2,4-dimethyl-1-(vinylsulfinyl)benzene) ---> A\nethyl 2-ethylbutanoate + (NaH, THF, methyl 2-cyclopentylidene-2-phenylacetate) ---> B\n\nA.

The definition says that structural mobility refers to changes in the objective relations between positions within a given structure, and these changes are independent of the strategies and the will of the agents who occupy these positions. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, what does \"objective relations between positions\" mean? I think it refers to the way different social positions or classes are related to each other in terms of power, status, or resources. So, in a society, there are various positions like workers, managers, executives, and so on, and there are relationships between these positions based on things like income, education, or influence.\n\nNow, \"changes in these objective relations\" would mean shifts or alterations in how these positions relate to each other. For example, maybe over time, the difference in income between workers and managers decreases or increases, or perhaps the education required to attain certain positions changes.\n\nThe key part here is that these changes are \"independent of the strategies and the will of the agents who occupy these positions.\" This means that these changes happen regardless of what individuals in those positions want or try to do. So, it's not about individual mobility where people move up or down based on their own efforts, but rather about shifts in the structure itself that affect everyone in those positions.\n\nLet me think of an example to make this clearer. Suppose there's a technological advancement that makes certain skills obsolete and raises the demand for new skills. This could lead to changes in the objective relations between different occupational positions, even if the people in those positions didn't intend for this to happen. For instance, jobs that previously required only basic computer skills might now require advanced programming knowledge, which could change the status and earning potential of those positions.\n\nAnother example could be economic shifts, like a recession or a boom, which can alter the relationships between different economic classes. During a recession, the gap between the wealthy and the poor might widen as the wealthy have more resources to weather the storm, while the poor might struggle more. This change in the objective relations between these classes happens independently of the individuals' actions or wills.\n\nContrasting this with individual mobility, which is when a person moves from one position to another based on their own efforts, choices, or circumstances, structural mobility is more about broad, systemic changes that affect entire positions or classes.\n\nSo, in summary, structural mobility, according to Bourdieu, is about shifts in the relationships between different social positions within a structure, and these shifts occur regardless of the intentions or actions of the individuals occupying those positions. It's about the movement or transformation of the structure itself, which in turn influences the positions and opportunities available within it.\n\nI think this helps me understand the concept better. It's important to distinguish between individual agency and broader structural changes when analyzing social mobility and inequality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
