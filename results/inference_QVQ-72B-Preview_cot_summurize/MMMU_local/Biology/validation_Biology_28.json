                    "text": "So I've got this image of a knee section, and I need to identify structure 164. It's a bit challenging because I don't have the labels, but I'll try my best by recalling the anatomy of the knee joint.\n\nFirst, I know that the knee is a complex joint composed of the femur, tibia, patella, and fibula. There are several ligaments that provide stability to the knee, and two of them are the collateral ligaments: the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament and the tibial (medial) collateral ligament.\n\nLooking at the image, I see various numbered structures. Structure 164 seems to be located on the outer side of the knee, near the fibula. Let me think about the position of the ligaments.\n\nThe fibular collateral ligament is on the lateral side of the knee, attaching the femur to the fibula. It's primarily responsible for stabilizing the knee against lateral stresses. On the other hand, the tibial collateral ligament is on the medial side, connecting the femur to the tibia, and it provides stability against medial stresses.\n\nGiven that structure 164 is on the lateral side, it's likely to be the fibular collateral ligament. But let me double-check.\n\nI also see other structures in the image: there's a large circular structure that looks like the patella, and there are bands that could be the cruciate ligaments. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is located in the center of the knee, attaching the femur to the tibia, and is crucial for stabilizing forward movements.\n\nStructure 164 doesn't seem to be the ACL because that's more centrally located. Also, the ligamentum patellae is the tendon that connects the patella to the tibia, and it's located in the front of the knee.\n\nSo, considering the position of structure 164 on the lateral side, I think it's the fibular collateral ligament.\n\nWait a minute, let me consider if there are any other ligaments or structures that could be confused with the fibular collateral ligament in this section. For example, the iliotibial band is a thickening of the fascia lata that runs down the lateral side of the thigh and knee, but it's not a ligament per se.\n\nIn the image, structure 164 appears to be a distinct ligamentous structure, not part of the muscle or fascia. Therefore, it's more likely to be the fibular collateral ligament.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the options provided:\n\nA. Ligamentum patellae\n\nB. Fibular collateral ligament\n\nC. Tibial collateral ligament\n\nD. Anterior cruciate ligament\n\nBased on my analysis, option B. Fibular collateral ligament seems the most appropriate choice for structure 164.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, I'll think about the cross-section of the knee. In a transverse section, the fibular collateral ligament would appear as a circular or oval structure on the lateral side, which seems to match structure 164 in the image.\n\nOn the other hand, the tibial collateral ligament is on the medial side, so that should be elsewhere in the section. The anterior cruciate ligament is centrally located within the joint cavity, and the ligamentum patellae is anteriorly positioned, connecting the patella to the tibia.\n\nTherefore, based on the position and appearance, structure 164 is most likely the fibular collateral ligament.\n\nI think I've got it right. If I were to choose one, I'd go with option B. Fibular collateral ligament.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
