                    "text": "So I've got this pedigree diagram here, and I need to figure out the probability that individual number 7 will be affected by a rare, autosomal recessive disease. Individual number 1 is a heterozygote for this disease, and I'm told that individuals number 2 and the spouses of numbers 3 and 4 are not carriers. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between these individuals. Pedigree diagrams can be a bit tricky, but if I follow the connections step by step, I should be able to figure it out.\n\nLet me start by identifying each individual based on the diagram you described. I'll assume that circles represent females and squares represent males, with hollow shapes indicating unaffected individuals and filled shapes indicating affected ones. But since the question specifies that individual number 1 is a heterozygote and the others mentioned are not carriers, I need to be careful with that.\n\nSo, individual number 1 is a heterozygote for the disease, meaning she carries one copy of the mutated gene and one normal copy. Since the disease is autosomal recessive, she doesn't show symptoms because she has at least one normal copy.\n\nIndividual number 2 is her spouse, and I'm told he is not a carrier, so he has two normal copies of the gene.\n\nNow, individuals number 3 and 4 are likely the children of individuals number 1 and 2. Wait, but individual number 2 is not a carrier, so all his gametes would carry the normal allele.\n\nGiven that, let's think about the offspring of individual number 1 and 2. Individual number 1 is heterozygous, so her gametes would be half with the mutated allele and half with the normal allele.\n\nSince individual number 2 is homozygous normal, his gametes are all with the normal allele.\n\nTherefore, all of their children\u2014individuals number 3 and 4\u2014would receive the normal allele from individual number 2 and either the normal or mutated allele from individual number 1.\n\nSo, each of their children has a 50% chance of being heterozygous (carrying one mutated and one normal allele) and a 50% chance of being homozygous normal.\n\nNow, the question states that the spouses of individuals number 3 and 4 are not carriers, meaning they are homozygous normal.\n\nIndividual number 5 is the child of individual number 3 and their spouse, and individual number 6 is the child of individual number 4 and their spouse.\n\nThen, individual number 7 is the child of individuals number 5 and 6.\n\nMy goal is to find the probability that individual number 7 is affected by the disease, meaning he has two copies of the mutated allele.\n\nSince the disease is autosomal recessive, for individual number 7 to be affected, both of his parents must pass on the mutated allele.\n\nBut wait, the spouses of individuals number 3 and 4 are not carriers, meaning they are homozygous normal. So, individuals number 5 and 6 can only pass on the mutated allele if they themselves carry it.\n\nLet me first determine the genotypes of individuals number 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nIndividual number 3 is a child of individual number 1 (heterozygous) and individual number 2 (homozygous normal). As I said earlier, there's a 50% chance individual number 3 is heterozygous and 50% chance homozygous normal.\n\nSimilarly, individual number 4 is also a child of individual number 1 and 2, so same probabilities apply.\n\nNow, individual number 5 is the child of individual number 3 and their spouse, who is not a carrier (homozygous normal).\n\nSimilarly, individual number 6 is the child of individual number 4 and their spouse, who is also not a carrier (homozygous normal).\n\nSo, for individual number 5, if individual number 3 is heterozygous, then individual number 5 has a chance of receiving the mutated allele from individual number 3 and the normal allele from the spouse.\n\nSimilarly for individual number 6.\n\nBut maybe I should use the concept of the probability that individual number 5 is a carrier and similarly for individual number 6.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the concept of conditional probability here.\n\nLet me define some events:\n\n- Let A be the event that individual number 3 is heterozygous.\n\n- Let B be the event that individual number 4 is heterozygous.\n\n- Let C be the event that individual number 5 is heterozygous.\n\n- Let D be the event that individual number 6 is heterozygous.\n\n- Let E be the event that individual number 7 is affected.\n\nI need to find P(E).\n\nFirst, I need to find P(C) and P(D), the probabilities that individuals number 5 and 6 are carriers.\n\nIndividual number 5 is the child of individual number 3 (who may or may not be heterozygous) and their spouse, who is homozygous normal.\n\nSimilarly, individual number 6 is the child of individual number 4 (who may or may not be heterozygous) and their spouse, who is homozygous normal.\n\nSo, P(C) = P(individual number 5 is heterozygous)\n\nSimilarly, P(D) = P(individual number 6 is heterozygous)\n\nNow, P(C) = P(C | A) * P(A) + P(C | not A) * P(not A)\n\nSimilarly for P(D).\n\nBut since individual number 3's spouse is homozygous normal, if individual number 3 is heterozygous, then individual number 5 has a 50% chance of being heterozygous.\n\nIf individual number 3 is homozygous normal, then individual number 5 is also homozygous normal.\n\nTherefore, P(C) = (0.5) * (0.5) + (0) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, P(D) = (0.5) * (0.5) + (0) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nWait, no. P(A) is 0.5, and P(not A) is 0.5.\n\nSo, P(C) = P(C | A) * P(A) + P(C | not A) * P(not A)\n\nIf individual number 3 is heterozygous (A), then individual number 5 has a 50% chance of being heterozygous.\n\nIf individual number 3 is homozygous normal (not A), then individual number 5 has 0% chance of being heterozygous.\n\nTherefore, P(C) = 0.5 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, P(D) = 0.5 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nNow, for individual number 7 to be affected, both parents (individuals number 5 and 6) must pass on the mutated allele.\n\nBut individual number 5 has a 25% chance of being a carrier, and individual number 6 has a 25% chance of being a carrier.\n\nAssuming independence, the probability that both are carriers is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nThen, the probability that both pass on their mutated allele to individual number 7 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the overall probability is 0.0625 * 0.25 = 0.015625, or 1.5625%\n\nWait, but this seems too low. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning.\n\nIndividual number 1 is heterozygous, individual number 2 is homozygous normal.\n\nTheir children, individuals number 3 and 4, each have a 50% chance of being heterozygous.\n\nIndividual number 3 marries someone who is homozygous normal.\n\nTheir child, individual number 5, has a 50% chance of being heterozygous if individual number 3 is heterozygous, otherwise, individual number 5 is homozygous normal.\n\nSimilarly for individual number 4 and individual number 6.\n\nSo, P(C) = P(individual number 5 is heterozygous) = P(individual number 3 is heterozygous) * 0.5 = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, P(D) = P(individual number 6 is heterozygous) = P(individual number 4 is heterozygous) * 0.5 = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nThen, the probability that both parents are heterozygous is P(C) * P(D) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nAnd the probability that both pass on the mutated allele is (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability that individual number 7 is affected is 0.0625 * 0.25 = 0.015625, or 1.5625%\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to approach this using more advanced probability concepts or considering the entire pedigree at once.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the coefficient of relationship or consanguinity, but I don't think that's necessary here since the spouses are not related.\n\nWait, in this pedigree, individuals number 5 and 6 are cousins, right? Because individual number 5 is the child of individual number 3 and individual number 6 is the child of individual number 4, who are siblings.\n\nSo, individuals number 5 and 6 are first cousins.\n\nIn such cases, the probability of them both being carriers can be higher due to shared ancestry.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, since individual number 2 is not a carrier, and the spouses of individuals number 3 and 4 are not carriers, maybe the standard approach suffices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of identity by descent or something like that.\n\nBut I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the probability that individual number 7 is affected by the disease is 1.5625%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{64}} \\]"
