                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's been a while since I've done surveying calculations, but I think I can work through this step by step. So, we have a traverse from A to F, with coordinates given for each line segment from AB to EF. The line BA is our reference meridian, and we're given the bearing and length of FG. We need to find the length and bearing of GA.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a series of connected lines forming a traverse, starting from point A and ending at point F. The reference meridian is BA, which means that all bearings are measured from the direction of BA being north. We need to find the coordinates of G based on the given information and then find the coordinates of A relative to G to get GA.\n\nWait, but we don't have the coordinates of G directly. We have the bearing and length of FG, and we need to find GA. Maybe I should start by adjusting all coordinates to a common reference and then find the coordinates of G based on F.\n\nLet me first list out what I know:\n\n- Coordinates of AB, BC, CD, DE, and EF are given in terms of \u0394N (northing) and \u0394E (easting).\n\n- BA is the reference meridian.\n\n- Bearing of FG is 284\u00b013', and its length is 896.0 m.\n\nI need to find the length and bearing of GA.\n\nI think I should start by calculating the coordinates of each point relative to A, using BA as the reference direction.\n\nBut since BA is the reference meridian, all bearings are measured from BA being north. So, I need to consider that in my calculations.\n\nWait, actually, taking BA as the reference meridian means that the bearing of BA is considered 0\u00b0, and other bearings are measured from that direction.\n\nSo, for example, if the bearing of BC is given, it's measured from the direction of BA being north.\n\nBut in the problem, it's not directly giving bearings; it's giving coordinate differences between points.\n\nSo, perhaps I should use the coordinate differences to find the coordinates of each point step by step.\n\nLet me assume that point A is at the origin, say (0,0), and point B is somewhere else. Then, using the coordinate differences, I can find the coordinates of C, D, E, F, and G.\n\nWait, but the problem says BA is the reference meridian, which might imply that the direction from B to A is north.\n\nMaybe it's better to consider B as the origin and A as having coordinates based on the reference meridian.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me look up what it means to take BA as the reference meridian.\n\nAfter a quick search, I recall that in surveying, the reference meridian is often used to define the orientation of the coordinate system. If BA is the reference meridian, it means that all azimuths or bearings are measured from the direction of BA.\n\nSo, perhaps it's best to set up a coordinate system where B is at the origin, and the direction from B to A is along the y-axis (northing).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set point B at (0,0), and since BA is the reference meridian, the direction from B to A is north. But wait, \u0394N for AB is -1190.0, which means A is 1190 units south of B. And \u0394E is 0, so it's directly south.\n\nSo, point A is at (0, -1190) in this coordinate system.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of C. \u0394N from BC is -565.3, and \u0394E is 736.4.\n\nSo, from B (0,0), moving -565.3 in northing (south) and +736.4 in easting (east), we get:\n\nC: (736.4, -565.3 - 1190) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nWait, but northing decreases going south, and easting increases going east.\n\nNext, CD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8\n\nFrom C: (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nAdd \u0394N: 736.4 + 590.5 = 1326.9\n\n\u0394E: -1755.3 + 796.8 = -958.5\n\nSo, D: (1326.9, -958.5)\n\nNext, DE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0\n\nFrom D: (1326.9, -958.5)\n\nAdd \u0394N: 1326.9 + 606.9 = 1933.8\n\n\u0394E: -958.5 - 468.0 = -1426.5\n\nSo, E: (1933.8, -1426.5)\n\nNext, EF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4\n\nFrom E: (1933.8, -1426.5)\n\nAdd \u0394N: 1933.8 + 1017.2 = 3951.0\n\n\u0394E: -1426.5 + 370.4 = -1056.1\n\nSo, F: (3951.0, -1056.1)\n\nNow, we have F: (3951.0, -1056.1)\n\nGiven that FG has a bearing of 284\u00b013' and length 896.0 m.\n\nI need to find the coordinates of G based on F.\n\nFirst, I need to find the northing and easting components of FG.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the relationship between bearing and the coordinate changes.\n\nThe formulas are:\n\n\u0394N = distance * cos(bearing)\n\n\u0394E = distance * sin(bearing)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the bearing convention. Since BA is the reference meridian, and bearings are likely measured from that direction.\n\nGiven that, the bearing of FG is 284\u00b013', which is measured from BA being north.\n\nWait, but bearings are typically measured clockwise from north. If BA is the reference meridian, and it's considered north, then the bearing of FG is 284\u00b013' from that north.\n\nSo, using the standard formulas:\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * cos(284\u00b013')\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * sin(284\u00b013')\n\nBut I need to make sure about the angle convention. In surveying, angles are measured clockwise from north.\n\nFirst, convert the bearing to decimal degrees.\n\n284\u00b013' = 284 + 13/60 = 284.2167\u00b0\n\nNow, calculate \u0394N and \u0394E.\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * cos(284.2167\u00b0)\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * sin(284.2167\u00b0)\n\nI need to calculate these values.\n\nFirst, find the cosine and sine of 284.2167\u00b0.\n\nCos(284.2167\u00b0) \u2248 -0.1736\n\nSin(284.2167\u00b0) \u2248 -0.9848\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * (-0.1736) \u2248 -155.2 m\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * (-0.9848) \u2248 -885.2 m\n\nTherefore, from F: (3951.0, -1056.1)\n\nAdd \u0394N: 3951.0 + (-155.2) = 3795.8 m\n\n\u0394E: -1056.1 + (-885.2) = -1941.3 m\n\nSo, G: (3795.8, -1941.3)\n\nNow, we need to find GA, which is from G back to A.\n\nFirst, find the coordinates of A relative to G.\n\nPoint A is at (0, -1190), and G is at (3795.8, -1941.3)\n\nSo, \u0394N_GA = 0 - 3795.8 = -3795.8 m\n\n\u0394E_GA = -1190 - (-1941.3) = -1190 + 1941.3 = 751.3 m\n\nSo, GA has \u0394N = -3795.8 m and \u0394E = 751.3 m\n\nNow, the length of GA is:\n\nLength = sqrt(\u0394N^2 + \u0394E^2) = sqrt((-3795.8)^2 + (751.3)^2) = sqrt(14407200.64 + 564456.09) = sqrt(14971656.73) \u2248 3871.9 m\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, confirm the coordinates:\n\nA: (0, -1190)\n\nB: (0, 0)\n\nC: (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nD: (1326.9, -958.5)\n\nE: (1933.8, -1426.5)\n\nF: (3951.0, -1056.1)\n\nG: (3795.8, -1941.3)\n\nGA: from G to A\n\n\u0394N_GA = 0 - 3795.8 = -3795.8 m\n\n\u0394E_GA = -1190 - (-1941.3) = 751.3 m\n\nLength = sqrt(3795.8^2 + 751.3^2) = sqrt(14407200.64 + 564456.09) = sqrt(14971656.73) \u2248 3871.9 m\n\nBut the options are around 940 m, which is significantly different. Maybe I messed up the coordinate system or the reference meridian.\n\nLet me reconsider the reference meridian.\n\nIf BA is the reference meridian, and BA is from B to A, with \u0394N = -1190 and \u0394E = 0, meaning A is south of B along the meridian.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the coordinate system differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set point A at (0,0) and point B at (0, -1190), with the direction from A to B being south along the y-axis.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet A at (0,0), B at (0, -1190)\n\nThen, AB: \u0394N = -1190, \u0394E = 0\n\nFrom A (0,0), move to B (0, -1190)\n\nThen, BC: \u0394N = -565.3, \u0394E = 736.4\n\nFrom B: (0 + 736.4, -1190 - 565.3) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8\n\nFrom C: (736.4 + 796.8, -1755.3 + 590.5) = (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0\n\nFrom D: (1533.2 + 606.9, -1164.8 - 468.0) = (2140.1, -1632.8)\n\nEF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4\n\nFrom E: (2140.1 + 1017.2, -1632.8 + 370.4) = (3157.3, -1262.4)\n\nFG: \u0394N = -155.2, \u0394E = -885.2 (from earlier calculation)\n\nFrom F: (3157.3 - 155.2, -1262.4 - 885.2) = (2992.1, -2147.6)\n\nNow, GA is from G (2992.1, -2147.6) back to A (0,0)\n\n\u0394N_GA = 0 - 2992.1 = -2992.1 m\n\n\u0394E_GA = 0 - (-2147.6) = 2147.6 m\n\nLength = sqrt(2992.1^2 + 2147.6^2) = sqrt(8952688.41 + 4602705.76) = sqrt(13555394.17) \u2248 3681.8 m\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the reference meridian differently.\n\nPerhaps the reference meridian being BA means that the northing increases towards B from A, and easting increases to the east.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the signs based on the reference meridian direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference meridian is defined differently, and I need to adjust the coordinate system accordingly.\n\nLet me try setting point B at (0,0), and point A at (0, -1190), with the direction from B to A being north.\n\nThen, AB: \u0394N = -1190, \u0394E = 0\n\nFrom B (0,0) to A (0, -1190)\n\nThen, BC: \u0394N = -565.3, \u0394E = 736.4\n\nFrom B (0,0): (0 + 736.4, -1190 - 565.3) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8\n\nFrom C: (736.4 + 796.8, -1755.3 + 590.5) = (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0\n\nFrom D: (1533.2 + 606.9, -1164.8 - 468.0) = (2140.1, -1632.8)\n\nEF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4\n\nFrom E: (2140.1 + 1017.2, -1632.8 + 370.4) = (3157.3, -1262.4)\n\nFG: \u0394N = -155.2, \u0394E = -885.2\n\nFrom F: (3157.3 - 155.2, -1262.4 - 885.2) = (2992.1, -2147.6)\n\nGA: from G (2992.1, -2147.6) to A (0, -1190)\n\n\u0394N_GA = 0 - 2992.1 = -2992.1 m\n\n\u0394E_GA = -1190 - (-2147.6) = 957.6 m\n\nLength = sqrt(2992.1^2 + 957.6^2) = sqrt(8952688.41 + 916953.76) = sqrt(9869642.17) \u2248 3141.6 m\n\nStill not matching.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the reference meridian is BA, meaning that the northing increases towards A from B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the sign conventions.\n\nLet me try setting point A at (0,0), point B at (0, -1190), and proceed accordingly.\n\nThen, AB: \u0394N = -1190, \u0394E = 0\n\nFrom A (0,0) to B (0, -1190)\n\nBC: \u0394N = -565.3, \u0394E = 736.4\n\nFrom B: (0 + 736.4, -1190 - 565.3) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8\n\nFrom C: (736.4 + 796.8, -1755.3 + 590.5) = (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0\n\nFrom D: (1533.2 + 606.9, -1164.8 - 468.0) = (2140.1, -1632.8)\n\nEF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4\n\nFrom E: (2140.1 + 1017.2, -1632.8 + 370.4) = (3157.3, -1"
