                    "text": "So I have this problem about calculating the volume of water in a reservoir using the prismoidal formula. The table provides areas at different contour levels, and I need to find out how much water is impounded when the water level reaches 700 meters, given that the floor of the reservoir is at 660 meters.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the prismoidal formula is. From what I recall, the prismoidal formula is used to approximate the volume between two cross-sections that are not necessarily parallel. The general form of the prismoidal formula for volume is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{H}{n} (A_1 + A_n + n \\cdot A_m) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n\n- \\( H \\) is the vertical distance between the cross-sections,\n\n- \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_n \\) are the areas of the end cross-sections,\n\n- \\( A_m \\) is the area of the mid-section,\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of divisions between the end sections.\n\nBut I think there's a standard formula for using the prismoidal formula with equally spaced areas. Let me look that up.\n\nUpon checking, the prismoidal formula can also be used in a series fashion, similar to the trapezoidal rule, where the volume is calculated between successive contour levels.\n\nGiven that the contour interval is 5 meters (from 660 m to 670 m, 670 m to 675 m, and so on), I can apply the prismoidal formula between each pair of contour levels and sum up the volumes.\n\nThe general form for multiple sections is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{H}{3} \\left( A_1 + A_n + 4A_{mid} + 2A_{others} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( H \\) is the vertical distance (contour interval),\n\n- \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_n \\) are the areas at the start and end of the interval,\n\n- \\( A_{mid} \\) is the area midway between \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_n \\),\n\n- \\( A_{others} \\) are the areas of any other intermediate contours.\n\nBut in this case, since the contour intervals are 5 meters apart, I need to apply this formula step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the contour levels and their corresponding areas:\n\n| Contour (m) | Area (m\u00b2) |\n\n|-------------|-----------|\n\n| 660 | 5200 |\n\n| 665 | 9400 |\n\n| 670 | 16300 |\n\n| 675 | 22400 |\n\n| 680 | 40700 |\n\n| 685 | 61500 |\n\n| 690 | 112200 |\n\n| 695 | 198100 |\n\n| 670 | 272400 |\n\nWait a minute, the last contour is 670 m with an area of 272400 m\u00b2. Is that correct? It seems like there might be a typo because the contour levels should be increasing by 5 m increments. Maybe it's supposed to be 700 m? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the water level reaches 700 m,\" and the table lists up to 695 m and then jumps back to 670 m. Perhaps there's a mistake in the table, or maybe the 670 m at the end is a different location. Assuming it's a typo and should be 700 m, with an area of 272400 m\u00b2, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, adjusting the table:\n\n| Contour (m) | Area (m\u00b2) |\n\n|-------------|-----------|\n\n| 660 | 5200 |\n\n| 665 | 9400 |\n\n| 670 | 16300 |\n\n| 675 | 22400 |\n\n| 680 | 40700 |\n\n| 685 | 61500 |\n\n| 690 | 112200 |\n\n| 695 | 198100 |\n\n| 700 | 272400 |\n\nNow, I need to calculate the volume from 660 m to 700 m in 5 m intervals using the prismoidal formula.\n\nThe prismoidal formula for volume between two consecutive contour levels is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{H}{3} (A_1 + A_2 + 4A_{mid}) \\]\n\nBut since the intervals are 5 m, and assuming no mid-interval areas are given, I can use Simpson's 1/3 rule between each pair of consecutive areas.\n\nWait, but in the standard prismoidal formula for volumes, when areas are equally spaced, the formula is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{H}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_n + 4(A_1 + A_3 + \\ldots) + 2(A_2 + A_4 + \\ldots) \\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\( H \\) is the contour interval.\n\nGiven that, and since the intervals are 5 m, I can apply this formula directly to all the areas from 660 m to 700 m.\n\nFirst, identify the areas:\n\nA0 = 5200 m\u00b2 (660 m)\n\nA1 = 9400 m\u00b2 (665 m)\n\nA2 = 16300 m\u00b2 (670 m)\n\nA3 = 22400 m\u00b2 (675 m)\n\nA4 = 40700 m\u00b2 (680 m)\n\nA5 = 61500 m\u00b2 (685 m)\n\nA6 = 112200 m\u00b2 (690 m)\n\nA7 = 198100 m\u00b2 (695 m)\n\nA8 = 272400 m\u00b2 (700 m)\n\nNow, plug these into the prismoidal formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{5}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_8 + 4(A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7) + 2(A_2 + A_4 + A_6) \\right) \\]\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\nFirst, A0 + A8:\n\n5200 + 272400 = 277600 m\u00b2\n\nSecond, 4 times the sum of A1, A3, A5, A7:\n\n4 * (9400 + 22400 + 61500 + 198100) = 4 * (9400 + 22400 = 31800; 31800 + 61500 = 93300; 93300 + 198100 = 291400)\n\nSo, 4 * 291400 = 1,165,600 m\u00b3\n\nThird, 2 times the sum of A2, A4, A6:\n\n2 * (16300 + 40700 + 112200) = 2 * (16300 + 40700 = 57000; 57000 + 112200 = 169200)\n\nSo, 2 * 169200 = 338,400 m\u00b3\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n277600 + 1,165,600 + 338,400 = 1,781,600 m\u00b3\n\nNow, multiply by H/3, which is 5/3 \u2248 1.666...\n\nSo, V \u2248 1.666 * 1,781,600 \u2248 2,989,333.333 m\u00b3\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 29.893 * 106 m\u00b3\n\nB. 29.293 * 106 m\u00b3\n\nC. 29.493 * 106 m\u00b3\n\nD. 29.693 * 106 m\u00b3\n\nOption A is 29.893 * 10^6 m\u00b3, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, sum of A0 + A8:\n\n5200 + 272400 = 277600\n\nSecond, 4*(A1 + A3 + A5 + A7):\n\nA1 + A3 + A5 + A7 = 9400 + 22400 + 61500 + 198100\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n9400 + 22400 = 31800\n\n31800 + 61500 = 93300\n\n93300 + 198100 = 291400\n\nThen, 4 * 291400 = 1,165,600\n\nThird, 2*(A2 + A4 + A6):\n\nA2 + A4 + A6 = 16300 + 40700 + 112200\n\n16300 + 40700 = 57000\n\n57000 + 112200 = 169200\n\nThen, 2 * 169200 = 338,400\n\nSum all: 277600 + 1,165,600 + 338,400 = 1,781,600\n\nNow, H/3 = 5/3 \u2248 1.666...\n\n1.666 * 1,781,600 = 2,989,333.333 m\u00b3\n\nWhich rounds to 29.893 * 10^6 m\u00b3\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\nBut before confirming, let's verify if there's any other way to approach this or if I've misapplied the prismoidal formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the trapezoidal rule for volumes, where the volume between two consecutive areas is approximately the average of the two areas multiplied by the contour interval.\n\nSo, volume between 660 m and 665 m: (5200 + 9400)/2 * 5 = (14600)/2 * 5 = 7300 * 5 = 36,500 m\u00b3\n\nSimilarly, between 665 m and 670 m: (9400 + 16300)/2 * 5 = (25700)/2 * 5 = 12,850 * 5 = 64,250 m\u00b3\n\nAnd so on, up to 695 m and 700 m: (198100 + 272400)/2 * 5 = (470,500)/2 * 5 = 235,250 * 5 = 1,176,250 m\u00b3\n\nAdding all these volumes together should give the total volume.\n\nLet me calculate each step:\n\nBetween 660 m and 665 m: 36,500 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 665 m and 670 m: 64,250 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 670 m and 675 m: (16300 + 22400)/2 * 5 = (38,700)/2 * 5 = 19,350 * 5 = 96,750 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 675 m and 680 m: (22400 + 40700)/2 * 5 = (63,100)/2 * 5 = 31,550 * 5 = 157,750 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 680 m and 685 m: (40700 + 61500)/2 * 5 = (102,200)/2 * 5 = 51,100 * 5 = 255,500 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 685 m and 690 m: (61500 + 112200)/2 * 5 = (173,700)/2 * 5 = 86,850 * 5 = 434,250 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 690 m and 695 m: (112200 + 198100)/2 * 5 = (310,300)/2 * 5 = 155,150 * 5 = 775,750 m\u00b3\n\nBetween 695 m and 700 m: (198100 + 272400)/2 * 5 = (470,500)/2 * 5 = 235,250 * 5 = 1,176,250 m\u00b3\n\nNow, sum all these volumes:\n\n36,500 + 64,250 + 96,750 + 157,750 + 255,500 + 434,250 + 775,750 + 1,176,250\n\nLet's add step by step:\n\n36,500 + 64,250 = 100,750\n\n100,750 + 96,750 = 197,500\n\n197,500 + 157,750 = 355,250\n\n355,250 + 255,500 = 610,750\n\n610,750 + 434,250 = 1,045,000\n\n1,045,000 + 775,750 = 1,820,750\n\n1,820,750 + 1,176,250 = 2,997,000 m\u00b3\n\nThis gives approximately 2,997,000 m\u00b3, which is slightly higher than my previous calculation of 2,989,333 m\u00b3 using the prismoidal formula.\n\nThe difference might be due to the approximation methods used in the two different formulas. Both methods should theoretically give similar results, and the slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or the nature of the approximation.\n\nGiven that, both methods point towards a volume of around 2.99 million cubic meters, which corresponds to option A: 29.893 * 10^6 m\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
