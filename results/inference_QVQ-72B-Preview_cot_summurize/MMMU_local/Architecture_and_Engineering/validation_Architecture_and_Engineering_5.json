                    "text": "Let's tackle this geometry problem. I have a pentagon with labeled vertices and known internal angles, and I'm given the coordinate bearing angle of one side. I need to find the coordinate bearing angles of the other sides. The options provided seem similar, so I have to be careful with my calculations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a coordinate bearing angle is. In surveying and navigation, the bearing of a line is the angle between the north direction and the line, measured clockwise from north. So, for each side of the pentagon, I need to determine this angle.\n\nGiven that it's a pentagon, which is a five-sided polygon, and I have the internal angles at each vertex: 70\u00b0 at vertex 1, 145\u00b0 at vertex 2, 85\u00b0 at vertex 3, 120\u00b0 at vertex 4, and 120\u00b0 at vertex 5. The coordinate bearing angle of side L12 is 30\u00b0.\n\nI think the key here is to use the fact that the sum of the internal angles in a polygon is (n-2)*180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, that's (5-2)*180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0. But in this case, the sum of the given internal angles is 70\u00b0 + 145\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 540\u00b0, so they add up correctly.\n\nNow, to find the bearing angles of the other sides, I can consider traversing around the pentagon, keeping track of the turning angles. In a closed traverse, the sum of the deflection angles should be 540\u00b0, but since it's a closed polygon, the total deflection should bring me back to the starting bearing.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of deflection angles. Deflection angles are the angles between the forward extension of one course and the next course. In a closed polygon, the algebraic sum of deflection angles should be zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Since I have the internal angles, I can find the exterior angles by subtracting the internal angles from 180\u00b0. The exterior angles would then give me the change in direction from one side to the next.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAt vertex 1: internal angle 70\u00b0, so exterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 2: internal angle 145\u00b0, exterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 145\u00b0 = 35\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 3: internal angle 85\u00b0, exterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 85\u00b0 = 95\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 4: internal angle 120\u00b0, exterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 5: internal angle 120\u00b0, exterior angle = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0\n\nNow, if I start with the bearing of side L12 being 30\u00b0, and I know the exterior angles, I can add these exterior angles to the current bearing to get the next bearing.\n\nWait, actually, in traversing around the polygon, the bearing changes by the exterior angle at each vertex.\n\nSo, starting from side L12 with bearing 30\u00b0.\n\nAt vertex 2, turning through the exterior angle of 35\u00b0 clockwise, so new bearing = 30\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 65\u00b0 for side L23.\n\nAt vertex 3, exterior angle 95\u00b0, so bearing for L34 = 65\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 = 160\u00b0.\n\nAt vertex 4, exterior angle 60\u00b0, so bearing for L45 = 160\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 220\u00b0.\n\nAt vertex 5, exterior angle 60\u00b0, so bearing for L51 = 220\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 280\u00b0.\n\nWait a minute, this seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the turning is in the correct direction. In the problem, the pentagon is likely traversed in a specific direction, say clockwise or counterclockwise, and the angles are labeled accordingly.\n\nAssuming we're traversing in a clockwise direction, the exterior angles should be turning right (clockwise) from the previous side to the next side.\n\nGiven that, my calculations seem consistent. Let's check if the final bearing brings us back to the starting bearing.\n\nStarting from L12 at 30\u00b0, after traversing around the pentagon, the bearing should return to 30\u00b0.\n\nLet's sum the exterior angle changes: 35\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 250\u00b0.\n\nSince we're traversing a full circle, which is 360\u00b0, the total change should be 360\u00b0, but in a closed polygon, the sum of exterior angles is always 360\u00b0, regardless of the number of sides.\n\nWait, but in this case, I've only added up 250\u00b0. There must be something missing.\n\nOh, wait, I think I've misapplied the concept. The exterior angles I calculated are the angles between the extensions of the sides, but in traversing, the turning angles might be different.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider deflection angles instead. Deflection angles are measured from the forward extension of the previous line to the next line, and they can be left or right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for bearing changes in a traverse.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll consider the bearing changes based on the internal angles.\n\nAt each vertex, the turning angle from one side to the next is equal to the internal angle minus 180\u00b0, if traversing clockwise, or 180\u00b0 minus the internal angle if traversing counterclockwise.\n\nI need to decide which convention is being used here.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it's a pentagon with internal angles given, and the bearing of one side is known. Without knowing the traverse direction, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps I can assume a direction.\n\nLet's assume we're traversing clockwise. Then, the turning angle at each vertex would be 180\u00b0 - internal angle.\n\nSo, for vertex 1: turning angle = 180\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0 (turning clockwise)\n\nStarting from side L12 at 30\u00b0, turning 110\u00b0 clockwise to get to side L15.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the turning angles are equal to the internal angles minus 180\u00b0 for clockwise turns.\n\nLet me try calculating the turning angles based on the internal angles.\n\nAt vertex 1: internal angle 70\u00b0, turning angle = 180\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0 (clockwise)\n\nStarting from L12 at 30\u00b0, turning 110\u00b0 clockwise to get to L51.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because vertex 1 connects to vertex 2 and 5.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the sequence of vertices in order.\n\nLet me try to traverse from vertex 1 to vertex 2, then to vertex 3, and so on.\n\nStarting at vertex 1, side L12 has bearing 30\u00b0.\n\nMoving to vertex 2, the internal angle is 145\u00b0.\n\nIf traversing from L12 to L23, the turning angle at vertex 2 would be 180\u00b0 - 145\u00b0 = 35\u00b0 (clockwise)\n\nSo, new bearing for L23 = 30\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 65\u00b0\n\nNext, at vertex 3, internal angle 85\u00b0, turning angle = 180\u00b0 - 85\u00b0 = 95\u00b0 (clockwise)\n\nNew bearing for L34 = 65\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 = 160\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 4, internal angle 120\u00b0, turning angle = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 (clockwise)\n\nNew bearing for L45 = 160\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 220\u00b0\n\nAt vertex 5, internal angle 120\u00b0, turning angle = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 (clockwise)\n\nNew bearing for L51 = 220\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 280\u00b0\n\nNow, checking if this makes sense: starting at 30\u00b0, ending at 280\u00b0, which should be consistent with a full circle.\n\nWait, but 280\u00b0 is equivalent to 280\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = -80\u00b0, meaning we've turned 80\u00b0 clockwise to close the traverse.\n\nBut in terms of bearings, it's acceptable as long as the sum of the bearing changes equals the total traverse closure.\n\nGiven that, my calculations suggest that the correct answers should be:\n\n\u03b123 = 65\u00b0\n\n\u03b134 = 160\u00b0\n\n\u03b145 = 220\u00b0\n\n\u03b151 = 280\u00b0\n\nLooking back at the options, option C matches this:\n\nC. \u03b123=65\u00b0, \u03b134=160\u00b0, \u03b145=220\u00b0, \u03b151=280\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{C}\\]"
