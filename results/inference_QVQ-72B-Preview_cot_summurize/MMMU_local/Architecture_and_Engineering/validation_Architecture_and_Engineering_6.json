                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about aerial photography and determining the scale of the photograph and the length of the air base. Here's what I know:\n\n- Camera focal length: 200 mm\n- Flying height: 1500 m\n- Overlap between photographs: 60%\n- Print size: 250 mm x 250 mm\n- Ground elevation: 250 m above sea level\n\nFirst, I need to find the scale of the photograph. The scale of a photograph is generally given by the ratio of a distance on the photo to the corresponding distance on the ground. The formula for the scale is:\n\nScale = focal length / (height above ground)\n\nBut wait, the height is given as 1500 m, and the ground is 250 m above sea level. So, the height above the ground would be:\n\nHeight above ground = flying height - ground elevation = 1500 m - 250 m = 1250 m\n\nSo, scale = focal length / height above ground = 200 mm / 1250 m\n\nHmm, but units need to be consistent. Let's convert everything to meters:\n\n200 mm = 0.2 m\n\nScale = 0.2 m / 1250 m = 0.2 / 1250 = 0.00016\n\nTo express this as cm on the photo to meters on the ground:\n\n0.00016 * 100 cm/m = 0.016 cm/m\n\nThat doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the scale can be expressed as:\n\n1 cm on photo = (height above ground / focal length) meters on ground\n\nWait, let's recall the formula for the scale of a photograph:\n\nScale = H / f\n\nWhere H is the flying height above ground, and f is the focal length.\n\nGiven that, and considering the units, let's compute H / f:\n\nH = 1250 m\nf = 200 mm = 0.2 m\n\nScale = 1250 / 0.2 = 6250\n\nSo, 1 unit on the photo corresponds to 6250 units on the ground.\n\nIf we express this as 1 cm on photo corresponds to X cm on ground:\n\n1 cm / 6250 cm = photo distance / ground distance\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express the scale in terms of cm to meters.\n\nLet's see, 1 cm on photo = 6250 cm on ground = 62.5 m\n\nSo, scale is 1 cm = 62.5 m\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\nScale = focal length / height above ground\n\nBut in aerial photography, the scale is often given by 1 / (H / f), which is f / H.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the scale of an aerial photograph.\n\nUpon checking, the vertical scale in aerial photography is given by:\n\nScale = H / f\n\nWhere H is the flying height above the ground, and f is the focal length.\n\nGiven that, and with H = 1250 m and f = 200 mm (0.2 m), scale = 1250 / 0.2 = 6250\n\nSo, 1 unit on photo corresponds to 6250 units on ground.\n\nIf we express it in cm on photo to meters on ground:\n\n1 cm on photo = 6250 cm on ground = 62.5 m\n\nSo, scale is 1 cm = 62.5 m\n\nNow, moving on to the air base.\n\nThe air base is the horizontal distance between the exposure stations of two consecutive photographs.\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, and the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, we can find the air base.\n\nFirst, find the length of the photograph in the direction of flight.\n\nSince the overlap is 60%, the air base can be calculated based on the overlap.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the length of the photograph in the direction of flight as L.\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, the air base is L - 0.6L = 0.4L\n\nFrom the diagram, it shows that the air base is 0.4L.\n\nSo, air base = 0.4 * L\n\nFirst, find L.\n\nL is the length of the photograph in the direction of flight, which is 250 mm.\n\nWait, the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, so L = 250 mm\n\nTherefore, air base = 0.4 * 250 mm = 100 mm\n\nBut air base is a ground distance, so we need to convert this photo distance to ground distance using the scale.\n\nWe just found that 1 cm on photo corresponds to 62.5 m on ground.\n\nSo, 100 mm on photo corresponds to 100 * 62.5 m = 6250 m on ground.\n\nTherefore, air base = 625 m\n\nSo, the scale is 1 cm = 62.5 m and air base = 625 m, which matches option A.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, the air base can also be calculated using the flying height and the focal length.\n\nThe air base B is related to the overlap percentage and the photograph length.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a formula that directly relates B to H and f.\n\nIn aerial photography, the air base B is given by:\n\nB = L * (1 - O)\n\nWhere L is the photograph length and O is the overlap percentage.\n\nGiven that, B = 250 mm * (1 - 0.6) = 250 mm * 0.4 = 100 mm\n\nThen, to find the ground distance, use the scale.\n\nScale = f / H = 200 mm / 1250 m = 0.16 mm/m\n\nSo, 1 mm on photo = 0.16 m on ground\n\nTherefore, 100 mm on photo = 100 * 0.16 m = 16 m on ground\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I messed up the scale formula.\n\nLet me revisit the scale calculation.\n\nScale = H / f = 1250 m / 0.2 m = 6250\n\nSo, 1 unit on photo = 6250 units on ground.\n\nIf photo is in mm, then 1 mm on photo = 6250 mm on ground = 6.25 m\n\nTherefore, 1 cm on photo = 62.5 m on ground\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nEarlier, I used scale = f / H, which is incorrect in this context.\n\nSo, sticking with scale = H / f = 6250\n\nTherefore, 1 mm on photo = 6.25 m on ground\n\nThus, air base = 100 mm * 6.25 m/mm = 625 m\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the scale is 1 cm = 62.5 m and air base = 625 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
