                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem, P9.31, about a pin-connected structure. There are three bars: AB, AC, and AD. Points B, C, and D are supported, and there's a 200 kN force acting downward at point A. The distances are given: from B to C is 4 meters, from C to D is 4 meters, and the vertical height from A to the supports is 4 meters. The Young's modulus, E, is 200 GPa, the cross-sectional area of AB is 1000 mm\u00b2, and the cross-sectional areas of AC and AD are both 500 mm\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to find the vertical displacement at point A. Since it's a pin-connected structure, the bars can only extend or contract axially, and the pins allow forces only along the bars.\n\nI think I should start by determining the forces in each bar. Once I have the forces, I can calculate the extension or contraction of each bar using the formula \u0394L = (F * L) / (A * E), where F is the force, L is the length, A is the area, and E is the Young's modulus.\n\nBut before that, I need to find the lengths of the bars. Let's see:\n\nPoint C is directly above A, since the vertical height is 4 meters. Points B and D are horizontally 4 meters apart from C.\n\nSo, for bar AB: it goes from B to A, which is diagonally down and to the left. The horizontal distance from B to C is 4 meters, and the vertical distance from A to C is 4 meters.\n\nWait, actually, point A is 4 meters below C, and B is 4 meters to the left of C. So, the horizontal distance from B to C is 4 meters, and from C to D is another 4 meters.\n\nSo, for bar AB: horizontal distance from B to C is 4 meters, and vertical distance from A to C is 4 meters. So, the horizontal component of AB is half of that, since it's an equilateral triangle sort of setup. Wait, no, it's not equilateral.\n\nActually, I need to find the coordinates of each point to calculate the lengths accurately.\n\nLet me assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s say point C is at (0, 0)\n\nThen point A is directly below at (0, -4 m)\n\nPoint B is 4 meters to the left of C, so at (-4 m, 0)\n\nPoint D is 4 meters to the right of C, so at (4 m, 0)\n\nNow, bar AB goes from A (0, -4) to B (-4, 0). The length of AB is the distance between these points.\n\nUsing the distance formula: L_AB = sqrt[(0 - (-4))^2 + (-4 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(4)^2 + (-4)^2] = sqrt[16 + 16] = sqrt[32] = 4*sqrt(2) meters.\n\nSimilarly, bar AC goes from A (0, -4) to C (0, 0). So, L_AC = sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 16] = 4 meters.\n\nBar AD goes from A (0, -4) to D (4, 0). So, L_AD = sqrt[(0 - 4)^2 + (-4 - 0)^2] = sqrt[16 + 16] = sqrt[32] = 4*sqrt(2) meters.\n\nSo, L_AB = L_AD = 4*sqrt(2) m \u2248 5.65685 m\n\nL_AC = 4 m\n\nNow, I need to find the forces in each bar. Since it's a pin-connected structure, the pins can transfer forces only along the bars.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the equilibrium at point A.\n\nThere is a downward force of 200 kN, and the forces from bars AB, AC, and AD acting at point A.\n\nSo, sum of forces in the x-direction: F_AB * cos(\u03b8_AB) + F_AD * cos(\u03b8_AD) = 0\n\nSum of forces in the y-direction: F_AB * sin(\u03b8_AB) + F_AC + F_AD * sin(\u03b8_AD) - 200 kN = 0\n\nFirst, find the angles \u03b8_AB and \u03b8_AD.\n\nFor bar AB: it goes from A to B. The horizontal distance from A to B is 4 meters (since B is at -4 m and A at 0), and vertical distance is 4 meters.\n\nSo, \u03b8_AB = arctan(opposite / adjacent) = arctan(4 / 4) = arctan(1) = 45\u00b0\n\nSimilarly, \u03b8_AD = arctan(4 / 4) = 45\u00b0\n\nWait, but AD goes from A to D, which is to the right and up. So, \u03b8_AD should be 45\u00b0 measured from the positive x-axis.\n\nWait, actually, since A is at (0, -4) and D is at (4, 0), the angle \u03b8_AD is the angle between AD and the vertical.\n\nLet me calculate it properly.\n\nThe horizontal distance from A to D is 4 meters (from 0 to 4), and the vertical distance is 4 meters (from -4 to 0).\n\nSo, the angle \u03b8_AD with respect to the vertical is \u03b8_AD = arctan(opposite / adjacent) = arctan(4 / 4) = 45\u00b0\n\nSimilarly, \u03b8_AB with respect to the vertical is \u03b8_AB = arctan(4 / 4) = 45\u00b0\n\nWait, but AB is to the left and down, so its angle with the vertical is \u03b8_AB = -45\u00b0\n\nBut when using trigonometric functions, it's better to consider the actual components.\n\nSo, for bar AB:\n\ncos(\u03b8_AB) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 4 / (4*sqrt(2)) = 1 / sqrt(2)\n\nsin(\u03b8_AB) = opposite / hypotenuse = 4 / (4*sqrt(2)) = 1 / sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, for bar AD:\n\ncos(\u03b8_AD) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 4 / (4*sqrt(2)) = 1 / sqrt(2)\n\nsin(\u03b8_AD) = opposite / hypotenuse = 4 / (4*sqrt(2)) = 1 / sqrt(2)\n\nNow, plug these into the equilibrium equations.\n\nSum of forces in x-direction:\n\nF_AB * (1 / sqrt(2)) + F_AD * (1 / sqrt(2)) = 0\n\n=> F_AB + F_AD = 0\n\nWait, no, since both cosines are positive, but actually, since AB is to the left and AD is to the right, their horizontal components are in opposite directions.\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully.\n\nPoint A is at (0, -4), B at (-4, 0), D at (4, 0).\n\nSo, the horizontal component of AB is towards the left, and of AD is towards the right.\n\nSo, F_AB * cos(\u03b8_AB) is negative (since it's towards the left), and F_AD * cos(\u03b8_AD) is positive (towards the right).\n\nSo, sum of forces in x-direction:\n\n-F_AB * (1 / sqrt(2)) + F_AD * (1 / sqrt(2)) = 0\n\n=> -F_AB + F_AD = 0 => F_AD = F_AB\n\nSum of forces in y-direction:\n\nF_AB * sin(\u03b8_AB) + F_AC + F_AD * sin(\u03b8_AD) - 200 kN = 0\n\n=> F_AB * (1 / sqrt(2)) + F_AC + F_AD * (1 / sqrt(2)) - 200 kN = 0\n\nBut since F_AD = F_AB, we can substitute:\n\n=> F_AB / sqrt(2) + F_AC + F_AB / sqrt(2) - 200 kN = 0\n\n=> 2 * (F_AB / sqrt(2)) + F_AC = 200 kN\n\n=> (2 / sqrt(2)) * F_AB + F_AC = 200 kN\n\n=> sqrt(2) * F_AB + F_AC = 200 kN\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) F_AD = F_AB\n\n2) sqrt(2) * F_AB + F_AC = 200 kN\n\nBut we have three unknowns: F_AB, F_AC, and F_AD. However, since F_AD = F_AB, we can consider F_AD as F_AB.\n\nBut actually, from the first equation, F_AD = F_AB, so we can substitute in the second equation.\n\nWait, but we have only two equations for three unknowns. We need another equation.\n\nOh, wait, since the structure is pin-connected and symmetric, maybe there's another relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the virtual work principle or another method to find the displacement.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the deformation of each bar and how they contribute to the displacement at point A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of virtual work to find the displacement.\n\nBut first, let's try to find the forces in each bar.\n\nFrom the equilibrium equations:\n\nF_AD = F_AB\n\nAnd sqrt(2) * F_AB + F_AC = 200 kN\n\nSince F_AD = F_AB, and the structure is symmetric, perhaps F_AC is equal to the vertical force divided by 2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nLet me denote F_AB = F, then F_AD = F, and F_AC = 200 kN - sqrt(2) * F\n\nBut I need another equation to solve for F.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the deformation of each bar and how they add up to give the total displacement at A.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nEach bar will extend or contract based on the force in it, and the displacement at A will be the sum of the displacements caused by each bar.\n\nBut since the bars are connected at A, their displacements must add up appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of virtual work to find the displacement.\n\nThe virtual work equation is:\n\n\u03b4U = \u03b4W\n\nWhere \u03b4U is the virtual strain energy and \u03b4W is the virtual work done by the external forces.\n\nSo, \u03b4U = (F_AB * \u03b4L_AB) / E * A_AB + (F_AC * \u03b4L_AC) / E * A_AC + (F_AD * \u03b4L_AD) / E * A_AD\n\nBut \u03b4L_AB = (F_AB * L_AB) / (E * A_AB)\n\nSimilarly for the other bars.\n\nBut since we are interested in the vertical displacement at A, we need to relate the extensions of the bars to the displacement at A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the stiffness method.\n\nFirst, find the stiffness of each bar, then set up the equilibrium equations, and solve for the displacements.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe axial stiffness of each bar is k = E * A / L\n\nSo, for bar AB:\n\nk_AB = E * A_AB / L_AB = 200 GPa * 1000 mm\u00b2 / (4*sqrt(2) m)\n\nWait, need to convert units consistently. E is in GPa (10^9 Pa), area in mm\u00b2 (1 mm\u00b2 = 1e-6 m\u00b2), and length in meters.\n\nSo, E = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 Pa = 200e9 Pa\n\nA_AB = 1000 mm\u00b2 = 1000 * 1e-6 m\u00b2 = 1e-3 m\u00b2\n\nL_AB = 4*sqrt(2) m \u2248 5.65685 m\n\nSo, k_AB = (200e9 Pa * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m \u2248 (200e6 N/m\u00b2 * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200 N/m) / 5.65685 m \u2248 35.355 N/m\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check the units.\n\nE = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 Pa = 200e9 Pa\n\nA_AB = 1000 mm\u00b2 = 1000 * 1e-6 m\u00b2 = 1e-3 m\u00b2\n\nL_AB = 4*sqrt(2) m \u2248 5.65685 m\n\nSo, k_AB = E * A / L = (200e9 Pa * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200e6 N/m\u00b2 * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200 N/m) / 5.65685 m \u2248 35.355 N/m\n\nThat seems too small for k_AB. Maybe I messed up the units.\n\nWait, E is in GPa, area in mm\u00b2, and length in meters.\n\nLet me convert everything to consistent units.\n\nE = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 Pa\n\nA_AB = 1000 mm\u00b2 = 1000 * 1e-6 m\u00b2 = 1e-3 m\u00b2\n\nL_AB = 4*sqrt(2) m \u2248 5.65685 m\n\nSo, k_AB = E * A / L = (200e9 Pa * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200e6 N/m\u00b2 * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200 N/m) / 5.65685 m \u2248 35.355 N/m\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I should keep all units in SI base units: E in N/m\u00b2, A in m\u00b2, L in m.\n\nE = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 N/m\u00b2\n\nA_AB = 1000 mm\u00b2 = 1000 * 1e-6 m\u00b2 = 1e-3 m\u00b2\n\nL_AB = 5.65685 m\n\nSo, k_AB = E * A / L = (200e9 N/m\u00b2 * 1e-3 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m = (200e6 N/m) / 5.65685 m \u2248 35.355e3 N/m \u2248 35.355 kN/m\n\nAh, I see, I missed the units in the intermediate step.\n\nSo, k_AB \u2248 35.355 kN/m\n\nSimilarly, for AC:\n\nk_AC = E * A_AC / L_AC = (200e9 N/m\u00b2 * 500e-6 m\u00b2) / 4 m = (200e3 N/m\u00b2 * 500e-6 m\u00b2) / 4 m = (100 N/m) / 4 m = 25 N/m\n\nWait, again, units seem off.\n\nWait, E = 200 GPa = 200e9 Pa = 200e9 N/m\u00b2\n\nA_AC = 500 mm\u00b2 = 500e-6 m\u00b2\n\nL_AC = 4 m\n\nSo, k_AC = E * A / L = (200e9 N/m\u00b2 * 500e-6 m\u00b2) / 4 m = (100e3 N/m) / 4 m = 25e3 N/m = 25 kN/m\n\nSimilarly, for AD:\n\nk_AD = E * A_AD / L_AD = (200e9 N/m\u00b2 * 500e-6 m\u00b2) / 5.65685 m \u2248 (100e3 N/m) / 5.65685 m \u2248 17.677 kN/m\n\nNow, with the stiffnesses, I can set up the equilibrium equations.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should consider the displacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of virtual work to find the displacement at A.\n\nThe virtual work equation is:\n\n\u03b4U = \u03b4W\n\nWhere \u03b4U is the virtual strain energy and \u03b4W is the virtual work done by the external forces.\n\nSo, \u03b4U = (F_AB * \u03b4L_AB) / E * A_AB + (F_AC * \u03b4L_AC) / E * A_AC + (F_AD * \u03b4L_AD) / E * A_AD\n\nBut \u03b4L_AB = (F_AB * L_AB) / (E * A_AB)\n\nSimilarly for the other bars.\n\nBut since we are interested in the vertical displacement at A, we need to relate the extensions of the bars to the displacement at A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the displacement at A as the sum of the displacements caused by each bar.\n\nBut since the bars are connected at A, their displacements must add up appropriately.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the compatibility conditions.\n\nThe displacement at A is the sum of the displacements caused by each bar.\n\nBut I need to find a relationship between the forces and the displacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for displacement in truss structures.\n\nIn truss analysis, the displacement at a point can be found using the formula:\n\n\u03b4 = \u03a3 (F_i * L_i) / (A_i * E) * cos(\u03b8_i)\n\nWhere F_i is the force in the i-th member, L_i is its length, A_i is its cross-sectional area, E is Young's modulus, and \u03b8_i is the angle between the member and the direction of the displacement.\n\nBut in this case, since the structure is pin-connected and the supports are fixed, I need to find the forces first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of virtual work by applying a virtual force at A and finding the corresponding virtual displacements.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nApply a virtual unit force (1 N) at A in the vertical direction.\n\nThen, the virtual work done by this force is \u03b4W = \u03b4 * 1 N, where \u03b4 is the vertical displacement at A.\n\nThe virtual strain energy \u03b4U is the sum of the virtual strain energies in each bar.\n\n\u03b4U"
