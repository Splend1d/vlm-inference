                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on surveying methods, but I remember that D.M.D. stands for Double Meridian Distance, which is a method used to calculate the area of a closed traverse. The formula for the area using this method is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum (D \\times M)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(D\\) is the departure of each course.\n\n- \\(M\\) is the meridian distance for each course.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what meridian distance is. The meridian distance (M) for each course is the accumulated sum of the latitudes from the starting point to that course. Since it's a closed traverse, the sum of the latitudes should be zero.\n\nGiven the table with latitudes and departures for lines AB, BC, CD, and DA, I need to calculate the meridian distance for each line and then use those to find the area.\n\nLet me list out the given values:\n\nLine | Latitude (m) | Departure (m)\n\n--- | --- | ---\n\nAB | -116.1 | -44.4\n\nBC | +6.8 | +58.2\n\nCD | +80.5 | +17.2\n\nDA | +28.8 | -31.0\n\nFirst, I should verify that the sum of the latitudes is zero, which is a condition for a closed traverse.\n\nSum of latitudes = -116.1 + 6.8 + 80.5 + 28.8 = Let's calculate that:\n\n-116.1\n\n+ 6.8\n\n= -109.3\n\n-109.3 + 80.5 = -28.8\n\n-28.8 + 28.8 = 0\n\nYes, the sum is zero, so it's a closed traverse.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the meridian distance (M) for each course. The meridian distance for a course is the sum of the latitudes from the starting point to that course.\n\nLet's assign M for point A as 0.\n\nFor point B: M = 0 + (-116.1) = -116.1 m\n\nFor point C: M = -116.1 + 6.8 = -109.3 m\n\nFor point D: M = -109.3 + 80.5 = -28.8 m\n\nFor point A (closing): M = -28.8 + 28.8 = 0 m\n\nNow, I need to calculate the product of each departure (D) and its corresponding meridian distance (M), then sum all these products and divide by 2 to get the area.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nLine | Departure (D) | Meridian Distance (M) | D \u00d7 M\n\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n\nAB | -44.4 | -116.1 | (-44.4) \u00d7 (-116.1) = 5162.84\n\nBC | +58.2 | -109.3 | 58.2 \u00d7 (-109.3) = -6344.94\n\nCD | +17.2 | -28.8 | 17.2 \u00d7 (-28.8) = -497.76\n\nDA | -31.0 | 0 | -31.0 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nNow, sum of (D \u00d7 M) = 5162.84 - 6344.94 - 497.76 + 0 = Let's calculate:\n\n5162.84 - 6344.94 = -1182.10\n\n-1182.10 - 497.76 = -1679.86\n\n-1679.86 + 0 = -1679.86\n\nNow, the area is (1/2) \u00d7 |sum of (D \u00d7 M)| = (1/2) \u00d7 1679.86 = 839.93 m\u00b2\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, sum of latitudes:\n\nAB: -116.1\n\nBC: +6.8 \u2192 total: -116.1 + 6.8 = -109.3\n\nCD: +80.5 \u2192 total: -109.3 + 80.5 = -28.8\n\nDA: +28.8 \u2192 total: -28.8 + 28.8 = 0\n\nThat's correct.\n\nMeridian distances:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: -116.1\n\nC: -109.3\n\nD: -28.8\n\nA: 0\n\nProducts:\n\nAB: D = -44.4, M = -116.1 \u2192 (-44.4) \u00d7 (-116.1) = 5162.84\n\nBC: D = +58.2, M = -109.3 \u2192 58.2 \u00d7 (-109.3) = -6344.94\n\nCD: D = +17.2, M = -28.8 \u2192 17.2 \u00d7 (-28.8) = -497.76\n\nDA: D = -31.0, M = 0 \u2192 -31.0 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nSum: 5162.84 - 6344.94 - 497.76 + 0 = -1679.86\n\nArea: (1/2) \u00d7 1679.86 = 839.93 m\u00b2\n\nBut this doesn't match the options. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, sometimes in traverse surveys, the area calculation might require considering the absolute values or signs differently. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use another method to verify.\n\nAnother common method for calculating the area of a traverse is the coordinate method, where you use the coordinates of the points.\n\nBut since I only have latitudes and departures, maybe I can find the coordinates first.\n\nLet's recall that:\n\n- Latitude (Lat) represents the north-south component.\n\n- Departure (Dep) represents the east-west component.\n\nIf I assume point A is at (0,0), then I can calculate the coordinates of points B, C, and D.\n\nPoint A: (0,0)\n\nPoint B: (0 + (-44.4), 0 + (-116.1)) = (-44.4, -116.1)\n\nPoint C: (-44.4 + 58.2, -116.1 + 6.8) = (13.8, -109.3)\n\nPoint D: (13.8 + 17.2, -109.3 + 80.5) = (31.0, -28.8)\n\nBack to point A: (31.0 + (-31.0), -28.8 + 28.8) = (0,0)\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can use the shoelace formula to calculate the area.\n\nThe shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + \\cdots + x_n y_1) - (y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + \\cdots + y_n x_1)|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (-44.4, -116.1)\n\nC: (13.8, -109.3)\n\nD: (31.0, -28.8)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |(0 \\times (-116.1) + (-44.4) \\times (-109.3) + 13.8 \\times (-28.8) + 31.0 \\times 0) - (0 \\times (-44.4) + (-116.1) \\times 13.8 + (-109.3) \\times 31.0 + (-28.8) \\times 0)|\n\\]\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n0 \u00d7 (-116.1) = 0\n\n(-44.4) \u00d7 (-109.3) = 4855.92\n\n13.8 \u00d7 (-28.8) = -399.84\n\n31.0 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nSum: 0 + 4855.92 - 399.84 + 0 = 4456.08\n\nSecond part:\n\n0 \u00d7 (-44.4) = 0\n\n(-116.1) \u00d7 13.8 = -1602.58\n\n(-109.3) \u00d7 31.0 = -3388.30\n\n(-28.8) \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nSum: 0 - 1602.58 - 3388.30 + 0 = -4990.88\n\nNow, Area = (1/2) |4456.08 - (-4990.88)| = (1/2) |4456.08 + 4990.88| = (1/2) \u00d7 9447 = 4723.5 m\u00b2\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, that's 4724 m\u00b2, which corresponds to option A. 4725 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 839.93 m\u00b2 using the D.M.D. method, which doesn't match. There must be an error in my application of the D.M.D. method.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for D.M.D. to calculate the area.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for the area using the D.M.D. method is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum (D \\times M)\n\\]\n\nWhere D is the departure of each course, and M is the meridian distance, which is the accumulated sum of the latitudes from the starting point to that course.\n\nI followed this step correctly earlier, but perhaps there's a sign convention I missed.\n\nIn my previous calculation, I got 839.93 m\u00b2, but according to the shoelace formula, it's 4723.5 m\u00b2. There's a significant discrepancy.\n\nMaybe I misapplied the D.M.D. method. Let me try recalculating the meridian distances.\n\nGiven that the meridian distance for point A is 0.\n\nFor point B: M = 0 + (-116.1) = -116.1\n\nFor point C: M = -116.1 + 6.8 = -109.3\n\nFor point D: M = -109.3 + 80.5 = -28.8\n\nFor point A: M = -28.8 + 28.8 = 0\n\nNow, the products:\n\nAB: D = -44.4, M = -116.1 \u2192 (-44.4) \u00d7 (-116.1) = 5162.84\n\nBC: D = +58.2, M = -109.3 \u2192 58.2 \u00d7 (-109.3) = -6344.94\n\nCD: D = +17.2, M = -28.8 \u2192 17.2 \u00d7 (-28.8) = -497.76\n\nDA: D = -31.0, M = 0 \u2192 -31.0 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nSum: 5162.84 - 6344.94 - 497.76 + 0 = -1679.86\n\nArea: (1/2) \u00d7 | -1679.86 | = 839.93 m\u00b2\n\nBut this doesn't match the shoelace formula result of 4723.5 m\u00b2. There's definitely a mistake here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider absolute values or another approach in the D.M.D. method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a different formula for the D.M.D. method.\n\nLet me check a different formula for the area using latitudes and departures.\n\nAnother formula for the area of a traverse is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (D \\times \\text{Lat}_{next}) \\right|\n\\]\n\nWhere you take the departure of one course and the latitude of the next course.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor a closed traverse with four sides:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |(D_{AB} \\times \\text{Lat}_{BC}) + (D_{BC} \\times \\text{Lat}_{CD}) + (D_{CD} \\times \\text{Lat}_{DA}) + (D_{DA} \\times \\text{Lat}_{AB})|\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nD_AB = -44.4, Lat_BC = 6.8\n\nD_BC = 58.2, Lat_CD = 80.5\n\nD_CD = 17.2, Lat_DA = 28.8\n\nD_DA = -31.0, Lat_AB = -116.1\n\nSo,\n\nArea = (1/2) |(-44.4 \u00d7 6.8) + (58.2 \u00d7 80.5) + (17.2 \u00d7 28.8) + (-31.0 \u00d7 -116.1)|\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-44.4 \u00d7 6.8 = -299.52\n\n58.2 \u00d7 80.5 = 4691.10\n\n17.2 \u00d7 28.8 = 499.36\n\n-31.0 \u00d7 -116.1 = 3599.10\n\nSum: -299.52 + 4691.10 + 499.36 + 3599.10 = 8499.04\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 8499.04 = 4249.52 m\u00b2\n\nThis is different from both previous results. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the order of the terms differently in this formula.\n\nLet me check the correct formula for the area using latitudes and departures.\n\nUpon reviewing, the correct formula should be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (D_i \\times \\text{Lat}_{i+1}) \\right|\n\\]\n\nWhere the sum is from i=1 to n, and Lat_{n+1} = Lat_1.\n\nGiven that, let's apply it correctly.\n\nGiven:\n\nLine | Departure (D) | Latitude (Lat)\n\n--- | --- | ---\n\nAB | -44.4 | -116.1\n\nBC | 58.2 | 6.8\n\nCD | 17.2 | 80.5\n\nDA | -31.0 | 28.8\n\nSo,\n\nArea = (1/2) |(D_AB \u00d7 Lat_BC) + (D_BC \u00d7 Lat_CD) + (D_CD \u00d7 Lat_DA) + (D_DA \u00d7 Lat_AB)|\n\nPlugging in:\n\n= (1/2) |(-44.4 \u00d7 6.8) + (58.2 \u00d7 80.5) + (17.2 \u00d7 28.8) + (-31.0 \u00d7 -116.1)|\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n-44.4 \u00d7 6.8 = -299.52\n\n58.2 \u00d7 80.5 = 4691.10\n\n17.2 \u00d7 28.8 = 499.36\n\n-31.0 \u00d7 -116.1 = 3599.10\n\nSum: -299.52 + 4691.10 + 499.36 + 3599.10 = 8499.04\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 8499.04 = 4249.52 m\u00b2\n\nThis is still not matching the shoelace formula result of 4723.5 m\u00b2.\n\nI must be missing something fundamental here.\n\nLet me consider that in the shoelace formula, I used coordinates in a specific order, whereas in the latitude-departure method, perhaps the order matters differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the latitude and departure values are given in meters, and I need to ensure consistent units.\n\nWait, perhaps the latitudes and departures are not just simple additions but need to be adjusted based on the actual course lengths or bearings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the actual coordinates first and then use those to find the area.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the D.M.D. method isn't the best approach here, and the shoelace formula gives the correct result.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the shoelace formula result of 4723.5 m\u00b2, which rounds to 4725 m\u00b2, corresponding to option A.\n\nHowever, I'm still curious as to why the D.M.D. method gave a different result. Maybe I'll look into it further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the D.M.D. method requires that all meridian distances be considered as absolute values or handled differently.\n\nLet me try recalculating the meridian distances using absolute values.\n\nIf I take absolute values:\n\nLine | Latitude (m) |"
