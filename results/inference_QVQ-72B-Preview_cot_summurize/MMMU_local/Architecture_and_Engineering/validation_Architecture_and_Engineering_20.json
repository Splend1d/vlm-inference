                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the side widths and the cross-sectional area of an embankment. There's a figure associated with it, but since I can't see it, I'll have to work with the dimensions provided in the text. The dimensions are:\n\n- Road width = 20 m\n\n- Existing ground slope = 1 in 10 (which is a 10% slope)\n\n- Side slopes = 1 in 2 (50% slope)\n\n- Center height = 10 m\n\nAnd there are points A, B, C, D, E, F labeled in the figure, but I don't have it, so I need to visualize this based on the description.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry of the embankment. An embankment is typically a raised section of a road or railway, built up from the surrounding ground level using soil or rock fill.\n\nGiven that the center height is 10 m, that probably refers to the vertical height of the embankment at the center.\n\nThe road width is 20 m, which is the width of the road at the top of the embankment.\n\nThe side slopes are 1 in 2, which means for every 1 unit of vertical rise, the slope extends 2 units horizontally.\n\nThe existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which might indicate that the ground itself is sloping before the embankment is built.\n\nPoints A, B, C, D, E, F are likely key points in the cross-section of the embankment. For example, A might be the top of the embankment, and F the base.\n\nThe problem mentions \"rate of approach calculation,\" which might refer to how the embankment approaches the existing ground level.\n\nI need to calculate the side widths w1 and w2, and the total cross-sectional area.\n\nLooking at the options, they all have w2 = 25.0 m and the total area = 418.75 m\u00b2, but w1 varies slightly between 37.2 m, 37.3 m, 37.4 m, and 37.5 m.\n\nThis suggests that w1 is being calculated with some precision, and there might be rounding differences.\n\nI need to carefully work through the geometry to find these values.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nFirst, let's assume the embankment is symmetrical on both sides.\n\nThe center height is 10 m, and the road width is 20 m.\n\nThe side slopes are 1 in 2, meaning for every 1 m vertical, it extends 2 m horizontally.\n\nThe existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which is a gentle slope.\n\nI need to find the widths w1 and w2, which are likely the widths at certain points along the embankment.\n\nLooking at the figure reference, it seems that w1 and w2 are the widths at the base on each side.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the total base width, which would be w1 + the road width + w2.\n\nBut since it's symmetrical, w1 should equal w2, but in the options, w2 is fixed at 25.0 m, while w1 varies.\n\nThat suggests that w1 and w2 might not be equal, which means the embankment might not be symmetrical, or perhaps the existing ground slope affects one side differently.\n\nWait, but if the embankment is built on a sloping ground, the sides might not be symmetrical.\n\nGiven that the existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which is a gentle slope, perhaps one side has more horizontal extension than the other.\n\nI need to consider the geometry carefully.\n\nLet me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet's place the center of the embankment at (0,0), with the road running horizontally.\n\nThe top of the embankment would then have points at (-10,0) and (10,0), since the road width is 20 m.\n\nThe height of the embankment is 10 m at the center.\n\nNow, the side slopes are 1 in 2.\n\nSo, for the right side:\n\n- Starting from (10,0), the slope goes down with a slope of 1 in 2.\n\nSimilarly, on the left side, starting from (-10,0), the slope goes down with the same slope.\n\nBut the existing ground is sloping at 1 in 10.\n\nSo, the embankment sides will intersect the existing ground at some points.\n\nI need to find the horizontal distances from the center to these intersection points, which will give me w1 and w2.\n\nFirst, let's define the equations of the lines for the embankment sides and the existing ground.\n\nFor the right side:\n\n- The embankment side slope is 1 in 2, which means for every 1 m vertical drop, it extends 2 m horizontally.\n\n- So, the slope of the embankment side is -1/2 (since it's downhill to the right).\n\n- The equation of this line, starting from (10,0), is y = - (1/2)(x - 10).\n\n- Similarly, for the left side, starting from (-10,0), y = - (1/2)(x + 10).\n\nThe existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which is a gentle uphill slope.\n\nAssuming the existing ground level at the center is y = 0, then the ground slope equation would be y = (1/10)x.\n\nBut wait, at the center, y = 0, and as x increases, y increases positively.\n\nBut the embankment is built on top of the existing ground, so perhaps the embankment sides are added onto the existing ground.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing ground is sloping, and the embankment is built relative to that.\n\nThis is getting confusing without the figure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the existing ground slope is 1 in 10, meaning for every 10 m horizontal, there is a 1 m vertical change.\n\nIf the embankment center height is 10 m, and the road width is 20 m, then the horizontal extent of the road is from -10 m to +10 m.\n\nNow, the side slopes are 1 in 2, so for every 1 m vertical, there are 2 m horizontal.\n\nSo, starting from the top edge of the road, at x = +10 m, y = 0, the side slope goes down with a slope of -1/2.\n\nSimilarly, at x = -10 m, y = 0, the side slope goes down with the same slope.\n\nNow, the existing ground is sloping at 1 in 10, so y = (1/10)x.\n\nI need to find where the embankment side slopes intersect the existing ground.\n\nSo, set the equation of the embankment side equal to the existing ground equation.\n\nFor the right side:\n\ny = - (1/2)(x - 10) = (1/10)x\n\nSolve for x:\n\n- (1/2)(x - 10) = (1/10)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-5(x - 10) = x\n\n-5x + 50 = x\n\n50 = 6x\n\nx = 50/6 \u2248 8.333 m\n\nThen, y = (1/10)(8.333) \u2248 0.833 m\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately at (8.333, 0.833)\n\nSimilarly, for the left side:\n\ny = - (1/2)(x + 10) = (1/10)x\n\n- (1/2)(x + 10) = (1/10)x\n\nMultiply by 10:\n\n-5(x + 10) = x\n\n-5x - 50 = x\n\n-50 = 6x\n\nx = -50/6 \u2248 -8.333 m\n\ny = (1/10)(-8.333) \u2248 -0.833 m\n\nSo, the embankment sides intersect the existing ground at approximately x = \u00b18.333 m.\n\nNow, to find w1 and w2, I need to find the widths at the base on each side.\n\nAssuming w1 is on the left side and w2 on the right side.\n\nBut in the options, w2 is given as 25.0 m, which might correspond to the width at the base on the right side.\n\nWait, perhaps w1 and w2 are the widths at the base on each side, measured from the center.\n\nBut since the embankment is symmetrical in terms of side slopes, w1 should equal w2, but in the options, w2 is fixed at 25.0 m, while w1 varies.\n\nThis suggests that the embankment is not symmetrical, perhaps due to the existing ground slope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe w1 and w2 are measured differently.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps w1 and w2 are the horizontal distances from the center to the base on each side.\n\nGiven that, w1 would be the distance from the center to the base on one side, and w2 on the other side.\n\nGiven that the embankment sides intersect the existing ground at x \u2248 \u00b18.333 m, perhaps w1 and w2 are related to these points.\n\nBut in the options, w2 is 25.0 m, which is larger than 8.333 m, suggesting that w2 is measured further out.\n\nWait, perhaps w1 and w2 are not just the intersection points, but include additional widths based on the existing ground slope.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the entire cross-section and calculate the area.\n\nThe cross-section of the embankment would be a trapezoid or a more complex shape, depending on how the sides slope.\n\nTo find the area, I can divide the cross-section into manageable parts, like triangles and rectangles.\n\nFirst, let's consider the top road width: 20 m.\n\nThe embankment height is 10 m at the center.\n\nThe side slopes are 1 in 2, meaning for every 1 m vertical, there are 2 m horizontal.\n\nSo, the horizontal extent of each side slope would be 2 m per 1 m vertical.\n\nSince the height is 10 m, the horizontal extent on each side would be 2 * 10 = 20 m.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if the side slope is 1 in 2, then for a 10 m height, the horizontal extent should be 2 * 10 = 20 m on each side.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the intersection with the existing ground, I got x \u2248 \u00b18.333 m, which is less than 20 m.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my earlier assumption might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the existing ground slope affects the horizontal extent.\n\nLet me try to calculate the horizontal extent more accurately.\n\nConsider the right side:\n\n- The embankment side slope is 1 in 2, which is a slope of -1/2.\n\n- The existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which is a slope of 1/10.\n\n- The embankment side starts at (10,0) and goes down to intersect the existing ground.\n\nWe already found that intersection at approximately (8.333, 0.833)\n\nBut if the embankment height is 10 m at the center, and the side slope is 1 in 2, then for a 10 m vertical drop, the horizontal extent should be 20 m.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the vertical drop from the top of the embankment to the existing ground.\n\nAt x = 10 m, y = 0, and the existing ground is at y = (1/10)*10 = 1 m.\n\nSo, the vertical drop from the top of the embankment to the existing ground is 10 m - 1 m = 9 m.\n\nGiven the side slope is 1 in 2, for a vertical drop of 9 m, the horizontal extent should be 18 m.\n\nSo, from x = 10 m, the embankment side extends horizontally 18 m to reach the base.\n\nTherefore, the base on the right side is at x = 10 m + 18 m = 28 m.\n\nSimilarly, on the left side, x = -10 m - 18 m = -28 m.\n\nThus, the total width at the base would be from x = -28 m to x = 28 m, which is 56 m.\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier calculation and the options provided.\n\nI must have made a mistake in assuming the vertical drop.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nThe embankment center height is 10 m.\n\nThe existing ground slope is 1 in 10, so at x = 10 m, y = 1 m.\n\nTherefore, the vertical drop from the top of the embankment to the existing ground is 10 m - 1 m = 9 m.\n\nGiven the side slope is 1 in 2, for every 1 m vertical, 2 m horizontal.\n\nSo, for a 9 m vertical drop, the horizontal extent is 2 * 9 = 18 m.\n\nTherefore, the base is at x = 10 m + 18 m = 28 m, as I previously calculated.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the options, where w2 is 25 m.\n\nPerhaps I'm misinterpreting what w1 and w2 represent.\n\nMaybe w1 and w2 are not the base widths but something else.\n\nLooking back at the figure reference, it shows points F and W2 on the base, with widths w1 and w2.\n\nPerhaps w1 and w2 are the widths at certain points along the base, not the entire base width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe w1 and w2 are the widths at the base on each side, measured from the center.\n\nIf that's the case, then w1 and w2 would be the distances from the center to the base on each side.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier calculation of the base being at x = 28 m, w1 and w2 would each be 28 m.\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options, where w2 is 25 m.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the rate of approach calculation mentioned in the figure caption.\n\n\"Rate of approach\" might refer to how quickly the embankment approaches the existing ground level.\n\nAlternatively, it might refer to the horizontal distance over which the embankment approaches the existing ground.\n\nThis might involve calculating the horizontal distance from the top of the embankment to where it meets the existing ground.\n\nGiven that, perhaps w1 and w2 are related to these distances.\n\nLet me try to calculate the horizontal distance from the center to the base on each side.\n\nFrom the center at x = 0 to the top of the embankment at x = 10 m, and then along the embankment side to the base.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated without the figure.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the area calculation.\n\nThe total area is given as 418.75 m\u00b2 in all options.\n\nI can try to calculate the area based on the cross-section and see which option matches.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the cross-section is a trapezoid.\n\nThe top width is 20 m, the height is 10 m, and the side slopes are 1 in 2.\n\nThe bottom width can be calculated as top width plus twice the horizontal extent of the sides.\n\nHorizontal extent per side = side slope * height = 2 * 10 = 20 m.\n\nTherefore, bottom width = 20 m + 2 * 20 m = 60 m.\n\nThen, the area of the trapezoid is (top width + bottom width) / 2 * height = (20 + 60) / 2 * 10 = 40 * 10 = 400 m\u00b2.\n\nBut this doesn't match the given area of 418.75 m\u00b2.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption of the side slopes is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the side slopes are not simply 1 in 2 per side, but affected by the existing ground slope.\n\nLet me consider the existing ground slope more carefully.\n\nThe existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which means for every 10 m horizontal, there is a 1 m vertical change.\n\nAt the center, y = 0, and at x = 10 m, y = 1 m, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, the vertical drop from the top of the embankment to the existing ground is 10 m - 1 m = 9 m.\n\nGiven the side slope is 1 in 2, for a vertical drop of 9 m, the horizontal extent should be 18 m.\n\nTherefore, the base is at x = 10 m + 18 m = 28 m, as before.\n\nBut this doesn't align with the area calculation.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the embankment is built on top of the existing ground, and the side slopes are added onto the existing ground slope.\n\nThis would make the actual side slopes different from just 1 in 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the embankment is built such that its sides are measured relative to the existing ground slope.\n\nThis is getting too complex without the figure.\n\nMaybe I should try to calculate the area based on the given options.\n\nLooking at option B: w1 = 37.5 m, w2 = 25.0 m, area = 418.75 m\u00b2.\n\nIf w1 and w2 are the base widths on each side, then the bottom width would be w1 + road width + w2 = 37.5 + 20 + 25 = 82.5 m.\n\nThen, area = (top width + bottom width)/2 * height = (20 + 82.5)/2 * 10 = (102.5)/2 * 10 = 51.25 * 10 = 512.5 m\u00b2, which doesn't match 418.75 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps w1 and w2 are not the entire base widths but parts of them.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the embankment is not a simple trapezoid but has additional features.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the area is calculated differently.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the embankment has a triangular section and a rectangular section.\n\nIf that's the case, I need to divide the cross-section into a triangle and a rectangle and calculate their areas separately.\n\nAssuming that, let's see.\n\nThe top road"
