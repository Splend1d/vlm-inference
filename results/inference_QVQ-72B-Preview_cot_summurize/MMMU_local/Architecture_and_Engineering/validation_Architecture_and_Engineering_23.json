                    "text": "Let's tackle this surveying problem. It seems a bit complex at first glance, but if I break it down step by step, I should be able to figure it out. So, we have a survey from point A to point E through points B and C and D, all connected by straight lines. Each line has a whole circle bearing (WCB), a measured distance, and some remarks about the grade (rising or falling at certain ratios). The task is to find the bearing from A to E directly and the overall grade of that straight tunnel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a whole circle bearing (WCB) is. I recall that in surveying, a whole circle bearing is measured in degrees around the full circle, starting from the north direction. So, it goes from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 clockwise. For example, 0\u00b0 is north, 90\u00b0 is east, 180\u00b0 is south, and 270\u00b0 is west.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Line AB: WCB 70\u00b030'00\", distance 150.00 m, rising 1 in 10\n\n- Line BC: WCB 0\u00b000'00\", distance 200.50 m, level\n\n- Line CD: WCB 154\u00b012'00\", distance 250.00 m, level\n\n- Line DE: WCB 90\u00b000'00\", distance 400.56 m, falling 1 in 30\n\nMy goal is to find the straight line from A to E and its bearing and grade.\n\nI think the first step is to plot these points on a map or a coordinate system to visualize the path from A to E. But since I don't have a map, I'll need to calculate the coordinates based on the bearings and distances.\n\nTo do that, I need to convert the WCB (which is in degrees, minutes, and seconds) into decimal degrees for easier calculation. Then, I can use the distance and bearing to find the changes in eastings (X) and northings (Y) for each line.\n\nLet's start by converting the WCBs to decimal degrees:\n\n- AB: 70\u00b030'00\" = 70 + 30/60 = 70.5\u00b0\n\n- BC: 0\u00b000'00\" = 0\u00b0\n\n- CD: 154\u00b012'00\" = 154 + 12/60 = 154.2\u00b0\n\n- DE: 90\u00b000'00\" = 90\u00b0\n\nNow, I need to assign coordinates to point A to start. Let's assume A is at (0,0) for simplicity.\n\nThen, for each line, I'll calculate the delta X and delta Y using the formula:\n\ndelta X = distance * cos(bearing)\n\ndelta Y = distance * sin(bearing)\n\nBut wait, the bearing is from north, so I need to make sure that the angles are in radians if I'm using trigonometric functions, or keep them in degrees and use degree mode in my calculator.\n\nI'll use degrees for consistency.\n\nSo, for line AB:\n\ndelta X_ab = 150 * cos(70.5\u00b0)\n\ndelta Y_ab = 150 * sin(70.5\u00b0)\n\nSimilarly for BC:\n\ndelta X_bc = 200.5 * cos(0\u00b0)\n\ndelta Y_bc = 200.5 * sin(0\u00b0)\n\nFor CD:\n\ndelta X_cd = 250 * cos(154.2\u00b0)\n\ndelta Y_cd = 250 * sin(154.2\u00b0)\n\nAnd for DE:\n\ndelta X_de = 400.56 * cos(90\u00b0)\n\ndelta Y_de = 400.56 * sin(90\u00b0)\n\nLet me calculate these step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate delta X and delta Y for AB:\n\ndelta X_ab = 150 * cos(70.5\u00b0) \u2248 150 * 0.3420 \u2248 51.3 m\n\ndelta Y_ab = 150 * sin(70.5\u00b0) \u2248 150 * 0.9403 \u2248 141.045 m\n\nSo, point B is at (51.3, 141.045)\n\nNext, BC:\n\ndelta X_bc = 200.5 * cos(0\u00b0) = 200.5 * 1 = 200.5 m\n\ndelta Y_bc = 200.5 * sin(0\u00b0) = 0 m\n\nSo, point C is at (51.3 + 200.5, 141.045 + 0) = (251.8, 141.045)\n\nThen, CD:\n\ndelta X_cd = 250 * cos(154.2\u00b0) \u2248 250 * (-0.9015) \u2248 -225.375 m\n\ndelta Y_cd = 250 * sin(154.2\u00b0) \u2248 250 * 0.4324 \u2248 108.1 m\n\nSo, point D is at (251.8 - 225.375, 141.045 + 108.1) = (26.425, 249.145)\n\nFinally, DE:\n\ndelta X_de = 400.56 * cos(90\u00b0) = 0 m\n\ndelta Y_de = 400.56 * sin(90\u00b0) = 400.56 m\n\nSo, point E is at (26.425 + 0, 249.145 + 400.56) = (26.425, 649.705)\n\nNow, I have the coordinates of points A and E:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nE: (26.425, 649.705)\n\nTo find the bearing from A to E, I can use the formula for the angle between two points:\n\nBearing AE = atan2(Y_e - Y_a, X_e - X_a)\n\nBut since I'm dealing with degrees, I'll use the arctangent function and convert it to degrees.\n\nFirst, calculate the differences:\n\ndelta X = X_e - X_a = 26.425 - 0 = 26.425 m\n\ndelta Y = Y_e - Y_a = 649.705 - 0 = 649.705 m\n\nThen, bearing AE = atan(delta Y / delta X) = atan(649.705 / 26.425)\n\nCalculating that:\n\natan(649.705 / 26.425) \u2248 atan(24.59) \u2248 87.47\u00b0\n\nSo, the bearing from A to E is approximately 87\u00b047'\n\nNow, for the grade, I need to find the vertical rise or fall per unit horizontal distance. The remarks indicate the grades for each line:\n\n- AB: rising 1 in 10\n\n- BC: level\n\n- CD: level\n\n- DE: falling 1 in 30\n\nFirst, I need to find the overall vertical difference between A and E.\n\nBut since the survey is not along the straight line AE, I need to consider the vertical components of each line's grade.\n\nLet's consider the vertical component for each line.\n\nFor line AB, it's rising 1 in 10. That means for every 10 units of horizontal distance, there's a 1-unit rise.\n\nThe horizontal distance is 150 m, so the rise is 150 / 10 = 15 m\n\nFor BC, it's level, so no rise or fall.\n\nFor CD, it's level, so no rise or fall.\n\nFor DE, it's falling 1 in 30, so for every 30 units of horizontal distance, there's a 1-unit fall.\n\nThe horizontal distance is 400.56 m, so the fall is 400.56 / 30 \u2248 13.352 m\n\nNow, let's sum up the vertical components:\n\nRise from AB: +15 m\n\nFall from DE: -13.352 m\n\nTotal vertical difference: 15 - 13.352 = 1.648 m rise from A to E\n\nNow, the horizontal distance from A to E can be calculated from the coordinates:\n\nHorizontal distance AE = sqrt((26.425)^2 + (649.705)^2) \u2248 sqrt(703.9 + 422,070) \u2248 sqrt(422,773.9) \u2248 650.21 m\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculation.\n\nActually, 26.425^2 = 703.9\n\n649.705^2 = 422,070.4\n\nSum is 422,774.3\n\nSquare root is approximately 650.21 m\n\nBut looking back, the options provide 652.33 m, which is close to my calculation. Maybe I made a rounding error.\n\nAnyway, with horizontal distance approximately 650 m and vertical rise of 1.648 m, the grade is:\n\nGrade = vertical rise / horizontal distance = 1.648 / 650 \u2248 0.00254 or 0.254%\n\nBut the options provide grade as 1.78 in 652.33 = 1 in 413\n\nWait, that doesn't match my calculation.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nVertical rise = 1.648 m\n\nHorizontal distance = 650.21 m\n\nGrade = 1.648 / 650.21 \u2248 0.00253 or 0.253%\n\nBut the options suggest grade = 1.78 in 652.33 = 1 in 413\n\nThere must be something wrong with my approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the actual slope distance, not just the horizontal distance.\n\nWait, in surveying, the grade is usually expressed as the vertical rise over the horizontal distance, not the slope distance.\n\nBut maybe in this context, it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grade is expressed as a ratio of rise over total distance, including the vertical component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the straight line distance and the vertical rise to find the grade.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf I have a horizontal distance of 650 m and a vertical rise of 1.648 m, the grade is indeed small, as I calculated.\n\nBut the options suggest a much higher grade.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating the vertical rise.\n\nLet me recalculate the vertical components.\n\nFor AB: rising 1 in 10, distance 150 m, so rise = 150 / 10 = 15 m\n\nFor BC: level, no rise\n\nFor CD: level, no rise\n\nFor DE: falling 1 in 30, distance 400.56 m, so fall = 400.56 / 30 \u2248 13.352 m\n\nNet rise from A to E: 15 - 13.352 = 1.648 m\n\nHorizontal distance AE \u2248 650 m\n\nGrade = 1.648 / 650 \u2248 0.00254 or 0.254%, which is not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the horizontal distance is not just the sum of the x and y components, but the actual straight line distance from A to E.\n\nLet me recalculate the straight line distance.\n\nCoordinates A: (0,0)\n\nE: (26.425, 649.705)\n\nDistance AE = sqrt((26.425)^2 + (649.705)^2) = sqrt(703.9 + 422,070) = sqrt(422,773.9) \u2248 650.21 m\n\nYes, that matches the options' horizontal distance of 652.33 m, within rounding error.\n\nBut the grade still doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grade is calculated based on the slope distance, not the horizontal distance.\n\nIf I consider the slope distance, I need to find the actual distance along the slope, considering both horizontal and vertical components.\n\nBut in surveying, grade is typically rise over run (horizontal distance).\n\nI'm confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grade is being expressed differently in the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, it says \"Grade = 1.78 in 652.33 = 1 in 413\"\n\nThat seems like the grade is being expressed as rise over total horizontal distance.\n\nBut according to my calculations, rise is only about 1.6 m, not 1.78 m.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the vertical components in terms of the straight line from A to E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical rise is not just the sum of the rises and falls along the lines, but needs to be calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the elevation difference between A and E based on the straight line path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical rise is proportional to the slope of the straight line AE.\n\nLet me try to find the slope of AE.\n\nFirst, find the slope (m) = delta Y / delta X = 649.705 / 26.425 \u2248 24.59\n\nThen, the angle of slope is arctan(24.59) \u2248 87.47\u00b0, which matches the bearing I calculated earlier.\n\nBut that's the horizontal bearing, not the slope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the vertical angle.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the vertical angle based on the rise and the horizontal distance.\n\nGiven horizontal distance AE \u2248 650 m and rise \u2248 1.648 m, the vertical angle would be very small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grade is being expressed as the tangent of the vertical angle.\n\nWait, grade is rise over run, which is tan(theta), where theta is the vertical angle.\n\nSo, grade = tan(theta) = rise / run\n\nIf run is 650 m and rise is 1.648 m, then grade = 1.648 / 650 \u2248 0.00254, which is 0.254%, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the options suggest a higher grade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rise is being calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the cumulative rise along the path, taking into account the direction of each grade.\n\nFor example, AB is rising 1 in 10, BC is level, CD is level, DE is falling 1 in 30.\n\nSo, net rise from A to E is rise from AB minus fall from DE.\n\nThat is, 15 m - 13.352 m = 1.648 m, as I had before.\n\nBut the options suggest a different rise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rise is being calculated based on the straight line AE's grade.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grade is being expressed in terms of the slope distance, not the horizontal distance.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the slope distance and the vertical rise to find the grade.\n\nSlope distance AE \u2248 650 m, vertical rise \u2248 1.648 m, so grade = 1.648 / 650 \u2248 0.00254, which is still not matching the options.\n\nI'm stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the options are given as \"Grade = 1.78 in 652.33 = 1 in 413\"\n\nPerhaps the \"in\" is a typo, and it should be \"per\" or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the grade is being expressed as a ratio, like 1 in 413, which would correspond to a grade of 1/413 \u2248 0.00242, or 0.242%, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut the options list \"Grade = 1.78 in 652.33 = 1 in 413\", which seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the grade is being expressed in terms of the slope angle, and the options are providing the tangent of that angle.\n\nWait, tan(theta) = rise / run = 1.648 / 650 \u2248 0.00254, which corresponds to an angle of approximately 0.146 degrees.\n\nBut the options seem to suggest a higher grade.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rise is being calculated incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the grades along AB and DE are not just additive linearly, but I need to consider the direction and the actual path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the cumulative rise along the path, taking into account the changes in elevation at each point.\n\nLet me try to plot the elevations.\n\nAssume point A is at elevation 0.\n\nThen, along AB, rising 1 in 10, distance 150 m, rise = 15 m, so B is at 15 m.\n\nBC is level, so C is at 15 m.\n\nCD is level, so D is at 15 m.\n\nDE is falling 1 in 30, distance 400.56 m, fall = 400.56 / 30 \u2248 13.352 m, so E is at 15 - 13.352 = 1.648 m.\n\nSo, the elevation difference from A to E is 1.648 m down, meaning A is higher than E by 1.648 m.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"rising 1 in 10\" and \"falling 1 in 30\", but doesn't specify the direction relative to the bearing.\n\nAssuming the"
