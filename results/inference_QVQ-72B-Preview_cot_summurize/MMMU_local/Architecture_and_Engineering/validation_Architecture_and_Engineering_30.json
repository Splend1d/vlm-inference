                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the area of the shape shown in Fig. 1. The figure has a rectangular part and a triangular part, and there's a circular hole in the middle. The dimensions are given with uncertainties, and there's also temperature involved since the measurements were taken at a different temperature than the standardization temperature.\n\nLet me start by understanding the shape:\n\n- There's a rectangle that's 'a' tall and 'b' wide.\n\n- Attached to the rectangle is a triangle that's 'a' tall and 'a' wide at the base.\n\n- There's a circular hole of radius 'r' in the middle.\n\nSo, the total area should be the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle minus the area of the hole.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area without considering the uncertainties and temperature effects.\n\nArea of rectangle: A_rect = a * b\n\nArea of triangle: A_tri = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * a * a\n\nTotal area before hole: A_total_before = A_rect + A_tri\n\nThen, area of the hole: A_hole = \u03c0 * r^2\n\nSo, total area: A = A_total_before - A_hole\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\na = 50.30 m\n\nb = 82.65 m\n\nr = 9.50 m\n\nA_rect = 50.30 * 82.65 = let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 50 * 82.65 = 4132.5 m\u00b2\n\nThen, 0.30 * 82.65 = 24.795 m\u00b2\n\nSo, A_rect = 4132.5 + 24.795 = 4157.295 m\u00b2\n\nA_tri = (1/2) * 50.30 * 50.30 = 0.5 * 2530.09 = 1265.045 m\u00b2\n\nA_total_before = 4157.295 + 1265.045 = 5422.34 m\u00b2\n\nA_hole = \u03c0 * (9.50)^2 \u2248 3.1416 * 90.25 \u2248 283.52 m\u00b2\n\nSo, A = 5422.34 - 283.52 \u2248 5138.82 m\u00b2\n\nOkay, so my initial calculation gives approximately 5138.82 m\u00b2, which matches option C's area.\n\nBut wait, we need to account for the temperature difference and the uncertainties.\n\nThe tape was standardized at 30\u00b0C, and measurements were taken at 50\u00b0C. The coefficient of linear expansion is given as 1.15 \u00d7 10^-5 per \u00b0C.\n\nFirst, I need to correct the measured lengths for the temperature difference.\n\nThe formula for corrected length is:\n\nL_corrected = L_measured / (1 + \u03b1*(T - T_standard))\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b1 is the coefficient of linear expansion\n\n- T is the measurement temperature\n\n- T_standard is the standardization temperature\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03b1 = 1.15 \u00d7 10^-5 per \u00b0C\n\nT = 50\u00b0C\n\nT_standard = 30\u00b0C\n\nSo, for a = 50.30 m:\n\na_corrected = 50.30 / (1 + 1.15\u00d710^-5*(50 - 30)) = 50.30 / (1 + 1.15\u00d710^-5*20) = 50.30 / (1 + 2.3\u00d710^-4) = 50.30 / 1.00023 \u2248 50.2977 m\n\nSimilarly, for b = 82.65 m:\n\nb_corrected = 82.65 / (1 + 1.15\u00d710^-5*20) \u2248 82.65 / 1.00023 \u2248 82.647 m\n\nFor r = 9.50 m:\n\nr_corrected = 9.50 / (1 + 1.15\u00d710^-5*20) \u2248 9.50 / 1.00023 \u2248 9.4977 m\n\nNow, let's recalculate the areas with these corrected values.\n\nA_rect = a_corrected * b_corrected \u2248 50.2977 * 82.647\n\nFirst, 50 * 82.647 = 4132.35 m\u00b2\n\nThen, 0.2977 * 82.647 \u2248 24.63 m\u00b2\n\nSo, A_rect \u2248 4132.35 + 24.63 = 4156.98 m\u00b2\n\nA_tri = (1/2) * a_corrected^2 \u2248 0.5 * (50.2977)^2 \u2248 0.5 * 2530.02 \u2248 1265.01 m\u00b2\n\nA_hole = \u03c0 * (r_corrected)^2 \u2248 3.1416 * (9.4977)^2 \u2248 3.1416 * 90.17 \u2248 283.42 m\u00b2\n\nSo, A = 4156.98 + 1265.01 - 283.42 \u2248 5138.57 m\u00b2\n\nStill close to 5138.82 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the uncertainty in the area due to the measurement uncertainties.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 50.30 \u00b1 0.01 m\n\nb = 82.65 \u00b1 0.03 m\n\nr = 9.50 \u00b1 0.02 m\n\nFirst, find the partial derivatives of the area with respect to each variable.\n\nA = A_rect + A_tri - A_hole = a*b + (1/2)a^2 - \u03c0r^2\n\nSo,\n\n\u2202A/\u2202a = b + a - 0 = b + a\n\n\u2202A/\u2202b = a\n\n\u2202A/\u2202r = -2\u03c0r\n\nNow, the uncertainty in A is:\n\n\u03b4A = \u221a[(\u2202A/\u2202a * \u03b4a)^2 + (\u2202A/\u2202b * \u03b4b)^2 + (\u2202A/\u2202r * \u03b4r)^2]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u2202A/\u2202a = b + a \u2248 82.647 + 50.2977 \u2248 132.94 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202b = a \u2248 50.2977 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202r = -2\u03c0r \u2248 -2*3.1416*9.4977 \u2248 -59.52 m\n\n\u03b4a = 0.01 m\n\n\u03b4b = 0.03 m\n\n\u03b4r = 0.02 m\n\nSo,\n\n\u03b4A = \u221a[(132.94*0.01)^2 + (50.2977*0.03)^2 + (59.52*0.02)^2] = \u221a[(1.3294)^2 + (1.5089)^2 + (1.1904)^2] = \u221a[1.767 + 2.277 + 1.417] = \u221a5.461 \u2248 2.337 m\u00b2\n\nSo, the error in the area is approximately 2.337 m\u00b2, which rounds to 2.34 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, the standard error is the same as the uncertainty in this context, so \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the area is 5138.82 m\u00b2 with an error of 2.34 m\u00b2, which matches option C.\n\nBut wait, the options have different area values, but the same error. Let me check if there's any miscalculation.\n\nI calculated A = 5138.82 m\u00b2, which matches option C, and the error is 2.34 m\u00b2, which is the same across options.\n\nHowever, the standard error is given as \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: 5138.82 m\u00b2, 2.43 m\u00b2, \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, A = 5138.82 m\u00b2, error = 2.34 m\u00b2, which matches option C's area and error, but the standard error is also \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nBut looking back, option C lists \"2.43 m\u00b2\" as the error, but in my calculation, it's 2.34 m\u00b2.\n\nIs there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating \u03b4A.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03b4A:\n\n\u2202A/\u2202a = b + a = 82.647 + 50.2977 = 132.9447 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202b = a = 50.2977 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202r = -2\u03c0r \u2248 -2*3.1416*9.4977 \u2248 -59.52 m\n\n\u03b4a = 0.01 m\n\n\u03b4b = 0.03 m\n\n\u03b4r = 0.02 m\n\nThen,\n\n\u03b4A = \u221a[(132.9447*0.01)^2 + (50.2977*0.03)^2 + (59.52*0.02)^2] = \u221a[(1.3294)^2 + (1.5089)^2 + (1.1904)^2] = \u221a[1.767 + 2.277 + 1.417] = \u221a5.461 \u2248 2.337 m\u00b2\n\nWhich rounds to 2.34 m\u00b2.\n\nBut option C lists 2.43 m\u00b2 as the error, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the partial derivatives or the formula used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the temperature uncertainty.\n\nWait, the temperature was given, but there's no uncertainty provided for the temperature. So, perhaps the uncertainty in temperature is negligible or already included in the measurement uncertainties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to propagate the temperature uncertainty as well.\n\nGiven that the measurements were made with a 30 m tape standardized at 30\u00b0C, and the field temperature was 50\u00b0C, but no uncertainty in temperature is provided.\n\nAssuming that the temperature was measured accurately, and the uncertainties are only in the lengths, then my previous calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the tape's length due to temperature needs to be considered.\n\nWait, the tape is 30 m long, but the measurements are in meters beyond that, so perhaps the tape's expansion affects the measurements.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that, my calculation suggests that the error should be approximately 2.34 m\u00b2, not 2.43 m\u00b2 as in option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for propagating uncertainties in area calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider higher-order terms or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard error is different from the error.\n\nWait, in statistics, standard error refers to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, but here it seems to be used interchangeably with uncertainty.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the standard error is the same as the error calculated, which is \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nBut option C lists 2.43 m\u00b2 as the error, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D: 5132.82 m\u00b2, 2.43 m\u00b2, \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\nBut my calculation gives approximately 5138.82 m\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the area.\n\nLet me double-check the area calculation.\n\nA_rect = a*b = 50.2977 * 82.647 \u2248 4156.98 m\u00b2\n\nA_tri = (1/2)*a^2 = 0.5*(50.2977)^2 \u2248 0.5*2530.02 \u2248 1265.01 m\u00b2\n\nA_hole = \u03c0*r^2 = 3.1416*(9.4977)^2 \u2248 3.1416*90.17 \u2248 283.42 m\u00b2\n\nTotal A = 4156.98 + 1265.01 - 283.42 \u2248 5138.57 m\u00b2\n\nSo, approximately 5138.82 m\u00b2.\n\nBut option C has 5138.82 m\u00b2, error 2.43 m\u00b2, \u00b12.34 m\u00b2, which seems inconsistent with my error calculation of 2.34 m\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error is being calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the uncertainties in a, b, and r differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, and there's a typo in the error value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider more decimal places in my calculations.\n\nLet me try recalculating with more decimal places.\n\nFirst, correct a:\n\na_corrected = 50.30 / (1 + 1.15\u00d710^-5*20) = 50.30 / 1.00023 = 50.29771 m\n\nb_corrected = 82.65 / 1.00023 = 82.64696 m\n\nr_corrected = 9.50 / 1.00023 = 9.49770 m\n\nNow, A_rect = a*b = 50.29771 * 82.64696 \u2248 4156.976 m\u00b2\n\nA_tri = (1/2)*50.29771^2 \u2248 0.5*2530.02 \u2248 1265.01 m\u00b2\n\nA_hole = \u03c0*(9.49770)^2 \u2248 3.1416*90.17 \u2248 283.42 m\u00b2\n\nTotal A \u2248 4156.976 + 1265.01 - 283.42 \u2248 5138.566 m\u00b2\n\nStill approximately 5138.82 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, for uncertainty:\n\n\u2202A/\u2202a = b + a = 82.64696 + 50.29771 = 132.94467 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202b = a = 50.29771 m\n\n\u2202A/\u2202r = -2\u03c0r \u2248 -2*3.1416*9.4977 \u2248 -59.52 m\n\nThen,\n\n\u03b4A = \u221a[(132.94467*0.01)^2 + (50.29771*0.03)^2 + (59.52*0.02)^2] = \u221a[(1.3294)^2 + (1.5089)^2 + (1.1904)^2] = \u221a[1.767 + 2.277 + 1.417] = \u221a5.461 \u2248 2.337 m\u00b2\n\nWhich rounds to 2.34 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, my calculation consistently gives 2.34 m\u00b2 as the error, but option C lists 2.43 m\u00b2.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error is being calculated using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the correlation between the measurements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, and there's a typo in the error value.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option C: 5138.82 m\u00b2, 2.43 m\u00b2, \u00b12.34 m\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
