                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have data on speed (in km/h) and density (in vehicles per km), and we need to use regression analysis to fit this data to the Greenshields model to find the capacity. The options are 1734 veh/mi, 1744 veh/mi, and 1344 veh/mi.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Greenshields model is. From what I recall, the Greenshields model is a fundamental traffic flow model that relates speed, density, and flow. The basic equation is:\n\n\\[ v = v_f \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v\\) is the observed speed,\n\n- \\(v_f\\) is the free-flow speed,\n\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the observed density,\n\n- \\(\\rho_c\\) is the critical density at capacity.\n\nAlso, the flow \\(q\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ q = v \\times \\rho \\]\n\nAt capacity, \\(q = q_c\\), and it occurs when \\(\\rho = \\rho_c\\).\n\nOur goal is to fit this model to the data and find \\(q_c\\).\n\nBut before diving into the model, let's look at the data:\n\n| Speed (km/h) | Density (veh/km) |\n\n|--------------|------------------|\n\n| 14.2 | 85 |\n\n| 24.1 | 70 |\n\n| 30.3 | 55 |\n\n| 40.1 | 41 |\n\n| 50.6 | 20 |\n\n| 55.0 | 15 |\n\nI need to plot speed against density to visualize the relationship. Typically, in traffic flow theory, speed decreases as density increases, which seems to be the case here.\n\nNow, the Greenshields model assumes a linear relationship between speed and density. If I rearrange the model equation, I get:\n\n\\[ v = v_f - v_f \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c}\\right) \\]\n\nThis suggests a linear relationship between \\(v\\) and \\(\\rho\\), with intercept \\(v_f\\) and slope \\(-v_f / \\rho_c\\).\n\nSo, I can perform a linear regression of speed against density to estimate \\(v_f\\) and \\(\\rho_c\\).\n\nLet me denote speed as \\(v\\) and density as \\(\\rho\\). The linear regression model would be:\n\n\\[ v = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\rho \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\beta_0 = v_f\\),\n\n- \\(\\beta_1 = -v_f / \\rho_c\\).\n\nOnce I have estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), I can find \\(v_f\\) and \\(\\rho_c\\), and then calculate the capacity \\(q_c\\).\n\nFirst, I need to perform the linear regression.\n\nGiven the data points:\n\n(14.2, 85)\n\n(24.1, 70)\n\n(30.3, 55)\n\n(40.1, 41)\n\n(50.6, 20)\n\n(55.0, 15)\n\nI need to calculate the coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\n\nThe formula for the regression coefficients is:\n\n\\[ \\beta_1 = \\frac{n \\sum xy - \\sum x \\sum y}{n \\sum x^2 - (\\sum x)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x} \\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is density, \\(y\\) is speed, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, and \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\bar{y}\\) are the sample means.\n\nLet's compute the necessary sums.\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\sum x\\), \\(\\sum y\\), \\(\\sum xy\\), and \\(\\sum x^2\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n\\(x = [85, 70, 55, 41, 20, 15]\\)\n\n\\(y = [14.2, 24.1, 30.3, 40.1, 50.6, 55.0]\\)\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\(\\sum x = 85 + 70 + 55 + 41 + 20 + 15 = 286\\)\n\n\\(\\sum y = 14.2 + 24.1 + 30.3 + 40.1 + 50.6 + 55.0 = 214.3\\)\n\n\\(\\sum xy = (85 \\times 14.2) + (70 \\times 24.1) + (55 \\times 30.3) + (41 \\times 40.1) + (20 \\times 50.6) + (15 \\times 55.0)\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\(85 \\times 14.2 = 1207\\)\n\n\\(70 \\times 24.1 = 1687\\)\n\n\\(55 \\times 30.3 = 1666.5\\)\n\n\\(41 \\times 40.1 = 1644.1\\)\n\n\\(20 \\times 50.6 = 1012\\)\n\n\\(15 \\times 55.0 = 825\\)\n\nSum them up:\n\n\\(\\sum xy = 1207 + 1687 + 1666.5 + 1644.1 + 1012 + 825 = 7041.6\\)\n\nNext, \\(\\sum x^2 = 85^2 + 70^2 + 55^2 + 41^2 + 20^2 + 15^2\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\(85^2 = 7225\\)\n\n\\(70^2 = 4900\\)\n\n\\(55^2 = 3025\\)\n\n\\(41^2 = 1681\\)\n\n\\(20^2 = 400\\)\n\n\\(15^2 = 225\\)\n\nSum them up:\n\n\\(\\sum x^2 = 7225 + 4900 + 3025 + 1681 + 400 + 225 = 17456\\)\n\nNow, \\(n = 6\\)\n\nCompute \\(\\beta_1\\):\n\n\\[ \\beta_1 = \\frac{6 \\times 7041.6 - 286 \\times 214.3}{6 \\times 17456 - (286)^2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate numerator:\n\n\\(6 \\times 7041.6 = 42249.6\\)\n\n\\(286 \\times 214.3\\)\n\nCalculate \\(286 \\times 200 = 57200\\)\n\n\\(286 \\times 14.3\\):\n\n\\(286 \\times 10 = 2860\\)\n\n\\(286 \\times 4 = 1144\\)\n\n\\(286 \\times 0.3 = 85.8\\)\n\nSo, \\(286 \\times 14.3 = 2860 + 1144 + 85.8 = 4089.8\\)\n\nThus, numerator = 42249.6 - 4089.8 = 38159.8\n\nNow, denominator:\n\n\\(6 \\times 17456 = 104736\\)\n\n\\((286)^2 = 81796\\)\n\nSo, denominator = 104736 - 81796 = 22940\n\nTherefore, \\(\\beta_1 = 38159.8 / 22940 \\approx 1.663\\)\n\nNow, compute \\(\\beta_0\\):\n\nFirst, find \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\):\n\n\\(\\bar{x} = \\sum x / n = 286 / 6 \\approx 47.6667\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y} = \\sum y / n = 214.3 / 6 \\approx 35.7167\\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\(\\beta_0 = 35.7167 - 1.663 \\times 47.6667 \\approx 35.7167 - 79.22 \\approx -43.5033\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because speed can't be negative. I must have made a calculation error.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, \\(\\beta_1\\):\n\nNumerator: 6*7041.6 = 42249.6\n\n286*214.3:\n\n286*200 = 57200\n\n286*14.3:\n\n286*10 = 2860\n\n286*4 = 1144\n\n286*0.3 = 85.8\n\nTotal: 2860 + 1144 = 4004 + 85.8 = 4089.8\n\nSo, numerator = 42249.6 - 4089.8 = 38159.6\n\nDenominator: 6*17456 = 104736\n\n286^2 = 81796\n\nDenominator = 104736 - 81796 = 22940\n\n\\(\\beta_1 = 38159.6 / 22940 \\approx 1.663\\) (this seems correct)\n\nNow, \\(\\beta_0\\):\n\n\\(\\bar{x} = 286 / 6 \\approx 47.6667\\)\n\n\\(\\bar{y} = 214.3 / 6 \\approx 35.7167\\)\n\n\\(\\beta_0 = 35.7167 - 1.663 * 47.6667 \\approx 35.7167 - 79.22 \\approx -43.5033\\)\n\nThis negative intercept doesn't make sense for speed. Maybe I need to reconsider the regression model.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the variables swapped. In the Greenshields model, speed decreases as density increases, so speed is the dependent variable and density is the independent variable. But in my earlier calculation, I might have misinterpreted the relationship.\n\nLet me think again. The Greenshields model is:\n\n\\[ v = v_f \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c}\\right) \\]\n\nThis suggests that speed decreases linearly with density. So, speed is a function of density.\n\nIn my regression, I set speed as the dependent variable (y) and density as the independent variable (x), which seems correct.\n\nHowever, the intercept \\(\\beta_0 = v_f\\), which should be the free-flow speed, and \\(\\beta_1 = -v_f / \\rho_c\\).\n\nGiven that, if \\(\\beta_0\\) is negative, it implies that \\(v_f\\) is negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate \\(\\beta_0\\):\n\nGiven that \\(\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x}\\), and \\(\\bar{y} = 35.7167\\), \\(\\beta_1 = 1.663\\), \\(\\bar{x} = 47.6667\\),\n\nThen, \\(\\beta_0 = 35.7167 - 1.663 * 47.6667 \\approx 35.7167 - 79.22 \\approx -43.5033\\)\n\nThis still gives a negative value, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rearrange the model. Maybe I should consider density as the dependent variable.\n\nLet me try regressing density against speed.\n\nIf I plot density against speed, I should get a linear relationship where density increases as speed decreases.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nSpeed | Density\n\n14.2 | 85\n\n24.1 | 70\n\n30.3 | 55\n\n40.1 | 41\n\n50.6 | 20\n\n55.0 | 15\n\nThis suggests that as speed increases, density decreases, which is consistent with the Greenshields model.\n\nSo, perhaps I should model density as a function of speed.\n\nLet me try to express the Greenshields model in terms of density as a function of speed.\n\nFrom the original model:\n\n\\[ v = v_f \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c}\\right) \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\rho\\):\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\rho_c \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{v_f}\\right) \\]\n\nThis suggests a linear relationship between \\(\\rho\\) and \\(v\\), with:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\rho_c - \\left(\\frac{\\rho_c}{v_f}\\right) v \\]\n\nSo, in this case, density is the dependent variable, and speed is the independent variable.\n\nTherefore, the regression model should be:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 v \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\alpha_0 = \\rho_c\\),\n\n- \\(\\alpha_1 = -\\rho_c / v_f\\).\n\nThis aligns with the model I just derived.\n\nSo, performing a linear regression of density on speed should give me estimates for \\(\\rho_c\\) and \\(\\rho_c / v_f\\).\n\nLet me proceed with this approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the regression coefficients for density against speed.\n\nGiven data points:\n\n(14.2, 85)\n\n(24.1, 70)\n\n(30.3, 55)\n\n(40.1, 41)\n\n(50.6, 20)\n\n(55.0, 15)\n\nLet me denote speed as \\(v\\) and density as \\(\\rho\\).\n\nCompute necessary sums:\n\n\\(\\sum v = 14.2 + 24.1 + 30.3 + 40.1 + 50.6 + 55.0 = 214.3\\)\n\n\\(\\sum \\rho = 85 + 70 + 55 + 41 + 20 + 15 = 286\\)\n\n\\(\\sum v \\rho = (14.2*85) + (24.1*70) + (30.3*55) + (40.1*41) + (50.6*20) + (55.0*15)\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n14.2*85 = 1207\n\n24.1*70 = 1687\n\n30.3*55 = 1666.5\n\n40.1*41 = 1644.1\n\n50.6*20 = 1012\n\n55.0*15 = 825\n\nSum: 1207 + 1687 = 2894\n\n2894 + 1666.5 = 4560.5\n\n4560.5 + 1644.1 = 6204.6\n\n6204.6 + 1012 = 7216.6\n\n7216.6 + 825 = 8041.6\n\nSo, \\(\\sum v \\rho = 8041.6\\)\n\nNext, \\(\\sum v^2 = 14.2^2 + 24.1^2 + 30.3^2 + 40.1^2 + 50.6^2 + 55.0^2\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n14.2^2 = 201.64\n\n24.1^2 = 580.81\n\n30.3^2 = 918.09\n\n40.1^2 = 1608.01\n\n50.6^2 = 2560.36\n\n55.0^2 = 3025\n\nSum: 201.64 + 580.81 = 782.45\n\n782.45 + 918.09 = 1700.54\n\n1700.54 + 1608.01 = 3308.55\n\n3308.55 + 2560.36 = 5868.91\n\n5868.91 + 3025 = 8893.91\n\nSo, \\(\\sum v^2 = 8893.91\\)\n\nNow, \\(n = 6\\)\n\nCompute \\(\\alpha_1\\):\n\n\\[ \\alpha_1 = \\frac{n \\sum v \\rho - \\sum v \\sum \\rho}{n \\sum v^2 - (\\sum v)^2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumerator: 6*8041.6 = 48249.6\n\nDenominator: 6*8893.91 - (214.3)^2 = 53363.46 - 45934.369 = 7429.091\n\nThus, \\(\\alpha_1 = 48249.6 / 7429.091 \\approx -6.497\\) (wait, negative?
