                    "text": "Let's tackle this surveying problem. So, from the figure, we have points A, B, and C, with a building in between points B and C, obstructing a direct measurement between them. The surveyor measures the distances from point A to B and A to C, which are 566.81 feet and 591.13 feet respectively. Also, the angle at point A is given as 80 degrees and 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to find the distance between points C and B, which is side a in the triangle ABC.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Side c = AB = 566.81'\n\n- Side b = AC = 591.13'\n\n- Angle A = 80\u00b0 30'\n\nI recall that in any triangle, the Law of Cosines can be used to find the length of a side when two sides and the included angle are known. The formula is:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos(A)\n\nSo, I can plug in the values I have:\n\na\u00b2 = (591.13)\u00b2 + (566.81)\u00b2 - 2*(591.13)*(566.81)*cos(80\u00b030')\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the angle is in decimal degrees or radians, depending on what my calculator uses. My calculator is set to degrees, so I need to convert 80\u00b030' to decimal degrees.\n\nTo convert minutes to degrees: 30' = 30/60 = 0.5\u00b0\n\nSo, 80\u00b030' = 80 + 0.5 = 80.5\u00b0\n\nNow, calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate b\u00b2 and c\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (591.13)\u00b2 = 349,416.7169\n\nc\u00b2 = (566.81)\u00b2 = 321,254.1761\n\nNext, calculate 2bc:\n\n2*(591.13)*(566.81) = 2*334,704.1333 = 669,408.2666\n\nNow, find cos(80.5\u00b0) and multiply by 2bc.\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.1710\n\nSo, 2bc * cos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 669,408.2666 * 0.1710 \u2248 114,440.26\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\na\u00b2 = 349,416.7169 + 321,254.1761 - 114,440.26 \u2248 670,670.893 - 114,440.26 \u2248 556,230.633\n\nNow, take the square root to find a:\n\na = \u221a556,230.633 \u2248 745.8 feet\n\nWait a minute, but none of the options are exactly 745.8. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the angle conversion: 80\u00b030' = 80 + 0.5 = 80.5\u00b0 That seems correct.\n\nNext, calculate b\u00b2 and c\u00b2:\n\n591.13\u00b2 = 349,416.7169\n\n566.81\u00b2 = 321,254.1761\n\n2bc = 2*591.13*566.81 = 2*334,704.1333 = 669,408.2666\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.1710\n\nMultiply: 669,408.2666 * 0.1710 \u2248 114,440.26\n\nNow, a\u00b2 = 349,416.7169 + 321,254.1761 - 114,440.26 \u2248 556,230.633\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,230.633 \u2248 745.8 feet\n\nHmm, but the options are around 748 feet, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Law of Sines, but since I have two sides and the included angle, Law of Cosines is more straightforward. Maybe I should try recalculating with more precision.\n\nLet me use more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nFirst, calculate b\u00b2 and c\u00b2 with more decimal places.\n\nb = 591.13'\n\nb\u00b2 = (591.13)^2 = 349,416.7169\n\nc = 566.81'\n\nc\u00b2 = (566.81)^2 = 321,254.1761\n\n2bc = 2*(591.13)*(566.81) = 2*334,704.1333 = 669,408.2666\n\nNow, calculate cos(80.5\u00b0) more precisely: cos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.1710044163\n\nMultiply: 669,408.2666 * 0.1710044163 \u2248 114,440.2597\n\nNow, a\u00b2 = 349,416.7169 + 321,254.1761 - 114,440.2597 \u2248 556,230.6333\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,230.6333 \u2248 745.81 feet\n\nStill getting approximately 745.8 feet, but the options are around 748 feet, which is slightly higher. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is being interpreted differently. Let's confirm the angle measurement.\n\nThe angle at A is given as 80\u00b030'. I converted it to decimal degrees as 80.5\u00b0, which should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the angle were in radians, but that's unlikely in a surveying context. Assuming it's in degrees, as is standard in such contexts.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle is at point B or C, but from the diagram, it seems like angle at A is between points B and C.\n\nWait, no, the angle is at point A, between sides AB and AC.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, angle A is the angle at point A, which is the included angle between sides b and c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle is exterior or something, but that doesn't make sense based on the diagram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the Law of Cosines formula.\n\nLet me try using the Law of Sines to see if I get a consistent result.\n\nFirst, find angle B or angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(C) = c/sin(B)\n\nBut I don't know angles B or C, nor do I know side a yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines to find side a, then use the Law of Sines to find angles B and C, but that seems unnecessary since the question only asks for side a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Tangents, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of the triangle and relate it to the sides, but again, that might not be necessary here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should accept that my calculation for side a is approximately 745.8 feet, but the options provided are around 748 feet, which suggests that perhaps there's an error in my approach or calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle is being interpreted differently, or perhaps there's a different formula that should be used in surveying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building is considered to be of negligible width, but that shouldn't affect the calculation since we're using the distances from point A to B and A to C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a unit conversion issue, but the problem states that all distances are in feet, so that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is being measured differently, but the diagram clearly labels the angle at A as 80\u00b030'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem or the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should stick with my calculation of approximately 745.8 feet, even though it's not matching exactly with the provided options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 2bc cos(A).\n\nLet me try recalculating 2bc cos(A):\n\n2bc = 2*(591.13)*(566.81) = 669,408.2666\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.1710044163\n\nMultiply: 669,408.2666 * 0.1710044163 \u2248 114,440.2597\n\nThen, a\u00b2 = 349,416.7169 + 321,254.1761 - 114,440.2597 \u2248 556,230.6333\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,230.6333 \u2248 745.81 feet\n\nStill getting the same result. Perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle is being measured in a different way, or perhaps there's additional information that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building is considered to be of a certain width, but that shouldn't affect the calculation since we're using the distances from point A to B and A to C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distances are not in feet, but that's unlikely since the problem specifies 'feet'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mislabeling in the figure, but assuming that's correct, my calculation should be accurate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, or perhaps there's a rounding difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as using the Law of Sines after finding one of the other angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area of the triangle and relating it to the sides, but that seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is approximately 745.8 feet, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should choose the closest value, which is 748.60 feet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different calculation, but based on the Law of Cosines, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, and the correct answer should be around 745.8 feet.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the closest option, which is C. Distance CB = 748.60'\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
