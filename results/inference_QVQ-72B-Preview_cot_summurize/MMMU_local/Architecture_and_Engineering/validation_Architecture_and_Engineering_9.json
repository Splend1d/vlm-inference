                    "text": "So I've got this problem about calculating the volume of a railway embankment using the prismoidal rule. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, there's a table showing distances in meters and corresponding reduced levels (R.L.) in meters:\n\n| Distance (m) | 0 | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 |\n\n| R.L. (m) | 104.8 | 106.2 | 107.5 | 107.2 | 108.3 |\n\nAnd there's some additional information:\n\n- The embankment is 400 meters long.\n\n- It's 12 meters wide at the formation level.\n\n- The side slope is 2:1.\n\n- The formation level at zero chainage is 107.00 meters.\n\n- There's a rising gradient of 1 in 100.\n\n- The ground is level across the centerline.\n\nI need to calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the prismoidal rule is. The prismoidal rule is used to find the volume of a prismoid, which is a three-dimensional shape with parallel ends and straight sides. In earthwork calculations, it's often used to estimate the volume of cut or fill between cross-sections.\n\nThe formula for the prismoidal rule is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} (A_1 + A_2 + 4A_m) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the volume.\n\n- \\( L \\) is the distance between the two end cross-sections.\n\n- \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) are the areas of the two end cross-sections.\n\n- \\( A_m \\) is the area of the mid-section.\n\nBut sometimes, depending on the number of cross-sections, the formula might be different. Since we have five cross-sections (at 0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 meters), I think the formula should be:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} (A_0 + A_n + 4A_{1} + 2A_{2} + 4A_{3} + 2A_{4} + \\dots) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A_0 \\) is the area at the start.\n\n- \\( A_n \\) is the area at the end.\n\n- \\( A_1, A_2, \\dots \\) are the intermediate areas.\n\nBut I need to confirm which formula to use. Maybe I should look up the prismoidal rule formula for multiple sections.\n\nUpon checking, the general prismoidal formula for multiple sections is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum_{odd} A + 2 \\sum_{even} A \\right) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A_0 \\) and \\( A_n \\) are the areas of the first and last cross-sections.\n\n- \\( \\sum_{odd} A \\) is the sum of areas of odd-numbered cross-sections.\n\n- \\( \\sum_{even} A \\) is the sum of areas of even-numbered cross-sections.\n\nGiven that, I need to calculate the areas at each cross-section (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 meters) and then apply the formula.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cross-section shape at each distance.\n\nThe embankment is 12 meters wide at the formation level, and the side slopes are 2:1. The formation level is given as 107.00 meters at zero chainage, and there's a rising gradient of 1 in 100.\n\nThe reduced levels (R.L.) are given for each 100-meter interval:\n\n- At 0 meters: 104.8 m\n\n- At 100 meters: 106.2 m\n\n- At 200 meters: 107.5 m\n\n- At 300 meters: 107.2 m\n\n- At 400 meters: 108.3 m\n\nSince the ground is level across the centerline, I assume the centerline is horizontal, and the embankment is built on a slope.\n\nWait, but the formation level at zero chainage is 107.00 m, and there's a rising gradient of 1 in 100. So, the formation level increases by 1 meter for every 100 meters.\n\nBut the R.L.s are different from the formation levels. Maybe the R.L. is the ground level, and the formation level is the top of the embankment.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Formation level: this is the top of the embankment.\n\n- R.L.: this is the ground level at each distance.\n\nGiven that, the height of the embankment at each cross-section would be the difference between the formation level and the ground level.\n\nBut wait, the formation level at zero chainage is 107.00 m, and there's a rising gradient of 1 in 100.\n\nSo, for every 100 meters, the formation level increases by 1 meter.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- At 0 meters: formation level = 107.00 m\n\n- At 100 meters: formation level = 107.00 + 1 = 108.00 m\n\n- At 200 meters: formation level = 108.00 + 1 = 109.00 m\n\n- At 300 meters: formation level = 109.00 + 1 = 110.00 m\n\n- At 400 meters: formation level = 110.00 + 1 = 111.00 m\n\nNow, the R.L. (ground level) at each distance is given:\n\n- At 0 meters: 104.8 m\n\n- At 100 meters: 106.2 m\n\n- At 200 meters: 107.5 m\n\n- At 300 meters: 107.2 m\n\n- At 400 meters: 108.3 m\n\nSo, the height of the embankment at each cross-section is:\n\n- At 0 meters: 107.00 - 104.8 = 2.2 m\n\n- At 100 meters: 108.00 - 106.2 = 1.8 m\n\n- At 200 meters: 109.00 - 107.5 = 1.5 m\n\n- At 300 meters: 110.00 - 107.2 = 2.8 m\n\n- At 400 meters: 111.00 - 108.3 = 2.7 m\n\nNow, I need to find the area of each cross-section.\n\nThe embankment is 12 meters wide at the top (formation level), and the side slopes are 2:1.\n\nWait, but the side slopes are 2:1, which means horizontal to vertical ratio is 2:1.\n\nSo, for every 1 meter of vertical height, the horizontal projection is 2 meters.\n\nTherefore, the width at the base would be wider due to the side slopes.\n\nLet me draw a cross-section to visualize this.\n\nAt each cross-section:\n\n- Top width = 12 m\n\n- Height = h (from above)\n\n- Side slope = 2:1\n\nThe width at the base would be:\n\nWidth at base = top width + 2 * (2 * h) = 12 + 4h\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nEach side has a slope of 2 horizontal to 1 vertical.\n\nSo, for each side:\n\n- For a height h, the horizontal extension is 2h\n\nTherefore, the total width at the base would be:\n\nTop width + 2 * (2h) = 12 + 4h\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, at each cross-section, the width at the base is 12 + 4h meters.\n\nNow, to find the area of the cross-section, I need to know the shape.\n\nAssuming the embankment has straight side slopes, the cross-section would be a trapezoid.\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2} \\times h \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- \\( b_1 \\) is the top width = 12 m\n\n- \\( b_2 \\) is the base width = 12 + 4h\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the embankment at that cross-section.\n\nTherefore, the area at each cross-section is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(12 + (12 + 4h))}{2} \\times h = \\frac{(24 + 4h)}{2} \\times h = (12 + 2h) \\times h \\]\n\nSo, \\( A = 12h + 2h^2 \\)\n\nNow, I can calculate the area at each cross-section using the heights I found earlier.\n\nLet's list the heights again:\n\n- At 0 meters: h = 2.2 m\n\n- At 100 meters: h = 1.8 m\n\n- At 200 meters: h = 1.5 m\n\n- At 300 meters: h = 2.8 m\n\n- At 400 meters: h = 2.7 m\n\nNow, calculate the areas:\n\n- At 0 meters: \\( A_0 = 12(2.2) + 2(2.2)^2 = 26.4 + 9.68 = 36.08 m^2 \\)\n\n- At 100 meters: \\( A_1 = 12(1.8) + 2(1.8)^2 = 21.6 + 6.48 = 28.08 m^2 \\)\n\n- At 200 meters: \\( A_2 = 12(1.5) + 2(1.5)^2 = 18 + 4.5 = 22.5 m^2 \\)\n\n- At 300 meters: \\( A_3 = 12(2.8) + 2(2.8)^2 = 33.6 + 15.68 = 49.28 m^2 \\)\n\n- At 400 meters: \\( A_4 = 12(2.7) + 2(2.7)^2 = 32.4 + 14.58 = 46.98 m^2 \\)\n\nNow, I need to apply the prismoidal formula to find the volume.\n\nThe prismoidal formula for five cross-sections is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_4 + 4(A_1 + A_3) + 2A_2 \\right) \\]\n\nWhere \\( L \\) is the distance between the first and last cross-sections, which is 400 meters.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{400}{3} \\left( 36.08 + 46.98 + 4(28.08 + 49.28) + 2(22.5) \\right) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n- \\( 36.08 + 46.98 = 83.06 \\)\n\n- \\( 28.08 + 49.28 = 77.36 \\)\n\n- \\( 4 \\times 77.36 = 309.44 \\)\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 22.5 = 45 \\)\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n\\[ 83.06 + 309.44 + 45 = 437.5 m^2 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by \\( \\frac{400}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{400}{3} \\times 437.5 = \\frac{175000}{3} \\approx 58333.33 m^3 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options. The options are around 14,500 m\u00b3, but I got 58,333 m\u00b3. Something must be wrong.\n\nLet me check my steps.\n\nFirst, the prismoidal formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} (A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum_{odd} A + 2 \\sum_{even} A) \\]\n\nWith five cross-sections, it should be:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{L}{3} (A_0 + A_4 + 4(A_1 + A_3) + 2A_2) \\]\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nNow, checking the area calculations:\n\n- \\( A_0 = 12(2.2) + 2(2.2)^2 = 26.4 + 9.68 = 36.08 m^2 \\) \u2014 correct\n\n- \\( A_1 = 12(1.8) + 2(1.8)^2 = 21.6 + 6.48 = 28.08 m^2 \\) \u2014 correct\n\n- \\( A_2 = 12(1.5) + 2(1.5)^2 = 18 + 4.5 = 22.5 m^2 \\) \u2014 correct\n\n- \\( A_3 = 12(2.8) + 2(2.8)^2 = 33.6 + 15.68 = 49.28 m^2 \\) \u2014 correct\n\n- \\( A_4 = 12(2.7) + 2(2.7)^2 = 32.4 + 14.58 = 46.98 m^2 \\) \u2014 correct\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{400}{3} (36.08 + 46.98 + 4(28.08 + 49.28) + 2(22.5)) \\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. \\( 36.08 + 46.98 = 83.06 \\)\n\n2. \\( 28.08 + 49.28 = 77.36 \\)\n\n3. \\( 4 \\times 77.36 = 309.44 \\)\n\n4. \\( 2 \\times 22.5 = 45 \\)\n\n5. \\( 83.06 + 309.44 + 45 = 437.5 \\)\n\n6. \\( V = \\frac{400}{3} \\times 437.5 = \\frac{175000}{3} \\approx 58333.33 m^3 \\)\n\nBut this doesn't match the options. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the areas.\n\nLet me double-check the area formula.\n\nThe cross-section is a trapezoid with top width \\( b_1 = 12 m \\), bottom width \\( b_2 = 12 + 4h \\), and height \\( h \\).\n\nArea of trapezoid:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2} \\times h = \\frac{(12 + (12 + 4h))}{2} \\times h = \\frac{(24 + 4h)}{2} \\times h = (12 + 2h) \\times h = 12h + 2h^2 \\]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side slopes are not linear, but I think for earthworks, we can assume linear slopes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the embankment has a different shape, but I think trapezoidal is standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the formation width at each level.\n\nWait, the formation level is 12 meters wide at the top, and the side slopes are 2:1.\n\nBut maybe the formation width changes with the height.\n\nWait, no, the formation width is given as 12 meters at the formation level.\n\nSo, perhaps my assumption about the base width is incorrect.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should use the formula for the area of a trapezoid with top width \\( b_1 \\), bottom width \\( b_2 \\), and height \\( h \\):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(b_1 + b_2)}{2} \\times h \\]\n\nGiven that, and knowing the side slope is 2:1, perhaps I need to calculate the bottom width differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the width at the base is not \\( 12 + 4h \\), but something else.\n\nWait, let's consider the side slope.\n\nIf the side slope is 2 horizontal to 1 vertical, then for a height \\( h \\), the horizontal extension on one side is \\( 2h \\).\n\nTherefore, the total base width would be \\( 12 + 4h \\), as I previously calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formation width is at the top, and the base width is wider due to the side slopes.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider that the formation width is at the top, and the base width is wider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formation width is at the top, and the base width is narrower.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the area of an embankment cross-section with side slopes.\n\nUpon checking, for a trapezoidal cross-section with top width \\( b \\), side slopes \\( m \\) (horizontal to vertical), and height \\( h \\), the bottom width \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[ B = b + 2mh \\]\n\nAnd the area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(b + B)}{2} \\times h = \\frac{(b + b + 2mh)}{2} \\times h = (b + mh) \\times h \\]\n\nIn this"
