                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this table that shows five soil samples with their moisture content and bulk density values. The question is asking me to determine the optimum moisture content for a highway embankment project. The options are 10%, 8%, or 9%. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the best.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"optimum moisture content\" means in this context. I recall that in soil mechanics, there's a relationship between moisture content and density when compacting soil. The Proctor test is a standard method to determine the optimal moisture content at which a soil can be compacted to its maximum dry density. So, maybe these data points are from a Proctor test.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nSample 1: 4.8% moisture, 2.164 g/cc bulk density\n\nSample 2: 7.5% moisture, 2.322 g/cc\n\nSample 3: 7.8% moisture, 2.351 g/cc\n\nSample 4: 8.9% moisture, 2.345 g/cc\n\nSample 5: 9.7% moisture, 2.327 g/cc\n\nI need to find a pattern here. Typically, as moisture content increases, the density increases up to a point and then starts to decrease. The peak of this relationship is the optimum moisture content.\n\nLet me list the data again with dry density calculations. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the dry density first. Bulk density is given as grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc), which is the same as wet density. Dry density is bulk density divided by (1 + moisture content in decimal form).\n\nSo, dry density = bulk density / (1 + moisture content)\n\nLet me calculate the dry density for each sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nMoisture content = 4.8% = 0.048\n\nDry density = 2.164 / (1 + 0.048) = 2.164 / 1.048 \u2248 2.065 g/cc\n\nSample 2:\n\nMoisture content = 7.5% = 0.075\n\nDry density = 2.322 / (1 + 0.075) = 2.322 / 1.075 \u2248 2.160 g/cc\n\nSample 3:\n\nMoisture content = 7.8% = 0.078\n\nDry density = 2.351 / (1 + 0.078) = 2.351 / 1.078 \u2248 2.181 g/cc\n\nSample 4:\n\nMoisture content = 8.9% = 0.089\n\nDry density = 2.345 / (1 + 0.089) = 2.345 / 1.089 \u2248 2.153 g/cc\n\nSample 5:\n\nMoisture content = 9.7% = 0.097\n\nDry density = 2.327 / (1 + 0.097) = 2.327 / 1.097 \u2248 2.122 g/cc\n\nNow, let's tabulate this:\n\nSample | Moisture (%) | Bulk Density (g/cc) | Dry Density (g/cc)\n\n1 | 4.8 | 2.164 | \u22482.065\n\n2 | 7.5 | 2.322 | \u22482.160\n\n3 | 7.8 | 2.351 | \u22482.181\n\n4 | 8.9 | 2.345 | \u22482.153\n\n5 | 9.7 | 2.327 | \u22482.122\n\nFrom this, I can plot moisture content against dry density to find the peak.\n\nMoisture: 4.8%, 7.5%, 7.8%, 8.9%, 9.7%\n\nDry Density: \u22482.065, \u22482.160, \u22482.181, \u22482.153, \u22482.122 g/cc\n\nI see that at 7.8% moisture, the dry density is highest at \u22482.181 g/cc, and it decreases as moisture increases or decreases from that point.\n\nTherefore, the optimum moisture content appears to be around 7.8%.\n\nBut wait, the options are 10%, 8%, or 9%. So, which one is closest to 7.8%? 8% is the closest option.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me verify the dry density calculation for sample 3:\n\nBulk density = 2.351 g/cc\n\nMoisture content = 7.8% = 0.078\n\nDry density = 2.351 / (1 + 0.078) = 2.351 / 1.078 \u2248 2.181 g/cc\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLooking at sample 4:\n\nMoisture = 8.9%, dry density \u22482.153 g/cc\n\nAnd sample 5:\n\nMoisture = 9.7%, dry density \u22482.122 g/cc\n\nBoth have lower dry densities than sample 3 at 7.8%.\n\nSample 2 at 7.5% has a slightly lower dry density than sample 3.\n\nSample 1 at 4.8% has an even lower dry density.\n\nSo, indeed, the peak is around 7.8%, which is closest to 8%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 8%.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this data.\n\nMaybe I should plot the points and see if there's a better estimate.\n\nPlotting moisture content on the x-axis and dry density on the y-axis:\n\n(4.8, 2.065), (7.5, 2.160), (7.8, 2.181), (8.9, 2.153), (9.7, 2.122)\n\nIt seems like the peak is between 7.5% and 8.9%, with the highest point at 7.8%.\n\nSince 7.8% is closer to 8% than to 9% or 10%, the best choice is 8%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard practice or formula to refine this estimation, but with the given data, 8% seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. 8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
