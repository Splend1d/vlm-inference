                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have two alternatives for a road alignment around a lake, each with different costs and impacts on wetlands. The table provides various cost components for each alternative, and we're supposed to use equivalent annual cost (EAC) analysis to decide which one is better, given an interest rate of 7%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what EAC is. EAC converts the total cost of a project over its lifetime into an equivalent annual cost, considering the time value of money. This way, we can compare projects with different lifespans and cost structures on an apples-to-apples basis.\n\nSo, for each alternative, I need to calculate the present value of all costs and then convert that present value into an annual cost over the project's service life, using the interest rate.\n\nLet's look at Alternative I:\n\n- First cost: $75,000\n\n- Annual maintenance cost: $3,000\n\n- Service life: 15 years\n\n- Salvage value: $45,000\n\n- Annual wetland costs: $7,500\n\n- Annual lighting costs: $1,500\n\nSimilarly, for Alternative II:\n\n- First cost: $125,000\n\n- Annual maintenance cost: $2,000\n\n- Service life: 15 years\n\n- Salvage value: $25,000\n\n- Annual wetland costs: $2,500\n\n- Annual lighting costs: $2,500\n\nI need to calculate the equivalent annual cost for each alternative and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for EAC:\n\nEAC = (First Cost - Salvage Value * PVF) / Annuity Factor + Annual Costs\n\nWhere:\n\n- PVF is the present value factor for the salvage value at the end of the service life.\n\n- Annuity Factor is the factor to convert the net present value to an equivalent annual cost over the service life.\n\nGiven that the service life is 15 years and the interest rate is 7%, I need to find the present value factor for year 15 and the annuity factor for 15 years at 7%.\n\nThe present value factor (PVF) is calculated as 1 / (1 + r)^n, where r is the interest rate and n is the number of years.\n\nSo, PVF = 1 / (1 + 0.07)^15 = 1 / 2.759 = approximately 0.362\n\nThe annuity factor (AF) for 15 years at 7% can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAF = [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / [ r * (1 + r)^n ] = [ (1.07)^15 - 1 ] / [ 0.07 * (1.07)^15 ] = [ 2.759 - 1 ] / [ 0.07 * 2.759 ] = 1.759 / 0.19313 = approximately 9.056\n\nNow, let's calculate the EAC for Alternative I:\n\nEAC_I = (First Cost - Salvage Value * PVF) / AF + Annual Costs\n\nFirst, calculate the net present value of the first cost and salvage value:\n\nNet PV = First Cost - Salvage Value * PVF = $75,000 - $45,000 * 0.362 \u2248 $75,000 - $16,290 = $58,710\n\nThen, convert this net PV to an equivalent annual cost over 15 years:\n\nEAC_net = Net PV / AF \u2248 $58,710 / 9.056 \u2248 $6,484\n\nNext, calculate the total annual costs:\n\nTotal Annual Costs = Annual Maintenance Cost + Annual Wetland Costs + Annual Lighting Costs = $3,000 + $7,500 + $1,500 = $12,000\n\nTherefore, the total EAC for Alternative I is:\n\nEAC_I = EAC_net + Total Annual Costs \u2248 $6,484 + $12,000 = $18,484\n\nNow, let's do the same for Alternative II.\n\nFirst, calculate the PVF and AF, which are the same as above since the service life and interest rate are the same.\n\nPVF \u2248 0.362\n\nAF \u2248 9.056\n\nNet PV for Alternative II:\n\nNet PV = $125,000 - $25,000 * 0.362 \u2248 $125,000 - $9,050 = $115,950\n\nEAC_net for Alternative II:\n\nEAC_net \u2248 $115,950 / 9.056 \u2248 $12,800\n\nTotal annual costs for Alternative II:\n\nTotal Annual Costs = $2,000 + $2,500 + $2,500 = $7,000\n\nTherefore, the total EAC for Alternative II is:\n\nEAC_II \u2248 $12,800 + $7,000 = $19,800\n\nWait a minute, the options provided are in terms of EUAW, which I believe is Equivalent Uniform Annual Worth. I think EAC and EUAW are similar concepts, possibly with slight differences in terminology.\n\nGiven that, let's see if my calculations align with the options provided.\n\nOption A: EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$19,730\n\nOption B: EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$15,730\n\nOption C: EUAW1=$15,444, EUAW2=$19,730\n\nMy calculation for Alternative I is approximately $18,484, which is close to $18,444 in Option A and B.\n\nFor Alternative II, my calculation is approximately $19,800, which is close to $19,730 in Option A.\n\nOption C has EUAW2=$19,730, which matches my calculation for Alternative II, but EUAW1=$15,444, which doesn't match my calculation for Alternative I.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems to be the closest match to my calculations.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me verify the annuity factor calculation.\n\nThe formula for the annuity factor (AF) is:\n\nAF = [ (1 - 1/(1+r)^n) ] / r\n\nWhere r = 7% = 0.07 and n = 15 years.\n\nSo, AF = [ (1 - 1/(1.07)^15) ] / 0.07 = [1 - 0.362] / 0.07 = 0.638 / 0.07 = 9.114\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly used [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / [ r * (1 + r)^n ], which is actually the future value of an annuity factor, not the present value annuity factor.\n\nSo, I need to correct that.\n\nThe correct AF for present value of an annuity is indeed [1 - 1/(1+r)^n] / r.\n\nSo, AF = [1 - 1/(1.07)^15] / 0.07 \u2248 [1 - 0.362] / 0.07 = 0.638 / 0.07 = 9.114\n\nNow, let's recalculate EAC for both alternatives using AF \u2248 9.114\n\nAlternative I:\n\nNet PV = $75,000 - $45,000 * 0.362 \u2248 $75,000 - $16,290 = $58,710\n\nEAC_net = $58,710 / 9.114 \u2248 $6,444\n\nTotal annual costs = $3,000 + $7,500 + $1,500 = $12,000\n\nEAC_I = $6,444 + $12,000 = $18,444\n\nAlternative II:\n\nNet PV = $125,000 - $25,000 * 0.362 \u2248 $125,000 - $9,050 = $115,950\n\nEAC_net = $115,950 / 9.114 \u2248 $12,724\n\nTotal annual costs = $2,000 + $2,500 + $2,500 = $7,000\n\nEAC_II = $12,724 + $7,000 = $19,724\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, this matches Option A: EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$19,730\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks to select which alternative is preferred. Since lower EAC is better, Alternative I has a lower EAC ($18,444) compared to Alternative II ($19,730), so Alternative I is preferred.\n\nHowever, the question seems to only ask for the EAC values, not to select the preferred alternative.\n\nIn any case, based on my calculations, Option A matches the EAC values for both alternatives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
