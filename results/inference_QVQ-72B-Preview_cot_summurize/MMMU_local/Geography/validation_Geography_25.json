                    "text": "So I've got this question about constructing a waterproofing layer for a basement exterior wall using coiled materials. There's a diagram provided, but since I can't see it, I'll have to rely on my general knowledge and the options given.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a coiled waterproofing layer is. I believe it refers to waterproofing membranes that come in rolls, like asphalt felt or synthetic membrane rolls. These are commonly used in construction to prevent water infiltration.\n\nOption A says that the roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall. Now, in waterproofing terminology, the upstream side is typically the side where water pressure is applied, meaning the side that faces the soil and potential water sources. So, logically, placing the waterproofing layer on the upstream side would help prevent water from penetrating the wall.\n\nOption B suggests laying the roll waterproof layer on the back surface of the external wall. This would be the interior side of the wall, away from the soil. While some waterproofing might be done on the interior side for added protection, it's not the primary place to install an external waterproofing membrane. So, this seems less likely to be the correct method.\n\nOption C mentions that the outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method. I'm not entirely sure what \"empty laying\" refers to. It might translate to \"loose laying,\" which is a method where the waterproofing membrane is laid over the surface without being fully adhered, sometimes to allow for movement or to accommodate insulation. However, for a basement exterior wall, full adhesion might be more common to ensure there are no gaps for water to seep through.\n\nOption D states that when laying double-layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other. This is a standard practice in waterproofing to ensure that any weaknesses in one layer are covered by the other layer, providing better overall protection against water infiltration.\n\nConsidering these options, I need to determine the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in basement waterproofing, it's typically more effective to place the waterproofing membrane on the exterior side of the wall, which is the upstream side, as mentioned in option A. This is because water pressure builds up on the outside, and having the waterproofing layer there helps prevent water from pushing through the wall structure.\n\nOption B suggests placing the waterproofing on the interior side. While this can be part of a waterproofing strategy, it's not the primary method for external waterproofing. Interior waterproofing is more about managing water that has already penetrated the wall, rather than preventing it from entering in the first place.\n\nOption C refers to the \"empty laying\" method, which might be a translation of \"loose laying.\" If that's the case, it's a technique where the waterproofing membrane is not fully adhered to the surface. In some cases, like when insulation is involved or when movement is expected, loose laying can be beneficial. However, for a basement wall directly in contact with soil, full adhesion might be preferable to ensure there are no paths for water to travel along the membrane.\n\nOption D about laying double-layer coils perpendicular to each other seems like a sound practice. Stacking layers at right angles to each other can help reinforce the waterproofing barrier, ensuring that any small defects in one layer are covered by the other layer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would say that option A is the correct method: the roll waterproof layer should be laid on the upstream surface of the external wall. Additionally, option D seems like a good practice for multiple-layer applications.\n\nHowever, since the question likely expects a single best answer, and options may not be cumulative, I need to prioritize.\n\nIf I had to choose one option that is most crucial or directly answers the question, it would be option A, as placing the waterproofing layer on the upstream side is standard practice for external basement walls.\n\nOption B is incorrect because placing the waterproofing on the back surface (interior) of the wall isn't the primary method for external waterproofing.\n\nOption C, if it means loose laying, might be acceptable in some scenarios but isn't necessarily the best practice for basement walls where full adhesion might be preferred.\n\nOption D is a good practice for multiple-layer systems but doesn't address the primary placement of the waterproofing layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: the roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall.\n\nTo summarize, in constructing the waterproofing layer of a basement exterior wall with coiled materials, it's essential to place the waterproofing membrane on the upstream (exterior) side of the wall to effectively prevent water infiltration. Additional layers, if used, should be installed with their coils perpendicular to each other for enhanced protection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
