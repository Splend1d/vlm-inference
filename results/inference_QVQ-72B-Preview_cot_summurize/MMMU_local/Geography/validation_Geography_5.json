                    "text": "So I've got this circuit diagram here, and I need to find the values of currents I1 and I2. Let's see... It's been a while since I've done circuit analysis, but I remember some basic principles that might help here.\n\nFirst off, I see that there are several current sources in the circuit. There's a -2A source, a 1A source, and a 1.5A source, and then there are these currents I1 and I2 that I need to solve for. The diagram also shows some resistors, but interestingly, their values aren't given, just their positions in the circuit.\n\nLooking at the circuit, it seems like there are nodes and loops that I can analyze using Kirchhoff's laws. Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving the node. Similarly, Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the sum of voltages around any closed loop is zero.\n\nSince the question is about currents, maybe KCL will be more directly applicable here. Let's identify the nodes in the circuit where currents meet.\n\nThere's a node where the -2A source and the 1A source are connected, and another node where the 1.5A source is connected. Wait, actually, I need to look at the diagram more carefully to identify the nodes accurately.\n\nIn the diagram, there are three current sources: -2A, 1A, and 1.5A. There's also a resistor labeled 0.5A, but I'm not sure if that's a typo or if it represents a current through the resistor. Maybe it's the resistance value, like 0.5 ohms, but it's labeled as \"0.5A,\" which is confusing.\n\nAssuming that the \"0.5A\" is a resistor with a resistance of 0.5 ohms, I need to consider the voltage across it to find the current through it. But without voltage values or other information, that might not be directly helpful.\n\nLet me try to assign directions to the currents I1 and I2. In the diagram, I1 is labeled in one branch and I2 in another. I need to determine their values based on the given current sources.\n\nPerhaps I can set up equations based on KCL at the nodes where these currents meet.\n\nLet's consider the node where the -2A source and the 1A source are connected. Assuming that currents enter the node equal the currents leaving, I can write an equation.\n\nSo, if the -2A source is pointing towards the node and the 1A source is pointing away, then the sum of currents at that node would be -2A (entering) plus some current leaving, perhaps I1.\n\nWait, no, the -2A source is likely a current source providing -2A, which means it's sinking 2A of current, right? So, it's like a current sink, removing 2A from the node.\n\nSimilarly, the 1A source might be injecting 1A into the node.\n\nSo, at that node, the sum of currents would be:\n\n-2A (sinking) + 1A (injecting) + I1 (leaving) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nI1 = 1A - (-2A) = 1A + 2A = 3A\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward, and it doesn't involve I2. But looking back at the options, 3A isn't among them. Maybe I need to consider more nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look at the entire loop where I1 is flowing. If there's a loop that includes I1, I can apply KVL around that loop.\n\nBut first, let's consider another node in the circuit where I2 is present.\n\nLooking at the node where the 1.5A source is connected, maybe I can write another KCL equation there.\n\nSuppose that at this node, the 1.5A source is injecting current, and I2 is leaving the node, along with possibly other currents.\n\nWait, in the diagram, the 1.5A source is connected in parallel with a resistor and possibly other components. I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, looking back at the diagram, there are current sources and resistors arranged in a certain configuration. There's a -2A source on the left, a 1A source in the middle, and a 1.5A source on the right.\n\nThere's also a resistor labeled \"0.5A,\" which might be a typo and should be 0.5 ohms. Assuming it's a resistor with 0.5 ohms resistance, the current through it would depend on the voltage across it.\n\nBut since I don't have voltage values, maybe I need to consider the currents in terms of the given sources.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of superposition, where I consider each current source separately and then sum their effects.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, consider the -2A source acting alone, with all other sources set to zero. So, setting the 1A and 1.5A sources to zero, I can find the currents produced by the -2A source alone.\n\nSimilarly, I can do the same for the 1A source and the 1.5A source individually, and then sum all the contributions to get the total currents I1 and I2.\n\nBut this might be a bit time-consuming, and since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a quicker way.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 2.5A and 1.5A\n\nB. 1A, and 0A\n\nC. 2.5A and 0A\n\nD. 1A, and 1.5A\n\nPerhaps I can plug in these values and see which one satisfies the KCL at the nodes.\n\nLet's try option B: I1 = 1A, I2 = 0A.\n\nAt the node where the -2A source and the 1A source are connected, if I1 is 1A leaving, then:\n\nSum of currents = -2A (sinking) + 1A (injecting) + 1A (leaving) = 0\n\nYes, that balances.\n\nNow, at the node where the 1.5A source is connected, if I2 is 0A, then the currents must balance there as well.\n\nSuppose the 1.5A source is injecting current, and there are other currents leaving that node. If I2 is 0A, then perhaps the other currents balance out to 1.5A.\n\nBut without more information about the rest of the circuit, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the loops in the circuit and apply KVL.\n\nLooking at the circuit again, there seems to be a loop involving the -2A source, the 1A source, and some resistors.\n\nIf I can find the voltages across these components, I might be able to set up loop equations.\n\nHowever, without knowing the resistance values (except for the one labeled \"0.5A,\" which might be 0.5 ohms), this seems difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the \"0.5A\" is not a resistor but a current through a branch. If that's the case, then I can consider that branch as having a current of 0.5A.\n\nAssuming that, let's see how that affects the currents I1 and I2.\n\nIf there's a branch with a current of 0.5A, then at the node where that branch connects, I need to account for that current.\n\nCombining this with the current sources, perhaps I can set up a system of equations to solve for I1 and I2.\n\nThis is getting complicated, and I might be overthinking it.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the concept of mesh analysis, where I assign mesh currents to the loops and set up equations based on the voltages around each mesh.\n\nBut again, without voltage values or knowing the resistances, this seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of all currents entering and leaving each node must be zero, and try to express all unknown currents in terms of I1 and I2.\n\nIf I can find relationships between the currents through the different branches, I might be able to solve for I1 and I2.\n\nHowever, without more information about the circuit configuration, this seems tricky.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can look back at the diagram and try to identify parallel or series connections between the components.\n\nIf there are any parallel connections, I can combine the currents accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if there are series connections, I can consider the currents through those series elements to be the same.\n\nBut again, without clear identification of the components and their connections, this is difficult.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the total current provided by the sources and see how it distributes through the circuit.\n\nThe -2A source is sinking current, the 1A source is injecting current, and the 1.5A source is also injecting current.\n\nSo, total current injected is 1A + 1.5A = 2.5A, and total current sunk is 2A.\n\nTherefore, the net current in the circuit should be 2.5A - 2A = 0.5A, which should be accounted for by the currents I1 and I2.\n\nIf I assume that I1 and I2 are the only unknown currents, then their sum should account for this 0.5A difference.\n\nBut that doesn't directly give me the individual values of I1 and I2.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the directions of the currents more carefully.\n\nLet's assume that I1 is flowing in one direction and I2 in another, and see how they relate to the given current sources.\n\nIf I consider that the -2A source is sinking current, then at the node where it's connected, the sum of currents should be zero.\n\nSimilarly, at the node where the 1.5A source is injecting current, the sum should be zero.\n\nBy setting up these equations, perhaps I can solve for I1 and I2.\n\nLet me try to write down the equations.\n\nAt the first node:\n\n-2A (sinking) + 1A (injecting) + I1 = 0\n\nSo, I1 = 2A - 1A = 1A\n\nAt the second node:\n\n1.5A (injecting) + I2 = sum of other currents leaving the node.\n\nBut I need to know what other currents are leaving that node to complete this equation.\n\nLooking back, perhaps there's a current through the resistor labeled \"0.5A.\"\n\nIf that's a resistor with 0.5 ohms resistance, then the current through it would depend on the voltage across it.\n\nWithout knowing the voltage, I can't determine that current directly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"0.5A\" is the current through that resistor, then I can use that information.\n\nAssuming that the \"0.5A\" is the current through the resistor, then at the node where it connects, that current must be considered in the KCL equation.\n\nSo, at the node where the 1.5A source is injecting current, the currents leaving are I2 and the 0.5A through the resistor.\n\nTherefore, the equation would be:\n\n1.5A = I2 + 0.5A\n\nSolving for I2:\n\nI2 = 1.5A - 0.5A = 1A\n\nNow, going back to the first node, where I had I1 = 1A.\n\nSo, according to this, I1 is 1A and I2 is 1A.\n\nBut looking at the options, 1A and 1A isn't explicitly listed, although option D has 1A and 1.5A.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the current through the resistor is 0.5A.\n\nIf \"0.5A\" is the label on the resistor, it might indicate the resistance value, not the current.\n\nIn that case, I need to reconsider.\n\nIf the resistor has a resistance of 0.5 ohms, then the current through it depends on the voltage across it.\n\nBut without knowing the voltages, I can't determine that current directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resistor is in parallel with another component, and I can find the current through it based on the voltages from the current sources.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for a multiple-choice question.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nGiven that it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can eliminate some options based on reasoning.\n\nOption A is 2.5A and 1.5A.\n\nDoes that make sense? Well, earlier I calculated I1 to be 1A, which is less than 2.5A, so maybe A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is 1A and 0A.\n\nEarlier, I got I1 = 1A and I2 = 1A, but according to that, I2 should be 1A, not 0A.\n\nOption C is 2.5A and 0A.\n\nAgain, I1 seems too high, based on my earlier calculation.\n\nOption D is 1A and 1.5A.\n\nThis seems plausible, as I earlier calculated I1 = 1A and I2 = 1A, but according to option D, I2 is 1.5A.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in assuming the current through the resistor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1.5A source is in parallel with the resistor, and their currents add up.\n\nIf that's the case, then the current through the resistor plus the 1.5A source equals I2.\n\nBut without knowing the resistance or the voltage, I can't determine the resistor's current.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I should just guess based on the options.\n\nOption B is 1A and 0A, which matches my earlier calculation for I1 but not for I2.\n\nOption D is 1A and 1.5A, which also matches I1 but has I2 as 1.5A.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D, with I1 = 1A and I2 = 1.5A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the 1.5A source is in parallel with the resistor, and their currents add up to I2.\n\nIf the resistor has 0.5 ohms and there's a voltage across it, then the current through it would be voltage divided by resistance.\n\nBut without knowing the voltage, I can't determine that current.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the voltage across the resistor can be found from the current sources.\n\nLet me try to find the voltage across the resistor.\n\nIf the -2A source is sinking current, and the 1A source is injecting current, then the voltage across that part of the circuit can be found, but again, without resistance values, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire loop and apply KVL.\n\nThis is taking too much time, and I'm not making progress.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the concept of current division.\n\nIf there are parallel branches in the circuit, the currents divide based on the resistances.\n\nBut again, without knowing the resistances, this doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the total current in the circuit is the sum of all currents, and set up equations accordingly.\n\nBut I feel like I'm going in circles here.\n\nMaybe I should accept that my initial calculation of I1 = 1A is correct, and that I2 is 1.5A, as per option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, with I1 = 1A and I2 = 0A.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the 1.5A source, which should be injecting current somewhere.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should just pick option D and move on.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
