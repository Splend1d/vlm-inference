                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a fully saturated cohesive soil. The natural water content is 60%, and I need to find the natural pore ratio from the given options. The options are 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, and 1.9. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between water content and pore ratio in a fully saturated soil. I know that in soil mechanics, the water content, or moisture content, is defined as the ratio of the mass of water to the mass of dry soil. The pore ratio, on the other hand, is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids in the soil.\n\nBut since the soil is fully saturated, all the voids are filled with water. So, there's a direct relationship between the water content and the pore ratio through the densities of water and soil.\n\nLet me try to find the formula that connects these properties. I think there's an equation that relates water content (w), pore ratio (e), and the specific gravity of the soil particles.\n\nThe formula I'm thinking of is:\n\nw = e * (\u03b3w / \u03b3d)\n\nWhere:\n\n- w is the water content (decimal)\n\n- e is the pore ratio\n\n- \u03b3w is the unit weight of water\n\n- \u03b3d is the dry unit weight of the soil\n\nBut wait, I don't have the dry unit weight of the soil here. Maybe there's another way to relate water content and pore ratio without knowing the dry unit weight.\n\nLet me consider the relationship in terms of volumes and masses.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Vs: volume of solids\n\n- Vv: volume of voids\n\n- V: total volume (Vs + Vv)\n\n- e = Vv / Vs (pore ratio)\n\n- w = (mass of water / mass of dry soil)\n\nIn a fully saturated condition, the volume of water is equal to the volume of voids, so Vw = Vv.\n\nGiven that, the mass of water is:\n\nm_w = Vw * \u03b3w\n\nBut Vw = Vv, so:\n\nm_w = Vv * \u03b3w\n\nThe mass of dry soil is:\n\nm_s = Vs * \u03b3s\n\nWhere \u03b3s is the unit weight of the solid particles.\n\nTherefore, the water content w is:\n\nw = m_w / m_s = (Vv * \u03b3w) / (Vs * \u03b3s)\n\nBut e = Vv / Vs, so:\n\nw = e * (\u03b3w / \u03b3s)\n\nWait, this looks similar to what I had before, but now I have \u03b3s, the unit weight of solids.\n\nI need to find a way to express this in terms of known quantities. I know the water content w is 60%, which is 0.6 in decimal form.\n\nIf I can find \u03b3w / \u03b3s, I can solve for e.\n\nBut I don't know \u03b3s. Maybe I can express \u03b3s in terms of specific gravity.\n\nSpecific gravity (Gs) is defined as the ratio of the unit weight of the solid particles to the unit weight of water:\n\nGs = \u03b3s / \u03b3w\n\nTherefore, \u03b3s = Gs * \u03b3w\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\nw = e * (\u03b3w / (Gs * \u03b3w)) = e / Gs\n\nSo, e = w * Gs\n\nNow, I need to know the specific gravity of the soil particles. Typically, for most soils, Gs is around 2.65 to 2.75, but since it's not given, I should assume a standard value.\n\nLet's assume Gs = 2.7\n\nThen, e = 0.6 * 2.7 = 1.62\n\nWhich is closest to option C. 1.6\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nIf e is 1.62, that means the volume of voids is 1.62 times the volume of solids. That seems plausible for a cohesive soil, which can have higher pore ratios compared to granular soils.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the void ratio e and the porosity n, where n = Vv / V.\n\nBut in this problem, it's specified as pore ratio, which is e = Vv / Vs.\n\nSo, I think using e = w * Gs is the correct approach.\n\nLet me verify this with another method to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother related formula is:\n\ne = (w * Gs)\n\nWhich matches what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the relationship between water content and void ratio in saturated soil:\n\nw = e / Gs\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with what I have.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the dry unit weight or something else.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn a fully saturated soil, the relationship between water content, void ratio, and specific gravity is given by:\n\nw = e / Gs\n\nAs I just wrote, but that would mean e = w * Gs, which is what I used earlier.\n\nBut earlier I thought w = e / Gs, which is incorrect; it should be w = e / Gs only if the soil is saturated, but I think I might have misremembered.\n\nLet me look up the correct relationship.\n\nAfter checking, I find that for fully saturated soil:\n\nw = e / Gs\n\nTherefore, e = w * Gs\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nGiven that, and assuming Gs = 2.7, then e = 0.6 * 2.7 = 1.62, which is closest to option C. 1.6\n\nBut wait, the options are 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, and 1.9. 1.62 is closest to 1.6.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the specific gravity isn't given, and I had to assume it's 2.7, which is typical for many soils, but it might not be accurate for this specific case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, Gs is different.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this without assuming Gs.\n\nAnother approach could be using the degree of saturation, but since the soil is fully saturated, S = 100%.\n\nThe relationship between water content, degree of saturation, and void ratio is:\n\nw = (e * S) / Gs\n\nBut since S = 1, it simplifies to w = e / Gs\n\nAgain, leading to e = w * Gs\n\nSo, I'm back to the same equation.\n\nTherefore, without knowing Gs, I can't find e directly, but assuming Gs = 2.7 leads to e \u2248 1.62, which is closest to option C. 1.6\n\nAlternatively, if I consider Gs = 2.65, then e = 0.6 * 2.65 = 1.59, which is still closest to 1.6.\n\nOr if Gs = 2.75, e = 0.6 * 2.75 = 1.65, still closest to 1.6.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. 1.6\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
