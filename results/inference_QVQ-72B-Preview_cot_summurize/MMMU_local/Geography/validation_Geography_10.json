                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about moments of inertia for different cross-sections. There are two sections shown: one with a circle and a rectangular hole, and another with a square and a circular hole. The axes are labeled u and v, and there's a spindle at the center. The question is about comparing the moments of inertia along these axes for both sections.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what moment of inertia represents. It's a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation. For planar sections like these, the moment of inertia depends on the distribution of material relative to the axis in question.\n\nLooking at section (a), it's a circle with a rectangular hole inside. The axes are u and v, which seem to be principal axes because they are aligned with the geometry. Similarly, in section (b), there's a square with a circular hole, and again, axes u and v are likely principal axes.\n\nThe notation used is I_u and I_v for the moments of inertia about the u and v axes, respectively. The options are comparing I_u and I_v for each section, and there's also a comparison between the sections.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. For section (a), the circle with a rectangular hole, if u and v are the axes of symmetry, then I_u and I_v should be equal because it's symmetric about both axes. But since there's a rectangular hole, which is not necessarily symmetric in the same way, maybe I_u and I_v are different.\n\nWait, in section (a), the hole is rectangular, and the outer shape is circular. If the rectangular hole is aligned in a way that breaks the symmetry of the circle, then I_u and I_v would be different unless specified otherwise.\n\nIn section (b), there's a square with a circular hole. Again, depending on the alignment of the hole, the moments of inertia about u and v might be equal or different.\n\nThe options seem to suggest that for section (a), I_u is greater than I_v, and for section (b), I_u is equal to I_v.\n\nLet me think about section (a) first. If I have a circle with a rectangular hole, and u and v are perpendicular axes through the center, then assuming the hole is aligned in a way that makes one axis coincide with the symmetry axis of the rectangle, say u is along the longer side of the rectangle, then I_u would be larger because more material is distributed farther from that axis compared to I_v.\n\nWait, actually, if the rectangular hole is elongated along the u-axis, then less material is removed along the v-axis, making I_u larger than I_v.\n\nSimilarly, for section (b), if it's a square with a circular hole, and u and v are perpendicular axes through the center, and if the square is symmetric about both axes, then I_u and I_v should be equal, provided that the circular hole is centered and symmetrically placed.\n\nSo, for section (a), I_u > I_v, and for section (b), I_u = I_v.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says l(a) > l(a); l(b) = l(b), which seems to match what I thought.\n\nBut wait, the notation is a bit confusing. It shows l(a) > l(a), but that seems redundant because it's comparing I_u with I_v for section (a), both denoted as l(a). Maybe there's a typo here.\n\nOption B says l.(a) > L(a); l(b) > l,(b), which is even more confusing.\n\nOption C says l.(a) >2(a); l(b)>l,(b), and option D says l.(a) >L(a); l(b)>2,(b).\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the closest to what I thought, but the notation is unclear. Maybe the periods and commas are placeholders for something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notation is using primes or dots to denote different moments of inertia, but it's not standard. Maybe it's a misprint, and it should compare I_u and I_v for each section.\n\nAssuming that, then for section (a), I_u > I_v, and for section (b), I_u = I_v.\n\nSo, the correct choice would be option A, but only if the notation is interpreted correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notation is indicating the product of inertia or something else, but the question seems to be about the moments of inertia along the u and v axes.\n\nGiven that, I think option A is the correct one, despite the confusing notation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
