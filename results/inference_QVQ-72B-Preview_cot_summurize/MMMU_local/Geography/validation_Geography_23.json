                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a cantilever beam with different cross-sections being subjected to a concentrated force P at the free end. The question is asking which type of cross-section will produce a combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion. The options are a rectangle, channel steel, I-beam, and equilateral angle steel. There's also a figure, but since I can't see it, I'll have to rely on my understanding of mechanics of materials.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what oblique bending and torsion are. Oblique bending is when a beam bends along a diagonal axis due to transverse loads that are not aligned with the principal axes of the cross-section. Torsion, on the other hand, is when a beam is twisted due to applied moments that create a twisting effect.\n\nSo, combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion would mean that the applied force is causing both bending along a diagonal axis and twisting of the beam.\n\nNow, the way the force P is applied is crucial here. Depending on where and how P is applied, it can cause different types of deformations. Since it's applied at the free end, its line of action will determine the type of deformation.\n\nLet me think about each cross-section one by one.\n\nStarting with the rectangle (option A). A rectangular cross-section has two principal axes, typically the centroidal X and Y axes. If the force P is applied along one of these axes, it would cause simple bending about that axis. However, if P is applied at an angle to these axes, it could cause oblique bending. But would it cause torsion as well? I think for a rectangular section, applying a force not along the principal axes would cause oblique bending, but torsion might not be directly induced unless there's a component of the force that creates a twisting moment.\n\nMoving on to channel steel (option B). Channel sections have asymmetry because of their C-shape. The principal axes are not the same as those of a symmetrical section like a rectangle or I-beam. Applying a force P at the free end, depending on its direction, could cause torsion due to the asymmetry of the section. Maybe oblique bending as well if the force is not aligned with the principal axes.\n\nNext, the I-beam (option C). I-beams are symmetrical about both the X and Y axes. Applying a force P at the free end along one of these axes would cause simple bending about that axis. If P is applied at an angle to these axes, it would cause oblique bending. However, similar to the rectangle, torsion might not be directly induced unless there's a component of the force that creates a twisting moment.\n\nLastly, equilateral angle steel (option D). Angle sections are also asymmetrical, especially if they're loaded in a way that the force is not aligned with their principal axes. Applying a force P at the free end could induce both bending and torsion due to the asymmetry of the section.\n\nFrom my understanding, for combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion to occur, the cross-section needs to be asymmetrical, and the force should be applied in a way that it causes both bending and twisting.\n\nBetween the given options, the rectangle and I-beam are symmetrical about their principal axes, while the channel steel and equilateral angle steel are asymmetrical.\n\nGiven that, both channel steel and equilateral angle steel could potentially exhibit combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion under certain loading conditions.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the action line of force P and the cross-sectional shape shown in the figure. Since I don't have the figure, I need to make an educated guess based on typical representations.\n\nIf I recall correctly, in such problems, the force P is often applied at the free end in a direction that causes a combination of bending and torsion, depending on the cross-section's symmetry.\n\nGiven that, I would lean towards selecting an asymmetrical cross-section, which would be either channel steel or equilateral angle steel.\n\nBetween these two, equilateral angle steel might be more prone to torsional deformations due to its higher degree of asymmetry.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be option D, equilateral angle steel.\n\nHowever, without the figure, it's hard to be absolutely certain, but based on general principles, this seems reasonable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
