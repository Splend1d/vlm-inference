                    "text": "So I've got this question here about types of water in soil. There are three types mentioned: gravitational water, capillary water, and hygroscopic water. The question is asking which type is located on the surfaces of individual soil particles and is largely unavailable to plants because it's held too tightly.\n\nLet me try to understand each type first.\n\nStarting with gravitational water: from the description, it seems like when the soil is really wet, maybe after a heavy rain, there's extra water that doesn't stay in the soil but instead gets pulled down by gravity into groundwater. So, this is like the water that drains away because it's not held by the soil.\n\nNext, capillary water: once the excess water has stopped flowing downward, the soil reaches something called field capacity. At this point, the water is held around the soil grains by capillary tension, which is like surface tension that keeps water clustered around the soil particles. This water is available to plants because it's not draining away; it's being held in place but not too tightly.\n\nThen there's hygroscopic water: after a period without rain, when all the available water has been used up by plants or evaporated, the soil reaches its wilting point. At this stage, the water left in the soil is held by adhesion, meaning it's stuck to the soil particles very strongly due to molecular attractions. This water is so firmly held that plants can't extract it easily, and it doesn't evaporate easily either.\n\nSo, based on this, hygroscopic water is the type that's held on the surfaces of soil particles and is largely unavailable to plants because of the strong molecular attractions.\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nGravitational water is the water that's draining away due to gravity, so that's not the one staying on the particle surfaces.\n\nCapillary water is held by capillary tension and is available to plants, so that's not the one that's unavailable.\n\nHygroscopic water is held by strong adhesion forces and is unavailable to plants, which matches the description in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Hygroscopic water.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll look back at the image labels.\n\nImage 1 is about gravitational water, where excess water is pulled through the soil by gravity.\n\nImage 2 is about capillary water, where water is held by capillary tension and is available to plants.\n\nImage 3 is about hygroscopic water, where water is held by adhesion and is not available to plants.\n\nSo, again, this confirms that hygroscopic water is the type held on the surfaces of soil particles and is unavailable to plants.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is C. Hygroscopic water.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
