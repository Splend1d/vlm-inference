                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's about who believed that the history of society was one of \"class struggle.\" The options are Emile Durkheim, Karl Marx, Erving Goffman, and George Herbert Mead. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from my sociology class.\n\nFirst off, the term \"class struggle\" sounds familiar. It makes me think of different social classes fighting against each other, maybe over resources or power. That rings a bell with Marxism, but I should make sure.\n\nLet me recall what I know about each of these theorists.\n\nStarting with Emile Durkheim, I remember he was a French sociologist who talked a lot about social solidarity and the division of labor. He thought that society was held together by shared values and norms, which he called \"mechanical solidarity.\" As society became more complex, this shifted to \"organic solidarity,\" where people were bound by specialized roles. Doesn't sound too much like class struggle, does it? He did talk about social conflict somewhat, but it wasn't the central theme of his work.\n\nNext is Karl Marx. Now, Marx is famous for his theories on how capitalist societies create class conflicts. He believed that history was driven by the struggles between different classes, especially between the bourgeoisie (the owners of the means of production) and the proletariat (the working class). His idea was that these conflicts would eventually lead to a revolution where the working class would overthrow the capitalist system and establish a classless society. That sounds a lot like the concept of class struggle.\n\nMoving on to Erving Goffman. He was an interactionist sociologist who focused on everyday social interactions and how people present themselves to others. His works like \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\" and \"Stigma\" deal with personal identity and social performance. While he did touch on power dynamics in social interactions, class struggle isn't really at the core of his theories.\n\nLastly, George Herbert Mead was an American pragmatist philosopher who contributed to symbolic interactionism. He emphasized the role of symbols and language in human interaction and how individuals develop self-identity through social experiences. Again, not directly related to class struggle.\n\nSo, based on this recap, it seems like Karl Marx is the one who is most associated with the idea that history is characterized by class struggle. But just to be thorough, maybe I should think about whether any of the others might have similar views.\n\nDurkheim did discuss social conflict, but it was more in the context of maintaining social order and equilibrium. Goffman and Mead were more focused on individual interactions and identity formation, rather than large-scale class conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Karl Marx.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the history of society was one of <image 1>?\" but the image is not visible here. However, based on the context and the options provided, it's clear that the question is referring to the concept of class struggle.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if there's any possibility that another theorist might have also emphasized class struggle. For instance, Friedrich Engels, who co-authored \"The Communist Manifesto\" with Marx, also wrote about class struggle. But Engels isn't listed here, so that doesn't complicate things.\n\nAdditionally, some might argue that Max Weber, another prominent sociologist, discussed class, status, and party in his theory of social stratification. However, Weber's approach was different from Marx's, as he saw class as one among several factors influencing social inequality, and he didn't believe in the inevitable class struggle leading to revolution.\n\nGiven all this, I'm confident that Karl Marx is the one who believed that the history of society was one of class struggle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Karl Marx}} \\]"
