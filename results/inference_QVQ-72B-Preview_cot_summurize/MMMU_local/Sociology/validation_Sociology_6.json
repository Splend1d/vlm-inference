                    "text": "Alright, I've got this term \"folkways\" to understand. Let's see, the definition says they are culturally-defined norms of etiquette that aren't very serious if broken. They're mostly customary and polite. So, it's like unwritten rules about how to behave in society, but they're not like laws that can get you in trouble with the police or anything. They're more about social expectations.\n\nThe examples listed help illustrate this. Tucking in your shirt\u2014that's more about looking neat and presentable, right? It's not something that's legally required, but if you don't do it, people might think you're sloppy or don't care about your appearance.\n\nDressing appropriately at work\u2014that makes sense too. Different jobs have different dress codes, whether formal or casual. If you don't follow them, you might be seen as disrespectful or not taking the job seriously, but it's not against the law.\n\nWearing a school uniform\u2014that's similar. Schools often have dress codes for students, and while there might be consequences from the school for not following them, it's generally not a legal issue.\n\nRaising your hand to speak\u2014that's a common practice in classrooms or meetings. It's a way to show respect and take turns speaking. Not doing it might be seen as rude or disruptive, but again, not something that's enforced by law.\n\nOnly having hard drinks after 5 PM\u2014that's an interesting one. It seems like a social norm about when it's acceptable to consume stronger alcoholic beverages. Breaking this might make people think you have a drinking problem or lack self-control, but it's not illegal to drink hard drinks before 5 PM.\n\nNot spitting on the sidewalk\u2014that's definitely a folkway related to public hygiene and respect for public spaces. Spitting in public is generally considered uncivilized or disrespectful, but unless there's a specific local ordinance against it, it's not usually a legal offense.\n\nWorking a 5-day week\u2014that's a norm in many workplaces. It's expected that employees work Monday through Friday and have weekends off. Deviating from this might be seen as unconventional, but it's not against any law.\n\nSaying \"please\" and \"thank you\"\u2014these are basic manners that show politeness and gratitude. Not using them might make you seem impolite or ungrateful, but it's not something that can get you punished by the authorities.\n\nSo, overall, folkways seem to be the informal, social norms that help maintain order and respect in society. They're not legally enforced, but breaking them can lead to social disapproval or being seen as rude.\n\nNow, comparing this to the other types of norms mentioned: laws, mores, and taboos.\n\nLaws are formal rules enacted by governing bodies, and breaking them can result in legal penalties.\n\nMores are norms that are considered important to the moral fabric of a society. Breaking mores can lead to strong social disapproval, though they aren't necessarily codified into law.\n\nTaboos are strong prohibitions against certain behaviors, often involving deep-seated cultural or religious beliefs, and breaking them can lead to severe social sanctions.\n\nIn contrast, folkways are less serious norms, more about etiquette and daily interactions, and breaking them might lead to mild social disapproval or discomfort among peers.\n\nSo, in summary, folkways are the everyday, informal rules that guide our behavior in society, ensuring smooth social interactions without legal or severe moral implications.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Norms for routine or casual interaction.
