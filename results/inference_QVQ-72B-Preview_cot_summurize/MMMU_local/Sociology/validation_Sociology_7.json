                    "text": "Alright, I've got this image to explain, and it's about the Dependency Theory by Raul Prebisch. It seems to be a visual representation of how global inequality and stratification work, particularly focusing on the relationship between core and periphery nations. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, the title is \"Dependency Theory\" with \"Raul Prebisch\" mentioned below it, so he's the one who developed this theory. There are two main parts in the image: \"Center\" and \"Periphery.\" The center is depicted with various icons representing wealth, industry, and economic growth, while the periphery is shown with icons indicating underdevelopment and dependence on the center.\n\nLooking at the center, there are icons of money bags with euros and dollars, indicating financial wealth, and a factory, suggesting industrial production. There's also a graph showing growth, which probably represents economic development. On the periphery side, there are icons of underdevelopment, dependence on the center, and a sad face, indicating negative consequences.\n\nThere's an arrow labeled \"Trade\" from the center to the periphery, suggesting that trade occurs between these two regions. Additionally, there's another arrow from the periphery back to the center labeled \"Total Control of Periphery,\" indicating that the center has control over the periphery through trade.\n\nNow, the question is asking about global inequality and stratification, focusing on how _______________. The options are:\n\nA. Core nations and peripheral nations exploit semi-peripheral nations\n\nB. Semi-peripheral nations exploit core nations\n\nC. Peripheral nations exploit core nations\n\nD. Core nations exploit peripheral nations\n\nGiven the image, it seems that the theory is highlighting how core nations exploit peripheral nations through trade and control mechanisms. So, option D seems plausible.\n\nBut let me think deeper. The image shows that the center has 80% of the wealth, as indicated by the money bags, and the periphery has 20%. This suggests a significant disparity in wealth distribution between the two regions.\n\nThe trade arrow from center to periphery implies that the center is exporting something to the periphery, possibly manufactured goods, while the periphery is providing raw materials or labor. The \"Total Control of Periphery\" arrow suggests that the center maintains dominance over the periphery through this trade relationship.\n\nFurthermore, the periphery is labeled as \"Underdeveloped\" and \"Dependent from Center,\" which reinforces the idea that these regions are not independent and are being held back by their reliance on the core nations.\n\nSo, according to this theory, the core nations are exploiting the peripheral nations through unequal trade relationships and maintaining control over them, leading to the periphery's underdevelopment and dependence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Core nations exploit peripheral nations.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that the theory doesn't suggest any exploitation of semi-peripheral nations. From the image, it only shows center and periphery, without mentioning semi-peripheral nations. So, options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the information provided in the image.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility of semi-peripheral nations being part of this dynamic. Dependency Theory does sometimes refer to semi-peripheral nations, which are countries that have some characteristics of both core and periphery nations. But in this particular image, it only shows center and periphery, without any mention of semi-periphery.\n\nHence, based on the visual information provided, the best answer is D. Core nations exploit peripheral nations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
