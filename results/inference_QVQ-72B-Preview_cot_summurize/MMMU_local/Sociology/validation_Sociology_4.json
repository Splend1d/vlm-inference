                    "text": "So I've got this image here titled \"organic solidarity (modern)\" with nine circles, each containing a stick figure and various symbols. The text at the bottom says \"solidarity from inter-dependence.\" I'm supposed to choose what caused the shift from mechanical to this organic solidarity. The options are competition, the enlightenment, division of labor, or class consciousness.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what organic solidarity is. I recall that Emile Durkheim, a famous sociologist, talked about two types of solidarity: mechanical and organic. Mechanical solidarity is typical in traditional, homogeneous societies where people share similar jobs, beliefs, and ways of life. Organic solidarity, on the other hand, characterizes modern, more complex societies where individuals have specialized roles and rely on one another for various needs.\n\nSo, in organic solidarity, people are connected through their interdependence based on specialized functions, whereas in mechanical solidarity, people are similar and share common traits.\n\nNow, looking at the image, there are nine circles, each with a stick figure and symbols that represent different aspects or perhaps different groups in society. Let's see:\n\n- Top left: A figure with an anarchist symbol (A) and a spoon, maybe representing anarchists or those who believe in equal distribution of resources.\n\n- Top middle: A figure with a dollar sign and a comb, possibly symbolizing wealth or economic power combined with personal grooming or self-care.\n\n- Top right: A figure with an Om symbol (associated with Hinduism) and a rifle, perhaps indicating a religious group with a focus on defense or militarism.\n\n- Middle left: A figure with a crescent and star (Islam) and a hammer, maybe representing Islamic workers or laborers.\n\n- Center: A figure with a question mark and a spear, could symbolize confusion or uncertainty in society, perhaps newcomers or those without a clear identity.\n\n- Middle right: A figure with a Christian cross and a golf club, possibly indicating Christian leisure or elite status.\n\n- Bottom left: A figure with a Star of David (Judaism) and a wrench, maybe representing Jewish artisans or technicians.\n\n- Bottom middle: A figure with a peace symbol and a pair of scissors, perhaps symbolizing peace activists or those involved in cutting ties with destructive practices.\n\n- Bottom right: A figure with a Communist hammer and sickle and a fork, possibly representing communist farmers or those advocating for collective agriculture.\n\nThe connections between these figures are represented by lines, suggesting interdependence and cooperation among diverse groups.\n\nNow, the question is about what caused the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Competition: While competition is a factor in society, it's not primarily what causes the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity. In fact, in mechanical solidarity, competition might be less pronounced due to similarity in roles.\n\nB. The enlightenment: The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, individualism, and liberty. It contributed to the development of modern societies and the idea of individual rights and responsibilities. However, it's not directly the cause of the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity.\n\nC. Division of labor: This seems promising. Durkheim argued that as societies become more complex, labor specialization increases, leading to organic solidarity. People rely on others to provide goods and services they cannot produce themselves, fostering interdependence.\n\nD. Class consciousness: This relates more to Marxist theory, where class awareness and the conflict between different social classes drive historical change. While class consciousness is important in understanding social structures, it's not the primary cause of the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is C. Division of labor. This is because the specialization of roles and the resulting interdependence among individuals is a key characteristic of organic solidarity, distinguishing it from mechanical solidarity.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about how division of labor affects society. As jobs become more specialized, no single individual can produce everything they need on their own. For example, a farmer needs tools made by a manufacturer, who in turn needs materials mined by miners, and so on. This interdependence leads to a sense of solidarity based on mutual need and cooperation, which is the essence of organic solidarity.\n\nTherefore, the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity is primarily caused by the division of labor in society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Division of labor}} \\]"
