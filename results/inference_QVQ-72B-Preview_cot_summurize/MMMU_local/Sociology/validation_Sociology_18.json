                    "text": "So I'm looking at this book cover, and the title is \"Double-Consciousness and the Rhetoric of Barack Obama: The Price and Promise of Citizenship\" by Robert E. Terrill. The design is pretty minimalistic, with a beige background and the text divided by a vertical split down the middle, creating two different colored sections for the words \"Double-\" and \"Consciousness.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"double-consciousness\" means. I recall that this concept was introduced by W.E.B. Du Bois, a prominent African American scholar and activist. Du Bois wrote about double-consciousness in his book \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" where he described it as the feeling of being both an American and an African American, and the conflict that arises from trying to reconcile these two identities.\n\nSo, in the context of this book, it seems like the author is exploring how Barack Obama, as the first African American president of the United States, navigated these dual identities through his rhetoric. Obama is known for his ability to speak to diverse audiences and address issues of race in a way that resonates with many people.\n\nThe subtitle, \"The Price and Promise of Citizenship,\" suggests that the book delves into the costs and benefits of being a citizen, particularly for African Americans. It probably examines how Obama's rhetoric addressed the historical struggles for civil rights and the ongoing pursuit of equal citizenship in American society.\n\nRobert E. Terrill is likely a scholar in the field of rhetoric or political science, given the subject matter. I should look him up to get more background on his expertise and other works he might have written.\n\nNow, the question is asking me to identify which option best describes W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Says the organization of society (stratifications based on class, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.) and the changes in society can be explained by the conflicts inherent to social relations.\n\nThis sounds like a description of conflict theory in sociology, which focuses on the struggles between different social groups over resources and power. It's not specifically about double-consciousness.\n\nB. Is the economic system that is directed at earning a profit for a few, selling the profits to many people, and keeping workers' wages low in order to increase profits.\n\nThis seems to be describing capitalism or some form of exploitative economic system. Again, not directly related to double-consciousness.\n\nC. Is a theory that focuses on the social structures that shape society as a whole. It sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to maintain stability and to promote solidarity.\n\nThis resembles structural functionalism in sociology, which emphasizes how different parts of society contribute to overall stability and functioning. Not the right fit for double-consciousness.\n\nD. Refers to the particular experience of African Americans in which they are forced to see themselves as citizens who are never able to escape identification based on the color of their skin.\n\nThis definition aligns closely with Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness. It captures the idea that African Americans have to navigate two distinct identities: one as an American and another as an African American, often experiencing a sense of divided self-awareness due to racial prejudice and discrimination.\n\nGiven these options, D is the correct choice. It directly refers to the experience of African Americans having to reconcile their dual identities within American society, which is the essence of double-consciousness as described by Du Bois.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check each option quickly:\n\nA. Conflict theory in sociology \u2013 not specific to double-consciousness.\n\nB. Description of an economic system \u2013 unrelated to the concept.\n\nC. Structural functionalism \u2013 general theory about society, not about double-consciousness.\n\nD. Explicitly about the experience of African Americans and their dual identity \u2013 matches the definition of double-consciousness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
