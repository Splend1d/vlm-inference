The first figure is wearing a blue helmet and a press vest, holding a camera. The second is a woman with blonde hair, holding a clipboard. The third is a man in a suit with a tie, looking a bit concerned. Okay, so the concept here seems to be about value-neutrality, probably in the context of reporting or journalism, given the press vest.\n\nNow, value-neutrality is a principle that suggests objectivity and impartiality in reporting facts, without letting personal values or biases influence the information presented. So, in journalism, it's important for reporters to present facts fairly and balanced, without showing favoritism towards any particular viewpoint.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Obesity in children is obviously a result of parental neglect and, therefore, schools should take a greater role to prevent it.\n\nThis statement seems to place blame on parents for children's obesity and suggests that schools should do more to prevent it. It's making a judgmental claim about the causes of obesity and proposing a solution. This doesn't sound neutral because it's assigning responsibility and recommending a specific course of action.\n\nB. In 2003, states like Arkansas adopted laws requiring elementary schools to remove soft drink vending machines from schools.\n\nThis statement is factual, providing information about a specific action taken by some states in 2003 regarding vending machines in schools. It doesn't express an opinion about whether this was a good or bad move; it's just stating what happened. This seems pretty neutral.\n\nC. Merely restricting children's access to junk food at school is not enough to prevent obesity.\n\nThis statement is offering an opinion that restricting junk food in schools isn't sufficient to tackle obesity. It's implying that more needs to be done, but it doesn't specify what else should be done. It's making a judgment about the effectiveness of a particular measure, which could be seen as not entirely neutral because it's evaluating the sufficiency of the measure.\n\nD. Physical activity and healthy eating are a fundamental part of a child's education.\n\nThis statement is asserting that physical activity and healthy eating are essential components of a child's education. It's presenting these elements as positive and important, but it's not necessarily taking a side or imposing a particular value beyond the general acceptance that health is important.\n\nGiven these options, the one that best illustrates the concept of value-neutrality is option B. It's simply stating a fact without expressing an opinion or making a judgment about the action taken. The other options involve some level of interpretation or judgment, whereas option B is straightforward and objective.\n\nI think that's the answer: option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
