                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph that shows aggregate demand, which is consumption (C), plotted against output or income (Y). The line starts at 10 on the consumption axis when output is zero and rises to 40 on the consumption axis when output is 50. So, it's a straight line with a positive slope.\n\nThe question is about a consumption function and how the consumption line C changes if (1) a rises or (2) b rises. I think here, a and b are parameters of the consumption function. Usually, the consumption function is written as C = a + bY, where a is autonomous consumption (consumption when income is zero), and b is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the slope of the consumption function.\n\nGiven that, let's see what happens to the consumption line when:\n\n1. a rises\n\n2. b rises\n\nFirst, if a rises, that means autonomous consumption increases. Since a is the intercept on the consumption axis, an increase in a would shift the entire consumption line upwards without changing its slope. So, the line would shift up, but its steepness would remain the same.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. C shifts upwards.\n\nB. (1) C shifts downwards. (2) C gets gentler.\n\nC. (1) C gets steeper. (2) C gets gentler.\n\nD. (1) C shifts downwards. (2) C gets steeper.\n\nOption A suggests that C shifts upwards, which matches what I just thought about an increase in a.\n\nNow, what happens if b rises? b is the MPC, which is the slope of the consumption function. If b increases, the slope of the consumption line becomes steeper. So, the line becomes steeper, meaning for each unit increase in income, consumption increases by a larger amount.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption B says (1) C shifts downwards. But I think it should shift upwards when a rises. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says (1) C gets steeper. But no, an increase in a should shift the line upwards without changing the slope. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says (1) C shifts downwards. Again, that contradicts what I think happens when a rises.\n\nSo, option A seems to be correct for part (1), but I need to consider part (2) as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the question. It says: \"what happens to the consumption-line C in graph 1 if (1) a rises; (2) b rises?\"\n\nI need to answer separately for each case.\n\nFor (1) a rises:\n\nAs I thought, C shifts upwards.\n\nFor (2) b rises:\n\nThe slope of C becomes steeper.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them directly say \"for (1) C shifts upwards and for (2) C gets steeper.\"\n\nOption A only says \"C shifts upwards,\" which is incomplete.\n\nOption B says \"(1) C shifts downwards; (2) C gets gentler,\" which is incorrect.\n\nOption C says \"(1) C gets steeper; (2) C gets gentler,\" which is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says \"(1) C shifts downwards; (2) C gets steeper,\" which is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nLet me look again.\n\nThe question is: \"what happens to the consumption-line C in graph 1 if (1) a rises; (2) b rises?\"\n\nAnd it provides four options, each with two parts corresponding to (1) and (2).\n\nFrom my understanding:\n\n(1) If a rises, the consumption line shifts upwards.\n\n(2) If b rises, the consumption line becomes steeper.\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this.\n\nOption A just says \"C shifts upwards,\" which is only part of the answer.\n\nOption B says \"(1) C shifts downwards; (2) C gets gentler,\" which is the opposite of what I think is correct.\n\nOption C says \"(1) C gets steeper; (2) C gets gentler,\" again, not matching my understanding.\n\nOption D says \"(1) C shifts downwards; (2) C gets steeper,\" which is also incorrect.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, maybe the options are not paired in the way I thought. Let's read them again carefully.\n\nOption A: \"C shifts upwards.\"\n\nOption B: \"(1) C shifts downwards. (2) C gets gentler.\"\n\nOption C: \"(1) C gets steeper. (2) C gets gentler.\"\n\nOption D: \"(1) C shifts downwards. (2) C gets steeper.\"\n\nIt seems that options B, C, and D are pairing (1) and (2) together, while option A is only stating one part.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question expects a single option that covers both (1) and (2), but none of the options present that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to identify what happens in each case separately.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n(1) When a rises, C shifts upwards.\n\n(2) When b rises, C gets steeper.\n\nBut again, none of the options present this directly.\n\nWait, perhaps option A is intended to be \"(1) C shifts upwards,\" and the other options are alternative scenarios.\n\nBut it's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to select the correct statement among the options, and option A is the only correct one for (1), even if it doesn't cover (2).\n\nBut that seems incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to choose multiple correct options, but the instruction says \"what happens to the consumption-line C in graph 1 if (1) a rises; (2) b rises?\" and then lists options without clear indicators.\n\nThis is puzzling. Maybe I need to consider that the options are not correctly formatted or there's a misunderstanding in the way they are presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing understanding of the consumption function and its graphical representation.\n\nLet me try to rephrase my understanding.\n\nThe consumption function is C = a + bY, where:\n\n- a is autonomous consumption (consumption when income is zero)\n\n- b is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the slope of the consumption function\n\nIf a increases, the consumption line shifts upwards, meaning that at any given level of income, consumption is higher.\n\nIf b increases, the slope of the consumption line becomes steeper, meaning that consumption increases more for each additional unit of income.\n\nGiven that, the correct descriptions would be:\n\n- For (1) a rises: C shifts upwards\n\n- For (2) b rises: C gets steeper\n\nBut none of the options present both of these correctly.\n\nOption A: \"C shifts upwards,\" which is correct for (1) but doesn't address (2).\n\nOptions B, C, D: These options pair both (1) and (2) together with incorrect descriptions.\n\nPerhaps the question is to select the correct description for both (1) and (2), but the options are presented in a confusing way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to select the option that correctly describes what happens in both cases, and since none of the options present both correctly, perhaps there is an error in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is option A, as it correctly describes what happens when a rises, even if it doesn't cover what happens when b rises.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to select the option that correctly describes what happens in either case, and option A is the only correct description among the options.\n\nThis is quite confusing. Maybe I should just go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
