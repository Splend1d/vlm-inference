                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem. So, we have a situation where the demand and supply of basketball tickets at a college are determined by the market. There's a table provided that shows the quantity demanded and quantity supplied at different prices. Then, the college plans to increase its total enrollment by 5,000 students, and these new students have their own demand schedule for tickets. We need to find the new equilibrium quantity after adding these new students.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial situation. Looking at the table:\n\n- At $4, quantity demanded is 10,000 tickets, and quantity supplied is 8,000 tickets.\n\n- At $8, quantity demanded is 8,000, and quantity supplied is 8,000.\n\n- At $12, quantity demanded is 6,000, and quantity supplied is 8,000.\n\n- At $16, quantity demanded is 4,000, and quantity supplied is 8,000.\n\n- At $20, quantity demanded is 2,000, and quantity supplied is 8,000.\n\nFrom this, it seems like at $8, the quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, which should be the equilibrium price, with an equilibrium quantity of 8,000 tickets.\n\nNow, with the addition of 5,000 new students, their demand schedule is given separately:\n\n- At $4, 4,000 tickets\n\n- At $8, 3,000\n\n- At $12, 2,000\n\n- At $16, 1,000\n\n- At $20, 0\n\nWe need to add this new demand to the existing demand to find the new total demand schedule, and then determine the new equilibrium quantity.\n\nSo, for each price, the new total quantity demanded will be the sum of the original quantity demanded and the quantity demanded by the new students.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nAt $4:\n\nOriginal demand: 10,000\n\nNew students' demand: 4,000\n\nTotal demand: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000\n\nAt $8:\n\nOriginal demand: 8,000\n\nNew students' demand: 3,000\n\nTotal demand: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000\n\nAt $12:\n\nOriginal demand: 6,000\n\nNew students' demand: 2,000\n\nTotal demand: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000\n\nAt $16:\n\nOriginal demand: 4,000\n\nNew students' demand: 1,000\n\nTotal demand: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000\n\nAt $20:\n\nOriginal demand: 2,000\n\nNew students' demand: 0\n\nTotal demand: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000\n\nNow, we have the new demand schedule:\n\n- $4: 14,000\n\n- $8: 11,000\n\n- $12: 8,000\n\n- $16: 5,000\n\n- $20: 2,000\n\nThe supply schedule remains the same, with a constant quantity supplied of 8,000 tickets at these prices.\n\nSo, to find the new equilibrium, we need to find the price where the new quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nLooking at the new demand:\n\nAt $12, quantity demanded is 8,000, which matches the quantity supplied.\n\nSo, the new equilibrium price is $12, and the equilibrium quantity is 8,000 tickets.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nAt $12, original demand was 6,000, new students' demand is 2,000, total demand is 8,000, which matches the supply of 8,000. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, at $8, total demand is 11,000, which is greater than supply of 8,000, so there would be a shortage, pushing the price up.\n\nAt $16, total demand is 5,000, which is less than supply of 8,000, so there would be a surplus, pushing the price down.\n\nTherefore, $12 seems to be the new equilibrium price with quantity 8,000.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6000\n\nB. 7000\n\nC. 8000\n\nD. 9000\n\nThe answer is C. 8000.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't a miscalculation.\n\nOriginal demand:\n\nPrice | Quantity Demanded | Quantity Supplied\n\n$4 | 10,000 | 8,000\n\n$8 | 8,000 | 8,000\n\n$12 | 6,000 | 8,000\n\n$16 | 4,000 | 8,000\n\n$20 | 2,000 | 8,000\n\nNew students' demand:\n\nPrice | Quantity Demanded\n\n$4 | 4,000\n\n$8 | 3,000\n\n$12 | 2,000\n\n$16 | 1,000\n\n$20 | 0\n\nTotal demand:\n\nPrice | Original | New Students | Total\n\n$4 | 10,000 | 4,000 | 14,000\n\n$8 | 8,000 | 3,000 | 11,000\n\n$12 | 6,000 | 2,000 | 8,000\n\n$16 | 4,000 | 1,000 | 5,000\n\n$20 | 2,000 | 0 | 2,000\n\nSupply is constant at 8,000.\n\nSo, at $12, total demand equals supply at 8,000.\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium quantity is 8,000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
