                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem. So, we've got a table that shows the price per frisbee, the quantity demanded, and the quantity supplied at different prices. The prices listed are $11 down to $6, and for each price, there's a corresponding quantity demanded and supplied, measured in millions of frisbees.\n\nFirst, I need to find the equilibrium price. Equilibrium is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. Looking at the table:\n\n- At $11: Quantity Demanded = 1 million, Quantity Supplied = 15 million\n\n- At $10: Quantity Demanded = 2 million, Quantity Supplied = 12 million\n\n- At $9: Quantity Demanded = 4 million, Quantity Supplied = 9 million\n\n- At $8: Quantity Demanded = 6 million, Quantity Supplied = 6 million\n\n- At $7: Quantity Demanded = 8 million, Quantity Supplied = 3 million\n\n- At $6: Quantity Demanded = 10 million, Quantity Supplied = 1 million\n\nSo, at $8, both quantity demanded and quantity supplied are 6 million frisbees. That sounds like the equilibrium price.\n\nNow, the government is imposing a price floor that's $2 above the equilibrium price. So, the price floor would be $8 + $2 = $10.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the price floor is actually effective. In economics, a price floor is effective only if it's set above the equilibrium price. Since $10 is indeed above $8, this price floor will be binding.\n\nAt this new price of $10, the quantity supplied is 12 million frisbees, and the quantity demanded is 2 million frisbees. So, there's a surplus of frisbees in the market because supply exceeds demand.\n\nBut the question is asking for the new market price after the price floor is imposed. Since the price floor is set at $10, and it's binding, the market price will be at least $10. However, in the presence of a surplus, the price might tend to drop, but because of the price floor, it can't go below $10.\n\nTherefore, the new market price will be $10.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 10\n\nD. 11\n\nThe correct answer is C. 10.\n\nI think that makes sense. But let me double-check.\n\nEquilibrium price is $8, price floor is set at $2 above, which is $10. At $10, quantity supplied is higher than quantity demanded, creating a surplus. But because the price floor is binding, the price remains at $10.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait a minute, the question says that Congress votes to impose a price floor $2 above the equilibrium price. So, equilibrium price is $8, plus $2 makes $10. That's straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the price.\n\nThe problem mentions that frisbee manufacturers persuaded the government that frisbee production is important for national security, which led to the price floor. But that doesn't directly affect the price; it just explains why the price floor was imposed.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the new market price should be $10.\n\nI think the answer is C. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
