                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this table that shows the breakdown of GDP for China, and it lists a few categories with their amounts in billions. The categories are Consumption, Investment, Government Expenditure, Exports, and Imports. The amounts are:\n\n- Consumption: 1700\n\n- Investment: 700\n\n- Government Expenditure: 100\n\n- Exports: 50\n\n- Imports: 40\n\nAnd the question is asking me to calculate GDP using the expenditure approach. Okay, so I need to remember what the expenditure approach is. From what I recall, the expenditure approach to calculating GDP involves adding up all the spending on final goods and services produced in a country during a specific period. The formula should be something like:\n\nGDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Expenditure + Net Exports\n\nNet Exports is usually Exports minus Imports. So, GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the numbers I have:\n\nC = 1700\n\nI = 700\n\nG = 100\n\nX = 50\n\nM = 40\n\nSo, Net Exports = X - M = 50 - 40 = 10\n\nTherefore, GDP = 1700 + 700 + 100 + 10\n\nLet me add those up step by step.\n\nFirst, 1700 + 700 = 2400\n\nThen, 2400 + 100 = 2500\n\nFinally, 2500 + 10 = 2510\n\nSo, my calculation gives me 2510.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 2510\n\nB. 2500\n\nC. 2410\n\nIt seems like option A is 2510, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the net exports calculation:\n\nExports are 50, imports are 40, so 50 - 40 is indeed 10.\n\nThen, adding up:\n\nConsumption: 1700\n\nInvestment: 700 \u2192 total so far: 1700 + 700 = 2400\n\nAdd Government Expenditure: 100 \u2192 2400 + 100 = 2500\n\nAdd Net Exports: 10 \u2192 2500 + 10 = 2510\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the answer should be A. 2510.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's any other way to interpret the data. Is there any chance that some of these categories might overlap or have been double-counted? For example, does Government Expenditure include imports? Probably not, as imports are separately accounted for.\n\nAlso, Consumption should be domestic consumption of goods and services, which wouldn't include imports directly, right? But Imports are subtracted in the Net Exports calculation, which makes sense because they represent leakage from the domestic economy.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the formula again:\n\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n1700 + 700 + 100 + (50 - 40) = 1700 + 700 + 100 + 10 = 2510\n\nYes, I can't see any error in this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 2510.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2510} \\]"
