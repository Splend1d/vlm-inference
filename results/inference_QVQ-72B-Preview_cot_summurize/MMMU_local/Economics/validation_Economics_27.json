                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have this table with years and prices for apples and textbooks in Japan for three years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. The prices are given in Japanese yen, I assume, since it's based in Japan. The question is asking for the CPI in 2015, given that the base year is 2015.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CPI stands for. CPI is the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. It's a key measure of inflation.\n\nThe formula to calculate the CPI for any given year is:\n\nCPI = (Price of the market basket in the current year / Price of the market basket in the base year) * 100\n\nBut since the base year is 2015, the CPI in the base year should be 100, because it's comparing itself to itself.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I understand the data correctly. The table seems to be formatted a bit strangely, but from what I can see, it lists the year, the price of apples, and the price of textbooks for each year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 2014: Price of Apples = \\$1.40, Price of Textbooks = 200\n\n- 2015: Price of Apples = \\$1.10, Price of Textbooks = 140\n\n- 2016: Price of Apples = \\$1.10, Price of Textbooks = 200\n\nBut hold on, the prices are mixed with some symbols that might be formatting errors. It looks like the prices are in dollars for apples and maybe yen for textbooks, but that seems inconsistent. Maybe everything is in yen, and the dollar sign is a mistake.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the market consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks. So, I need to calculate the total cost of this basket in each year.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the currency. Since the market is based in Japan, it's likely that the prices are in Japanese yen. So, I'll assume that the prices are in yen, and the dollar signs are typos.\n\nSo, correcting the table:\n\n- 2014: Price of Apples = 1.40 yen each, Price of Textbooks = 200 yen each\n\n- 2015: Price of Apples = 1.10 yen each, Price of Textbooks = 140 yen each\n\n- 2016: Price of Apples = 1.10 yen each, Price of Textbooks = 200 yen each\n\nNow, the market consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks. So, for each year, I need to calculate the total cost of this basket.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost for 2014:\n\nTotal cost in 2014 = (Price of Apples in 2014 * Quantity of Apples) + (Price of Textbooks in 2014 * Quantity of Textbooks)\n\n= (1.40 * 200) + (200 * 290)\n\n= (280) + (58,000)\n\n= 58,280 yen\n\nNow, for 2015:\n\nTotal cost in 2015 = (1.10 * 200) + (140 * 290)\n\n= (220) + (40,600)\n\n= 40,820 yen\n\nAnd for 2016:\n\nTotal cost in 2016 = (1.10 * 200) + (200 * 290)\n\n= (220) + (58,000)\n\n= 58,220 yen\n\nNow, the formula for CPI is:\n\nCPI_current_year = (Total cost in current year / Total cost in base year) * 100\n\nSince the base year is 2015, we need to calculate the CPI for 2015 using this formula.\n\nCPI_2015 = (Total cost in 2015 / Total cost in 2015) * 100\n\n= (40,820 / 40,820) * 100\n\n= 1 * 100\n\n= 100\n\nSo, the CPI in 2015 is 100.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the total cost calculations:\n\n2014: 1.40 * 200 = 280; 200 * 290 = 58,000; total 58,280\n\n2015: 1.10 * 200 = 220; 140 * 290 = 40,600; total 40,820\n\n2016: 1.10 * 200 = 220; 200 * 290 = 58,000; total 58,220\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, applying the CPI formula for 2015:\n\nCPI = (current year's total cost / base year's total cost) * 100\n\nSince 2015 is the base year, it's (40,820 / 40,820) * 100 = 100\n\nSo, the CPI in 2015 is 100.\n\nWait a minute, the question might be trying to ask for something else. Let's read it again carefully.\n\n\"Assume that the base year is 2015. What is CPI in 2015?\"\n\nGiven that, and using the formula, CPI in the base year is always 100 by definition. So, the answer should be 100.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here, or perhaps the question has some misdirection.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the market consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks, and we need to consider quantities in the basket.\n\nBut according to standard CPI calculation, the quantities are fixed in the basket, and we calculate the cost of that basket in each year.\n\nIn the base year, the CPI is always 100, because you're dividing the current year's cost by the base year's cost and multiplying by 100.\n\nSo, unless there's something unusual, the answer should be 100.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 100} \\]"
