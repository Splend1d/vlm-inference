                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got this table here that shows the quantities and prices of different fruits over several years: 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. The fruits listed are apples, bananas, grapes, and raspberries. For each year, I need to calculate the total amount spent on this \"basket\" of fruits using the quantities given in column 2 and the prices for each year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"basket\" of fruits means in this context. It probably refers to a fixed quantity of each fruit, and I have to calculate the total cost of this set of quantities each year based on the prices at that time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Apples: quantity 10\n\n- Bananas: quantity 12\n\n- Grapes: quantity 2\n\n- Raspberries: quantity 1\n\nSo, the basket consists of 10 apples, 12 bananas, 2 grapes, and 1 raspberry.\n\nNow, for each year, I need to multiply the quantity of each fruit by its price in that year and then sum up the totals.\n\nLet's start with 2001:\n\n- Apples: 10 * $0.50\n\n- Bananas: 12 * $0.20\n\n- Grapes: 2 * $0.65\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * $2.00\n\nCalculating each:\n\n- Apples: 10 * 0.50 = $5.00\n\n- Bananas: 12 * 0.20 = $2.40\n\n- Grapes: 2 * 0.65 = $1.30\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * 2.00 = $2.00\n\nTotal for 2001: 5.00 + 2.40 + 1.30 + 2.00 = $10.70\n\nOkay, that matches with option A and D for 2001.\n\nNext, 2002:\n\n- Apples: 10 * $0.75\n\n- Bananas: 12 * $0.25\n\n- Grapes: 2 * $0.70\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * $1.90\n\nCalculating each:\n\n- Apples: 10 * 0.75 = $7.50\n\n- Bananas: 12 * 0.25 = $3.00\n\n- Grapes: 2 * 0.70 = $1.40\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * 1.90 = $1.90\n\nTotal for 2002: 7.50 + 3.00 + 1.40 + 1.90 = $13.80\n\nLooking back at the options, both A and C have $13.80 for 2002.\n\nNow, 2003:\n\n- Apples: 10 * $0.85\n\n- Bananas: 12 * $0.25\n\n- Grapes: 2 * $0.90\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * $2.05\n\nCalculating each:\n\n- Apples: 10 * 0.85 = $8.50\n\n- Bananas: 12 * 0.25 = $3.00\n\n- Grapes: 2 * 0.90 = $1.80\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * 2.05 = $2.05\n\nTotal for 2003: 8.50 + 3.00 + 1.80 + 2.05 = $15.35\n\nOption A has $15.35 for 2003, while option C also has $15.35.\n\nFinally, 2004:\n\n- Apples: 10 * $0.88\n\n- Bananas: 12 * $0.29\n\n- Grapes: 2 * $0.95\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * $2.13\n\nCalculating each:\n\n- Apples: 10 * 0.88 = $8.80\n\n- Bananas: 12 * 0.29 = $3.48\n\n- Grapes: 2 * 0.95 = $1.90\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * 2.13 = $2.13\n\nTotal for 2004: 8.80 + 3.48 + 1.90 + 2.13 = $16.31\n\nAgain, option A has $16.31 for 2004.\n\nWait a minute, option C also has $16.31 for 2004. So, both A and C match up to 2004.\n\nBut option B has different numbers, and option D has $19.31 for 2004, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both seem to match my calculations for all years.\n\nWait, but in the question, option A is:\n\nA. 2001:$10.70; 2002:$13.80; 2003:$15.35; 2004:$16.31\n\nOption C is:\n\nC. 2001:$10.80; 2002:$13.80; 2003:$15.35; 2004:$16.31\n\nHmm, the only difference is in 2001, where option A has $10.70 and option C has $10.80.\n\nBut according to my calculation, it should be $10.70, not $10.80.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\n2001:\n\n- Apples: 10 * 0.50 = 5.00\n\n- Bananas: 12 * 0.20 = 2.40\n\n- Grapes: 2 * 0.65 = 1.30\n\n- Raspberries: 1 * 2.00 = 2.00\n\nTotal: 5.00 + 2.40 = 7.40; plus 1.30 = 8.70; plus 2.00 = 10.70.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nOption A matches my calculation, while option C has $10.80 for 2001, which doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps there's a typo in option C, or I might have misread the table.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nTable 9.4\n\n| Items     | Qty | (2001) Price | (2001) Amount Spent | (2002) Price | (2002) Amount Spent | (2003) Price | (2003) Amount Spent | (2004) Price |\n\n|-----------|-----|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|\n\n| Apples    | 10  | $0.50        |                     | $0.75        |                     | $0.85        |                     | $0.88        |\n\n| Bananas   | 12  | $0.20        |                     | $0.25        |                     | $0.25        |                     | $0.29        |\n\n| Grapes    | 2   | $0.65        |                     | $0.70        |                     | $0.90        |                     | $0.95        |\n\n| Raspberries | 1 | $2.00        |                     | $1.90        |                     | $2.05        |                     | $2.13        |\n\n| Total     |     |              |                     |              |                     |              |                     |              |\n\nWait a second, in the table, there are columns for (2001) Amount Spent, (2002) Amount Spent, etc., but they are empty. So, I need to calculate these amounts based on the quantities and the prices for each year.\n\nGiven that, my calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nBut the question says:\n\n\"What is the amount spent each year on the \"basket\" of fruit with the quantities shown in column 2?\"\n\nAnd the options are listed as A, B, C, D.\n\nGiven that my calculations match option A for all years except 2004, where option A has $16.31 and option C has the same, but option C has $10.80 in 2001, which doesn't match my calculation, I conclude that option A is the correct one.\n\nMaybe there's a typo in option C, or perhaps I misread the table.\n\nDouble-checking the prices:\n\n2001:\n\n- Apples: $0.50\n\n- Bananas: $0.20\n\n- Grapes: $0.65\n\n- Raspberries: $2.00\n\nQuantities:\n\n- Apples: 10\n\n- Bananas: 12\n\n- Grapes: 2\n\n- Raspberries: 1\n\nTotal:\n\n(10 * 0.50) + (12 * 0.20) + (2 * 0.65) + (1 * 2.00) = 5.00 + 2.40 + 1.30 + 2.00 = 10.70\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for other years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
