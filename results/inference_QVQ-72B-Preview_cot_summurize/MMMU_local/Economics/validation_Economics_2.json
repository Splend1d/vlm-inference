                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph about the gasoline market, and it shows the demand and supply curves for gasoline. The x-axis is the quantity of gasoline in millions of gallons, and the y-axis is the price per gallon in dollars. There's a point labeled \"E\" which I assume is the equilibrium point where demand and supply meet.\n\nFrom the graph, the equilibrium price seems to be around $1.40 per gallon, and the equilibrium quantity is about 600 million gallons. Now, the question is about what would happen if the government sets a price cap at $1.30 per gallon, which is below the equilibrium price.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus.\n\nB. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\nC. Not certain.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when the price is set below the equilibrium price. At the equilibrium price, the amount that buyers want to buy is equal to the amount sellers want to sell. If the price is set lower than that, the quantity demanded would be higher than the quantity supplied because the price is attractive to buyers but less so to sellers.\n\nSo, at a price of $1.30, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40, I would expect that consumers would want to buy more gasoline than producers are willing to sell at that price. This situation is called a shortage.\n\nLet me look at the graph to confirm this. At $1.30, the demand curve shows that consumers would want to buy around 700 million gallons, while the supply curve shows that producers would only supply around 500 million gallons at that price. So, yes, quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied, which confirms a shortage.\n\nOption A says that a price below 1.30 would cause excess demand and hence a surplus. That doesn't make sense because excess demand means that quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, which is a shortage, not a surplus.\n\nOption B says that a price below 1.30 would cause excess demand and hence a shortage. This seems correct based on my understanding and the graph.\n\nOption C is \"not certain,\" but I think I can be certain based on the economic principles of supply and demand.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider what would happen if the price was above the equilibrium price. For example, at $1.80, the quantity supplied would be around 700 million gallons, and quantity demanded would be around 500 million gallons. In this case, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, leading to a surplus.\n\nSo, yes, below equilibrium price leads to shortage, and above leads to surplus.\n\nTherefore, setting a price cap at $1.30, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40, would lead to a shortage.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"a price below that of 1.30 dollars,\" but in the graph, the equilibrium price is around $1.40. So, if the price is set at $1.30, which is below the equilibrium, it should indeed cause a shortage.\n\nBut the options are phrased a bit strangely. Option A says \"a price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus.\" But that contradicts basic supply and demand theory. A price below equilibrium leads to excess demand and hence a shortage, not a surplus.\n\nOption B correctly states that a price below 1.30 would cause excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be Option B.\n\nI think the confusion might come from misremembering whether a surplus or a shortage occurs when price is set below equilibrium. But based on the graph and economic theory, it's clear that setting the price below equilibrium leads to a shortage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
