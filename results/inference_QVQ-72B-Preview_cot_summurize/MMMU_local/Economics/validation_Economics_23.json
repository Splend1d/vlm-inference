                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a balance sheet for TD, which is a bank, and we're supposed to figure out how a $700 deposit affects the M1 money supply, assuming TD keeps only the required reserves. The options are A. $4118, B. $3418, C. $700, and D. $5118.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's on the balance sheet. There are assets and liabilities. Assets include reserves and loans, while liabilities include deposits. Specifically, reserves are $493, deposits are $2900, and loans are $2407. I assume these numbers are in millions or billions, but the unit doesn't matter for the calculation.\n\nNow, someone deposits $700, and we need to find the total change in the M1 money supply. M1 typically includes cash and demand deposits that can be easily accessed.\n\nSince TD keeps only the required reserves, it means it's holding the minimum amount of reserves required by the central bank or regulatory authority.\n\nWhen a new deposit comes in, the bank has to set aside a certain percentage as required reserves and can lend out the rest.\n\nSo, if someone deposits $700, the bank adds $700 to its deposits and also adds $700 to its reserves, right? Wait, no. When someone deposits money, the bank's reserves increase by the amount deposited, but the deposits also increase by the same amount.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be careful here. When a deposit is made, the bank's reserves increase by the amount deposited, and its deposits increase by the same amount.\n\nBut since the bank is keeping only required reserves, it will lend out the excess reserves.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the required reserve ratio. Since it's not provided, I need to figure out what it is based on the initial balance sheet.\n\nFrom the initial balance sheet:\n\nDeposits = $2900\n\nReserves = $493\n\nLoans = $2407\n\nAssuming that the required reserves are equal to the required reserve ratio times deposits.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the required reserve ratio as r.\n\nSo, required reserves = r * $2900\n\nGiven that the bank is holding only required reserves, actual reserves = required reserves.\n\nTherefore, $493 = r * $2900\n\nFrom this, r = $493 / $2900\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nr = 493 \u00f7 2900 \u2248 0.1699, or about 17%.\n\nSo, the required reserve ratio is approximately 17%.\n\nNow, when a new deposit of $700 comes in, the bank's reserves increase by $700, but its deposits also increase by $700.\n\nSo, the required reserves increase by r * $700 = 0.17 * $700 \u2248 $119\n\nTherefore, the bank's reserves increase by $700, but the required reserves increase by only $119.\n\nThis means the bank has excess reserves of $700 - $119 = $581.\n\nThe bank can lend out this excess reserves of $581.\n\nWhen the bank makes a loan of $581, this money is typically deposited into another account, increasing deposits and reserves in the banking system.\n\nThis sets off a money multiplier effect.\n\nThe money multiplier is 1 / r, where r is the required reserve ratio.\n\nWe have r \u2248 0.17, so money multiplier \u2248 1 / 0.17 \u2248 5.882\n\nTherefore, the total increase in the money supply should be approximately 5.882 * $700 \u2248 $4117.4, which rounds to $4118.\n\nSo, option A. $4118 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure.\n\nFirst, calculate the money multiplier:\n\n1 / 0.17 = approximately 5.882\n\nThen, multiply by the initial deposit:\n\n5.882 * $700 = approximately $4117.4, which rounds to $4118.\n\nBut let's double-check the required reserve ratio calculation.\n\nInitial reserves = $493\n\nInitial deposits = $2900\n\nSo, r = $493 / $2900 \u2248 0.1699, or 17%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, when $700 is deposited, required reserves increase by 0.17 * $700 = $119\n\nSo, excess reserves = $700 - $119 = $581\n\nThe bank lends out $581, which is then deposited elsewhere, increasing reserves in the system by $581.\n\nThis process repeats, with each bank lending out its excess reserves, leading to a multiplied increase in the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the total change in the money supply is the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier.\n\nSo, $700 * (1 / 0.17) = $700 * 5.882 \u2248 $4117.4, which rounds to $4118.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. $4118.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs M1 only composed of cash and demand deposits? Yes, typically.\n\nSo, when the bank makes a loan, that money is deposited into another account, increasing demand deposits, which are part of M1.\n\nTherefore, the money supply increases by the amount of the loan, which is $581, but then this sets off the multiplier effect.\n\nWait, but in the money multiplier formula, the initial deposit is the amount that sets off the multiplier, which is $700, and the multiplier is 1 / r.\n\nSo, total change in money supply = initial deposit * (1 / r) = $700 * (1 / 0.17) \u2248 $700 * 5.882 \u2248 $4117.4, which rounds to $4118.\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nBut let's check the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption B. $3418\n\nThat might be a miscalculation. Perhaps someone added the initial deposit to the initial reserves or something like that.\n\nOption C. $700\n\nThat would be the initial deposit, but we know that with the money multiplier, the total change should be larger.\n\nOption D. $5118\n\nThat might be $4118 + $1000, but I don't see a reason for that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. $4118.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 4118} \\]"
