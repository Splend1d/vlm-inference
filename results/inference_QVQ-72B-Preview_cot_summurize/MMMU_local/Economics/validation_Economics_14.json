                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem. So, we have a market for basketball tickets at a college, and the demand and supply are determined by market forces. There's a table provided that shows the quantity demanded and quantity supplied at different prices. Then, the college plans to increase its total enrollment by 5,000 students, and these new students have their own demand schedule for tickets. We need to find the new equilibrium price after adding these new students.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial situation. The table shows prices ranging from \\$4 to \\$20, with corresponding quantities demanded and supplied. For example, at \\$4, 10,000 tickets are demanded and 8,000 are supplied. At \\$8, demand drops to 8,000 and supply remains at 8,000. This seems like the current equilibrium price since quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.\n\nWait, but looking closely, at \\$4, Qd=10,000 and Qs=8,000, so there's excess demand. At \\$8, Qd=8,000 and Qs=8,000, which balances out. At higher prices, Qd decreases further while Qs stays at 8,000. So, yes, the current equilibrium price is \\$8.\n\nNow, the college is adding 5,000 new students, and these new students have their own demand schedule. The problem asks me to add the old demand schedule and the new students' demand schedule to get the new total demand schedule for the entire college.\n\nLet me look at the new students' demand schedule:\n\n- At \\$4: 4,000 tickets\n\n- At \\$8: 3,000\n\n- At \\$12: 2,000\n\n- At \\$16: 1,000\n\n- At \\$20: 0\n\nSo, for each price, I need to add the quantity demanded by the existing students and the quantity demanded by the new students.\n\nFirst, I need to find the existing students' demand schedule. From the initial table, we have:\n\n- At \\$4: 10,000 tickets\n\n- At \\$8: 8,000\n\n- At \\$12: 6,000\n\n- At \\$16: 4,000\n\n- At \\$20: 2,000\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, under \"Price Quantity Demanded,\" it shows:\n\nTable:![Picture 2]\n\n\n\nBut earlier, it says \"the demand and supply schedules are as follows:\" with a table that includes both Qd and Qs. There might be some confusion here. Let me check the images again.\n\nLooking back, the first image shows:\n\n| Price | Quantity Demanded | Quantity Supplied |\n\n|-------|------------------|------------------|\n\n| \\$4 | 10000 tickets | 8000 tickets |\n\n| \\$8 | 8000 | 8000 |\n\n| \\$12 | 6000 | 8000 |\n\n| \\$16 | 4000 | 8000 |\n\n| \\$20 | 2000 | 8000 |\n\nAnd the second image shows:\n\n| Price | Quantity Demanded |\n\n|-------|------------------|\n\n| \\$4 | 4,000 tickets |\n\n| \\$8 | 3,000 |\n\n| \\$12 | 2,000 |\n\n| \\$16 | 1,000 |\n\n| \\$20 | 0 |\n\nSo, the initial demand schedule is the first table's Qd column, and the new students' demand is the second table's Qd column.\n\nTo find the new total demand, I need to add these two schedules at each price level.\n\nFor example, at \\$4:\n\nExisting demand: 10,000\n\nNew students' demand: 4,000\n\nTotal demand: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000\n\nSimilarly:\n\nAt \\$8: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000\n\nAt \\$12: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000\n\nAt \\$16: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000\n\nAt \\$20: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000\n\nSo, the new demand schedule is:\n\n- \\$4: 14,000\n\n- \\$8: 11,000\n\n- \\$12: 8,000\n\n- \\$16: 5,000\n\n- \\$20: 2,000\n\nNow, supply remains the same as before, which is 8,000 tickets at each price from \\$4 upwards.\n\nSo, we need to find the price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, which is the new equilibrium price.\n\nLooking at the new demand and the supply:\n\nAt \\$4: Qd=14,000, Qs=8,000 \u2192 excess demand of 6,000\n\nAt \\$8: Qd=11,000, Qs=8,000 \u2192 excess demand of 3,000\n\nAt \\$12: Qd=8,000, Qs=8,000 \u2192 equilibrium?\n\nWait, at \\$12, Qd=8,000 and Qs=8,000, so that seems like equilibrium.\n\nBut let's check higher prices to be sure.\n\nAt \\$16: Qd=5,000, Qs=8,000 \u2192 excess supply of 3,000\n\nAt \\$20: Qd=2,000, Qs=8,000 \u2192 excess supply of 6,000\n\nSo, at \\$12, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied at 8,000 tickets.\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium price should be \\$12.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 10\n\nB. 11\n\nC. 12\n\nD. 13\n\nOption C. 12 seems to be the correct answer based on this calculation.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nInitial demand:\n\n- \\$4: 10,000\n\n- \\$8: 8,000\n\n- \\$12: 6,000\n\n- \\$16: 4,000\n\n- \\$20: 2,000\n\nNew students' demand:\n\n- \\$4: 4,000\n\n- \\$8: 3,000\n\n- \\$12: 2,000\n\n- \\$16: 1,000\n\n- \\$20: 0\n\nTotal demand:\n\n- \\$4: 14,000\n\n- \\$8: 11,000\n\n- \\$12: 8,000\n\n- \\$16: 5,000\n\n- \\$20: 2,000\n\nSupply is constant at 8,000 tickets from \\$4 upwards.\n\nThus, at \\$12, Qd=8,000 and Qs=8,000, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the new equilibrium price is \\$12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
