                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a balance sheet for TD Bank before someone deposits $700. The assets side shows reserves of $493 and loans of $2407. On the liabilities side, there are deposits of $2900. Now, someone deposits $700 into the bank. We need to figure out by what minimum amount the money supply will increase as a result of this deposit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens when someone deposits money into a bank. When a person deposits money into a bank, the bank's reserves increase by the amount of the deposit. So, in this case, TD Bank's reserves should increase by $700.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the balance sheet, it seems like the units might be in millions or something, but assuming they are in dollars, the reserves are $493. If someone deposits $700, reserves should become $493 + $700 = $1193.\n\nHowever, banks don't just keep all the deposits as reserves; they lend out a portion of them. The amount they can lend depends on the reserve requirement set by the central bank. The reserve requirement is the minimum amount of reserves a bank must hold against its deposits.\n\nLet's assume there's a reserve requirement in place, though the problem doesn't specify it. In many economies, banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves, and the rest can be lent out.\n\nSo, if the reserve requirement is, say, 10%, then for every dollar deposited, the bank has to keep $0.10 and can lend out $0.90. But since the problem doesn't specify the reserve requirement, I need to find another way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can use the concept of the money multiplier. The money multiplier is the factor by which the money supply increases when new reserves are injected into the banking system.\n\nThe formula for the money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio, assuming that the bank holds only the required reserves and lends out the rest.\n\nBut again, without knowing the reserve ratio, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can find the reserve ratio from the initial balance sheet.\n\nLet's see: initial deposits are $2900, and reserves are $493. So, the reserve ratio is $493 / $2900 = let's calculate that.\n\n$493 divided by $2900 is approximately 0.169, or 16.9%. So, the reserve ratio is roughly 16.9%.\n\nTherefore, the money multiplier would be 1 / 0.169 \u2248 5.92.\n\nNow, if someone deposits $700, and the bank has to keep only 16.9% as reserves, it can lend out the remaining 83.1% of the deposit.\n\nSo, the bank can lend out $700 * 0.831 \u2248 $581.70.\n\nBut this lending can create more money through the multiplier effect.\n\nSo, the total increase in the money supply would be the initial deposit plus the additional lending multiplied by the money multiplier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's recall that the money supply increases when banks make loans, and those loans are spent, leading to more deposits in other banks, and so on.\n\nThe formula for the change in the money supply is \u0394Ms = money multiplier * \u0394reserves.\n\nGiven that, \u0394reserves is the new deposit of $700.\n\nSo, \u0394Ms = (1 / reserve ratio) * \u0394reserves = 1 / 0.169 * $700 \u2248 5.92 * $700 = $4144.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the initial deposits were $2900, and reserves were $493, which gives a reserve ratio of about 16.9%, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut if the money multiplier is about 5.92, and the new reserves are $493 + $700 = $1193, then the potential money supply would be $1193 * 5.92 \u2248 $7076.\n\nBut initially, the money supply was $2900, so the increase would be $7076 - $2900 = $4176.\n\nThat's close to what I got earlier, but not exactly the same due to rounding.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them match this calculation.\n\nOption A is 0, which doesn't make sense because the deposit should lead to some increase in the money supply.\n\nOption B is 700, which is the initial deposit, but that's not the total increase in the money supply.\n\nOption C is 1400, and option D is 3418.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the change in reserves and the change in deposits.\n\nWhen someone deposits $700, the bank's reserves increase by $700, and deposits increase by $700.\n\nBut in the balance sheet, initial reserves are $493 and deposits are $2900.\n\nWait, but in the balance sheet, liabilities are deposits ($2900) and assets are reserves ($493) and loans ($2407).\n\nActually, in a typical balance sheet, assets equal liabilities plus equity, but here it's simplified.\n\nAssuming that reserves are part of assets and deposits are liabilities.\n\nWhen someone deposits $700, deposits increase by $700, and reserves increase by $700.\n\nNow, the bank can lend out a portion of the new reserves, based on the reserve ratio.\n\nGiven that the initial reserve ratio is $493 / $2900 \u2248 16.9%, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, for the new $700 deposit, the bank has to keep 16.9% as reserves, which is $700 * 0.169 \u2248 $118.30, and can lend out the remaining $700 - $118.30 = $581.70.\n\nWhen the bank makes a loan of $581.70, that money is spent by the borrower and deposited into another bank, increasing deposits in the banking system by $581.70.\n\nThis process repeats, with each bank lending out a portion of the new deposits, leading to a multiplied increase in the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the total increase in the money supply is the initial deposit plus the amount lent out through the multiplier effect.\n\nSo, \u0394Ms = initial deposit / reserve ratio = $700 / 0.169 \u2248 $4142.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nOption A: 0 \u2013 that's not right because there is an increase.\n\nOption B: 700 \u2013 that's just the initial deposit, not the total increase.\n\nOption C: 1400 \u2013 that might be twice the deposit, but I don't see why.\n\nOption D: 3418 \u2013 that seems too high compared to my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the entire balance sheet and recalculate the reserve ratio after the deposit.\n\nInitial reserves are $493, and deposits are $2900, giving a reserve ratio of 16.9%.\n\nAfter the deposit, reserves become $493 + $700 = $1193, and deposits become $2900 + $700 = $3600.\n\nThe new reserve ratio is $1193 / $3600 \u2248 0.3314, or 33.14%.\n\nBut the reserve requirement is presumably still 16.9%, so the bank can lend out the excess reserves.\n\nExcess reserves are total reserves minus required reserves.\n\nRequired reserves = $3600 * 0.169 \u2248 $608.40.\n\nExcess reserves = $1193 - $608.40 \u2248 $584.60.\n\nThe bank can lend out $584.60.\n\nThis lending will create more money through the multiplier effect.\n\nThe money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio = 1 / 0.169 \u2248 5.92.\n\nSo, the total new money created is $584.60 * 5.92 \u2248 $3460.\n\nAdding this to the initial deposit of $700, the total increase in the money supply is $700 + $3460 = $4160.\n\nStill, this doesn't match any of the options exactly, but it's closer to option D: 3418.\n\nMaybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me check the initial reserve ratio again.\n\nInitial reserves are $493, deposits are $2900, so reserve ratio is $493 / $2900 \u2248 0.1699, or about 17%.\n\nAfter the deposit, reserves are $1193, deposits are $3600, so reserve ratio is $1193 / $3600 \u2248 0.3314.\n\nExcess reserves are $1193 - ($3600 * 0.17) \u2248 $1193 - $612 = $581.\n\nMoney multiplier is 1 / 0.17 \u2248 5.88.\n\nNew money created is $581 * 5.88 \u2248 $3418.\n\nAdding the initial deposit of $700, total increase is $700 + $3418 = $4118.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase, which would be just the initial deposit plus the loans made from the excess reserves, without considering the full multiplier effect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reserve ratio is different, or there are other factors at play.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the bank can only lend out the excess reserves, and the money supply increases by the amount of the loan times the money multiplier.\n\nSo, excess reserves are $581, and money multiplier is about 5.88, so new money created is $581 * 5.88 \u2248 $3418.\n\nThat matches option D: 3418.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is only considering the loans made, which are $581, and the initial deposit is $700, but that doesn't add up to any of the options.\n\nI think the correct answer is D: 3418, based on the calculations of excess reserves and the money multiplier.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
