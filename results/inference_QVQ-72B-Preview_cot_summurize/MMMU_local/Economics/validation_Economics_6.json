                    "text": "So I have this problem here about price elasticity of demand. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question is asking for the price elasticity of demand when the price of DVDs increases from $8 to $10, and my income is $12,000. The options are A. 0.17, B. 0.27, C. 0.37, and D. 0.47.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what price elasticity of demand is. From what I remember, price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's usually expressed as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\text{Percentage Change in Price}}\n\\]\n\nAlright, I have the price increasing from $8 to $10, and my income is $12,000. Looking at the table, when income is $12,000:\n\n- At $8, quantity demanded is 50 DVDs\n\n- At $10, quantity demanded is 45 DVDs\n\nSo, the change in quantity demanded is 45 - 50 = -5 DVDs (since it's decreasing as price increases).\n\nNow, I need to calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded and the percentage change in price.\n\nFirst, the percentage change in quantity demanded:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change in Quantity} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{-5}{50} \\times 100\\% = -10\\%\n\\]\n\nWait, but I think in elasticity calculations, we usually use the average quantity or the mid-point formula to avoid the ambiguity of direction.\n\nLet me recall the mid-point formula for price elasticity of demand:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{(Q_2 - Q_1)/( (Q_2 + Q_1)/2 )}{(P_2 - P_1)/( (P_2 + P_1)/2 )}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nQ_1 = 50, Q_2 = 45, P_1 = 8, P_2 = 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{(45 - 50)/( (45 + 50)/2 )}{(10 - 8)/( (10 + 8)/2 )}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-5 / 47.5}{2 / 9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{-5 / 47.5}{2 / 9} = \\frac{-0.10526}{0.22222} \\approx -0.47\n\\]\n\nHmm, so the elasticity is approximately -0.47. But looking at the options, they are all positive numbers, so maybe I should ignore the sign and just take the absolute value, which is 0.47.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 0.47 seems to be the closest match.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator of the quantity change:\n\n\\[\n(Q_1 + Q_2)/2 = (50 + 45)/2 = 95/2 = 47.5\n\\]\n\nThen, the numerator:\n\n\\[\nQ_2 - Q_1 = 45 - 50 = -5\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change in Quantity} = -5 / 47.5 = -0.10526 or -10.526\\%\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the percentage change in price:\n\n\\[\n(P_2 - P_1)/( (P_2 + P_1)/2 ) = (10 - 8)/( (10 + 8)/2 ) = 2 / 9 = 0.22222 or 22.222\\%\n\\]\n\nThen, the elasticity is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{-10.526\\%}{22.222\\%} = -0.47\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the price elasticity of demand is approximately 0.47 in absolute terms.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there's another way to calculate this, maybe using the initial quantity and price.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\text{Percentage Change in Price}}\n\\]\n\nI already have the percentage changes: quantity demanded decreased by 10.526% and price increased by 22.222%.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{-10.526\\%}{22.222\\%} = -0.47\n\\]\n\nAgain, the result is -0.47, which suggests that the demand is inelastic since the absolute value is less than 1.\n\nGiven that, the closest option is D. 0.47, ignoring the negative sign.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the data or if I've missed something.\n\nOne thing I notice is that the table shows quantity demanded at different prices for two different income levels: $10,000 and $12,000. The question specifies that my income is $12,000, so I think I correctly used the corresponding quantity demanded values.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that I'm using the mid-point formula correctly. Yes, the mid-point formula is a standard method to calculate elasticity, as it provides a more accurate measure by using averages rather than just initial or final values.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the point elasticity formula, which requires derivative calculations, but that seems more complicated for this context, and since we're dealing with discrete changes, the mid-point formula should suffice.\n\nTherefore, based on my calculations and the options provided, I believe the correct answer is D. 0.47.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
