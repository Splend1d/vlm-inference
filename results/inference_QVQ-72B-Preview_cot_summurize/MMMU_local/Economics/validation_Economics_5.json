                    "text": "So I've got this graph here that's supposed to represent the economy's short-run and long-run equilibrium. There are three lines: LRAS, SRAS, and AD. LRAS stands for Long-Run Aggregate Supply, SRAS is Short-Run Aggregate Supply, and AD is Aggregate Demand. The axes are Price Level on the y-axis and Real Output (rY) on the x-axis.\n\nPoint A is where the SRAS and AD curves intersect, and there's a vertical line labeled LRAS that intersects SRAS at the same point. So, it looks like the economy is currently in both short-run and long-run equilibrium at point A.\n\nNow, the question is about what happens if the economy faces a boom and how it returns to long-run equilibrium, assuming wages are flexible. A boom typically means an increase in economic activity, which could shift the AD curve to the right, leading to higher prices and higher output in the short run.\n\nBut in this graph, it seems like the economy is already at its potential output, as indicated by the LRAS line. So, if there's a boom, meaning increased demand, the AD curve would shift to the right, leading to higher prices and possibly higher output in the short run. However, in the long run, if the economy is initially at its potential output, any deviation due to increased demand should be temporary.\n\nGiven that wages are flexible, I need to think about how wages adjust to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the economy starts at point A, where AD intersects SRAS and LRAS. At this point, the price level and real output are in equilibrium in both the short and long run.\n\nIf there's a boom, meaning increased aggregate demand, the AD curve shifts to the right, say to AD'. This would lead to a new intersection point, let's call it B, where AD' and SRAS intersect. At this point, the price level would be higher, and real output would be higher than the potential output indicated by LRAS.\n\nIn the short run, this is fine, but in the long run, the economy should return to its potential output. So, what mechanisms would cause this to happen?\n\nWell, if wages are flexible, especially if they are flexible upwards, which they typically are in standard economic models, then in response to the increased demand and higher prices, wages would start to rise.\n\nHigher wages would increase the cost of production, which would shift the SRAS curve upwards (to the left) as it becomes more expensive to produce the same level of output.\n\nAs the SRAS shifts upwards, the intersection point between AD and SRAS moves upwards and to the left, meaning higher prices and lower output.\n\nThis process continues until the SRAS curve shifts back to align with the LRAS, bringing real output back to its potential level.\n\nSo, in this scenario, wages would rise to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"if wages are flexible,\" and the options are:\n\nA. Wages will fall.\n\nB. Wages will rise.\n\nC. Wages will remain unchanged.\n\nGiven that the boom leads to higher prices and higher output in the short run, and assuming that wages are flexible upwards, wages should rise in response to the increased demand and higher prices.\n\nThis rise in wages would then lead to higher production costs, shifting SRAS upwards, and eventually bringing real output back to its potential level.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wages will rise.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that in the classical model, wages and prices are flexible, and in the long run, the economy returns to full employment. If there's a positive demand shock (a boom), AD increases, leading to higher prices and output in the short run.\n\nOver time, as wages adjust upwards, the SRAS curve shifts back, and the economy moves back to the LRAS, with higher prices but real output returning to potential.\n\nSo, yes, wages would rise in this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, if wages were sticky downwards, it might be different, but the question specifies that wages are flexible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wages will rise.\n\nI think that's the right conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
