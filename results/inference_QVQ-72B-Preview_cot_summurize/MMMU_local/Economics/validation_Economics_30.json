                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a bunch of identical people in Whoville who really love drinking this stuff called Zlurp. Each of them has a specific willingness to pay for each bottle they drink, and there's a table showing that:\n\n- First bottle: $5\n\n- Second bottle: $4\n\n- Third bottle: $3\n\n- Fourth bottle: $2\n\n- Fifth bottle: $1\n\n- Any bottles after that: $0\n\nSo, basically, each person is willing to pay less and less for each additional bottle they drink, which makes sense because the more you have of something, the less extra benefit you get from each new unit\u2014that's the law of diminishing marginal utility in action.\n\nNow, the cost to produce each bottle of Zlurp is $1.50, and the suppliers are selling it at that price. The problem mentions that the supply curve is horizontal, which means it's perfectly elastic. In economics, a perfectly elastic supply means that suppliers will supply any quantity at the given price, but won't supply any at a lower price.\n\nMayor Grinch decides to impose a $1 tax on each bottle of Zlurp. We need to figure out what the external cost of this tax is. The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an external cost is. In economics, an external cost is a negative side effect of a production or consumption activity that affects someone who is not directly involved in the transaction. For example, pollution from a factory is an external cost because it affects the health and environment of people around the factory who aren't part of the factory's operations.\n\nIn this scenario, the tax is being imposed on the consumption of Zlurp. So, the external cost would be the additional cost that society bears because of this consumption beyond the private costs that the consumers and producers directly face.\n\nThe private cost here is the production cost plus the tax. Before the tax, the production cost is $1.50 per bottle, and after the tax, it's $1.50 plus $1 tax, so $2.50 per bottle.\n\nBut wait, in reality, when a tax is imposed on the consumers, it shifts the demand curve inward, leading to a higher price paid by consumers and a lower quantity demanded. However, since the supply is perfectly elastic, the entire tax is likely to be passed on to the consumers.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, without the tax, the price is $1.50 per bottle. Each consumer will buy up to the point where their willingness to pay equals the price. So, looking at the table:\n\n- First bottle: $5 (willingness to pay) vs. $1.50 (price) \u2192 buy\n\n- Second bottle: $4 vs. $1.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Third bottle: $3 vs. $1.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Fourth bottle: $2 vs. $1.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Fifth bottle: $1 vs. $1.50 \u2192 don't buy\n\n- Further bottles: $0 vs. $1.50 \u2192 don't buy\n\nSo, each consumer buys 4 bottles at $1.50 each.\n\nTotal expenditure per consumer: 4 bottles * $1.50 = $6\n\nTotal consumer surplus (the benefit beyond what they pay): ($5 - $1.50) + ($4 - $1.50) + ($3 - $1.50) + ($2 - $1.50) = $3.50 + $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $8\n\nNow, with the $1 tax, the price each consumer pays becomes $1.50 + $1 = $2.50 per bottle.\n\nNow, let's see how many bottles each consumer will buy at $2.50:\n\n- First bottle: $5 vs. $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Second bottle: $4 vs. $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Third bottle: $3 vs. $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Fourth bottle: $2 vs. $2.50 \u2192 don't buy\n\n- Fifth bottle: $1 vs. $2.50 \u2192 don't buy\n\n- Further bottles: $0 vs. $2.50 \u2192 don't buy\n\nSo now, each consumer buys 3 bottles at $2.50 each.\n\nTotal expenditure per consumer: 3 bottles * $2.50 = $7.50\n\nTotal consumer surplus: ($5 - $2.50) + ($4 - $2.50) + ($3 - $2.50) = $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $4.50\n\nNow, the total benefit to the consumer is the consumer surplus plus the amount they pay to get the product. But we need to find the external cost.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Perhaps I need to consider the social cost, which includes the private cost plus any external costs.\n\nBefore the tax:\n\n- Private cost per bottle: $1.50 (production cost)\n\n- No tax yet applied\n\nAfter the tax:\n\n- Private cost per bottle: $1.50 + $1 tax = $2.50\n\n- But the consumer pays $2.50, and the producer receives $1.50, with $1 going to the government as tax.\n\nNow, the external cost would be the cost to society that isn't covered by the private costs. But in this case, the tax is just transferring $1 per bottle from consumers to the government. It's not causing any additional harm to third parties.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"external cost.\" Maybe it's referring to the deadweight loss caused by the tax.\n\nDeadweight loss is the reduction in total surplus (consumer plus producer surplus) that results from a market distortion like a tax.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total surplus before and after the tax.\n\nBefore tax:\n\n- Consumer surplus: $8 (as calculated earlier)\n\n- Producer surplus: since the production cost is $1.50 per bottle, and they sell 4 bottles per consumer at $1.50, their revenue is 4 * $1.50 = $6, and cost is 4 * $1.50 = $6, so producer surplus is $0.\n\nWait, that seems off. If the production cost is $1.50 and they sell at $1.50, their profit is zero? That can't be right.\n\nWait, in a competitive market with perfect elasticity of supply, the supply price reflects the marginal cost of production. So, the producer is making zero economic profit in the long run. So, producer surplus is zero.\n\nAfter tax:\n\n- Consumer surplus: $4.50 (as calculated earlier)\n\n- Producer surplus: they still receive $1.50 per bottle, and produce 3 bottles per consumer, so revenue is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50, cost is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50, so producer surplus is $0.\n\n- Government revenue: $1 tax per bottle * 3 bottles = $3 per consumer\n\nSo, total surplus before tax: consumer surplus $8 + producer surplus $0 = $8\n\nTotal surplus after tax: consumer surplus $4.50 + producer surplus $0 = $4.50\n\nSo, the deadweight loss is $8 - $4.50 = $3.50\n\nBut the government has collected $3 in tax revenue. So, the net loss to society is $3.50 - $3 = $0.50\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the tax revenue is a transfer and doesn't represent a loss in welfare, only the deadweight loss does.\n\nIn that case, the deadweight loss is $3.50, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the deadweight loss, which is $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the external cost differently. Perhaps the external cost is related to the marginal external cost per additional unit consumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the cost that society bears for each bottle consumed beyond the private cost.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the external cost is the difference between the social cost and the private cost.\n\nSocial cost = private cost + external cost.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the external cost per bottle can be calculated based on the tax.\n\nBut the tax is $1 per bottle, and it's paid to the government, which doesn't impose any external costs directly.\n\nUnless the tax leads to some external costs, which isn't specified in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the external cost is the foregone consumer surplus due to the tax.\n\nBut that still doesn't give me a clear answer.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement.\n\n\"The many identical residents of Whoville love drinking Zlurp. Each resident has the following willingness to pay for the tasty refreshment:\n\nFirst bottle $5\n\nSecond bottle 4\n\nThird bottle 3\n\nFourth bottle 2\n\nFifth bottle 1\n\nFurther bottles 0\n\nThe cost of producing Zlurp is $1.50, and the competitive suppliers sell it at this price. (The supply curve is horizontal.) Mayor Grinch imposes a $1 tax on Zlurp. What is the external cost?\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\"\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the external cost is related to the number of bottles consumed.\n\nBefore tax, each consumer buys 4 bottles.\n\nAfter tax, each consumer buys 3 bottles.\n\nSo, the reduction in consumption is 1 bottle per consumer.\n\nIf the external cost is related to the environmental impact or something like that, but the problem doesn't specify any externalities associated with consumption.\n\nWait, maybe the external cost is the cost imposed on society by the consumption of Zlurp, and the tax is meant to internalize that cost.\n\nIn that case, if the tax is $1 per bottle, and it's equal to the external cost per bottle, then the external cost would be $1 per bottle.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and the options are single numbers without units, so maybe it's $1 total.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the total external cost imposed by the consumption, which would be the tax times the quantity consumed.\n\nAfter tax, quantity consumed is 3 bottles per consumer, and tax is $1 per bottle, so total external cost is 3 * $1 = $3.\n\nBut that's not matching the options either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the deadweight loss, which I calculated as $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the external cost is the area of the deadweight loss triangle.\n\nIn a graph, with quantity on the x-axis and price on the y-axis, the deadweight loss would be the area between the demand and supply curves after the tax is imposed.\n\nBut without the graph, it's hard to visualize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the difference between the social marginal cost and the private marginal cost, multiplied by the quantity.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that the external cost is the cost to society beyond the private costs incurred by consumers and producers.\n\nIn this case, the private costs are the production costs and the tax.\n\nThe production cost is $1.50 per bottle, and the tax is $1 per bottle, so total private cost per bottle is $2.50.\n\nBut what is the social cost per bottle?\n\nIf there are no externalities, then the social cost should equal the private cost.\n\nBut the problem mentions an external cost, so perhaps there is an externality associated with the consumption of Zlurp.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem, it says: \"the competitive suppliers sell it at this price. (The supply curve is horizontal.) Mayor Grinch imposes a $1 tax on Zlurp. What is the external cost?\"\n\nActually, the problem doesn't explicitly mention any externalities or negative effects from consuming Zlurp.\n\nIt only mentions that there's a tax imposed on Zlurp.\n\nSo, perhaps the external cost is the tax itself, which is $1 per bottle.\n\nBut again, that seems too straightforward, and the options are single numbers without units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the total tax collected, but that would be $1 per bottle times the quantity, which is 3 bottles, so $3, which is option C.\n\nBut I feel like that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the deadweight loss, which I calculated as $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of marginal external cost.\n\nIf the tax is $1 per bottle, and it's meant to internalize the external cost, then the external cost per bottle is $1.\n\nSo, the total external cost would be $1 per bottle times the quantity consumed, which is 3 bottles, totaling $3.\n\nThat would be option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the total external cost before the tax, and the tax is meant to internalize it.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide information about any externalities before the tax.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the difference between the social cost and the private cost after the tax.\n\nBut I'm getting confused again.\n\nLet me consider that the external cost is the cost to society that is not being covered by the private costs.\n\nIn this case, the private costs are the production costs and the tax.\n\nIf there are no externalities, then the social cost equals the private cost, and there's no external cost.\n\nBut the problem mentions an external cost, so perhaps there is an externality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the deadweight loss caused by the tax.\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, it's $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the total tax collected, which is $3, option C.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the tax revenue is going to the government, which might use it for public goods or other beneficial purposes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the reduction in consumer surplus, which is $8 - $4.50 = $3.50, again not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the difference between the willingness to pay and the price paid after the tax.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the marginal consumer.\n\nBefore the tax, consumers buy up to the fourth bottle, where willingness to pay equals $2 and price is $1.50.\n\nAfter the tax, price is $2.50, and willingness to pay for the fourth bottle is $2, so they stop at the third bottle.\n\nSo, the marginal consumer after the tax has a willingness to pay of $3 for the third bottle and pays $2.50, so has a consumer surplus of $0.50.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the cost to society of the reduced consumption due to the tax.\n\nBut again, without specific externalities mentioned, it's hard to quantify.\n\nWait, maybe the external cost is the foregone consumer surplus minus the tax revenue.\n\nSo, foregone consumer surplus is $8 - $4.50 = $3.50\n\nTax revenue is $3\n\nSo, net external cost is $3.50 - $3 = $0.50, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is just the tax revenue, which is $3, option C.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the difference between the social marginal benefit and the social marginal cost at the quantity consumed after the tax.\n\nBut without knowing the social marginal cost, that's hard to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the area of the deadweight loss, which I calculated as $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the total external cost per bottle times the quantity, which is $1 times 3 bottles = $3, option C.\n\nBut I'm not confident about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the difference between the private marginal cost and the social marginal cost, multiplied by the quantity.\n\nBut again, without knowing the social marginal cost, that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the external cost in terms of the tax per bottle.\n\nIf the tax is $1 per bottle, and it's meant to internalize an external cost of $1 per bottle, then the external cost is $1 per bottle.\n\nSo, for 3 bottles consumed after the tax, the total external cost would be $3, option C.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the total tax revenue, which is $3, option C.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because the tax revenue is going to the government, which might use it for public goods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the deadweight loss, which I calculated as $3.50, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the difference between the social optimal quantity and the quantity consumed after the tax.\n\nBut without knowing the social optimal quantity, that's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the cost to society of the underconsumption due to the tax.\n\nBut again, without specific externalities, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is simply the tax per bottle, which is $1, option A.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and the options are single numbers without units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the external cost is the total external cost, which is the tax times the quantity, which is $3, option C.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to go with option C. 3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
