                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a market in Japan with a basket consisting of 200 apples and 290 textbooks. We're given prices for apples and textbooks over three years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. The base year is 2015, and we need to find the price of the basket in 2014.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a basket is in this context. A basket typically represents a fixed set of goods and services, and its price is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each item in the basket by its price and then summing up these amounts.\n\nGiven that the basket consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks, I need to find the total cost of this basket in 2014 using the prices from that year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 2014, the price of apples is \\$1.40 each.\n\n- In 2015, the price of apples is \\$1.10 each.\n\n- In 2016, the price of apples is \\$1.10 each.\n\nSimilarly for textbooks:\n\n- In 2014, the price is \\$200 each.\n\n- In 2015, the price is \\$140 each.\n\n- In 2016, the price is \\$200 each.\n\nWait a minute, the table seems to have some issues with the formatting, but assuming that the prices are as I've listed above.\n\nSo, for 2014:\n\n- Price of one apple: \\$1.40\n\n- Price of one textbook: \\$200\n\nTherefore, the cost of 200 apples in 2014 would be 200 * \\$1.40.\n\nLet me calculate that: 200 * 1.40 = \\$280.\n\nThe cost of 290 textbooks in 2014 would be 290 * \\$200.\n\nCalculating that: 290 * 200 = \\$58,000.\n\nSo, the total cost of the basket in 2014 would be the sum of these two: \\$280 + \\$58,000.\n\nThat would be \\$58,280.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\$58,280\n\nB. \\$64,420\n\nC. \\$71,520\n\nD. \\$42,450\n\nIt seems like option A matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the base year is 2015. Does that mean I need to adjust for inflation or something? Maybe calculate a price index?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn economics, when we calculate the price of a basket in different years, we often use a price index to compare its cost over time. The base year is the year we set to 100, and other years are indexed relative to that.\n\nHowever, in this specific question, since we are only asked for the price of the basket in 2014 without referring to it in terms of the base year's dollars, I think the straightforward calculation is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want us to calculate the price of the basket in 2014 using the quantities from the base year, 2015. But no, the problem states that the basket consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks, which seems to be a fixed basket.\n\nTherefore, using the prices from 2014 and the given quantities, the total cost should indeed be \\$58,280.\n\nI don't see any need to involve further calculations like inflation rates or index adjustments unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, my final answer is option A: \\$58,280.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$58,280} \\]"
