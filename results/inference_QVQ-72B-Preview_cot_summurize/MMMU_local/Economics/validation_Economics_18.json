                    "text": "So I've got this graph here that shows the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curves for Brazil. There are two vertical lines labeled LRAS1 and LRAS2, with LRAS2 being further to the right. The x-axis is labeled \"Real GDP\" and goes from 0 to 1200 in increments of 100. The y-axis is labeled \"Price Level\" and ranges from 0 to 1200 in increments of 100. Both axes have a scale that seems to be in units of 100, maybe billions or something, but it's not specified.\n\nAnyway, the question is asking what event could shift the LRAS from LRAS1 to LRAS2 in Brazil. The options are:\n\nA. Increase in capital.\n\nB. Decrease in labor.\n\nC. Decrease in human capital.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what LRAS represents. In macroeconomics, the LRAS curve is vertical because it represents the potential output of an economy in the long run, when all prices are flexible. So, any shift in LRAS would be due to changes in the economy's productive capacity, not just changes in aggregate demand.\n\nNow, the question is about shifting from LRAS1 to LRAS2, which means an increase in potential GDP. So, we're looking for an option that would increase Brazil's productive capacity.\n\nOption A is an increase in capital. Capital includes things like machinery, infrastructure, and other productive assets. If Brazil invests more in capital goods, it should increase its ability to produce more in the long run. So, this seems like a plausible reason for LRAS to shift right.\n\nOption B is a decrease in labor. Labor is one of the factors of production. If there's less labor available, whether due to a decrease in population, lower participation rates, or other factors, that would typically lead to a decrease in potential output, shifting LRAS to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption C is a decrease in human capital. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and health of the workforce. If human capital decreases, for example, due to lower education levels or poorer health, that would also lead to a reduction in productive capacity, shifting LRAS to the left.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be the correct choice because increasing capital should lead to an increase in potential GDP, shifting LRAS to the right.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there any way that increasing capital could lead to a leftward shift in LRAS? No, I don't think so. Increasing capital should always increase potential output in the long run, assuming we're not already at the point where additional capital doesn't increase production efficiency.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor that could be at play here. Maybe technological progress? But that's not one of the options. Or perhaps improvements in resource utilization? Again, not among the choices.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the increase in capital leads to higher productivity, which allows for more output with the same amount of labor and other resources. That would indeed shift LRAS to the right.\n\nI should also consider the law of diminishing returns. At some point, adding more capital might not lead to proportional increases in output. But in the long run, if capital is increasing significantly, it should still lead to an increase in potential GDP, just maybe not as much as if there were increasing returns.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are constraints on labor or natural resources that could limit the effectiveness of increased capital. But again, in the long run, if capital increases while other factors remain constant or increase proportionally, LRAS should shift to the right.\n\nLet me look back at the graph to make sure. LRAS1 is at, say, 200 on the Real GDP axis, and LRAS2 is at 400. So, a shift from 200 to 400 would indeed be a rightward shift, indicating an increase in potential GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: increase in capital.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility that increasing capital could lead to a leftward shift in LRAS. For example, if increasing capital leads to environmental degradation that reduces the overall productivity of other factors, that could potentially lead to a leftward shift. But that seems like a specific scenario, and generally, increasing capital should increase potential output.\n\nMoreover, if the increase in capital is financed by borrowing, leading to higher interest rates that crowd out private investment, that could potentially limit future growth. But again, in the direct sense, increasing capital should still lead to higher potential output.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
