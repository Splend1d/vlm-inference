The quote says, \"I think everybody should like everybody,\" and it's attributed to Andy Warhol. Now, the question is asking who painted this image, and the options are Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Andy Warhol, and Georgia O'Keefe.\n\nFirst off, I need to recognize the style of the art to help me answer this question. Pop art is known for its bold colors, graphic design, and often incorporates elements of popular culture. This image has a greenish-yellow background with a halftone dot pattern, which is characteristic of pop art printing techniques. The person in the image is wearing sunglasses and has a serious expression, which is typical of Warhol's portraits.\n\nAndy Warhol was a prominent figure in the pop art movement, famous for his silkscreen paintings of celebrities and everyday objects. His work often commented on consumerism and celebrity culture. The quote on the image is in his handwriting style, which adds to the authenticity.\n\nClaude Monet, on the other hand, was an Impressionist painter known for his landscapes and seascapes, characterized by loose brushstrokes and an emphasis on light and color. His work doesn't align with the pop art style seen in this image.\n\nHenri Matisse was a French artist known for his use of color and his fluid and original drawing style. He was a key figure in the Fauvism movement, which emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Matisse's work is colorful, the style of this image doesn't match his signature techniques.\n\nGeorgia O'Keefe was an American artist known for her paintings of flowers and landscapes, often depicted in a stylized and abstract manner. Her work doesn't reflect the pop art style evident in this image.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's clear that Andy Warhol is the most likely artist who painted this image. His association with pop art, his famous portraits of celebrities, and the presence of his quote all point towards him being the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any possibility that this image could be attributed to another artist. However, the style is distinctly pop art, and Warhol is one of the most famous proponents of this movement. Moreover, the quote is from Warhol himself, which further reinforces that this is his work.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the style of the artwork and the inclusion of Andy Warhol's quote, I am confident that Andy Warhol is the artist who painted this image.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C.
