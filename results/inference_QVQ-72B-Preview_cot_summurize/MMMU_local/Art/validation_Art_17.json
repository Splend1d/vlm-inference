                    "text": "So I'm looking at this image of a stone sculpture, and it's supposed to be a Mayan chacmool figure. It's sitting on a pedestal with a beautiful beach in the background\u2014clear blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and the ocean stretching out to the horizon. A few people are walking along the sand, and there are some small waves breaking near the shore. The sculpture itself is made of stone and has a distinctive shape: it's lying on its back with its knees bent and arms crossed over its chest, holding a flat object, which I believe is a bowl or something similar.\n\nNow, the question is asking which twentieth-century sculptor was influenced by these Mayan chacmool sculptures. The options are Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and Constantin Brancusi. I need to recall some art history here.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a chacmool is. From my memory, chacmools are pre-Columbian sculptures, particularly from the Maya and Aztec cultures. They are often depicted as human figures in a reclining position, supporting a bowl or plate on their stomachs, which was likely used for offerings or sacrifices. They have a significant symbolic meaning in Mesoamerican mythology and religion.\n\nNow, let's think about each sculptor:\n\nA. Louise Bourgeois: She was a French-American sculptor known for her large-scale installations and sculptures that often explored themes of memory, family, and sexuality. Her works can be quite abstract and sometimes resemble spiders or other organic forms. I don't recall her directly referencing chacmool figures in her work.\n\nB. Henry Moore: He was an English sculptor who is perhaps best known for his abstracted figures, often carved from stone. Moore was interested in the human form and how it interacts with the surrounding space. He was influenced by a variety of sources, including pre-Columbian art, which might include chacmool sculptures.\n\nC. Barbara Hepworth: Also an English sculptor, Hepworth was known for her modernist sculptures that often incorporated holes or cavities, giving them a sense of openness and lightness. While she was contemporaneous with Moore and shared some influences, I don't specifically recall chacmool sculptures being a significant influence on her work.\n\nD. Constantin Brancusi: A Romanian sculptor who worked in France, Brancusi is famous for his highly abstracted, smooth-surfaced sculptures that often resemble organic forms. His work is characterized by a simplicity and elegance that might not directly align with the more figurative chacmool sculptures.\n\nConsidering these brief overviews, Henry Moore seems like the most likely candidate to have been influenced by chacmool sculptures. He was known for his interest in human figures and was deeply influenced by pre-Columbian art, which includes Mayan and Aztec cultures.\n\nLet me dig a bit deeper. I recall that Moore collected pre-Columbian artifacts and that some of his sculptures show similarities to chacmool figures. For example, his reclining figures bear a resemblance to the posture of chacmools, lying on their backs with limbs bent in a relaxed position.\n\nI should also consider if any of the other sculptors had specific connections to Mesoamerican art. Louise Bourgeois was known for her interest in psychoanalysis and personal history, which might not directly relate to chacmool sculptures. Barbara Hepworth was involved with the St. Ives School in Cornwall, England, and was more focused on abstract forms and the natural landscape. Constantin Brancusi was famous for his minimalist approach and smooth, polished surfaces, which differ significantly from the more textured and figurative chacmool sculptures.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would conclude that Henry Moore was the twentieth-century sculptor most influenced by Mayan chacmool sculptures.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a few key points. First, chacmool figures are indeed pre-Columbian sculptures from Mesoamerica, primarily associated with the Maya and Aztec cultures. They are characterized by their reclining position and the bowl they hold, which was likely used for ritual purposes.\n\nHenry Moore was known for his reclining figures, which share a similar pose to the chacmools. His works often emphasize the organic flow of the human form and its connection to the earth, which aligns with the symbolic significance of chacmool figures in their original cultural context.\n\nIn contrast, Louise Bourgeois' sculptures are more about emotional expression and personal narratives, Barbara Hepworth's works are abstract with a focus on form and space, and Brancusi's sculptures are highly stylized and abstract.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Henry Moore.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
