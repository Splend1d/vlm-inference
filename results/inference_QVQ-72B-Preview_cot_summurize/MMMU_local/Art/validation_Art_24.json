It is a story of the unbreakable bond that unites a mother and her child. Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery. There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships. Personification is a literary device in which human qualities are ascribed to a nonhuman subject. Which statement best captures the personification in the passage?\n\nA. The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.\nB. A sculpture is described as speaking.\nC. The artist is described as a storyteller.\nD. A sculpture is without frills.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this passage about a sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, and it's describing how the sculpture tells a story of the bond between a mother and her child. The language used is really poetic and emphasizes the simplicity and grace of the sculpture. There's a question at the end about personification, and I need to choose which statement best captures that.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what personification is. Personification is when human characteristics are attributed to something that isn't human, like an object, an animal, or an abstract concept. So, in this passage, I should look for a place where the author describes the sculpture or something related to it with human-like qualities.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.\n\nWell, a bond is an abstract concept, and describing it as \"unbreakable\" is a metaphor, but is it personification? Hmm, not really. \"Unbreakable\" suggests strength and durability, which can be applied to both literal and figurative bonds. I don't think this is personification.\n\nB. A sculpture is described as speaking.\n\nOh, this sounds promising. Sculptures can't literally speak; they're inanimate objects. So, if the passage says the sculpture \"speaks volumes,\" that's attributing a human-like quality to it\u2014communication through speech. That seems like personification.\n\nC. The artist is described as a storyteller.\n\nHere, the artist is being compared to a storyteller. But the artist is a human, and being a storyteller is also a human activity. So, this isn't personification; it's more of a comparison or metaphor within the same realm of human activities.\n\nD. A sculpture is without frills.\n\nThis seems similar to option A. \"Without frills\" suggests simplicity or lack of decoration. While it's descriptive of the sculpture, it doesn't attribute human qualities to it. It's more about the physical characteristics of the sculpture rather than personifying it.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the best example of personification in the passage. The sculpture is described as \"speaking volumes,\" which gives it a human-like quality of communication, even though it's just a sculpture.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. The passage says, \"Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships.\" This is clearly attributing the ability to speak, which is a human characteristic, to the sculpture. Therefore, it's personification.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is B. A sculpture is described as speaking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
