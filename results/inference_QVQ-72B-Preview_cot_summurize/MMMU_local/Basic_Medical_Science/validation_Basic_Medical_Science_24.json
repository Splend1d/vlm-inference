I need to match these waves with their correct descriptions: atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization. The options are A, B, and C, each pairing these waves with different stages of heart activity.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each wave represents in an ECG. I remember that the heart has two main chambers: the atria and the ventricles. Depolarization is when the heart muscle cells prepare to contract, and repolarization is when they relax after contracting.\n\nSo, the P wave should represent the atrial depolarization, which is when the atria are getting ready to contract. Then, the QRS complex is the ventricular depolarization, meaning the ventricles are preparing to contract. Finally, the T wave is the ventricular repolarization, when the ventricles are relaxing after contracting.\n\nLet me double-check that. Atrial depolarization is the P wave, ventricular depolarization is the QRS complex, and ventricular repolarization is the T wave. That seems right.\n\nOption A says: P wave represents atrial depolarization, QRS segment represents ventricular depolarization, and T wave represents ventricular repolarization. That matches what I just thought.\n\nOption B says: P wave represents ventricular repolarization, QRS segment represents atrial depolarization, and T wave represents ventricular depolarization. That seems confusing because it mixes up the sequences.\n\nOption C says: P wave represents ventricular depolarization, QRS segment represents ventricular repolarization, and T wave represents atrial depolarization. That also doesn't seem to follow the standard ECG waveforms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A: P wave represents atrial depolarization, QRS segment represents ventricular depolarization, and T wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about the sequence of events in the heart's electrical activity.\n\n1. The sinoatrial (SA) node generates an impulse that spreads through the atria, causing them to depolarize and contract. This is the P wave.\n\n2. The impulse then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node and down the bundle branches to the ventricles, causing ventricular depolarization and contraction. This is the QRS complex.\n\n3. Finally, the ventricles repolarize and relax, which is the T wave.\n\nYes, that sequence makes sense. So, Option A is indeed correct.\n\nI should also remember that the Q wave is normally the first downward deflection after the P wave, the R wave is the first upward deflection after the Q, and the S wave is the downward deflection following the R. Together, they form the QRS complex.\n\nIn some ECGs, the Q wave might not be present, depending on the lead and the heart's structure.\n\nBut in this diagram, all P, Q, R, S, and T are labeled, so I assume the Q wave is present here.\n\nAnyway, based on my knowledge, Option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
