The question is about how using over one million small tiles allowed the creator to do certain things. Let me see what options we have.\n\nOption A says it helped depict a disorganized scene that overwhelms the viewer. Hmm, but this seems negative, and mosaics are usually carefully designed, not meant to overwhelm the viewer with disorganization. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B says it allowed modeling the anatomy of the figures naturalistically. That sounds interesting. Mosaics can be detailed, and with a million tiles, you could probably create pretty intricate and realistic figures. Maybe this is a good option.\n\nOption C mentions modifying and transporting the composition easily. Well, mosaics are typically fixed in place once they're laid down. It's not like painting that can be moved around easily. So, I doubt this is the main advantage of using so many tiles.\n\nOption D suggests reducing the figures into abstract forms. That seems more like a style choice rather than something enabled by the number of tiles used. Plus, the Alexander Mosaic is known for its detailed and dynamic representation, not abstraction.\n\nLet me think again. The Alexander Mosaic is a floor mosaic, and it's famous for its vivid depiction of a battle scene, presumably the Battle of Issus between Alexander the Great and Darius III. The mosaic is detailed, with multiple figures, horses, and weapons in action poses.\n\nUsing a large number of small tiles would allow for finer details and more nuanced shading, which could help in achieving a more naturalistic representation of the figures and the scene. So, option B seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe the number of tiles isn't just about detail but also about the overall size of the mosaic. A larger mosaic would need more tiles, but that doesn't directly relate to the artistic achieve... Wait, no, because the question is about what the use of over a million tiles allowed the creator to do, in terms of artistic expression.\n\nPerhaps the creator could achieve a wider range of colors and gradients by using so many tiles, which in turn helped in creating more realistic figures and deeper compositions. That sounds similar to option B, again pointing towards naturalistic anatomy modeling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tiles allowed for creating texture and pattern in a way that enhanced the realism of the scene. But that seems somewhat overlapping with option B.\n\nI think the best answer is option B: model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically. The extensive number of tiles enabled the artist to create detailed and realistic representations of the human and animal figures in the mosaic, capturing the dynamics of the battle scene effectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
