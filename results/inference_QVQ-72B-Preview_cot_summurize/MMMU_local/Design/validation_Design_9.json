Let me look at the image carefully.\n\nFirst off, the triptych is made up of three panels connected by hinges, which allows them to fold closed. It's small enough to be portable, which suggests it might have been used for personal devotion or travel.\n\nLooking at the material, it has a creamy white color with fine detailing. The figures are intricately carved with visible lines and textures that give them a sense of depth and dimension. The clothing drapery is particularly detailed, and the halos around the heads of the figures stand out.\n\nLet me consider each medium one by one.\n\nStarting with carved ivory. Ivory is known for its fine grain and suitability for detailed carving. It was commonly used in medieval art for small sculptures and reliefs. The Harbaville Triptych has a high level of detail, which could be achievable with ivory.\n\nNext, fresco secco. This is a technique where paint is applied to dry plaster. It's typically used on walls and doesn't have the portability factor that this triptych seems to have. Plus, the texture looks more smooth and less porous than plaster would be.\n\nMarble is a popular choice for sculptures, but it's generally heavier and less portable than ivory. The triptych seems lightweight based on its size and appearance, so marble might not be the best fit.\n\nLastly, mosaic. Mosaics are made from small pieces of stone, glass, or other materials embedded in a matrix to form images or patterns. This triptych doesn't appear to have the textured surface or the visible grout lines that mosaics usually have.\n\nConsidering all this, carved ivory seems the most plausible medium for The Harbaville Triptych. It accounts for the fine detailing, the portability, and the creamy white color.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check some characteristics of ivory. Ivory can be carved with great precision, allowing for the intricate details seen in the figures' clothing and facial features. It's also durable yet not excessively heavy, making it ideal for portable objects like this triptych.\n\nFresco secco, on the other hand, is not portable and doesn't offer the same level of fine detail in carving. Marble, while commonly used for sculptures, would likely be too heavy for such a portable item, unless it was very thin, which isn't evident here.\n\nMosaics are typically fixed installations and don't translate well to small, portable objects due to their construction method.\n\nTherefore, based on the visual evidence and the properties of each medium, I'm confident that the correct answer is A. carved ivory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ carved ivory}} \\]"
