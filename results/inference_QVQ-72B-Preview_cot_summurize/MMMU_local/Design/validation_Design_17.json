                    "text": "So I've got this question about color schemes, and I need to pick which one involves using different tints, shades, and intensities of one color. The options are Analogous Color Scheme, Complementary Color Scheme, Monochromatic Color Scheme, and Triadic Color Scheme. Let me try to understand what each of these means.\n\nFirst off, a color scheme is like a way of combining colors in a design or a painting. I've heard of some of these before, but I'm not entirely sure about the details. Let's take them one by one.\n\nStarting with the Analogous Color Scheme. I think analogous colors are ones that are next to each other on the color wheel. So, like blue and green, or red and orange. They're similar because they're close on the wheel, hence \"analogous.\" But the question is about using different tints, shades, and intensities of one color. So, it's about varying the lightness, darkness, or saturation of a single color. Does analogous sound like that? Not really, because analogous involves multiple colors that are related, but not necessarily variations of a single color.\n\nNext is the Complementary Color Scheme. I remember that complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. Like blue and orange, or red and green. These pairs are supposed to create a strong contrast when used together. But again, the question is about different tints, shades, and intensities of one color, not combining two different colors. So, complementary doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nThen there's the Monochromatic Color Scheme. \"Mono\" means one, and \"chromatic\" relates to color. So, monochromatic should mean using one color in different forms. That sounds promising. Tints are lighter versions of a color, shades are darker versions, and intensities refer to how saturated or dull the color is. So, if I'm using various tints, shades, and intensities of one color, that means I'm sticking to one base color but changing its lightness, darkness, or vividness. That fits perfectly with the definition of a monochromatic color scheme.\n\nLastly, there's the Triadic Color Scheme. \"Triadic\" makes me think of three things, probably three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. So, like blue, yellow, and red, which are all spaced 120 degrees apart on the color wheel. This seems to involve using three different colors, not variations of one color. So, again, not matching the description of using different tints, shades, and intensities of one color.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. The question is specifically about using different tints, shades, and intensities of ONE color. So, it's all about variations of a single color, not combining multiple colors. Therefore, the Analogous, Complementary, and Triadic schemes all involve using multiple colors, whereas the Monochromatic scheme focuses on one color and its variations.\n\nI think the answer is clear: C. Monochromatic Color Scheme.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any chance of misinterpretation. For example, could \"one color\" be understood differently? No, I don't think so. \"One color\" means a single hue, and tints, shades, and intensities are modifications of that hue.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider an example. Suppose I have the color blue. A tint of blue would be light blue, almost sky-like. A shade of blue would be navy blue or dark blue. An intensity of blue could be a more vivid or less vivid blue, like going from a pastel blue to a bright electric blue.\n\nAll of these variations are still within the blue family; they're not crossing over into other colors. So, this aligns perfectly with a monochromatic color scheme.\n\nI don't see any other option that fits the description as well as Monochromatic does. Therefore, I'm confident that C. Monochromatic Color Scheme is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
