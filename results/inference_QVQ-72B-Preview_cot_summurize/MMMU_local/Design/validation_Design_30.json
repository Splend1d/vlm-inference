I need to pick the correct answer from these choices.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Chrysler Building is a famous skyscraper in New York City. It's known for its Art Deco style and has a distinctive spire that's really iconic. I think it's one of the tallest buildings in NYC, though I'm not sure about its exact height compared to others now.\n\nOkay, so to answer this question, I need to recall who the architect of the Chrysler Building is. Let me think about this. I remember that Frank Lloyd Wright designed some famous buildings like Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum, but I don't think he designed the Chrysler Building.\n\nI. M. Pei is another famous architect; he designed the Louvre Pyramid in Paris and the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. But again, I don't recall him being associated with the Chrysler Building.\n\nPhilip Johnson is known for the Glass House and other modernist buildings. The Chrysler Building seems older than his typical work, so probably not him.\n\nThat leaves William Van Alen. I think I've heard his name in connection with the Chrysler Building. Let me see if I can confirm this.\n\nI recall that the Chrysler Building was constructed in the 1930s, and it was briefly the tallest building in the world before being surpassed by the Empire State Building. William Van Alen was an American architect who was active around that time, and he was known for his work in the Art Deco style, which matches the Chrysler Building's design.\n\nMoreover, I remember that there was some rivalry between William Van Alen and another architect, H. Craig Severance, regarding the height of their respective buildings. Severance was working on the Bank of Manhattan Building, and Van Alen secretly added the spire to the Chrysler Building to make it taller than the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Eiffel Tower.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems pretty clear that William Van Alen is the architect of the Chrysler Building. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. William Van Alen.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my knowledge. Frank Lloyd Wright was more known for his organic architecture and residential designs, not for skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building. I. M. Pei was a prominent 20th-century architect, but his work was more in the modernist and postmodernist styles, which came after the Art Deco period of the Chrysler Building.\n\nPhilip Johnson was also a modernist architect, and while he did some significant work, the Chrysler Building was built before his rise to prominence.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, William Van Alen is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. William Van Alen}} \\]"
