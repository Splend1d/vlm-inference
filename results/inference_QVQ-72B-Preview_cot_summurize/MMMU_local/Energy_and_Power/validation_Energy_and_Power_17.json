                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have water flowing out of a storm drain with a velocity of 2 m/s and an initial depth of 40 cm. This water then flows onto a porous bed that absorbs the water at a uniform vertical velocity of 8 mm/s. The system is 5 m deep into the paper, and we need to find the length \\(L\\) of the bed that will completely absorb the storm water. The options are 50 m, 70 m, or 90 m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The water is coming out horizontally from the drain at 2 m/s and has an initial depth of 40 cm. As it spreads out onto the porous bed, it's being absorbed at a rate of 8 mm/s vertically. The porous bed is 5 m deep into the paper, so I think this means that the absorption is happening uniformly across this 5 m depth.\n\nTo find the length \\(L\\), I need to figure out how far along the bed the water will spread before it's all absorbed. This seems like a problem involving conservation of mass, where the flow rate of water from the drain equals the absorption rate of the bed.\n\nLet's start by calculating the flow rate from the drain. The drain is releasing water at a velocity of 2 m/s with an initial depth of 40 cm. Assuming the flow is rectangular, the discharge per unit width (in the direction into the paper) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nq = v \\times h = 2 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 0.40 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(q\\) is the discharge per unit width, \\(v\\) is the velocity, and \\(h\\) is the depth.\n\nNow, the porous bed absorbs water at a uniform vertical velocity of 8 mm/s, which is 0.008 m/s. The bed is 5 m deep into the paper, so the absorption rate per unit width is:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption }} = v_{\\text{absorption }} \\times \\text{width} = 0.008 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. The absorption is happening vertically, so the width here should be the width perpendicular to the flow, which is the 5 m depth into the paper. So, the absorption rate per unit length in the direction of flow should be:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption }} = v_{\\text{absorption }} \\times \\text{depth} = 0.008 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\text{ per unit length}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the length \\(L\\), I need to equate the flow rate from the drain to the absorption rate of the bed. So:\n\n\\[\nq = q_{\\text{absorption }} \\times L\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n0.8 = 0.04 \\times L\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(L\\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{0.8}{0.04} = 20 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\n\nHmm, but none of the options are 20 m. Maybe I've missed something.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the absorption rate needs to be considered over the area where the water is spreading. The water spreads laterally as it's being absorbed. Maybe I need to consider the rate at which the water spreads along the length \\(L\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the time it takes for the water to be completely absorbed. If I can find the time, then I can find how far the water has spread in that time.\n\nLet's try that approach. The absorption rate is 8 mm/s, which is the rate at which water is being removed from the bed. If I can find the total volume of water coming from the drain, I can divide that by the absorption rate to find the time it takes to absorb all the water.\n\nFirst, find the total discharge from the drain per unit width:\n\n\\[\nq = 0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nThe absorption rate per unit length is:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption }} = 0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\text{ per meter length}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total absorption rate for the length \\(L\\) is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{absorption }} = q_{\\text{absorption }} \\times L = 0.04 L \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nThe total discharge from the drain is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{drain}} = q \\times \\text{unit width} = 0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 1 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with units. Let's clarify.\n\nThe discharge from the drain is \\(q=0.8 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) per unit width. Since the system is 5 m deep into the paper, the total discharge is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{drain}} = q \\times \\text{width} = 0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} = 4 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nNow, the absorption rate per unit length along the bed is \\(q_{\\text{absorption }}=0.04 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) per meter length. So, for a length \\(L\\), the total absorption rate is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{absorption }} = q_{\\text{absorption }} \\times L = 0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times L \\mathrm{~m} = 0.04 L \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the units are \\(\\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\), which seems inconsistent with the discharge in \\(\\mathrm{m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}\\). Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the mass conservation per unit width and relate the flow depth to the absorption rate.\n\nLet me recall that in unsteady flow, the change in storage is equal to the difference between inflow and outflow. So, for a small element of length \\(d x\\) along the bed, the change in storage \\(d S\\) is:\n\n\\[\nd S = (q - q_{\\text{absorption}}) d x\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I need to use the equation for spreading flow on a porous bed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the water spreads out as a sheet flow, and the volume of water spread per unit time is equal to the absorption rate times the length \\(L\\).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a similar problem or a formula that relates the flow rate to the absorption rate in porous media.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for flow over a porous bed, the length \\(L\\) can be determined by equating the volume flow rate to the absorption rate integrated over the length.\n\nSo, the total volume flow rate from the drain is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{drain}} = v \\times h \\times b = 2 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 0.40 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} = 4 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(b\\) is the width into the paper, which is 5 m.\n\nThe absorption rate per unit area is:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption}} = v_{\\text{absorption}} = 0.008 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nBut since absorption is happening over the area of the bed, the total absorption rate is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{absorption}} = q_{\\text{absorption}} \\times A = 0.008 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times L \\times b = 0.008 \\times L \\times 5 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.04 L \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(Q_{\\text{drain}} = Q_{\\text{absorption}}\\):\n\n\\[\n4 = 0.04 L\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(L\\):\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{4}{0.04} = 100 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\n\nBut 100 m is not among the options either. Maybe I'm missing something fundamental here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps I need to consider the time it takes for the water to be completely absorbed.\n\nThe discharge from the drain is \\(Q_{\\text{drain}}=4 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}\\). The absorption rate is \\(q_{\\text{absorption}}=0.008 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\) over the area \\(A=L \\times b\\).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the time-averaged absorption rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that the water spreads out as it moves along the bed, and the absorption is happening continuously.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the flow rate to the absorption rate in a porous bed.\n\nAfter some searching, I find that for a porous bed with uniform absorption, the length \\(L\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{q}{v_{\\text{absorption}} \\times b}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(q\\) is the discharge per unit width from the drain (in the direction of flow),\n\n- \\(v_{\\text{absorption}}\\) is the absorption velocity,\n\n- \\(b\\) is the width into the paper.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{0.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}}{0.008 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m}} = \\frac{0.8}{0.04} = 20 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 20 m, which isn't among the options. Maybe the formula I found isn't applicable, or perhaps I misinterpreted the units.\n\nLet me try to think about the problem differently. Suppose the water spreads out as a sheet flow, and the absorption rate reduces the flow as it progresses along the bed.\n\nIn that case, the flow rate decreases exponentially with distance along the bed, similar to how current decreases in an electrical circuit with resistance.\n\nThe general equation for such a flow might be:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = q_{0} e^{-k x}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(q(x)\\) is the discharge at distance \\(x\\),\n\n- \\(q_{0}\\) is the initial discharge,\n\n- \\(k\\) is a constant related to the absorption rate.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this approach. Maybe I need to set up a differential equation to model the flow.\n\nLet's assume that the discharge \\(q(x)\\) at a distance \\(x\\) along the bed is decreasing due to absorption. The rate of decrease should be proportional to the absorption rate times the width.\n\nSo, the differential equation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d q}{d x} = -k q\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(k\\) is related to the absorption rate.\n\nSolving this equation:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = q_{0} e^{-k x}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(k\\), I need to relate it to the absorption velocity. The absorption velocity is \\(v_{\\text{absorption}}=0.008 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\), and the width is \\(b=5 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nThe absorption rate per unit length is \\(q_{\\text{absorption}}=v_{\\text{absorption}} \\times b=0.008 \\times 5=0.04 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) per meter length.\n\nSo, the rate of decrease in discharge per unit length is \\(k q\\), which should equal the absorption rate per unit length.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nk q = q_{\\text{absorption}}\n\\]\n\nBut \\(q\\) is a function of \\(x\\), so this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can integrate the absorption rate over the length to find the total absorption, and set it equal to the initial discharge.\n\nThe total absorption over the length \\(L\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{L} q_{\\text{absorption}} d x = q_{\\text{absorption}} L\n\\]\n\nThis should equal the initial discharge \\(q_{0}\\):\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption}} L = q_{0}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nL = \\frac{q_{0}}{q_{\\text{absorption}}} = \\frac{0.8}{0.04} = 20 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I get 20 m, which isn't matching any of the options. Maybe there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nPerhaps the absorption rate isn't constant over the length, or maybe there's another factor I need to consider.\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to consider the fact that the water spreads out in both directions from the drain, not just in one direction.\n\nIf the water spreads out in both directions, then the effective length would be twice the value I calculated.\n\nSo, \\(L=2 \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m}=40 \\mathrm{~m}\\), but that's still not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the absorption rate is affecting the depth of the flow, and I need to consider the change in depth along the bed.\n\nLet me think about the flow depth. The initial depth is 40 cm, and as the water spreads out, the depth decreases due to absorption.\n\nThe discharge per unit width is \\(q=v h\\), where \\(v\\) is the velocity and \\(h\\) is the depth.\n\nIf the velocity remains constant at 2 m/s, then as the depth decreases, the discharge decreases proportionally.\n\nBut the absorption rate is removing water at a rate of \\(v_{\\text{absorption}} \\times b\\), which is \\(0.008 \\times 5=0.04 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) per meter length.\n\nSo, the change in discharge per unit length is equal to the absorption rate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d q}{d x} = -0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}\n\\]\n\nBut \\(q=v h\\), and if \\(v\\) is constant, then \\(d q / d x = v \\frac{d h}{d x}\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nv \\frac{d h}{d x} = -0.04\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d h}{d x} = -\\frac{0.04}{v} = -\\frac{0.04}{2} = -0.02 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{m}}\n\\]\n\nThis means the depth decreases by 0.02 m for every meter along the bed.\n\nGiven the initial depth of 0.40 m, the depth at any point \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\nh(x) = h_{0} - 0.02 x = 0.40 - 0.02 x\n\\]\n\nThe discharge at any point \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = v h(x) = 2 (0.40 - 0.02 x)\n\\]\n\nThe absorption rate per unit length is:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{absorption}} = v_{\\text{absorption}} \\times b = 0.008 \\times 5 = 0.04 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nThe total absorption over the length \\(L\\) is:\n\n\\[\nQ_{\\text{absorption}} = q_{\\text{absorption}} \\times L = 0.04 L \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to relate this to the total discharge from the drain, which is \\(Q_{\\text{drain}}=v h_{0} b=2 \\times 0.40 \\times 5=4 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set up an integral to find the total absorption over the length where the flow depth is greater than zero.\n\nThe flow depth \\(h(x)=0.40 - 0.02 x\\) decreases linearly with \\(x\\). The flow will stop when \\(h(x)=0\\), which occurs at:\n\n\\[\n0.40 - 0.02 x = 0 \\implies x = 20 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the flow spreads up to \\(x=20 \\mathrm{~m}\\), which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut again, this suggests that \\(L=20 \\mathrm{~m}\\), which isn't among the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the absorption rate affects the velocity as well as the depth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the absorption rate is constant, and the length \\(L\\) is determined by the time it takes for all the water to be absorbed.\n\nLet me try calculating the time it takes for the water to be completely absorbed.\n\nThe total volume of water discharged per second is \\(Q_{\\text{drain}}=4 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nThe absorption rate is \\(q_{\\text{absorption}}=0.04 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\) per meter length.\n\nWait, no."
