                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have water flowing upward in a pipe that's slanted at 30 degrees, and there's a mercury manometer attached to it showing a reading of \\( h = 12 \\) cm. We need to find the pressure difference between points (1) and (2) in the pipe.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how a manometer works. A manometer is a device that measures pressure by balancing the weight of a fluid column, like mercury, against the pressure difference. In this case, the pressure at point (1) is different from the pressure at point (2), and that difference is causing the mercury to rise by 12 cm in the manometer.\n\nThe pressure difference \\(\\Delta p\\) that the manometer is measuring can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\rho_{\\text{manometer fluid}} \\times g \\times h\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\rho_{\\text{manometer fluid}}\\) is the density of the manometer fluid (mercury in this case),\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height difference in the manometer.\n\nThe density of mercury is approximately \\( 13600 \\) kg/m\\(^{3}\\), and \\( g \\) is about \\( 9.81 \\) m/s\\(^{2}\\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = 13600 \\, \\text{kg/m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^{2} \\times 0.12 \\, \\text{m} = 13600 \\times 9.81 \\times 0.12\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 13600 \\times 9.81 = 133464 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 133464 \\times 0.12 = 16015.68 \\) Pa\n\nSo, \\(\\Delta p = 16015.68\\) Pa\n\nBut wait, this doesn't match any of the options provided: A. 12400 Pa, B. 36000 Pa, C. 26100 Pa.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.\n\nThe manometer is connected to points (1) and (2) in the pipe, and it's showing a pressure difference due to the difference in pressure between these two points. However, since the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees, and water is flowing upward, there might be additional factors to consider, such as the hydrostatic pressure due to the elevation change in the water itself.\n\nPerhaps the pressure difference measured by the manometer includes both the difference in water pressure due to the elevation change and any other pressure changes between points (1) and (2).\n\nLet's consider the Bernoulli's equation, which relates pressure and fluid velocity at different points in a flow. The equation is:\n\n\\[\np_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( p \\) is pressure,\n\n- \\( \\rho \\) is fluid density,\n\n- \\( v \\) is fluid velocity,\n\n- \\( h \\) is elevation,\n\n- subscripts 1 and 2 refer to points (1) and (2).\n\nRearranging for the pressure difference \\( p_1 - p_2 \\):\n\n\\[\np_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left(v_2^2 - v_1^2\\right) + \\rho g\\left(h_2 - h_1\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, if we assume that the velocities at points (1) and (2) are the same (\\( v_1 = v_2 \\)), which might be a reasonable assumption if the pipe has a constant diameter, then the first term on the right-hand side vanishes, and we're left with:\n\n\\[\np_1 - p_2 = \\rho g\\left(h_2 - h_1\\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven that the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees, the elevation difference \\( h_2 - h_1 \\) can be expressed in terms of the horizontal distance between points (1) and (2) and the angle.\n\nBut looking back at the figure, it shows a rectangular duct with a width of 2 meters, and the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees. The manometer is connected between points (1) and (2), which are along the pipe.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the elevation difference between points (1) and (2) in terms of the vertical height difference.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal distance between points (1) and (2) as \\( l \\), and the vertical height difference as \\( h \\). Given the angle of 30 degrees, we have:\n\n\\[\nh = l \\times \\sin(30^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin(30^\\circ) = 0.5\\), then \\( h = 0.5 \\times l \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( l \\) yet. Maybe I need to find another way to relate these points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference, which includes both the pressure difference due to the water column and any other pressure changes in the system.\n\nLet me consider the pressure difference due to the water column first. If the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees, and the horizontal distance between points (1) and (2) is 2 meters, then the vertical height difference \\( h \\) is indeed \\( 2 \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = 2 \\times 0.5 = 1 \\) meter.\n\nWait, but in the figure, it seems like the horizontal distance is 2 meters, and the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees, so yes, the vertical rise is 1 meter.\n\nNow, the pressure difference due to this elevation change in water would be:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{water}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times h = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^{2} \\times 1 \\, \\text{m} = 9810 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut the manometer is showing a pressure difference of 16015.68 Pa, which is higher than this. So, there must be an additional pressure difference due to other factors, perhaps friction or changes in velocity.\n\nHowever, the problem states that water is flowing upward, and the manometer is connected between points (1) and (2). If we assume that the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference between these two points, then perhaps the total pressure difference is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure difference and any other pressure changes.\n\nBut without more information about the flow conditions, such as velocities or friction losses, it's challenging to determine the exact pressure difference.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider only the manometer reading to find the pressure difference. The manometer reads \\( h = 12 \\) cm in mercury, which corresponds to a pressure difference of:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\rho_{\\text{Hg}} \\times g \\times h = 13600 \\, \\text{kg/m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^{2} \\times 0.12 \\, \\text{m} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps I need to consider the units or see if there's a conversion factor I'm missing.\n\nLet me check the units again. Density of mercury is \\( 13600 \\) kg/m\\(^{3}\\), gravity is \\( 9.81 \\) m/s\\(^{2}\\), and height is \\( 0.12 \\) m. Multiplying them should give pressure in Pascals (N/m\\(^{2}\\)).\n\nWait, maybe the height in the manometer is in centimeters, so \\( h = 12 \\) cm = 0.12 m, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pressure difference is affected by the water flow and not just the manometer reading. Maybe I need to consider the water pressure difference due to the elevation change and combine it with the manometer reading.\n\nLet's try that. First, calculate the pressure difference due to the water column:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{water}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times h = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^{2} \\times 1 \\, \\text{m} = 9810 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nThen, the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference, which includes this hydrostatic pressure difference plus any other pressure differences due to flow conditions.\n\nIf we assume that the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference, then:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{manometer}} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider the direction of flow and how it affects the pressure difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pressure difference is the sum of the manometer reading and the water pressure difference. Let's try adding them:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\Delta p_{\\text{manometer}} + \\Delta p_{\\text{water}} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa} + 9810 \\, \\text{Pa} = 25825.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest hundred, that's approximately 25800 Pa, which is close to option C. 26100 Pa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to subtract the water pressure difference from the manometer reading:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\Delta p_{\\text{manometer}} - \\Delta p_{\\text{water}} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa} - 9810 \\, \\text{Pa} = 6205.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut that doesn't match any options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manometer is measuring the pressure difference after accounting for the water pressure difference. Maybe the total pressure difference is the manometer reading plus the water pressure difference, which as I calculated, is approximately 25800 Pa.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 26100 Pa is close to my calculation of 25800 Pa. Maybe the problem expects us to round differently or consider additional factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the width of the duct and the flow rates, but without more information, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the pressure difference due to the water flow and the elevation change separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me think about Bernoulli's equation again:\n\n\\[\np_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2\n\\]\n\nAssuming steady flow and no friction losses for simplicity, and if the velocities are the same at both points (assuming constant area), then the pressure difference is only due to the elevation change:\n\n\\[\np_1 - p_2 = \\rho g \\left( h_2 - h_1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven that the pipe is slanted at 30 degrees and the horizontal distance is 2 meters, the vertical height difference is 1 meter, as calculated earlier.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\np_1 - p_2 = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^{2} \\times 1 \\, \\text{m} = 9810 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut the manometer is showing a pressure difference of 16015.68 Pa, which is higher than this. This suggests that there are other factors at play, such as friction losses or changes in velocity.\n\nPerhaps the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference, which includes both the hydrostatic pressure difference and the frictional pressure drop.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total pressure difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{hydrostatic}} + \\Delta p_{\\text{friction}}\n\\]\n\nWe already have:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{hydrostatic}} = 9810 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{manometer}} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{friction}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{manometer}} - \\Delta p_{\\text{hydrostatic}} = 16015.68 \\, \\text{Pa} - 9810 \\, \\text{Pa} = 6205.68 \\, \\text{Pa}\n\\]\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the manometer is measuring the total pressure difference, which includes both the hydrostatic and frictional components, and I need to add them:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{hydrostatic}} + \\Delta p_{\\text{friction}}\n\\]\n\nBut without knowing \\(\\Delta p_{\\text{friction}}\\), this doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the manometer is directly measuring the total pressure difference, and the 16015.68 Pa is the correct value, and I should round it to the nearest option, which would be C. 26100 Pa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the units more carefully. The manometer reading is in cm of mercury, and I converted it to Pascals correctly, but perhaps there's a mistake in the density value I used for mercury.\n\nLet me check the density of mercury. I used 13600 kg/m\\(^{3}\\), which is standard. Gravity is 9.81 m/s\\(^{2}\\), and height is 0.12 m. Multiplying them should indeed give 16015.68 Pa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manometer reading needs to be adjusted based on the inclination of the pipe or other factors, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the information provided and the calculations I've done, I think the closest answer is C. 26100 Pa, considering that the manometer measures the total pressure difference, which includes both the hydrostatic pressure difference and any other pressure changes in the system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
