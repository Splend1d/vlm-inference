                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a hose with a diameter of 0.625 inches that's too short, and it's connected to a nozzle with a diameter of 0.375 inches. The distance from the nozzle exit to the garden is 125 feet. We need to find the minimum gauge pressure inside the hose to reach the garden, assuming no losses. The options are 3000 lbf/ft\u00b2, 3600 lbf/ft\u00b2, and 3400 lbf/ft\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Water flows through the hose and exits the nozzle, projecting in the air to reach the garden, which is 125 feet away horizontally. Since losses are neglected, I can use the Bernoulli equation to relate the pressure and velocity at different points.\n\nLet me sketch this mentally: we have the hose connected to the nozzle, and the water exits horizontally towards the garden. The hose is too short, so the entire 125 feet is the horizontal distance the water needs to travel after exiting the nozzle.\n\nI think I need to find the velocity at which the water exits the nozzle to cover 125 feet horizontally. Once I have that velocity, I can use the Bernoulli equation to find the pressure inside the hose.\n\nSo, let's break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the exit velocity required for the water to travel 125 feet horizontally.\n\n2. Use the Bernoulli equation to find the pressure inside the hose that corresponds to this exit velocity.\n\nStarting with part 1: the horizontal range of the water jet.\n\nAssuming the water exits horizontally, the horizontal distance \\(d\\) is given by:\n\n\\[d = v t\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(d\\) is the horizontal distance (125 feet)\n\n- \\(v\\) is the horizontal velocity (which is constant since there's no acceleration in the horizontal direction)\n\n- \\(t\\) is the time of flight\n\nMeanwhile, vertically, the water is falling under gravity. The vertical displacement \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\]\n\nAssuming the garden is at ground level, the vertical displacement is the height from which the water falls to the ground. But since it's a horizontal jet, the initial vertical velocity is zero.\n\nWait a minute, I need to assume that the nozzle is mounted at some height above the ground. If it's mounted at height \\(h\\), then \\(y = -h\\). But the problem doesn't specify the height. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to assume that the nozzle is at ground level, so the water doesn't have any vertical displacement. But that doesn't make sense because then the water wouldn't need to fall; it would just need to move horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nozzle is mounted at a height equal to the height of the garden, so the vertical displacement is zero. But that seems unlikely.\n\nI think I need to consider that the water exits horizontally and falls vertically due to gravity while moving horizontally to the garden.\n\nLet me think about the time of flight. The horizontal velocity is constant, so:\n\n\\[d = v t\\]\n\n\\[t = \\frac{d}{v}\\]\n\nVertically, under free fall:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\]\n\nBut I need to relate \\(y\\) to the height from which the water falls. Maybe I need to express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(v\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the relationship between \\(v\\) and \\(d\\), given the time of flight.\n\nLet me try to express \\(t\\) from the horizontal equation:\n\n\\[t = \\frac{d}{v}\\]\n\nSubstitute into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nBut I still have \\(y\\) and \\(v\\) in this equation. I need another equation to relate them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the range formula for projectile motion. For a horizontal launch, the range \\(d\\) is:\n\n\\[d = v \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is the vertical height from which the water falls.\n\nBut again, I don't know \\(h\\). Maybe I can solve for \\(v\\) in terms of \\(d\\) and \\(h\\), and then relate it back to the pressure.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the Bernoulli equation between the inside of the hose and the exit of the nozzle.\n\nThe Bernoulli equation (neglecting losses) is:\n\n\\[p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^{2} + \\rho g h_1 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^{2} + \\rho g h_2\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(p_1\\) is the pressure inside the hose\n\n- \\(v_1\\) is the velocity inside the hose\n\n- \\(h_1\\) is the height of the hose\n\n- \\(p_2\\) is the pressure at the nozzle exit (atmospheric pressure)\n\n- \\(v_2\\) is the velocity at the nozzle exit\n\n- \\(h_2\\) is the height at the nozzle exit\n\nAssuming the hose and nozzle are at the same height, \\(h_1 = h_2\\), so the height terms cancel out.\n\nAlso, \\(p_2\\) is atmospheric pressure, which is often taken as 0 in gauge pressure terms.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^{2}\\]\n\nRearranged for \\(p_1\\):\n\n\\[p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left(v_2^{2} - v_1^{2}\\right)\\]\n\nI need to find \\(p_1\\), so I need to know \\(v_2\\) and \\(v_1\\).\n\nI know the diameters of the hose and the nozzle, so I can relate their velocities using the continuity equation:\n\n\\[v_1 = v_2 \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = v_2 \\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_1}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nWhere \\(a\\) is the cross-sectional area and \\(d\\) is the diameter.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(d_1 = 0.625\\) inches (hose)\n\n- \\(d_2 = 0.375\\) inches (nozzle)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{0.375}{0.625} = 0.6\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[v_1 = v_2 (0.6)^{2} = 0.36 v_2\\]\n\nNow, plug this into the Bernoulli equation:\n\n\\[p_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left(v_2^{2} - (0.36 v_2)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^{2}\\left(1 - 0.36^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^{2}(1 - 0.1296) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^{2}(0.8704)\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\rho v_2^{2}\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(v_2\\) such that the water reaches 125 feet horizontally.\n\nBack to the projectile motion. Assuming the water exits horizontally, the time of flight \\(t\\) is determined by the vertical fall.\n\nThe vertical displacement \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\]\n\nThe horizontal distance is:\n\n\\[d = v_2 t\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\]\n\nSubstitute into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v_2}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nRearranged for \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[v_2 = d \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 y}}\\]\n\nBut I still have \\(y\\), which is the height from which the water falls. I need to express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(d\\) and \\(v_2\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the water needs to reach a horizontal distance \\(d\\) and that the vertical displacement is such that it hits the ground at that point.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the garden is at ground level, and the nozzle is at height \\(h\\). Then, the vertical displacement is \\(-h\\), and I can solve for \\(v_2\\) in terms of \\(h\\), \\(d\\), and \\(g\\).\n\nFrom the range equation for projectile motion:\n\n\\[d = v_2 t\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[y = -h = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\]\n\nSubstitute into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[-h = -\\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v_2}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v_2}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nRearranged for \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[v_2 = d \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 h}}\\]\n\nNow, I need to express \\(h\\) in terms of known quantities. But I don't know \\(h\\). Maybe I can relate \\(h\\) to the required range \\(d\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum range for a given initial velocity. The maximum range in projectile motion occurs at a launch angle of 45 degrees, and the range formula is:\n\n\\[d_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v^2}{g}\\]\n\nBut in this case, the launch angle is horizontal, so the angle is 0 degrees, and the range is simply:\n\n\\[d = v_2 t\\]\n\nWith \\(t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g}}\\), as before.\n\nI feel like I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the energy per unit mass of the water. The Bernoulli equation gives the total head, which is the sum of pressure head, velocity head, and elevation head. Since there's no change in elevation, the difference in pressure head and velocity head must account for the required exit velocity to reach the garden.\n\nGiven that, I need to find \\(p_1\\) such that \\(v_2\\) is sufficient to propel the water 125 feet horizontally.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the kinetic energy required at the nozzle exit to achieve the desired range.\n\nFirst, find the required \\(v_2\\) to reach 125 feet horizontally.\n\nAssuming the nozzle is at height \\(h\\), and the water falls vertically to the ground.\n\nThe horizontal velocity is constant, so:\n\n\\[d = v_2 t\\]\n\nThe vertical displacement is:\n\n\\[y = -h = -\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\]\n\nSubstitute into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[-h = -\\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v_2}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[h = \\frac{1}{2} g \\left(\\frac{d}{v_2}\\right)^{2}\\]\n\nRearranged:\n\n\\[v_2 = d \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 h}}\\]\n\nNow, I need to express \\(h\\) in terms of known quantities. Maybe I can assume a typical height for the nozzle above the ground. For example, if it's a garden hose, it might be around 1 meter (or about 3.3 feet) above the ground.\n\nLet's assume \\(h = 3.3\\) feet.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[v_2 = 125 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{32.2}{2 \\times 3.3}}\\]\n\nWait, I need to make sure about the units. Let's convert everything to consistent units.\n\nIn the English unit system, pressure is in lbf/ft\u00b2, distance in feet, and so on.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Distance \\(d = 125\\) feet\n\n- Acceleration due to gravity \\(g = 32.2\\) ft/s\u00b2 (standard value)\n\n- Density of water \\(\\rho = 62.4\\) lbm/ft\u00b3\n\nFirst, find \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[v_2 = d \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 h}}\\]\n\nAssuming \\(h = 3.3\\) feet,\n\n\\[v_2 = 125 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{32.2}{2 \\times 3.3}} = 125 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{32.2}{6.6}} = 125 \\times \\sqrt{4.88} \\approx 125 \\times 2.209 \\approx 276.125 \\text{ ft/s}\\]\n\nNow, plug this into the Bernoulli equation to find \\(p_1\\):\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\rho v_2^{2}\\]\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\times 62.4 \\times (276.125)^{2}\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(v_2^{2}\\):\n\n\\[276.125^{2} \\approx 76287.14 \\text{ ft}^{2}/\\text{s}^{2}\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\times 62.4 \\times 76287.14\\]\n\nFirst, \\(0.4352 \\times 62.4 = 27.18\\)\n\nThen, \\(27.18 \\times 76287.14 \\approx 2070000 \\text{ lbf/ft}^{2}\\]\n\nWait, that seems too high compared to the options provided (3000, 3600, 3400 lbf/ft\u00b2). Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the height \\(h\\).\n\nPerhaps the height \\(h\\) is much smaller, leading to a higher required velocity and thus higher pressure. Let's try a different height.\n\nIf I assume \\(h = 1\\) foot (which might be more realistic for a garden hose), then:\n\n\\[v_2 = 125 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{32.2}{2 \\times 1}} = 125 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{32.2}{2}} = 125 \\times \\sqrt{16.1} \\approx 125 \\times 4.01 \\approx 501.25 \\text{ ft/s}\\]\n\nNow, plug into Bernoulli:\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\times 62.4 \\times (501.25)^{2}\\]\n\n\\[p_1 = 0.4352 \\times 62.4 \\times 251251.56 \\approx 0.4352 \\times 62.4 \\times 251251.56\\]\n\nFirst, \\(0.4352 \\times 62.4 = 27.18\\)\n\nThen, \\(27.18 \\times 251251.56 \\approx 6820000 \\text{ lbf/ft}^{2}\\]\n\nThis is even higher than before, which doesn't make sense because higher height should correspond to lower required velocity and pressure.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in assuming the height. Maybe the height is not 1 foot but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the height is negligible, and I should consider the water exiting at ground level.\n\nIf \\(h = 0\\), then the vertical displacement is zero, which implies that the water doesn't need to fall at all, which doesn't make sense because it needs to reach 125 feet horizontally.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the water exits horizontally and needs to reach 125 feet horizontally while staying at the same height, meaning no vertical displacement.\n\nBut that would mean the water is being projected horizontally without any vertical component, which isn't practical because gravity will pull it down.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the range formula for projectile motion, where the range \\(d\\) is given by:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{v^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\]\n\nBut in this case, the launch angle is horizontal, so \\(\\theta = 0\\), and \\(\\sin(0) = 0\\), which would give zero range, which doesn't help.\n\nWait, but if the launch angle is exactly horizontal, the vertical velocity is zero, and the water wouldn't rise or fall; it would just move horizontally at a constant velocity, which isn't realistic for this scenario.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a small vertical component to allow the water to have a trajectory that reaches the garden.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nozzle is mounted at a height such that the vertical displacement is negligible, and I can approximate the horizontal velocity required based on the time of flight.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose the water exits the nozzle horizontally with velocity \\(v_2\\), and I want it to reach 125 feet horizontally.\n\nIf I neglect the time it takes to fall due to gravity, then the required velocity is simply:\n\n\\[v_2 = \\frac{d}{t}\\]\n\nBut I need to account for the time it takes to fall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the range formula for projectile motion launched horizontally:\n\n\\[d = v_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g}}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[v_2 = d \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{2 h}}\\]\n\nBut again, I don't know \\(h\\).\n\nMaybe I can assume that the height \\(h\\) is such that the time of flight \\(t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 h}{g}}\\) corresponds to the time needed to cover 125 feet horizontally at a certain velocity.\n\nBut without knowing \\(h\\), I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \\(h\\) in terms of \\(v_2\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nFrom the horizontal distance:\n\n\\[d = v_2 t\\]\n\nFrom the vertical displacement:\n\n\\[y = -h = -\\frac{1}{2} g"
