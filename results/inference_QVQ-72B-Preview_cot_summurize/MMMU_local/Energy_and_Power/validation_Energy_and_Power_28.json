                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a pipe with radius \\(R\\) carrying air in a fully developed laminar flow. The velocity profile is given by \\(v = v_c\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)\\), where \\(v_c\\) is the centerline velocity and \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the center of the pipe.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total mass flow rate and the average velocity, both expressed as functions of \\(v_c\\) and \\(R\\).\n\n### Step 1: Find the total mass flow rate \\(\\dot{m}\\)\n\nThe mass flow rate \\(\\dot{m}\\) is given by the integral of the velocity times the density over the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\int_{A} \\rho \\, v \\, dA\n\\]\n\nFor laminar flow of air, we can assume constant density \\(\\rho\\), so it can be factored out of the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\rho \\int_{0}^{R} v \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(v = v_c\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)\\), so substitute that in:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\rho \\int_{0}^{R} v_c\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr\n\\]\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = 2\\pi \\rho v_c \\int_{0}^{R} r - \\frac{r^3}{R^2} \\, dr\n\\]\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{R} r \\, dr = \\frac{1}{2}R^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{r^3}{R^2} \\, dr = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}R^4 = \\frac{1}{4}R^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = 2\\pi \\rho v_c \\left( \\frac{1}{2}R^2 - \\frac{1}{4}R^2 \\right) = 2\\pi \\rho v_c \\left( \\frac{1}{4}R^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the average velocity \\(\\bar{v}\\)\n\nThe average velocity is defined as the total volume flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{v} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A}\n\\]\n\nFirst, find the volume flow rate \\(\\dot{V}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\int_{A} v \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{R} v \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr\n\\]\n\nWe already have this integral from the mass flow rate calculation, but without the density:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\int_{0}^{R} v_c\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, integrate term by term:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = 2\\pi v_c \\left( \\frac{1}{2}R^2 - \\frac{1}{4}R^2 \\right) = 2\\pi v_c \\left( \\frac{1}{4}R^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} v_c R^2\n\\]\n\nNow, the cross-sectional area \\(A\\) of the pipe is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi R^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average velocity is:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{v} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2} v_c R^2}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{v_c}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Summary\n\n- Average velocity: \\(\\bar{v} = \\frac{v_c}{2}\\)\n\n- Mass flow rate: \\(\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\\)\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\(\\begin{aligned} \\bar{v} &= \\frac{v_c}{3} \\\\ \\dot{m} &= \\frac{\\pi}{2\\nu} v_c R^2 \\end{aligned}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\begin{aligned} \\bar{v} &= \\frac{v_c}{2} \\\\ \\dot{m} &= \\frac{\\pi}{2\\nu} v_c R^2 \\end{aligned}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\begin{aligned} \\bar{v} &= \\frac{v_c}{2} \\\\ \\dot{m} &= \\frac{\\pi}{2\\nu} v_c R^3 \\end{aligned}\\)\n\nOur calculations show that \\(\\bar{v} = \\frac{v_c}{2}\\), which matches options B and C. However, the mass flow rate we found is \\(\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\\), which does not match any of the options directly. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided, as viscosity \\(\\nu\\) is not present in our expression for mass flow rate in laminar flow of air with constant density.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes incompressible flow with variable density, but that seems unlikely for air. Alternatively, maybe viscosity affects the velocity profile, but in the standard Hagen-Poiseuille flow, viscosity appears in the pressure drop, not directly in the mass flow rate expression at constant density.\n\nGiven that, I believe the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{v} = \\frac{v_c}{2}, \\quad \\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\n\\]\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Option B has \\(\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\nu} v_c R^2\\), which is similar but includes viscosity instead of density. Option C has \\(\\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\nu} v_c R^3\\), which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nPerhaps there's a confusion between different flow models or units. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of viscosity rather than density. However, based on standard fluid mechanics, mass flow rate should involve density, not viscosity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering dimensionless quantities or a different context. But given the information provided, I stand by my calculations.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options seem to be correct based on my calculations. However, since I have to choose among the given options, and my average velocity matches options B and C, but the mass flow rate doesn't match either, I'm in a dilemma.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in my approach. Let me double-check.\n\n### Double-checking the mass flow rate calculation\n\nStarting again:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\rho \\int_{A} v \\, dA = \\rho \\int_{0}^{R} v_c\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr\n\\]\n\nLet's re-evaluate the integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{R} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right) r \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{R} r - \\frac{r^3}{R^2} \\, dr = \\frac{1}{2}R^2 - \\frac{1}{4}R^2 = \\frac{1}{4}R^2\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\rho \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot v_c \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}R^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of kinetic viscosity \\(\\nu\\), but that doesn't seem relevant here for constant density flow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relation involving viscosity that I'm missing. For laminar pipe flow, the centerline velocity is related to the average velocity by \\(v_c = 2 \\bar{v}\\), which matches our earlier result.\n\nPerhaps the mass flow rate is intended to be expressed in terms of viscosity. In that case, recalling the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for volume flow rate:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}\n\\]\n\nBut in this problem, there's no pressure drop or length specified, so that might not be applicable directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps relating viscosity to density through the kinetic viscosity \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\), but again, without knowing \\(\\mu\\) or \\(\\nu\\), that doesn't help directly.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer should be:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{v} = \\frac{v_c}{2}, \\quad \\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\rho v_c R^2\n\\]\n\nBut since none of the options match this exactly, and assuming that there might be a typo or misinterpretation in the options, I would select option B, which has the correct average velocity, even though the mass flow rate doesn't match my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the mass flow rate in terms of viscosity, but that doesn't align with standard laminar flow equations for constant density fluids.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll stick with option B as the closest correct answer, acknowledging that the mass flow rate expression seems inconsistent with my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{B}"
