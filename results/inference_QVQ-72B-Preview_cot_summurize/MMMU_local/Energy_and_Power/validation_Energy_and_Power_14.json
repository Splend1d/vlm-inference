                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem from Figure P2.13, and it involves three different liquids in what I assume is a container divided into sections. The liquids are water, gasoline, and another liquid with a specific gravity of 1.60. The depths are given as 1.5 meters for water and 1 meter for the unknown liquid, and there's a height h for the gasoline section. The problem mentions that the water and gasoline are open to the atmosphere and are at the same elevation, and I need to find the height h of the gasoline.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are three compartments in this container:\n\n1. Water at 1.5 meters depth.\n\n2. Gasoline with height h.\n\n3. An unknown liquid with a specific gravity of 1.60 at 1 meter depth.\n\nAll these are open to the atmosphere, and the water and gasoline are at the same elevation. I think this means that the top surfaces of water and gasoline are at the same height, which might be important for pressure considerations.\n\nI recall that specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, usually water. So, if water has a density of 1000 kg/m\u00b3 at 20\u00b0C, then the unknown liquid has a density of 1.60 times that, which is 1600 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nSince the containers are open to the atmosphere and the water and gasoline are at the same elevation, I think the pressure at the interface where the water and gasoline meet should be the same. Maybe I can set up an equation based on pressure equilibrium at that point.\n\nLet me consider the pressure at the bottom of each section. For water, the pressure due to its column is:\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\text {water }} \\times g \\times\\) depth_water \\(=1000 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2} \\times 1.5 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nSimilarly, for the unknown liquid:\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\text {unknown }} \\times g \\times\\) depth_unknown \\(=1600 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3} \\times 9.81 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2} \\times 1 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nAnd for gasoline, I need to find its height h. I need to know the density of gasoline to relate its pressure.\n\nI think I need to assume that the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline is the same, considering they are at the same elevation and open to the atmosphere.\n\nWait, but gasoline is less dense than water, so if they are in direct contact, which one would be on top? Probably gasoline would float on top of water, but in this problem, it seems like they are in separate compartments, maybe separated by a divider.\n\nLooking back at the figure, it shows three separate compartments side by side, each containing one of the liquids. The top surfaces of water and gasoline are at the same elevation, and they are open to the atmosphere.\n\nI need to ensure that the pressure at the bottom of each compartment is equal because they are all connected at the bottom, or something like that. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, since they are open to the atmosphere, maybe the pressure at the top surface of each liquid is equal to atmospheric pressure.\n\nBut the problem states that water and gasoline are at the same elevation and open to the atmosphere, so perhaps the pressure at their top surfaces is atmospheric pressure, and since they are at the same elevation, the pressure due to the atmosphere is the same for both.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider the hydrostatic pressure equation for each liquid and set them equal at the same vertical level.\n\nLet me recall the hydrostatic pressure equation:\n\n\\(p=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho g h\\)\n\nwhere p is the pressure at a certain depth, \\(p_{\\text {atm }}\\) is the atmospheric pressure, \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the liquid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the depth below the surface.\n\nGiven that the top surfaces are at the same elevation and open to the atmosphere, their pressures are equal to \\(p_{\\text {atm }}\\).\n\nNow, if I consider a horizontal plane at some depth where all three liquids are present, the pressure should be the same across that plane.\n\nBut since the compartments are separate, maybe I need to consider the pressure at the bottom of each compartment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the total pressure exerted by each liquid column and set them equal.\n\nWait, but they have different densities and different heights, so their pressures would be different unless there's some equilibrium condition.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline and set it equal to the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. There are three compartments:\n\n1. Water at 1.5 meters depth.\n\n2. Gasoline at height h.\n\n3. Unknown liquid with SG=1.60 at 1 meter depth.\n\nSince they are open to the atmosphere and at the same elevation, the pressure at the top surface of each liquid is atmospheric pressure.\n\nTherefore, the total pressure at the bottom of each compartment would be:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {total }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho g h\\)\n\nFor water:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5\\)\n\nFor gasoline:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nFor the unknown liquid:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {unknown }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nNow, since the compartments are separate, I'm not sure if their bottom pressures are equal. Maybe they are not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering equilibrium across the entire system, meaning that at any horizontal plane, the pressure should be the same across all compartments.\n\nBut that might not be the case if the compartments are separated.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the fact that the water and gasoline are at the same elevation and open to the atmosphere. Perhaps the pressure at the bottom of the water compartment should be equal to the pressure at the bottom of the gasoline compartment plus the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure due to the water and the unknown liquid should balance the pressure due to the gasoline.\n\nBut I need a clear principle here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total pressure exerted by each liquid column and set up an equilibrium condition.\n\nLet me try to calculate the pressure at the bottom of each compartment.\n\nFor water:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5\\)\n\nFor gasoline:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nFor the unknown liquid:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {unknown }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nNow, if I assume that the bottom of the container is at the same level for all compartments, then the pressure at the bottom should be the same for all compartments.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {unknown }}\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nAnd also:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5=p_{\\text {atm }}+1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nWait a minute, if I set \\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {unknown }}\\), then:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5=p_{\\text {atm }}+1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\(1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5=1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\(14715=15696\\)\n\nWhich is not true. So, my assumption that the bottom pressures are equal must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressures at the interfaces between the liquids need to be equal.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Since the water and gasoline are at the same elevation and open to the atmosphere, their top surfaces are both exposed to atmospheric pressure.\n\nPerhaps the pressure at the bottom of the water compartment should equal the pressure at the bottom of the gasoline compartment plus the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nBut that still doesn't give me a clear equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the total weight of the liquids and set up an equilibrium condition.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the concept of hydrostatic equilibrium. In a system of multiple immiscible fluids, the pressure at any point must be the same in all directions.\n\nBut in this case, the liquids are in separate compartments, so maybe that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the pressure difference between the water and gasoline compartments and relate it to the unknown liquid.\n\nBut I'm still stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the difference in pressure between the water and gasoline compartments and relate it to the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe pressure difference between water and gasoline is:\n\n\\(\\Delta p=p_{\\text {water }}-p_{\\text {gasoline }}=1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5-\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nSimilarly, the pressure difference between water and the unknown liquid is:\n\n\\(\\Delta p=p_{\\text {water }}-p_{\\text {unknown }}=1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5-1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nBut earlier, I saw that these two pressures are not equal, so maybe I need to consider the pressure difference across the system.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look up a similar problem or recall a principle I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to think about the densities.\n\nWater has a density of 1000 kg/m\u00b3, gasoline is less dense, maybe around 700-800 kg/m\u00b3, and the unknown liquid has a specific gravity of 1.60, so its density is 1600 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pressure due to the water column is balanced by the pressure due to the gasoline and the unknown liquid in some way.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to set up the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the weights of the liquids and set up an equilibrium condition.\n\nLet me try to calculate the pressure due to each liquid and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nFirst, for water:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5=p_{\\text {atm }}+14715 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\)\n\nFor gasoline:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nFor the unknown liquid:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {unknown }}=p_{\\text {atm }}+1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1=p_{\\text {atm }}+15696 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\)\n\nNow, if I assume that \\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {gasoline }}\\), then:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {atm }}+14715=p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\(14715=\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nBut I don't know \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}\\), so I need another equation to solve for h.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that \\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {unknown }}\\), then:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {atm }}+14715=p_{\\text {atm }}+15696\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(14715=15696\\)\n\nWhich is not possible. So, my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the pressures are not equal at the bottom of the compartments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure difference between water and gasoline is equal to the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nSo:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}-p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {unknown }}\\)\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n\\((p_{\\text {atm }}+14715)-(p_{\\text {atm }}+\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h)=p_{\\text {atm }}+15696\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\(14715-\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h=15696\\)\n\nBut I still have \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}\\) unknown.\n\nI need another piece of information to solve this.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the fact that the system is in equilibrium and set up an equation based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline and set it equal to the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nSo:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {gasoline }}+p_{\\text {unknown }}\\)\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because pressures don't add up that way.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total weight of the liquids and see if that gives me any insight.\n\nThe weight of water is:\n\n\\(w_{\\text {water }}=1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 1.5\\)\n\nThe weight of gasoline is:\n\n\\(w_{\\text {gasoline }}=\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nThe weight of the unknown liquid is:\n\n\\(w_{\\text {unknown }}=1600 \\times 9.81 \\times 1\\)\n\nBut I'm not sure how to relate these weights to find h.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the pressure differences and set up a ratio based on the densities.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to plug in the options and see which one makes sense.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 5.69 m\n\nB. 2.37 m\n\nC. 1.52 m\n\nLet me see which one satisfies the pressure equilibrium.\n\nAssuming that \\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {gasoline }}\\), then:\n\n\\(14715=\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nIf I know \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}\\), I can solve for h.\n\nBut I don't know \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}\\). Maybe I need to look it up.\n\nI recall that gasoline has a density of around 700-800 kg/m\u00b3 at 20\u00b0C.\n\nLet's assume \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}=750 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\).\n\nThen:\n\n\\(14715=750 \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\n\\(14715=7357.5 h\\)\n\n\\(h=14715 / 7357.5 \\approx 2 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nBut this is not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume \\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }}=720 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\):\n\n\\(14715=720 \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\n\\(14715=7058.4 h\\)\n\n\\(h=14715 / 7058.4 \\approx 2.08 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nMaybe my assumption that \\(p_{\\text {water }}=p_{\\text {gasoline }}\\) is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pressure difference between water and gasoline is equal to the pressure due to the unknown liquid.\n\nSo:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {water }}-p_{\\text {gasoline }}=p_{\\text {unknown }}\\)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\(14715-\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h=15696\\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h=14715-15696=-981 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\)\n\nThis would imply that h is negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure due to the unknown liquid is balancing the pressure difference between water and gasoline.\n\nSo:\n\n\\(p_{\\text {unknown }}=p_{\\text {water }}-p_{\\text {gasoline }}\\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\(15696=14715-\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h\\)\n\nThis would give:\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\text {gasoline }} \\times 9.81 \\times h=14715-15696=-981 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\)\n\nAgain, negative pressure doesn't make sense.\n\n"
