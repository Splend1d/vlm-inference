                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got this figure here, Fig. P2.63, which shows a tank filled with water, and there's a plug at the bottom that's 4 cm in diameter. The plug will pop out if the hydrostatic force on it reaches 25 N. There's also a manometer filled with mercury, and I need to find the reading \\( h \\) on the manometer when the plug pops out. The temperature is 20\u00b0C, but I think that's just to ensure we use the correct densities for water and mercury at that temperature.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a tank with water, and a plug at the bottom that's 4 cm in diameter. There's a manometer attached to the tank, and it's filled with mercury. The manometer has a height difference \\( h \\), which I need to find when the force on the plug reaches 25 N.\n\nI should start by calculating the hydrostatic force on the plug. The force due to pressure at a depth is given by \\( F = p \\times A \\), where \\( p \\) is the pressure and \\( A \\) is the area.\n\nThe pressure at the depth of the plug is \\( p = \\rho \\times g \\times H \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( H \\) is the depth of the water above the plug.\n\nThe area of the plug is \\( A = \\pi r^{2} \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the plug. Given the diameter is 4 cm, the radius is 2 cm or 0.02 m.\n\nSo, \\( A = \\pi \\times (0.02)^{2} = \\pi \\times 0.0004 \\) m\u00b2.\n\nNow, the force on the plug is \\( F = \\rho \\times g \\times H \\times A \\).\n\nWe know that this force equals 25 N when the plug pops out, so:\n\n\\( 25 = \\rho \\times g \\times H \\times \\pi \\times 0.0004 \\).\n\nI need to find \\( H \\), but I see that there's a manometer connected to the tank, and it shows a height \\( h \\). The manometer is filled with mercury, which has a higher density than water.\n\nThe manometer will indicate the pressure at the bottom of the tank relative to the atmospheric pressure. Wait, actually, in this setup, it seems like the manometer is connected to the bottom of the tank, and there's a column of mercury that rises to a height \\( h \\) above the bottom of the tank.\n\nBut looking back at the figure, it shows the manometer connected to the side of the tank, and there's a column of mercury rising to a height \\( h \\) above the water level in the tank.\n\nWait, let's look carefully at the figure. There's a tank with water, and a manometer connected to the bottom of the tank, with a column of mercury rising to a height \\( h \\).\n\nActually, no, looking closer, the manometer is connected to the side of the tank, and there's a column of mercury rising to a height \\( h \\) above the water level in the tank.\n\nI need to relate the pressure at the bottom of the tank to the height \\( h \\) in the manometer.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is due to the water column, \\( p_{\\text{water}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\), where \\( H \\) is the depth of the water above the plug.\n\nThe pressure indicated by the manometer is \\( p_{\\text{manometer}} = \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\), where \\( h \\) is the height difference in the manometer tube.\n\nAssuming the manometer is open to the atmosphere on one side, the pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nWait, actually, if the manometer is open to the atmosphere on one side, and connected to the tank on the other side, then the pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut in reality, the manometer is likely connected to the tank, and the other side is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nWait, but in the figure, it shows the manometer connected to the bottom of the tank, with a column of mercury rising to a height \\( h \\) above the water level in the tank.\n\nActually, perhaps the manometer is connected to the bottom of the tank, and the other side is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I need to find \\( h \\) when the force on the plug reaches 25 N.\n\nFirst, let's express the pressure at the bottom of the tank in terms of \\( H \\), the depth of the water.\n\n\\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nBut wait, the plug is at a depth \\( H \\) below the water surface, so the pressure there is \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nThe force on the plug is \\( F = p \\times A = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\times \\pi r^{2} \\).\n\nWe know that this force equals 25 N when the plug pops out.\n\nSo, \\( 25 = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\times \\pi r^{2} \\).\n\nI can solve for \\( H \\):\n\n\\( H = \\frac{25}{\\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times \\pi r^{2}} \\).\n\nFirst, I need the values for \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\), \\( g \\), and \\( r \\).\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3.\n\n\\( g \\) is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) is 0.02 m.\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n\\( H = \\frac{25}{1000 \\times 9.81 \\times \\pi \\times (0.02)^{2}} \\).\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\( 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times \\pi \\times 0.0004 \\approx 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 3.1416 \\times 0.0004 \\).\n\nFirst, \\( 9.81 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 30.85 \\).\n\nThen, \\( 30.85 \\times 0.0004 = 0.01234 \\).\n\nThen, \\( 1000 \\times 0.01234 = 12.34 \\).\n\nSo, \\( H = \\frac{25}{12.34} \\approx 2.026 \\) meters.\n\nNow, I need to relate this \\( H \\) to the manometer reading \\( h \\).\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column in the manometer.\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( p_{\\text{atm}} \\), and I don't think I need it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up the equation differently.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nThis pressure is also equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column in the manometer.\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\), so maybe I can eliminate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference in pressure between the water and mercury levels.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the pressure difference.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\), and the pressure at the same level as the bottom of the tank on the manometer side is \\( p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n\\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury }} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\), so maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the pressure difference between the water and mercury levels is due to the height difference \\( h \\).\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the hydrostatic equilibrium in the manometer.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the manometer tube plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{manometer bottom}} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to visualize this again.\n\nThere's a tank filled with water, and a manometer connected to the bottom of the tank, with one end open to the atmosphere.\n\nThe manometer contains mercury, and it rises to a height \\( h \\) above the water level in the tank.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nThe pressure at the open end of the manometer is atmospheric pressure, \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\).\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the manometer tube is \\( p_{\\text{manometer bottom}} = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nSince the bottom of the tank and the bottom of the manometer tube are connected, their pressures should be equal:\n\n\\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{manometer bottom }} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I still have \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) in the equation, and I don't know its value.\n\nPerhaps I can eliminate \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) by considering another point in the system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the pressure difference between the water and mercury levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the fact that the pressure at the bottom of the tank is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the manometer tube, which is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the mercury column.\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut without knowing \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\), I can't solve for \\( h \\).\n\nMaybe I need to assume that \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) cancels out or something.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can consider the pressure difference between the water and mercury levels directly.\n\nThe pressure difference due to the mercury column is \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\), and this should be equal to the pressure due to the water column, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( h = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times H}{\\rho_{\\text{mercury}}} \\).\n\nI know \\( \\rho_{\\text{water }} = 1000 \\) kg/m\u00b3, \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury }} = 13599 \\) kg/m\u00b3 at 20\u00b0C, and \\( H \\approx 2.026 \\) m.\n\nSo, \\( h = \\frac{1000 \\times 2.026}{13599} \\approx \\frac{2026}{13599} \\approx 0.149 \\) meters.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match this value.\n\nOption A is 0.152 m, which is close to my calculation, but not exact.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating \\( H \\).\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nEarlier, I calculated \\( H = \\frac{25}{\\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times \\pi r^{2}} \\).\n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\n\\( H = \\frac{25}{1000 \\times 9.81 \\times \\pi \\times (0.02)^{2}} \\).\n\nFirst, \\( (0.02)^{2} = 0.0004 \\) m\u00b2.\n\nThen, \\( 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 3.1416 \\times 0.0004 \\).\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\( 1000 \\times 9.81 = 9810 \\)\n\n\\( 9810 \\times 3.1416 = 30852.768 \\)\n\n\\( 30852.768 \\times 0.0004 = 12.3411072 \\)\n\nSo, \\( H = \\frac{25}{12.3411072} \\approx 2.026 \\) meters.\n\nNow, using this \\( H \\), and knowing \\( \\rho_{\\text{water }} = 1000 \\) kg/m\u00b3, \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury }} = 13599 \\) kg/m\u00b3,\n\n\\( h = \\frac{1000 \\times 2.026}{13599} \\approx \\frac{2026}{13599} \\approx 0.149 \\) meters.\n\nBut option A is 0.152 m, which is close but not exact. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nUsing \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury }} = 13599 \\) kg/m\u00b3,\n\n\\( h = \\frac{2026}{13599} \\approx 0.149 \\) meters.\n\nAlternatively, if I use \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury }} = 13599 \\) kg/m\u00b3, but sometimes densities can vary slightly based on temperature and pressure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the atmospheric pressure in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should not assume that \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) cancels out.\n\nLet me revisit the pressure equilibrium.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the tank is \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the manometer tube is \\( p_{\\text{manometer bottom}} = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nSince they are connected at the bottom, \\( p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_{\\text{manometer bottom}} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\), so maybe I need to express \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) in terms of pressure head.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the manometer reading \\( h \\) as the difference in height between the mercury levels on both sides.\n\nWait, in the figure, the manometer is likely a U-tube manometer, with one side connected to the tank and the other side open to the atmosphere.\n\nThe difference in height between the mercury levels on the two sides of the manometer is \\( h \\).\n\nThe pressure difference between the two sides is \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nTherefore, the pressure at the tank side is \\( p_{\\text{tank}} = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nBut \\( p_{\\text{tank}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H = p_{\\text{atm }} + \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\).\n\nI still have \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\) in the equation, which I don't know.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the atmospheric pressure is the same on both sides, but in reality, the atmospheric pressure is present on both sides, so maybe it cancels out.\n\nWait, no. The pressure at the bottom of the tank is \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H \\), and the pressure at the open end of the manometer is \\( p_{\\text{atm }} \\).\n\nThe pressure difference due to the mercury column is \\( \\rho_{\\text{mercury}} \\times g \\times h \\), and this should be equal to the pressure difference between the tank and the atmosphere.\n\nSo, \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\times g \\times H -"
