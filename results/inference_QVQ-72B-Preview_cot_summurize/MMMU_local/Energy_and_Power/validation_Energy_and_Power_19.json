                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about a jet engine, and we need to find the reaction force \\( R_x \\) that the test stand needs to provide to hold the engine in place. The engine is taking in air at a certain temperature and pressure, adding fuel, burning it in the combustion chamber, and then expelling the gases at a higher speed. Our goal is to calculate \\( R_x \\), which is likely the horizontal force reaction due to the thrust of the jet.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n\n- Air enters at \\( 20^\\circ \\mathrm{C} \\) and 1 atm pressure.\n\n- Inlet area \\( A_1 = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2 \\) and velocity \\( V_1 = 250 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} \\).\n\n- Fuel-air ratio is 1:30, meaning for every 1 unit of fuel, there are 30 units of air by mass.\n\n- Air leaves at 1 atm, \\( V_2 = 900 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} \\), and \\( A_2 = 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2 \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( R_x \\), which is the reaction force in the horizontal direction.\n\nSince it's a jet engine on a test stand, the reaction force \\( R_x \\) should be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the thrust produced by the jet engine.\n\nThrust can be calculated using the momentum equation, which states that the thrust \\( T \\) is equal to the mass flow rate times the change in velocity of the exhaust gases.\n\nSo, \\( T = \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) \\), where \\( \\dot{m} \\) is the mass flow rate, \\( V_2 \\) is the exit velocity, and \\( V_1 \\) is the inlet velocity.\n\nGiven that, \\( R_x \\) would be equal to \\( T \\), but in the opposite direction.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m} \\).\n\nWe can find \\( \\dot{m} \\) using the inlet conditions:\n\n\\( \\dot{m} = \\rho_1 \\times A_1 \\times V_1 \\), where \\( \\rho_1 \\) is the density of air at inlet conditions.\n\nWe know that air at standard atmospheric conditions (1 atm and 20\u00b0C) has a density of approximately \\( 1.225 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^3} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\dot{m} = 1.225 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^3} \\times 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2 \\times 250 \\, \\mathrm{m/s} = 1.225 \\times 0.5 \\times 250 = 153.125 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nWait a minute, but the fuel is being added, so the mass flow rate should include both the air and the fuel.\n\nGiven the fuel-air ratio is 1:30, for every 30 kg of air, there's 1 kg of fuel.\n\nSo, total mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} + \\dot{m}_{\\text{fuel}} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} + \\frac{\\dot{m}_{\\text{air}}}{30} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{30}\\right) = \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} \\times \\frac{31}{30} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = 153.125 \\times \\frac{31}{30} = 153.125 \\times 1.0333 \\approx 158.25 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nNow, the thrust \\( T = \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} (V_2 - V_1) = 158.25 \\times (900 - 250) = 158.25 \\times 650 = 103362.5 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\).\n\nSo, \\( R_x = 103362.5 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which is closest to option B. 102,000 N.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, mass flow rate of air \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} = 1.225 \\times 0.5 \\times 250 = 153.125 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\), correct.\n\nFuel-air ratio is 1:30, so fuel mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{fuel}} = \\frac{153.125}{30} \\approx 5.1042 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nTotal mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = 153.125 + 5.1042 = 158.229 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\), which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThrust \\( T = 158.229 \\times (900 - 250) = 158.229 \\times 650 = 103348.85 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which rounds to 103,349 N.\n\nSo, the closest option is B. 102,000 N.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it. Maybe we need to consider the pressure forces or something else.\n\nLet's think about the control volume. The combustion chamber is taking in air and fuel, burning them, and expelling gases at a higher speed.\n\nThe control volume includes the inlet, outlet, and possibly the combustion chamber walls.\n\nThe momentum equation for steady flow is:\n\n\\( \\sum F = \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) + \\int P \\, dA \\), where \\( P \\) is pressure.\n\nIn this case, since the inlet and outlet are both at atmospheric pressure, the pressure forces should cancel out.\n\nSo, \\( R_x = \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} (V_2 - V_1) = 103,349 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which is still closest to option B.\n\nBut let's check if there's any change in pressure forces that we need to consider.\n\nGiven that both inlet and outlet are at 1 atm, and assuming no external forces like gravity or friction, the net force should just be due to the change in momentum of the fluid.\n\nTherefore, \\( R_x = 103,349 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which is closest to option B. 102,000 N.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A is 99,000 N, option B is 102,000 N, and option C is 121,000 N.\n\nOur calculation gives approximately 103,349 N, which is closest to option B.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something. Maybe the area change or something else affects the mass flow rate.\n\nLet's consider the continuity equation to ensure mass conservation.\n\nAt inlet: \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = \\rho_1 \\times A_1 \\times V_1 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{30}\\right) = 158.229 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nAt outlet: \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = \\rho_2 \\times A_2 \\times V_2 \\).\n\nAssuming ideal gas law, \\( \\rho = \\frac{P}{R T} \\), but since both inlet and outlet are at the same pressure and temperature (assuming exhaust gases are at 1 atm and some temperature), the density might not be the same.\n\nWait, actually, the exhaust gases have a different composition and possibly different temperature, so density might change.\n\nPerhaps I need to account for the change in density.\n\nLet's see.\n\nGiven that the combustion process changes the composition and temperature of the gases, the density at the outlet might be different from that at the inlet.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific heat capacities or the combustion products, it's challenging to determine the exact outlet density.\n\nMaybe I should assume that the outlet gases are at 1 atm and some temperature \\( T_2 \\), and use the ideal gas law to find \\( \\rho_2 \\).\n\nBut I don't know \\( T_2 \\). Perhaps I need to make an assumption or use some other information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the continuity equation to relate the inlet and outlet velocities and areas.\n\nContinuity equation: \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = \\rho_1 \\times A_1 \\times V_1 = \\rho_2 \\times A_2 \\times V_2 \\).\n\nBut since \\( \\rho_2 \\) is unknown, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( \\rho_2 \\) in terms of \\( \\rho_1 \\) and the temperature ratio.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law:\n\n\\( \\rho = \\frac{P}{R T} \\), so \\( \\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\), assuming constant pressure.\n\nBut I don't know \\( T_2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the thrust equation more carefully.\n\nThe thrust \\( T \\) is equal to \\( \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) + (P_2 - P_1) A_2 \\), where \\( P_2 \\) and \\( P_1 \\) are the pressures at the outlet and inlet, respectively.\n\nGiven that \\( P_1 = P_2 = 1 \\) atm, the pressure term vanishes, and we're left with \\( T = \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) \\), which is what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a term for the force exerted by the combustion chamber walls.\n\nBut assuming the combustion chamber is fixed, and the only forces are due to the inlet and outlet flows, then the earlier calculation should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the weight of the fuel and air, but since it's a horizontal flow, gravity shouldn't affect the horizontal reaction force.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a term related to the combustion process itself, like the heat addition, but that should be accounted for in the change in velocity.\n\nI think the initial calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 103,349 N, which is closest to option B. 102,000 N.\n\nHowever, since the exact answer isn't matching any of the options perfectly, perhaps there's a different approach or a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass flow rate of air:\n\n\\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{air}} = \\rho_1 \\times A_1 \\times V_1 = 1.225 \\times 0.5 \\times 250 = 153.125 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nFuel-air ratio is 1:30, so \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{fuel}} = \\frac{153.125}{30} \\approx 5.1042 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nTotal mass flow rate \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} = 153.125 + 5.1042 = 158.229 \\, \\mathrm{kg/s} \\).\n\nThrust \\( T = \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} (V_2 - V_1) = 158.229 \\times (900 - 250) = 158.229 \\times 650 = 103348.85 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\).\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nPerhaps the options are approximate, and B. 102,000 N is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the change in pressure forces more carefully.\n\nLet's assume that the outlet pressure is not exactly 1 atm due to the high velocity, and there might be some pressure recovery.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to quantify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combustion chamber adds mass beyond just the fuel, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass flow rate calculation needs to account for the change in density due to combustion.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specific heat capacities or the products of combustion, it's challenging to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the fuel mass, considering only the air mass flow rate.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the fuel is being burned and adds to the mass of the exhaust gases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fuel mass is negligible compared to the air mass, but with a fuel-air ratio of 1:30, it's about 3.4% of the total mass, which isn't negligible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the air mass flow rate and ignore the fuel.\n\nBut that would give \\( T = 153.125 \\times (900 - 250) = 153.125 \\times 650 = 99,533.75 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which is close to option A. 99,000 N.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the fuel is being burned and should contribute to the mass flow rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider the fuel mass but not add it directly to the air mass flow rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for thrust in jet engines that I'm not considering.\n\nLet me look up the thrust equation for jet engines.\n\nThrust \\( T = \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) + (P_2 - P_1) A_2 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P_2 = P_1 = 1 \\) atm, the pressure term drops out, leaving \\( T = \\dot{m} (V_2 - V_1) \\).\n\nAssuming total mass flow rate includes both air and fuel, then \\( T = 158.229 \\times 650 = 103,348.85 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which rounds to 103,349 N, closest to option B.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider only the air mass flow rate, \\( T = 153.125 \\times 650 = 99,533.75 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\), which is close to option A.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the fuel is being burned and should contribute to the mass flow rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fuel mass is being expelled at a different velocity, but without more information, it's hard to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the fuel mass separately, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to include the total mass flow rate, including both air and fuel, and calculate the thrust as \\( \\dot{m}_{\\text{total}} (V_2 - V_1) \\), which gives approximately 103,349 N, closest to option B. 102,000 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 102,000 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
