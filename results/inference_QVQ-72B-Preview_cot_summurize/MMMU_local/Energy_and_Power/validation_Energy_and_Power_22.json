                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a pipe flow system driven by pressurized air in a tank, and we need to find the gauge pressure \\(p_1\\) required to maintain a water flow rate of \\(60 \\mathrm{~m}^3/\\mathrm{h}\\) at \\(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\). The pipe is smooth with a diameter of \\(5 \\mathrm{~cm}\\), and there's an open jet at the end of the pipe. The vertical distances are given: the tank is \\(10 \\mathrm{~m}\\) high, and there's a \\(80 \\mathrm{m}\\) vertical rise in the pipe, with horizontal extensions of \\(30 \\mathrm{~m}\\) and \\(60 \\mathrm{m}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a tank with pressurized air above the water, and the water flows through a pipe that has a series of bends and finally exits as an open jet. The flow rate is given, so I can start by calculating the velocity in the pipe.\n\nGiven:\n- Flow rate, \\(Q = 60 \\mathrm{~m}^3/\\mathrm{h}\\)\n- Pipe diameter, \\(d = 5 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.05 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n- Water temperature, \\(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\)\n\nFirst, convert the flow rate to cubic meters per second:\n\\[Q = 60 \\mathrm{~m}^3/\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~h}}{3600 \\mathrm{~s}} = 0.01667 \\mathrm{~m}^3/\\mathrm{s}\\]\n\nNext, calculate the cross-sectional area of the pipe:\n\\[A = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\times (0.05)^2}{4} \\approx 0.0019635 \\mathrm{~m}^2\\]\n\nThen, find the velocity in the pipe:\n\\[v = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{0.01667}{0.0019635} \\approx 8.49 \\mathrm{~m/s}\\]\n\nNow, I need to consider the energy losses in the pipe system. Since the pipe is smooth, friction losses will depend on the pipe's length, the fluid's viscosity, and the velocity.\n\nFirst, calculate the total length of the pipe. From the figure:\n\n- Horizontal section before the vertical rise: \\(60 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\n- Vertical rise: \\(80 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\n- Horizontal section after the vertical rise: \\(30 \\mathrm{m}\\)\n\nTotal pipe length, \\(L = 60 + 80 + 30 = 170 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nNext, determine the Darcy friction factor, \\(f\\). Since the pipe is smooth and the flow is turbulent (assuming \\(Re > 4000\\), which is likely given the velocity), we can use the smooth pipe friction factor formula or use a value from a friction factor chart. For smooth pipes at high Reynolds numbers, \\(f\\) is approximately 0.005 to 0.02. I'll use \\(f = 0.02\\) as an initial estimate.\n\nNow, calculate the head loss due to friction:\n\\[h_f = f \\times \\frac{L}{d} \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[h_f = 0.02 \\times \\frac{170}{0.05} \\times \\frac{(8.49)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} \\approx 0.02 \\times 3400 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 0.02 \\times 3400 \\times 3.67 \\approx 240 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nThis seems too high compared to the static head differences in the system, so I need to check my assumption of \\(f\\). Maybe the flow is laminar, or perhaps I need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime.\n\nCalculate the Reynolds number, \\(Re\\):\n\\[Re = \\frac{\\rho v d}{\\mu}\\]\n\nAt \\(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\), water properties are:\n- Density, \\(\\rho = 998 \\mathrm{~kg}/\\mathrm{m}^3\\)\n- Dynamic viscosity, \\(\\mu = 1.002 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\)\n\nSo,\n\\[Re = \\frac{998 \\times 8.49 \\times 0.05}{1.002 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx \\frac{42.87}{0.001002} \\approx 42800\\]\n\nSince \\(Re > 4000\\), the flow is turbulent. For smooth pipes in the turbulent regime, the friction factor can be estimated using the Swamee-Jain equation or other empirical formulas. I'll use the Swamee-Jain equation:\n\n\\[f = 0.25 \\left( \\ln \\left( \\frac{e}{3.7d} + \\frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}} \\right) \\right)^{-2}\\]\n\nAssuming the pipe is smooth, \\(e = 0\\):\n\n\\[f = 0.25 \\left( \\ln \\left( \\frac{0}{3.7 \\times 0.05} + \\frac{5.74}{42800^{0.9}} \\right) \\right)^{-2}\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the term inside the logarithm:\n\n\\[\\frac{5.74}{42800^{0.9}} \\approx \\frac{5.74}{26926} \\approx 0.000213\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[f = 0.25 \\left( \\ln(0.000213) \\right)^{-2}\\]\n\nBut \\(\\ln(0.000213) \\approx -8.8\\), so:\n\n\\[f = 0.25 \\times (-8.8)^{-2} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{1}{77.44} \\approx 0.0032\\]\n\nThis is a much smaller friction factor than my initial estimate of 0.02. So, recalculate \\(h_f\\):\n\n\\[h_f = 0.0032 \\times \\frac{170}{0.05} \\times \\frac{(8.49)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} \\approx 0.0032 \\times 3400 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 0.0032 \\times 3400 \\times 3.67 \\approx 40 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nThat's a more reasonable value.\n\nNext, consider minor losses from the bends and the exit. For each bend, assume a loss coefficient \\(K\\). Typically, a 90-degree bend has \\(K \\approx 0.2\\). Assuming there are two 90-degree bends:\n\nTotal minor loss from bends: \\(h_{m,bends} = 2 \\times 0.2 \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} \\approx 0.4 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 1.44 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nAt the exit, there's an open jet, which typically has a loss coefficient of \\(K = 1\\):\n\n\\[h_{m,exit} = 1 \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} \\approx 1 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 3.67 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nTotal minor losses: \\(h_m = 1.44 + 3.67 = 5.11 \\mathrm{~m}\\)\n\nNow, apply the Bernoulli equation between the tank and the exit. Let's set the datum at the exit point for simplicity.\n\nIn the tank, the pressure is \\(p_1\\), and the elevation is \\(z_1 = 10 \\mathrm{~m} + 80 \\mathrm{~m} = 90 \\mathrm{~m}\\) (since the pipe rises \\(80 \\mathrm{~m}\\) after the tank).\n\nAt the exit, the pressure is atmospheric, \\(p_2 = 0\\) (gage pressure), and the elevation is \\(z_2 = 0 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nThe velocity in the tank is negligible compared to the pipe velocity, so we can assume \\(v_1 \\approx 0\\).\n\nThe Bernoulli equation with head losses is:\n\n\\[p_1/\\rho g + z_1 + v_1^2/(2g) = p_2/\\rho g + z_2 + v_2^2/(2g) + h_f + h_m\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 90 + 0 = 0 + 0 + \\frac{8.49^2}{2 \\times 9.81} + 40 + 5.11\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 90 = 0 + 0 + 3.67 + 40 + 5.11\\]\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 90 = 48.78\\]\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) = -41.22\\]\n\nThis doesn't make sense because pressure can't be negative. I must have made a mistake in setting up the Bernoulli equation.\n\nLet me re-examine the elevations. The tank is \\(10 \\mathrm{~m}\\) high, and the pipe rises \\(80 \\mathrm{~m}\\), so the total elevation difference is \\(90 \\mathrm{~m}\\). However, the exit is at a lower elevation than the tank, so \\(z_2 < z_1\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the direction of the pipe. If the pipe rises \\(80 \\mathrm{m}\\) and then extends horizontally, the exit is at the same elevation as the tank base plus the rise, but the tank is \\(10 \\mathrm{~m}\\) high. If the pipe exits at the same elevation as the tank base plus the rise, then \\(z_2 = 10 \\mathrm{~m} + 80 \\mathrm{m} = 90 \\mathrm{~m}\\), but if it exits lower, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the figure, it shows a vertical rise of \\(80 \\mathrm{~m}\\), then a horizontal section \\(30 \\mathrm{~m}\\) long, and finally an open jet. Assuming the open jet is at the same elevation as the base of the tank, then \\(z_2 = 0 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nSo, \\(z_1 = 10 \\mathrm{~m}\\) (tank elevation), and \\(z_2 = 0 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nNow, rewrite the Bernoulli equation:\n\n\\[p_1/\\rho g + z_1 + v_1^2/(2g) = p_2/\\rho g + z_2 + v_2^2/(2g) + h_f + h_m\\]\n\nAssume \\(v_1 \\approx 0\\), \\(p_2 = 0\\) (gage pressure), \\(z_1 = 10 \\mathrm{~m}\\), \\(z_2 = 0 \\mathrm{~m}\\), \\(v_2 = 8.49 \\mathrm{~m/s}\\), \\(h_f = 40 \\mathrm{~m}\\), \\(h_m = 5.11 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 10 + 0 = 0 + 0 + \\frac{(8.49)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} + 40 + 5.11\\]\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 10 = 0 + 0 + 3.67 + 40 + 5.11\\]\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 10 = 48.78\\]\n\nSubtract 10:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) = 38.78\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(p_1\\):\n\n\\[p_1 = 38.78 \\times 998 \\times 9.81\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(998 \\times 9.81 \\approx 9789.18 \\mathrm{~N/m}^2\\)\n\nThen, \\(p_1 = 38.78 \\times 9789.18 \\approx 379300 \\mathrm{~N/m}^2 = 379.3 \\mathrm{kPa}\\)\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the provided options. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the friction factor or the minor losses.\n\nLet me double-check the friction factor calculation.\n\nGiven \\(Re = 42800\\), and for smooth pipes, using the Swamee-Jain equation:\n\n\\[f = 0.25 \\left( \\ln \\left( \\frac{0}{3.7d} + \\frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}} \\right) \\right)^{-2}\\]\n\nCalculate \\(\\frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}} = \\frac{5.74}{42800^{0.9}} \\approx \\frac{5.74}{26926} \\approx 0.000213\\)\n\nThen, \\(f = 0.25 \\left( \\ln(0.000213) \\right)^{-2}\\)\n\nBut \\(\\ln(0.000213) \\approx -8.8\\), so \\(f = 0.25 \\times (-8.8)^{-2} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{1}{77.44} \\approx 0.0032\\), which seems correct.\n\nNow, recalculate \\(h_f\\):\n\n\\[h_f = f \\times \\frac{L}{d} \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} = 0.0032 \\times \\frac{170}{0.05} \\times \\frac{(8.49)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} \\approx 0.0032 \\times 3400 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 40 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nWait, \\( \\frac{170}{0.05} = 3400 \\), and \\( \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 3.67 \\), so \\( 0.0032 \\times 3400 \\times 3.67 \\approx 40 \\mathrm{~m} \\), which seems correct.\n\nMaybe the minor loss estimation is off. Let's check the minor losses again.\n\nFor the bends: two 90-degree bends with \\(K = 0.2\\):\n\n\\[h_{m,bends} = 2 \\times 0.2 \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} = 0.4 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 1.44 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nFor the exit: open jet with \\(K = 1\\):\n\n\\[h_{m,exit} = 1 \\times \\frac{v^2}{2g} = 1 \\times \\frac{72}{19.62} \\approx 3.67 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\n\nTotal minor losses: \\(1.44 + 3.67 = 5.11 \\mathrm{~m}\\), which seems reasonable.\n\nNow, plug these back into the Bernoulli equation:\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 10 = \\frac{(8.49)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} + 40 + 5.11\\]\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) + 10 = 3.67 + 40 + 5.11 = 48.78\\]\n\n\\[p_1/(998 \\times 9.81) = 38.78\\]\n\n\\[p_1 = 38.78 \\times 998 \\times 9.81 \\approx 379300 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider the pressure inside the tank.\n\nWait, the pressure \\(p_1\\) is the gauge pressure inside the tank above the water surface. But the water depth in the tank is \\(10 \\mathrm{~m}\\), which exerts its own hydrostatic pressure.\n\nThe absolute pressure at the bottom of the tank is:\n\n\\[p_{\\text{bottom}} = p_1 + \\rho g h = p_1 + 998 \\times 9.81 \\times 10 \\approx p_1 + 97891.8 \\mathrm{~Pa}\\]\n\nBut the pipe is connected to the bottom of the tank, so the pressure driving the flow is \\(p_{\\text{bottom}}\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the absolute pressure at the bottom of the tank as the driving pressure.\n\nLet me adjust the Bernoulli equation accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s set the datum at the bottom of the tank, so \\(z_1 = 0 \\"
