                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a hollow steel sphere with a diameter of 14 inches, so the radius R is 7 inches. The wall thickness is 0.16 inches, and the specific gravity of steel is 7.85. We need to find out how much weight to add inside the sphere to make it neutrally buoyant in water.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what neutral buoyancy means. It means that the weight of the sphere plus the added weight equals the weight of the water it displaces. So, if we can calculate the buoyant force and the total weight of the sphere with the added weight, we can set them equal and solve for the added weight.\n\nLet's start by finding the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3. But since it's hollow, we need to subtract the volume of the inner sphere.\n\nFirst, find the inner radius. The wall thickness is 0.16 inches, so the inner radius r is R - wall thickness = 7 in - 0.16 in = 6.84 inches.\n\nNow, the volume of the steel in the sphere is the difference between the outer and inner volumes:\n\nV_steel = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 - (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV_steel = (4/3)\u03c0(7\u00b3 - 6.84\u00b3) = (4/3)\u03c0(343 - 319.254) = (4/3)\u03c0(23.746) \u2248 (4/3)*3.1416*23.746 \u2248 4.1887*23.746 \u2248 100.9 cu.in.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation.\n\nFirst, calculate R\u00b3 and r\u00b3:\n\n7\u00b3 = 343\n\n6.84\u00b3 = 6.84 * 6.84 * 6.84\n\nFirst, 6.84 * 6.84 = 46.7536\n\nThen, 46.7536 * 6.84 \u2248 319.254\n\nSo, 343 - 319.254 = 23.746\n\nThen, (4/3)\u03c0*23.746 \u2248 4.1887*23.746 \u2248 99.9 cu.in.\n\nHmm, slight difference from my earlier calculation, maybe due to rounding. I'll go with approximately 100 cu.in.\n\nNow, the mass of the steel is the volume times the density. Specific gravity of steel is 7.85, and the density of water is 1 g/cm\u00b3 or 62.4 lb/ft\u00b3.\n\nWait, I need to be consistent with units. The volume is in cubic inches, and specific gravity is given, so let's convert.\n\nFirst, convert cubic inches to cubic feet:\n\n1 cubic foot = 12*12*12 = 1728 cubic inches.\n\nSo, 100 cu.in / 1728 cu.ft/cu.in = approximately 0.0579 cu.ft.\n\nNow, density of steel is 7.85 times the density of water. The density of water is 62.4 lb/ft\u00b3.\n\nSo, density of steel = 7.85 * 62.4 \u2248 490.8 lb/ft\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, mass of steel = density * volume = 490.8 lb/ft\u00b3 * 0.0579 ft\u00b3 \u2248 28.3 lb.\n\nSo, the weight of the steel sphere is approximately 28.3 pounds.\n\nNow, let's find the buoyant force. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.\n\nThe volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(7\u00b3) = (4/3)*3.1416*343 \u2248 1436.75 cu.in.\n\nConvert to cubic feet: 1436.75 / 1728 \u2248 0.83 cu.ft.\n\nThe weight of water displaced is volume * density of water = 0.83 ft\u00b3 * 62.4 lb/ft\u00b3 \u2248 51.55 lb.\n\nNow, for neutral buoyancy, the total weight of the sphere plus the added weight should equal the buoyant force.\n\nSo, weight_sphere + weight_added = buoyant_force\n\n28.3 lb + weight_added = 51.55 lb\n\nTherefore, weight_added = 51.55 lb - 28.3 lb \u2248 23.25 lb.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest is 25 lbf.\n\nBut let's check if there's any error in the calculations.\n\nFirst, the volume of the steel:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3) = (4/3)*3.1416*(343 - (7 - 0.16)^3)\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The inner radius should be R - wall thickness = 7 - 0.16 = 6.84 inches, and then r\u00b3 = 6.84\u00b3.\n\nLet me recalculate r\u00b3:\n\n6.84 * 6.84 = 46.7536\n\n46.7536 * 6.84 \u2248 319.254\n\nSo, R\u00b3 - r\u00b3 = 343 - 319.254 = 23.746 cu.in.\n\nThen, V_steel = (4/3)*\u03c0*23.746 \u2248 4.1887*23.746 \u2248 99.9 cu.in.\n\nThen, volume in cubic feet: 99.9 / 1728 \u2248 0.0578 cu.ft.\n\nDensity of steel: 7.85 * 62.4 = 490.8 lb/ft\u00b3.\n\nMass of steel: 490.8 * 0.0578 \u2248 28.3 lb.\n\nVolume of the sphere: (4/3)*\u03c0*R\u00b3 = (4/3)*3.1416*343 \u2248 1436.75 cu.in.\n\nConvert to cubic feet: 1436.75 / 1728 \u2248 0.83 cu.ft.\n\nBuoyant force: 0.83 * 62.4 \u2248 51.55 lb.\n\nAdded weight: 51.55 - 28.3 \u2248 23.25 lb.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 23.25 pounds, which rounds to 25 lbf.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the buoyant force based on the volume of water displaced by the outer sphere and the weight of the sphere based on the volume of the steel.\n\nThe buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the outer sphere, which we calculated as 51.55 lb.\n\nThe weight of the sphere is the volume of the steel times the density of steel, which we calculated as 28.3 lb.\n\nTherefore, the additional weight needed is 51.55 - 28.3 = 23.25 lb, which rounds to 25 lbf.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider the volume of the hollow part.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nThe volume of the hollow part is V_hollow = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the inner radius.\n\nBut actually, V_hollow = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3), which is what we calculated earlier as approximately 99.9 cu.in.\n\nThe volume of the sphere is V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = 1436.75 cu.in.\n\nThe volume of the steel is V_steel = V_sphere - V_hollow = 1436.75 - 99.9 = 1336.85 cu.in., wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, V_steel = V_sphere - V_hollow, but V_hollow is the volume inside the sphere, which is not correct. Wait, no.\n\nWait, V_steel = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3), which is what we calculated earlier as approximately 99.9 cu.in.\n\nBut according to the formula, V_steel = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3), and V_hollow = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\n\nSo, V_steel = (4/3)\u03c0(R\u00b3 - r\u00b3) = approximately 99.9 cu.in., which seems correct.\n\nThen, the weight of the steel sphere is V_steel * density_steel = 99.9 cu.in. * (7.85 * 0.036127 lb/cu.in.) \u2248 28.3 lb, where 0.036127 lb/cu.in. is the density of water.\n\nAlternatively, density of steel is 7.85 g/cm\u00b3 or 490.8 lb/ft\u00b3, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the weight of the sphere is approximately 28.3 lb.\n\nThe buoyant force is the weight of the water displaced by the sphere, which is V_sphere * density_water = 1436.75 cu.in. * 0.036127 lb/cu.in. \u2248 51.55 lb.\n\nTherefore, the added weight needed is 51.55 lb - 28.3 lb \u2248 23.25 lb, which rounds to 25 lbf.\n\nHence, the answer is approximately 25 lbf.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\ \\text{lbf}} \\]"
