                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem about a heat engine. I've got to find the first and second-law efficiencies, and there are some given options to choose from. The problem involves air flowing into the engine at certain conditions, receiving heat, losing some heat, and then exiting at another set of conditions. I need to make sure I understand all the parts of the diagram and the processes involved.\n\nFirst, let's try to visualize what's going on. There's a heat engine with air flowing into it at ambient pressure and temperature, which are 100 kPa and 300 K, respectively. The air receives heat from a high-temperature source at 1500 K, specifically 1200 kJ per kilogram of air. During the process, there's some heat loss of 300 kJ per kilogram of air at 750 K. Finally, the air exits the engine at 100 kPa and 800 K.\n\nI need to find the first-law efficiency, which is basically the thermal efficiency of the engine, and the second-law efficiency, which is related to the exergetic efficiency or how well the engine utilizes the available energy.\n\nLet me start with the first-law efficiency. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved; in other words, the energy input minus the energy output equals the change in internal energy of the system. For a heat engine, the thermal efficiency is typically defined as the work output divided by the heat input.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the work output and the heat input to calculate the thermal efficiency.\n\nFrom the problem, the heat input \\( q_h \\) is 1200 kJ/kg of air.\n\nThere's also a heat loss of 300 kJ/kg at 750 K, so the net heat input would be \\( q_h - q_{\\text{loss}} = 1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about that. Actually, the heat loss is energy that's being rejected from the system, so it's reducing the available energy for conversion into work. So, the net heat supplied to the engine is indeed \\( q_h - q_{\\text{loss}} \\).\n\nNow, to find the work output, I can use the first law for a control volume, which is often expressed as:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}} = w_{\\text{out}}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( q_{\\text{net}} \\) is the net heat transferred to the system and \\( w_{\\text{out}} \\) is the work output.\n\nGiven that, \\( q_{\\text{net}} = q_h - q_{\\text{loss}} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( w_{\\text{out}} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nSo, the thermal efficiency \\( \\eta_{\\text{th}} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{q_h} = \\frac{900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}}{1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe I've missed something.\n\nLet me double-check the first law. Perhaps I need to account for the change in internal energy of the air.\n\nThe general form of the first law for a control volume with steady flow is:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}} - w_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta u\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\Delta u \\) is the change in specific internal energy of the air.\n\nGiven that the air enters at 300 K and exits at 800 K, I need to find \\( \\Delta u \\).\n\nAssuming air is an ideal gas, \\( u \\) is a function of temperature only.\n\nI need to find \\( u_2 - u_1 \\), where \\( u_2 \\) is the internal energy at 800 K and \\( u_1 \\) is at 300 K.\n\nI need specific heat data for air at constant volume, \\( c_v \\), to calculate \\( \\Delta u = c_v (T_2 - T_1) \\).\n\nFor air, at room temperature, \\( c_v \\) is approximately 0.718 kJ/kg\u00b7K.\n\nBut since the temperature changes significantly (from 300 K to 800 K), I should consider if \\( c_v \\) changes with temperature.\n\nLooking up the specific heats of air at different temperatures, I find that \\( c_v \\) increases slightly with temperature.\n\nTo be precise, I can use the average \\( c_v \\) over the temperature range.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the specific heat at constant volume at a mean temperature.\n\nLet's calculate the average temperature and find \\( c_v \\) at that temperature.\n\nAverage temperature \\( T_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{300 \\, \\text{K} + 800 \\, \\text{K}}{2} = 550 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\nAt 550 K, \\( c_v \\) for air is approximately 0.745 kJ/kg\u00b7K.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\Delta u = 0.745 \\, \\text{kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\times (800 \\, \\text{K} - 300 \\, \\text{K}) = 0.745 \\, \\text{kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\times 500 \\, \\text{K} = 372.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nNow, plugging back into the first law:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}} - w_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta u\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}) - w_{\\text{out}} = 372.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - w_{\\text{out}} = 372.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw_{\\text{out}} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 372.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} = 527.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nNow, the thermal efficiency is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{q_h} = \\frac{527.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}}{1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}} \\approx 0.4396\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} \\approx 0.44\n\\]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match any of the options provided. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating \\( \\Delta u \\).\n\nLet me check the specific heat value at 550 K. Perhaps I should use a more accurate value or consider the variation of \\( c_v \\) with temperature more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the specific heat at constant pressure, \\( c_p \\), since we're dealing with enthalpy changes.\n\nWait a second, in a control volume, it's often more convenient to use enthalpy changes rather than internal energy changes, especially for steady-flow processes.\n\nThe first law for a steady-flow process can be written as:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}} - w_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta h\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\Delta h \\) is the change in specific enthalpy of the air.\n\nGiven that the air enters at 300 K and exits at 800 K, and pressure remains constant at 100 kPa, I can find \\( h_2 - h_1 \\).\n\nAgain, assuming air is an ideal gas, \\( h = u + p v = u + R T \\), where \\( R \\) is the specific gas constant for air, approximately 0.287 kJ/kg\u00b7K.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\Delta h = \\Delta u + R (T_2 - T_1) \\).\n\nFrom earlier, \\( \\Delta u = c_v (T_2 - T_1) \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\Delta h = c_p (T_2 - T_1) \\), where \\( c_p = c_v + R \\).\n\nAt average temperature, \\( c_p \\approx 1.005 \\, \\text{kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\).\n\nThus, \\( \\Delta h = 1.005 \\, \\text{kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\times (800 \\, \\text{K} - 300 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.005 \\, \\text{kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\times 500 \\, \\text{K} = 502.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nNow, applying the first law:\n\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}} - w_{\\text{out}} = \\Delta h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}) - w_{\\text{out}} = 502.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - w_{\\text{out}} = 502.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw_{\\text{out}} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 502.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} = 397.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nNow, the thermal efficiency is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{q_h} = \\frac{397.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}}{1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}} \\approx 0.33125\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} \\approx 0.33\n\\]\n\nThis is closer to one of the options, but not exactly. Maybe I need to consider the heat loss more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the heat loss occurs at 750 K, which might affect the calculation.\n\nLet me think about the energy balance again.\n\nThe heat input is 1200 kJ/kg at 1500 K, and there's a heat loss of 300 kJ/kg at 750 K.\n\nSo, the net heat input is indeed 900 kJ/kg, but perhaps the heat loss affects the work output differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the energy balance equation more carefully.\n\nLet's consider the energy entering and leaving the control volume.\n\nEnergy in: \\( q_h = 1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\)\n\nEnergy out: \\( w_{\\text{out}} \\), \\( q_{\\text{loss}} = 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\), and \\( h_2 - h_1 = 502.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\)\n\nSo, the energy balance is:\n\n\\[\nq_h = w_{\\text{out}} + q_{\\text{loss}} + (h_2 - h_1)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n1200 = w_{\\text{out}} + 300 + 502.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1200 = w_{\\text{out}} + 802.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nw_{\\text{out}} = 1200 - 802.5 = 397.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the thermal efficiency is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{q_h} = \\frac{397.5}{1200} \\approx 0.33125\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.33 or 33.125%.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.32 and 0.67, option B is 0.32 and 0.74, option C is 0.67 and 0.32, and option D is 0.74 and 0.32.\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 0.33 for the first-law efficiency, which is closest to 0.32 in the options. Maybe I made a rounding error, or perhaps I need to consider something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the heat loss is not just subtracted directly from the heat input. Maybe it's part of the rejected heat.\n\nLet me consider the standard definition of thermal efficiency for a heat engine:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{q_h}\n\\]\n\nBut in this case, \\( q_h \\) is the heat supplied from the high-temperature source, and \\( q_{\\text{loss}} \\) is a part of that heat that is lost to a lower temperature reservoir.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the net heat input is indeed \\( q_h - q_{\\text{loss}} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\), and then \\( w_{\\text{out}} = 397.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{397.5}{1200} \\approx 0.33125\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the net heat input as 900 kJ/kg, then:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{397.5}{900} \\approx 0.4416\n\\]\n\nBut that doesn't match any options either.\n\nI think the correct approach is to consider the total heat input as 1200 kJ/kg, and the work output as 397.5 kJ/kg, so:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{397.5}{1200} \\approx 0.33125\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 0.33.\n\nLooking back at the options, none have exactly 0.33, but option A has 0.32, which is close.\n\nMaybe I need to consider more significant figures or check my assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the heat loss as part of the rejected heat, and calculate the efficiency based on the available heat.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should move on to the second-law efficiency and see if that helps.\n\nThe second-law efficiency, or exergetic efficiency, is a measure of how well the engine utilizes the available energy, considering the quality of the energy sources and sinks.\n\nThe general formula for second-law efficiency is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{II}} = \\frac{\\text{actual work output}}{\\text{maximum possible work output}}\n\\]\n\nThe maximum possible work output can be determined based on the exergy of the heat inputs and outputs.\n\nExergy is the maximum useful work obtainable from a system as it comes to equilibrium with a reference environment.\n\nIn this case, the exergy input is related to the heat supplied at 1500 K, and the exergy loss is related to the heat lost at 750 K.\n\nThe ambient conditions are 100 kPa and 300 K, which should be considered as the reference environment.\n\nThe exergy of heat \\( q \\) at temperature \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\ne = q \\left(1 - \\frac{T_0}{T}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( T_0 \\) is the ambient temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that, the exergy input from the high-temperature source is:\n\n\\[\ne_h = q_h \\left(1 - \\frac{T_0}{T_h}\\right) = 1200 \\left(1 - \\frac{300}{1500}\\right) = 1200 \\left(1 - 0.2\\right) = 1200 \\times 0.8 = 960 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nThe exergy loss due to the heat loss at 750 K is:\n\n\\[\ne_{\\text{loss}} = q_{\\text{loss}} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_0}{T_m}\\right) = 300 \\left(1 - \\frac{300}{750}\\right) = 300 \\left(1 - 0.4\\right) = 300 \\times 0.6 = 180 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the net exergy input is:\n\n\\[\ne_{\\text{net}} = e_h - e_{\\text{loss}} = 960 - 180 = 780 \\, \\text{kJ/kg}\n\\]\n\nThe actual work output is \\( w_{\\text{out}} = 397.5 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\).\n\nTherefore, the second-law efficiency is:\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{II}} = \\frac{w_{\\text{out}}}{e_{\\text{net}}} = \\frac{397.5}{780} \\approx 0.5096\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\eta_{\\text{II}} \\approx 0.51\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options directly. Option A has 0.32 and 0.67, option B has 0.32 and 0.74, option C has 0.67 and 0.32, and option D has 0.74 and 0.32.\n\nI must be making a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the exergy calculations.\n\nExergy of heat at temperature \\( t \\) is indeed \\( q \\left(1 - \\frac{T_0}{T}\\right) \\), where \\( T \\) is in Kelvin.\n\nSo, for \\( q_h = 1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\) at \\( T_h = 1500 \\, \\text{"
