                    "text": "So I'm looking at this problem about a solid-propellant rocket. The figure isn't here, but it's described as Fig. P3.35, and it seems to show a solid-propellant rocket with some given parameters at the exit section. The problem is asking me to compute the rate of mass loss of the propellant using a control-volume analysis, assuming that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on in this rocket. Solid-propellant rockets have their fuel and oxidizer combined in a solid form, usually in the rocket motor. When the propellant is ignited, it burns and produces high-pressure gases that are then expanded through a nozzle to produce thrust.\n\nThe control-volume approach involves defining a fixed region in space (the control volume) and applying conservation laws across it. In this case, the control volume would likely encompass the combustion chamber and the nozzle of the rocket.\n\nGiven parameters at the exit section are:\n\n- Diameter (D_e) = 18 cm\n\n- Pressure (P_e) = 90 kPa\n\n- Velocity (V_e) = 150 m/s\n\n- Temperature (T_e) = 750 K\n\nAnd the combustion chamber conditions:\n\n- 1500 K, 920 kPa\n\nBut since it's a solid-propellant rocket, there are no entrance ducts, so all the propellant is contained within the rocket itself.\n\nI need to find the rate of mass loss of the propellant. That means, how much mass is being consumed per unit time to produce the exhaust gases.\n\nTo do this, I can use the continuity equation, which states that the mass flow rate into the control volume minus the mass flow rate out of the control volume equals the rate of mass accumulation within the control volume.\n\nIn steady flow, if we assume no mass is accumulating inside the control volume, then the mass flow rate in equals the mass flow rate out.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a rocket engine, the flow is steady, so mass flow rate in equals mass flow rate out.\n\nHowever, since it's a solid rocket, there's no mass flowing in from the outside; the propellant is being consumed from within the rocket.\n\nTherefore, the mass flow rate out is equal to the rate of mass loss of the propellant.\n\nSo, if I can find the mass flow rate at the exit, that should give me the rate of mass loss of the propellant.\n\nThe mass flow rate (m_dot) can be calculated as:\n\nm_dot = rho * A * V\n\nWhere:\n\n- rho is the density of the fluid\n\n- A is the cross-sectional area\n\n- V is the velocity\n\nSo, I need to find the density at the exit section.\n\nDensity can be found using the ideal gas law:\n\nrho = P / (R * T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is pressure\n\n- R is the specific gas constant\n\n- T is temperature\n\nGiven that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28, I can find R using the universal gas constant and the molecular weight.\n\nThe universal gas constant (R_u) is approximately 8.314 J/(mol*K)\n\nThen, R = R_u / MW = 8.314 / 28 \u2248 0.297 J/(g*K) or 297 J/(kg*K)\n\nBut wait, units should be consistent. Let's see:\n\nPressure is in kPa, temperature in Kelvin, velocity in m/s, and diameter in cm.\n\nFirst, convert diameter to meters: 18 cm = 0.18 m\n\nThen, calculate the cross-sectional area:\n\nA = pi * D^2 / 4 = 3.1416 * (0.18)^2 / 4 \u2248 0.0254 m\u00b2\n\nNow, calculate density:\n\nrho = P / (R * T)\n\nBut need to make sure units are consistent. Pressure is in kPa, which is 1000 Pa.\n\nSo, P = 90 kPa = 90,000 Pa\n\nT = 750 K\n\nR = 0.297 kPa.m\u00b3/(kg*K)\n\nWait, no. If R is in J/(kg*K), then:\n\nrho = P / (R * T) = 90,000 / (297 * 750) \u2248 90,000 / 222,750 \u2248 0.404 kg/m\u00b3\n\nNow, mass flow rate:\n\nm_dot = rho * A * V = 0.404 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.0254 m\u00b2 * 150 m/s \u2248 0.404 * 0.0254 * 150 \u2248 0.404 * 3.81 \u2248 1.54 kg/s\n\nBut this seems too high. Let me check my units and calculations.\n\nFirst, make sure that R is in consistent units. If R is given in J/(kg*K), then P should be in Pa, V in m/s, A in m\u00b2, and m_dot in kg/s.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the specific gas constant in kPa.m\u00b3/(kg*K).\n\nLet me try that.\n\n1 Pa = 1 N/m\u00b2 = 1 kg/(m.s\u00b2)\n\nSo, R = 0.297 kPa.m\u00b3/(kg*K)\n\nThen, rho = P / (R * T) = 90 kPa / (0.297 kPa.m\u00b3/(kg*K) * 750 K) = 90 / (0.297 * 750) = 90 / 222.75 \u2248 0.404 kg/m\u00b3\n\nSame result.\n\nThen, m_dot = rho * A * V = 0.404 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.0254 m\u00b2 * 150 m/s \u2248 1.54 kg/s\n\nBut looking back at the options, they are negative values, like -10.0 kg/s, -11.8 kg/s, -12.4 kg/s.\n\nWhy is it negative? Maybe the sign indicates the direction of flow.\n\nIn any case, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the combustion chamber conditions.\n\nCombustion chamber pressure is 920 kPa, temperature is 1500 K.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the expansion process from the combustion chamber to the exit section.\n\nAssuming adiabatic expansion, I can relate the properties at the two sections.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary if I'm using the exit conditions directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the thrust equation, since thrust is related to mass flow rate and velocity.\n\nThe thrust equation is:\n\nF = m_dot * (V_e - V_o) + (P_e * A_e - P_o * A_o)\n\nWhere:\n\n- F is thrust\n\n- m_dot is mass flow rate\n\n- V_e is exit velocity\n\n- V_o is ambient velocity (usually 0)\n\n- P_e is exit pressure\n\n- P_o is ambient pressure\n\n- A_e is exit area\n\nBut ambient conditions aren't provided, so maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, in rocket engines, the mass flow rate is often related to the thrust and specific impulse.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think about the control volume.\n\nIf I take a control volume around the rocket motor, including the combustion chamber and nozzle, then:\n\n- There's no mass flowing in from the outside; the propellant is being consumed from within.\n\n- Mass flows out through the nozzle.\n\n- Therefore, the rate of mass loss of the propellant should equal the mass flow rate at the exit.\n\nSo, m_dot_prop_loss = m_dot_exit\n\nWhich is what I calculated as 1.54 kg/s\n\nBut this doesn't match the options provided, which are much higher and negative.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the molecular weight differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the fact that the propellant has a certain density and volume, and as it burns, it produces gases at a certain expansion ratio.\n\nBut without knowing the propellant's density or volume, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the energy released per unit mass of propellant.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specific heat of the propellant, that might be too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the conservation of mass in terms of the propellant mass loss and the exhaust gas mass flow rate.\n\nIf the propellant consists of fuel and oxidizer, and they combine to produce exhaust gases, then the mass of propellant consumed should equal the mass of exhaust gases produced, assuming no mass is lost elsewhere.\n\nBut in reality, some mass might be lost as unburned particles or through other means, but perhaps we can assume complete combustion.\n\nGiven that, my initial approach seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the molecular weight of the propellant.\n\nBut the problem states that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28, which is likely the exhaust gas, not the propellant.\n\nI need to find the rate of mass loss of the propellant, which is different from the exhaust gas.\n\nPerhaps I need to relate the propellant mass to the exhaust gas mass based on the combustion process.\n\nBut without knowing the propellant composition and the combustion products, that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the continuity equation in integral form over the control volume.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nDefine the control volume as the entire rocket motor, from the propellant grain to the nozzle exit.\n\nAssume steady flow, no mass accumulation inside.\n\nThen, integral of (rho * V * dA) over the control surface equals zero.\n\nIn this case, only the exit section has mass flowing out.\n\nSo, rho_e * V_e * A_e = m_dot_exit\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the fact that the propellant is being consumed at a certain rate to produce the exhaust gases.\n\nIf I know the mass of propellant needed to produce a certain mass of exhaust gases, I can relate them.\n\nBut without knowing the propellant composition or the combustion efficiency, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the thrust equation to relate the mass flow rate to the thrust, but again, thrust isn't provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the mass flow rate at the exit, but I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the fact that the propellant is being consumed at a rate equal to the mass flow rate at the exit, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nDiameter = 18 cm = 0.18 m\n\nArea = pi * D^2 / 4 = 3.1416 * (0.18)^2 / 4 \u2248 0.0254 m\u00b2\n\nPressure = 90 kPa = 90,000 Pa\n\nTemperature = 750 K\n\nMolecular weight = 28\n\nSpecific gas constant R = R_u / MW = 8.314 / 28 \u2248 0.297 kPa.m\u00b3/(kg*K)\n\nThen, rho = P / (R * T) = 90 / (0.297 * 750) \u2248 0.404 kg/m\u00b3\n\nMass flow rate = rho * A * V = 0.404 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.0254 m\u00b2 * 150 m/s \u2248 1.54 kg/s\n\nBut this is much lower than the options provided, which are around -10 to -12 kg/s.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing a factor of two or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the fact that the propellant consists of both fuel and oxidizer, and their combined mass loss equals the exhaust gas mass flow rate.\n\nBut again, without knowing the propellant composition, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the expansion ratio or the area ratio from the combustion chamber to the exit section.\n\nThe combustion chamber pressure is 920 kPa, temperature 1500 K, and exit pressure is 90 kPa.\n\nAssuming isentropic expansion, I can find the area ratio A_e / A_throat.\n\nBut without knowing the throat area or the specific heat ratios, that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the isentropic relations to find the density ratio.\n\nrho_e / rho_c = (P_e / P_c)^(1/gamma)\n\nWhere gamma is the specific heat ratio.\n\nFor diatomic gases, gamma is approximately 1.4.\n\nSo, rho_e / rho_c = (90 / 920)^(1/1.4) \u2248 (0.0978)^{0.714} \u2248 0.524\n\nThen, rho_c = rho_e / 0.524 \u2248 0.404 / 0.524 \u2248 0.771 kg/m\u00b3\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps me find the mass flow rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the mass flow rate through the nozzle.\n\nIn nozzle flow, the mass flow rate is given by:\n\nm_dot = rho * A * V\n\nBut in isentropic flow, this should be constant along the nozzle, assuming no friction or heat transfer.\n\nBut in reality, the area changes, so perhaps I need to consider the throat area.\n\nHowever, without knowing the throat area or the expansion ratio, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the continuity equation in terms of mass flow rate being constant.\n\nBut again, that brings me back to the exit mass flow rate being 1.54 kg/s.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options are much higher, perhaps I need to consider that the propellant mass loss includes both the fuel and oxidizer, whereas the exhaust gases are only part of that.\n\nBut in a solid rocket, the propellant is a mixture of fuel and oxidizer, and when it burns, it produces exhaust gases plus some solid residues or other products.\n\nWithout knowing the exact composition and the combustion products, it's hard to relate the propellant mass loss directly to the exhaust gas mass flow rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the molecular weight of the propellant, but that's not provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the thrust equation to find the mass flow rate.\n\nThrust F = m_dot * V_e + (P_e - P_o) * A_e\n\nBut again, thrust isn't given, and ambient pressure isn't provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the specific impulse, but that's not provided either.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to consider that the mass flow rate I calculated is too low because I missed a factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diameter is not the diameter of the exit section but of the combustion chamber or something else.\n\nBut the problem states that D_e = 18 cm is the exit section diameter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity is not the actual velocity but some other velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the Mach number or something like that.\n\nBut without more information, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the exhaust gases are not ideal gases, but again, the problem states to assume ideal gas behavior.\n\nGiven that, perhaps my initial calculation is correct, and the options provided are incorrect or refer to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rate of mass loss is negative, indicating loss over time, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the negative sign indicates the direction of flow, but that's just a convention.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the propellant mass loss includes both the mass of the exhaust gases and any unburned residues.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specifics, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the energy balance and find the mass loss based on the energy released.\n\nBut without knowing the heat of combustion or other energy terms, that's not feasible.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll stick with my initial calculation.\n\nMass flow rate at exit = 1.54 kg/s\n\nTherefore, rate of mass loss of propellant is approximately 1.5 kg/s\n\nBut that's not among the options, which are -10.0 kg/s, -11.8 kg/s, -12.4 kg/s\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the exit velocity is actually higher or that the diameter is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecular weight is different, but it's given as 28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the exhaust gases are at a higher temperature or pressure, leading to a higher density.\n\nBut given the calculations, that doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the propellant mass loss is higher because some mass is not converted to exhaust gases.\n\nBut again, without more information, that's speculative.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose the closest option, which is -10.0 kg/s\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[
