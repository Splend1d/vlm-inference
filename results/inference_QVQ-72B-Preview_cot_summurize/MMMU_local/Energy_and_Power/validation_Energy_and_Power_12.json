                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an adiabatic container that's initially evacuated, meaning there's nothing inside it. Then, we have a supply line filled with air at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F. When the valve is opened, air flows into the container until the pressure inside the container equals the pressure in the supply line. We need to find the work potential of the air in the container after it's filled. The ambient temperature is given as T0 = 80\u00b0F.\n\nFirst, let's understand what work potential is. Work potential, also known as exergy, is the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system as it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings. So, in this case, the surroundings are at 80\u00b0F, and the container is filled with air at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F.\n\nSince the container is adiabatic, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings during the filling process. But we're dealing with exergy, which involves both work and heat interactions with the surroundings.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the concept of exergy balance. The exergy of the air in the container after filling is equal to the exergy that was transferred with the mass as the air filled the container.\n\nLet's recall the exergy balance equation for a control volume:\n\nExergy_in - Exergy_out = Exergy_accumulated + Irreversibilities\n\nIn this scenario, exergy enters the container with the mass flow of air, and there are no exergy outputs. Assuming the process is quasi-static or reversible for maximum work potential, we can neglect irreversibilities.\n\nSo, Exergy_in = Exergy_accumulated\n\nNow, exergy_in is the exergy of the air entering the container, which depends on the state of the air (pressure and temperature) and the ambient state.\n\nThe specific exergy (exergy per unit mass) of a fluid relative to the ambient state can be calculated as:\n\nex = (h - h0) - T0*(s - s0)\n\nwhere h and s are the specific enthalpy and entropy of the fluid, and h0 and s0 are the specific enthalpy and entropy at the ambient state.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the concept of specific exergy based on the deviation from the ambient state. For ideal gases, exergy can be expressed in terms of pressure and temperature ratios.\n\nGiven that air is an ideal gas, we can use the following formula for specific exergy:\n\nex = RT0 * ln(P/P0) + Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0)\n\nwhere:\n\n- R is the specific gas constant for air (about 53.34 ft*lbf/lbm*\u00b0R)\n\n- Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure for air (about 0.24 Btu/lbm/\u00b0F)\n\n- P is the pressure of the air in the container (150 psia)\n\n- P0 is the ambient pressure (assuming it's 14.7 psia, unless stated otherwise)\n\n- T is the temperature of the air in the container (90\u00b0F, converted to \u00b0R)\n\n- T0 is the ambient temperature (80\u00b0F, converted to \u00b0R)\n\nFirst, we need to convert temperatures to absolute scales in \u00b0R (Rankine):\n\nT = 90\u00b0F + 460 = 550 \u00b0R\n\nT0 = 80\u00b0F + 460 = 540 \u00b0R\n\nAnd pressures to absolute pressures, assuming psia is already absolute (psia stands for pounds per square inch absolute).\n\nNow, plug in the values into the specific exergy formula.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the units. The formula requires consistent units. Let's check:\n\n- R = 53.34 ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R\n\n- Cp = 0.24 Btu/lbm/\u00b0F\n\n- P and P0 are in psia, which is lbm*ft/l*s\u00b2*in\u00b2\n\nThis might get messy with unit conversions. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the exergy per unit mass formula in terms of pressure and temperature ratios without worrying about the gas constant, by expressing everything in terms of specific volumes or using property tables.\n\nBut since air is an ideal gas, we can use the specific exergy formula directly.\n\nLet me compute ex first.\n\nFirst, convert R to units compatible with Btu.\n\nGiven that 1 Btu = 778.16 ft*lbf, and R = 53.34 ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R, then R = 53.34 / 778.16 = 0.06857 Btu/lbm/\u00b0R\n\nSimilarly, Cp = 0.24 Btu/lbm/\u00b0F\n\nNow, compute ex:\n\nex = R*T0*ln(P/P0) + Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0)\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nex = (0.06857 * 540 * ln(150/14.7)) + (0.24*(550 - 540)) - (540 * 0.24 * ln(550/540))\n\nWait, is P0 14.7 psia? The problem doesn't specify the ambient pressure, only the ambient temperature. Maybe I need to assume standard atmospheric pressure, which is 14.7 psia at sea level.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that ln is natural logarithm.\n\nLet me calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst term: R*T0*ln(P/P0) = 0.06857 * 540 * ln(150/14.7)\n\nCalculate ln(150/14.7):\n\n150/14.7 \u2248 10.204\n\nln(10.204) \u2248 2.322\n\nSo, 0.06857 * 540 * 2.322 \u2248 0.06857 * 540 = 37.0572\n\n37.0572 * 2.322 \u2248 86.07 Btu/lbm\n\nSecond term: Cp*(T - T0) = 0.24 * (550 - 540) = 0.24 * 10 = 2.4 Btu/lbm\n\nThird term: -T0*Cp*ln(T/T0) = -540 * 0.24 * ln(550/540)\n\nFirst, calculate ln(550/540):\n\n550/540 \u2248 1.0185\n\nln(1.0185) \u2248 0.0183\n\nSo, -540 * 0.24 * 0.0183 \u2248 -540 * 0.24 = -129.6\n\n-129.6 * 0.0183 \u2248 -2.37 Btu/lbm\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\nex \u2248 86.07 + 2.4 - 2.37 \u2248 86.1 Btu/lbm\n\nNow, we need to find the total exergy in the container, which is ex * mass.\n\nFirst, find the mass of air in the container.\n\nThe container is 40 ft\u00b3, filled with air at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F.\n\nUse the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = mRT\n\nWhere:\n\n- P = 150 psia\n\n- V = 40 ft\u00b3\n\n- R = 53.34 ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R\n\n- T = 550 \u00b0R\n\nFirst, convert P to lb_f/in\u00b2 to ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R.\n\nWait, in the ideal gas law PV = mRT, if P is in psia, V in ft\u00b3, m in lbm, R in ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R, then units should be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can find m = PV/RT\n\nBut need to ensure units are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, use m = \u03c1*V, where \u03c1 is density.\n\nFor air at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F, we can find density from tables or calculate it.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the ideal gas law directly.\n\nFirst, convert P to psia and V to ft\u00b3, R in ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R, T in \u00b0R.\n\nGiven that 1 psia = 1 lb_f/in\u00b2, and 1 ft*lbf = 1 lb_f*ft.\n\nSo, P = 150 psia = 150 lb_f/in\u00b2\n\nV = 40 ft\u00b3\n\nR = 53.34 ft*lbf/lbm/\u00b0R\n\nT = 550 \u00b0R\n\nThen, m = P*V/(R*T) = 150 * 40 / (53.34 * 550)\n\nCalculate numerator: 150 * 40 = 6000\n\nDenominator: 53.34 * 550 \u2248 29337\n\nSo, m \u2248 6000 / 29337 \u2248 0.204 lbm\n\nNow, total exergy = ex * m \u2248 86.1 * 0.204 \u2248 17.54 Btu\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided (817, 917, 1017 Btu).\n\nHmm, something must be wrong here.\n\nLet me check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the specific exergy calculation seems correct.\n\nThen, the mass calculation:\n\nm = P*V/(R*T) = 150 * 40 / (53.34 * 550) \u2248 0.204 lbm\n\nBut if ex is 86.1 Btu/lbm, then ex * m = 86.1 * 0.204 \u2248 17.54 Btu, which is way off from the options.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in assuming P0.\n\nWait, perhaps P0 is not 14.7 psia. The problem says \"supply line is at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F\", and the vessel is initially evacuated.\n\nWhen the valve is opened, air flows into the vessel until the pressure equals the supply line pressure.\n\nBut the ambient pressure isn't specified, so perhaps P0 is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exergy calculation should consider the ambient pressure as the final pressure, but that doesn't make sense because the vessel is at 150 psia.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exergy is calculated relative to the ambient state, which is T0 = 80\u00b0F, and P0 is the ambient pressure, which I assumed to be 14.7 psia.\n\nBut perhaps the ambient pressure is also 150 psia.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the supply line contains air that is maintained at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F. The valve is opened until the pressure in the container is the same as the pressure in the supply line.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the ambient pressure, so maybe the ambient pressure is also 150 psia.\n\nLet me assume that.\n\nIf P0 = 150 psia, then the specific exergy formula changes.\n\nex = R*T0*ln(P/P0) + Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0)\n\nPlug in P0 = 150 psia.\n\nThen, ln(P/P0) = ln(150/150) = ln(1) = 0\n\nSo, ex = 0 + 0.24*(550 - 540) - 540*0.24*ln(550/540)\n\nCalculate ln(550/540):\n\n550/540 \u2248 1.0185\n\nln(1.0185) \u2248 0.0183\n\nSo, ex \u2248 0 + 2.4 - 540*0.24*0.0183\n\nCalculate 540*0.24 = 129.6\n\n129.6*0.0183 \u2248 2.37\n\nSo, ex \u2248 2.4 - 2.37 \u2248 0.03 Btu/lbm\n\nThen, total exergy = ex * m \u2248 0.03 * 0.204 \u2248 0.006 Btu\n\nThis is even smaller than before and doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the ambient pressure is not 150 psia, but standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nBut the problem states that the supply line is at 150 psia and 90\u00b0F, and the vessel is initially evacuated.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, ambient pressure is typically 14.7 psia.\n\nBut maybe in this context, it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the vessel is adiabatic, and the filling process is reversible.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the exergy transfer with mass formula:\n\nEx = m*(ex + ke + pe - RT0*ln(P/P0))\n\nBut since there's no kinetic or potential energy changes, and assuming the process is reversible, maybe it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the exergy as the available work, which is the maximum useful work that can be extracted as the system comes to equilibrium with the surroundings.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should calculate the work done during the isentropic expansion from the vessel pressure to the ambient pressure.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of exergy based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics.\n\nLet me recall that exergy is defined as:\n\nEx = (U - U0) - T0*(S - S0) + P0*(V - V0)\n\nWhere U is internal energy, S is entropy, V is volume, and the subscript 0 denotes ambient conditions.\n\nBut this seems complicated to apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, for a closed system, the exergy change is:\n\nEx2 - Ex1 = W - Q - T0*S_gen\n\nWhere W is work, Q is heat transfer, and S_gen is entropy generation.\n\nGiven that the container is adiabatic (Q=0) and assuming a reversible process (S_gen=0), then Ex2 = W\n\nSo, the exergy of the air in the container is equal to the work done during the filling process.\n\nBut I need to find W.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the work done by the air as it expands from the supply line to the vessel.\n\nWait, but the vessel is filled until the pressure equals the supply line pressure.\n\nSo, no expansion occurs; rather, air flows into the vessel until pressures equalize.\n\nBut in an adiabatic container, the work done is related to the change in internal energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the isentropic process.\n\nGiven that the container is adiabatic and the process is reversible (assuming), then it's an isentropic process.\n\nFor an isentropic process of an ideal gas, we have:\n\nP1*V1^\u03b3 = P2*V2^\u03b3\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the specific heat ratio (for air, about 1.4)\n\nBut in this case, initially, the vessel is evacuated, so P1=0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the filling process as a mass flow process, where exergy is carried in by the mass.\n\nGiven that, the exergy rate is m_dot*(ex + ke + pe - RT0*ln(P/P0))\n\nBut without knowing the mass flow rate, this seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the exergy of the air in the vessel based on its final state relative to the ambient state.\n\nGiven that, ex = (h - h0) - T0*(s - s0)\n\nI need to find h and s at the final state (150 psia, 90\u00b0F) and h0 and s0 at the ambient state (14.7 psia, 80\u00b0F).\n\nI can look up these values from air tables or use formulas for ideal gases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the specific exergy formula in terms of temperature and pressure ratios.\n\nGiven that, ex = Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0) + R*T0*ln(P/P0)\n\nWait, earlier I had ex = R*T0*ln(P/P0) + Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0)\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the standard formula for specific exergy of an ideal gas.\n\nUpon checking, the specific exergy (ex) of an ideal gas relative to ambient conditions is:\n\nex = (h - h0) - T0*(s - s0)\n\nWhere h and s are at the state of the system, and h0 and s0 are at ambient conditions.\n\nExpressed in terms of pressure and temperature:\n\nex = Cp*(T - T0) - R*T0*ln(P/P0)\n\nWait, that seems different from what I had earlier.\n\nLet me verify.\n\nEnthalpy difference: h - h0 = Cp*(T - T0)\n\nEntropy difference: s - s0 = Cp*ln(T/T0) - R*ln(P/P0)\n\nTherefore, ex = Cp*(T - T0) - T0*(Cp*ln(T/T0) - R*ln(P/P0))\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nex = Cp*(T - T0) - T0*Cp*ln(T/T0) + T0*R*ln(P/P0)\n\nSo, my earlier formula was missing a sign.\n\nNow, with this corrected formula, let's recalculate ex.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Cp = 0.24 Btu/lbm/\u00b0F\n\n- R = 0.06857 Btu/lbm/\u00b0R\n\n- T = 550 \u00b0R\n\n- T0 = 540 \u00b0R\n\n- P = 150 psia\n\n- P0 = 14.7 psia\n\nFirst, calculate Cp*(T - T0) = 0.24*(550 - 540) = 0.24*10 = 2.4 Btu/lbm\n\nSecond term: -T0*Cp*ln(T/T0) = -"
