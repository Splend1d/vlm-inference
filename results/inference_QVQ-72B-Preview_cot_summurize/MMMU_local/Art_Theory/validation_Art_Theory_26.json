The backrest is a large, red rectangular panel, and the seat is a blue rectangular panel. Both the backrest and the seat seem to be made of some kind of plywood or perhaps even metal, but I'm guessing it's plywood based on the way it looks.\n\nNow, the arms of the chair are also made of the same dark brown wood, and they have yellow accents where they connect to the backrest and the seat. These yellow accents are small blocks or cubes that add a pop of color to the otherwise dark wood.\n\nLooking at the legs, they're also made of the same dark brown wood and are connected by crossbars, which might provide additional support and stability. The legs have yellow accents similar to those on the arms, again adding touches of color.\n\nThe chair is placed on a wooden floor against a gray wall, and there's a shadow cast on the wall, probably due to lighting in the room. The overall design of the chair seems very modern and minimalistic, with clean lines and bold colors.\n\nI need to answer a question about the material of the chair. The options are cast iron, plastic, steel, and plywood. Based on what I can see, the frame is definitely wooden, so that eliminates cast iron and steel immediately. The backrest and seat panels look like they could be plywood, given their appearance and the way they're attached to the frame.\n\nBut let me think again. Could the backrest and seat be made of plastic? Well, plastic can come in many forms, but from the image, it looks more like painted wood or plywood rather than plastic. The texture seems smoother and more uniform than what I'd expect from plastic.\n\nAlternatively, could it be metal? Maybe steel or aluminum painted in red and blue? It's possible, but the way the panels are attached and the overall look suggests more of a wooden construction with painted plywood for the backrest and seat.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is plywood. The chair appears to be constructed primarily from wood, with plywood used for the backrest and seat due to its suitability for larger, flat surfaces.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the properties of each material:\n\n- Cast iron: heavy, typically used for outdoor furniture or industrial settings. Doesn't seem to fit here.\n\n- Plastic: lightweight, often used in modern furniture, but the appearance here seems more substantial and less flexible than plastic would allow.\n\n- Steel: strong, metallic, and usually has a different finish unless painted to look like another material.\n\n- Plywood: consists of thin layers of wood glued together, ideal for furniture making due to its strength and flexibility in design.\n\nGiven this, plywood seems the most appropriate choice for the backrest and seat. The frame is definitely wooden, and the use of plywood for the panels is consistent with the overall design aesthetic.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. plywood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
