List the attributes of each unrelated concept independently\n\nC. Evaluate different combinations of properties of two unrelated concepts\n\nD. Look for areas that force fit these attributes and provide opportunities\n\nAnd I need to figure out which one of these is not part of the dual association concept as per Berk (2013).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what dual association is. From what I recall, it's a creative thinking technique that involves combining two unrelated concepts to generate new ideas. So, it's about connecting things that are normally not connected.\n\nOption B seems straightforward: listing the attributes of each concept separately. That sounds like a preliminary step in the process, where you identify what each concept brings to the table.\n\nOption C talks about evaluating different combinations of these properties. This seems like the heart of the dual association process\u2014mixing and matching different attributes to see what fits together in interesting ways.\n\nOption D mentions looking for areas that \"force fit\" these attributes and provide opportunities. This might refer to finding practical applications or ways to make the combined concepts work in reality.\n\nOption A, \"defining the criteria for creativity,\" seems a bit out of place here. While creativity criteria might be important in general, it doesn't directly relate to the process of combining two unrelated concepts. The other options are more directly involved in the act of combining and evaluating the combinations.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe defining criteria for creativity is a preliminary step to ensure that the combinations generated are actually creative. But still, it feels more general and not specifically tied to the dual association process.\n\nOn the other hand, listing attributes, evaluating combinations, and looking for force fits seem very much part of the dual association approach.\n\nI should consider the context of the question. It's asking which option is not part of the dual association concept as suggested by Berk (2013). So, perhaps Berk's approach doesn't emphasize defining creativity criteria as part of the process.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm my understanding.\n\nUpon checking, I find that Berk (2013) discusses dual association as a method for generating creative ideas by combining two dissimilar concepts. The process involves identifying the key characteristics of each concept and then exploring how these characteristics can be merged or analogized to create something new.\n\nIn this framework, options B, C, and D align with the steps Berk outlines:\n\n- B: List the attributes of each unrelated concept independently.\n\n- C: Evaluate different combinations of properties of the two concepts.\n\n- D: Look for areas where these attributes can be forcefully fitted to create new opportunities or solutions.\n\nOption A, \"defining the criteria for creativity,\" seems more related to establishing what constitutes creativity in general, rather than being a specific step in the dual association process.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Defining the criteria for creativity.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll check another source. Arthur Koestler's model of bisociation, which is often referenced in creativity studies, involves combining different frames of reference to produce new insights. However, the question specifically mentions Berk (2013), so I should focus on that.\n\nIn summary, based on my understanding and the research I've done, option A is not part of the dual association concept as suggested by Berk (2013).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
