Information regarding budgeted sales for the last quarter of the year is as follows: <image 1> Past experience shows that 5 percent of credit sales are uncollectible. Of the credit sales that are collectible, 60 percent are collected in the month of sale; the remaining 40 percent are collected in the month following the month of sale. Customers are granted a 1.5 percent discount for payment within 10 days of billing. Approximately 75 percent of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount. Inventory purchases each month are 100 percent of the cost of the following month's projected sales. (The gross profit rate for Timpco is approximately 30 percent.) All merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25 percent paid in the month of purchase and the remainder paid in the following month. No cash discounts for early payment are available.

Cash sales in November.\n\n2. Collections from credit sales made in October and November.\n\nLet's handle each component one by one.\n\n**1. Cash sales in November:**\n\nThis is straightforward. It's given as $120,000.\n\n**2. Collections from credit sales:**\n\nFirst, we need to consider credit sales from October and November.\n\n**Credit sales in October: $100,000**\n\n- 5% of credit sales are uncollectible.\n\n- So, collectible amount from October credit sales:\n\nCollectible from October credit sales = $100,000 * (100% - 5%) = $100,000 * 95% = $95,000\n\n- Collection pattern:\n\n- 60% collected in the month of sale (which is October, so cash received in October).\n\n- 40% collected in the month following the month of sale (which is November).\n\n- Additionally, there's a 1.5% discount for payments within 10 days of billing.\n\n- Approximately 75% of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount.\n\nSo, for the 40% collected in November:\n\n- Amount before discount: $95,000 * 40% = $38,000\n\n- Discount taken: 75% of $38,000 * 1.5%\n\n- First, find 75% of $38,000: $38,000 * 75% = $28,500\n\n- Discount amount: $28,500 * 1.5% = $427.50\n\n- Therefore, the cash received in November from October's credit sales:\n\n$38,000 - $427.50 = $37,572.50\n\n**Credit sales in November: $150,000**\n\n- Collectible amount:\n\n$150,000 * (100% - 5%) = $150,000 * 95% = $142,500\n\n- Collection pattern:\n\n- 60% collected in November.\n\n- 40% collected in December.\n\n- Discount for payments within 10 days: 1.5%, taken by approximately 75% of customers.\n\nSo, for the 60% collected in November:\n\n- Amount before discount: $142,500 * 60% = $85,500\n\n- Discount taken: 75% of $85,500 * 1.5%\n\n- First, 75% of $85,500: $85,500 * 75% = $64,125\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.88\n\n- Therefore, cash received in November from November's credit sales:\n\n$85,500 - $961.88 = $84,538.12\n\n**Total cash receipts from credit sales in November:**\n\n$37,572.50 (from October's credit sales) + $84,538.12 (from November's credit sales) = $122,110.62\n\n**Total cash receipts for November:**\n\nCash sales in November: $120,000\n\nPlus cash from credit sales: $122,110.62\n\nTotal: $120,000 + $122,110.62 = $242,110.62\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"the budgeted total cash receipts for November.\" Is there anything I'm missing?\n\nLet me double-check the steps.\n\n1. Cash sales in November: $120,000 \u2013 That's straightforward.\n\n2. Credit sales collections:\n\n- From October's credit sales:\n\n- Collectible: $95,000\n\n- 40% collected in November: $95,000 * 40% = $38,000\n\n- Discount taken: 75% of $38,000 take 1.5% discount.\n\n- Discount amount: $28,500 * 1.5% = $427.50\n\n- Net cash received: $38,000 - $427.50 = $37,572.50\n\n- From November's credit sales:\n\n- Collectible: $150,000 * 95% = $142,500\n\n- 60% collected in November: $142,500 * 60% = $85,500\n\n- Discount taken: 75% of $85,500 take 1.5% discount.\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.88\n\n- Net cash received: $85,500 - $961.88 = $84,538.12\n\n- Total from credit sales: $37,572.50 + $84,538.12 = $122,110.62\n\n- Plus cash sales: $120,000 + $122,110.62 = $242,110.62\n\nBut, looking back at the question, it might be that there are other considerations, such as collections from December's credit sales, but since December is after November, those collections would be in December or later, which doesn't affect November's cash receipts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other elements like payments for purchases or other expenses that affect cash receipts. However, the question specifically asks for \"budgeted total cash receipts for November,\" which are primarily from sales.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's inventory purchase payment involved, but the problem mentions that all merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25% paid in the month of purchase and the remainder in the following month. But since we're dealing with cash receipts from sales, perhaps this doesn't directly impact cash receipts, but rather cash payments.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the cash receipts net of the cost of goods sold (COGS), but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inventory purchases affect the cash payments, which might net against cash receipts, but that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gross profit rate is relevant for calculating COGS, which might affect cash flows, but again, the question is about cash receipts from sales.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it.
