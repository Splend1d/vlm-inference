The table is titled \"Estimated REA Express Rates\" and it has a note that says, \"Minimum charge will never be less than $6.75.\" Okay, got it.\n\nLet me look at the table structure. There are columns for different distance ranges: up to 100 miles, 101 to 200, 201 to 300, 301 to 400, 401 to 500, and 501 to 700 miles. And there are rows for different weight ranges: 1 to 25 pounds, 26 to 50 pounds, 51 to 75 pounds, and 76 to 100 pounds. Each cell in the table gives the cost in dollars for shipping within that weight and distance range.\n\nThe question is asking for the estimated REA charge for shipping a 34-pound item 295 miles. Alright, so first, I need to determine which weight range 34 pounds falls into and which distance range 295 miles falls into.\n\nLooking at the weight ranges:\n\n- 1 to 25 pounds\n\n- 26 to 50 pounds\n\n- 51 to 75 pounds\n\n- 76 to 100 pounds\n\n34 pounds is between 26 and 50 pounds, so that's the row I should use.\n\nNow, for the distance:\n\n- Up to 100 miles\n\n- 101 to 200 miles\n\n- 201 to 300 miles\n\n- 301 to 400 miles\n\n- 401 to 500 miles\n\n- 501 to 700 miles\n\n295 miles falls into the 201 to 300 miles range.\n\nSo, I need to find the cell where the \"26 to 50 pounds\" row intersects with the \"201 to 300 miles\" column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 26 to 50 pounds and 201 to 300 miles, the cost is $9.20.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nHere's the table again:\n\n| Weight | Up to 100 Miles | 101 to 200 | 201 to 300 | 301 to 400 | 401 to 500 | 501 to 700 |\n|--------|----------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| 1 to 25 lbs | $7.30 | $7.80 | $8.05 | $8.60 | $8.90 | $9.60 |\n| 26 to 50 lbs | 8.05 | 8.85 | 9.20 | 10.00 | 10.45 | 11.55 |\n| 51 to 75 lbs | 8.85 | 9.85 | 10.40 | 11.45 | 12.00 | 13.40 |\n| 76 to 100 lbs | 9.60 | 10.85 | 11.50 | 12.75 | 13.50 | 15.25 |\n\nYes, for 26 to 50 pounds and 201 to 300 miles, the rate is $9.20.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the minimum charge will never be less than $6.75. Does that mean that even if the calculated rate is less than $6.75, they would charge $6.75? In this case, $9.20 is already higher than $6.75, so it doesn't affect this particular calculation.\n\nSo, the estimated REA charge for shipping a 34-pound item 295 miles is $9.20.\n\nBut let's make sure there's no trick here. Maybe I should check if 34 pounds could be considered in a different weight category or if 295 miles could fall into a different distance bracket.\n\nNo, 34 pounds is clearly in the 26 to 50 pounds range, and 295 miles is in the 201 to 300 miles range.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the rate is per pound or for the entire shipment. But looking at the table, it seems that the rates are per shipment within the specified weight and distance ranges.\n\nAlso, the table doesn't indicate any additional fees or surcharges, so I assume that the rate provided is the total charge.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $9.20.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"estimated REA charge,\" but it doesn't specify whether to round it to the nearest cent or anything like that. Since the table provides exact figures, I'll assume that $9.20 is the exact charge.\n\nSo, the final answer is $9.20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9.20} \\]"
