So, we have a project with activities A, B, C, and D, each having estimated times for their optimistic (a), most likely (m), and pessimistic (b) scenarios. We're also given their immediate predecessors, which help us understand the sequence of the project.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between the activities. Activity A has no predecessor, so it's the starting point. Activity B also has no predecessor, meaning it can start simultaneously with A. Activity C depends on A, and D depends on B. So, the project sequence is:\n\n- A -> C\n\n- B -> D\n\nAnd since A and B can start independently, their paths are separate.\n\nNow, the question is focusing on the path B-D and asks for the probability that this path will be finished in 22 weeks or less, assuming the time to complete this path is normally distributed.\n\nTo find this probability, I need to first determine the expected time and the variance (or standard deviation) for the path B-D.\n\nGiven that B-D is a path, I need to sum the expected times for activities B and D to get the expected time for the entire path.\n\nSimilarly, I need to find the variance for the path by considering the variances of activities B and D, assuming independence.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in PERT analysis, the expected time (t) for an activity is calculated as:\n\nt = (a + 4m + b) / 6\n\nAnd the variance (\u03c3\u00b2) for an activity is:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = (b - a)^2 / 36\n\nLet's calculate the expected time and variance for activity B:\n\nt_B = (4 + 4*10 + 16) / 6 = (4 + 40 + 16)/6 = 60/6 = 10 weeks\n\n\u03c3\u00b2_B = (16 - 4)^2 / 36 = (12)^2 / 36 = 144 / 36 = 4\n\nFor activity D:\n\nt_D = (5 + 4*8 + 11)/6 = (5 + 32 + 11)/6 = 48/6 = 8 weeks\n\n\u03c3\u00b2_D = (11 - 5)^2 / 36 = (6)^2 / 36 = 36 / 36 = 1\n\nNow, since the activities are independent, the expected time for the path B-D is the sum of the expected times of B and D:\n\nt_B-D = t_B + t_D = 10 + 8 = 18 weeks\n\nSimilarly, the variance for the path B-D is the sum of the variances of B and D:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2_B-D = \u03c3\u00b2_B + \u03c3\u00b2_D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nNow, the standard deviation (\u03c3) for the path B-D is the square root of the variance:\n\n\u03c3_B-D = \u221a5 \u2248 2.236 weeks\n\nNow, we are assuming that the time to complete path B-D is normally distributed with mean 18 weeks and standard deviation approximately 2.236 weeks.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the path will be finished in 22 weeks or less.\n\nTo find this probability, we can standardize the normal distribution using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere x is the value we're interested in (22 weeks), \u03bc is the mean (18 weeks), and \u03c3 is the standard deviation (\u22482.236 weeks).\n\nz = (22 - 18) / 2.236 \u2248 4 / 2.236 \u2248 1.79\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to 1.79.\n\nI can look this up in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator.\n\nLooking it up, P(Z \u2264 1.79) \u2248 0.9633\n\nTherefore, the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is approximately 96.33%.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the expected time and variance for B and D:\n\nt_B = (4 + 4*10 + 16)/6 = (4 + 40 + 16)/6 = 60/6 = 10 weeks\n\n\u03c3\u00b2_B = (16 - 4)^2 / 36 = 144 / 36 = 4\n\nt_D = (5 + 4*8 + 11)/6 = (5 + 32 + 11)/6 = 48/6 = 8 weeks\n\n\u03c3\u00b2_D = (11 - 5)^2 / 36 = 36 / 36 = 1\n\nSum of expected times: 10 + 8 = 18 weeks\n\nSum of variances: 4 + 1 = 5\n\nStandard deviation: \u221a5 \u2248 2.236 weeks\n\nz = (22 - 18)/2.236 \u2248 1.79\n\nP(Z \u2264 1.79) \u2248 0.9633\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that path B-D will be completed in 22 weeks or less is approximately 96.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.9633} \\]"
