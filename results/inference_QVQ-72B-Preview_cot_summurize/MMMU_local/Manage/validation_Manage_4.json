                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about room registrations at the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel. They've got data for the past nine years, and they want me to develop a regression equation to find the trend in guest registrations. Then, using that equation, I need to forecast the registrations for year 11. The data is given in thousands, and there are options provided for the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a trend equation is. I think it's a mathematical model that shows how a variable changes over time. In this case, it's room registrations over years. Since it's a time series data, I can use linear regression to find the trend.\n\nSo, the first step is to plot the data to see if there's a linear relationship. But since I don't have a graph, I'll assume that the data shows a linear increase or decrease over time.\n\nThe data provided is:\n\nYear 1: 17\n\nYear 2: 16\n\nYear 3: 16\n\nYear 4: 21\n\nYear 5: 20\n\nYear 6: 20\n\nYear 7: 23\n\nYear 8: 25\n\nYear 9: 24\n\nAnd registrations are in thousands.\n\nI need to develop a regression equation relating registrations to time.\n\nI think I should use simple linear regression, where registrations (y) are dependent on the year (x).\n\nBut first, I need to assign numerical values to the years. Let's assign x as the year number, with x=1 for year 1, x=2 for year 2, and so on up to x=9 for year 9.\n\nSo, my data points are:\n\n(1,17), (2,16), (3,16), (4,21), (5,20), (6,20), (7,23), (8,25), (9,24)\n\nI need to find the equation of the line that best fits these points, which is of the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nTo find m and b, I can use the least squares method.\n\nThe formulas for m and b are:\n\nm = [n*\u03a3(xy) - \u03a3x*\u03a3y] / [n*\u03a3(x^2) - (\u03a3x)^2]\n\nb = [\u03a3y - m*\u03a3x] / n\n\nWhere n is the number of data points.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \u03a3xy, \u03a3x, \u03a3y, \u03a3x^2, and n.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step.\n\nFirst, list out x, y, x^2, and xy for each data point:\n\nx | y | x^2 | xy\n\n1 | 17 | 1 | 17\n\n2 | 16 | 4 | 32\n\n3 | 16 | 9 | 48\n\n4 | 21 | 16 | 84\n\n5 | 20 | 25 | 100\n\n6 | 20 | 36 | 120\n\n7 | 23 | 49 | 161\n\n8 | 25 | 64 | 200\n\n9 | 24 | 81 | 216\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n\u03a3x = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45\n\n\u03a3y = 17+16+16+21+20+20+23+25+24 = let's calculate that.\n\n17+16=33\n\n33+16=49\n\n49+21=70\n\n70+20=90\n\n90+20=110\n\n110+23=133\n\n133+25=158\n\n158+24=182\n\nSo, \u03a3y = 182\n\n\u03a3x^2 = 1+4+9+16+25+36+49+64+81 = 285\n\n\u03a3xy = 17+32+48+84+100+120+161+200+216 = let's add them up.\n\n17+32=49\n\n49+48=97\n\n97+84=181\n\n181+100=281\n\n281+120=401\n\n401+161=562\n\n562+200=762\n\n762+216=978\n\nSo, \u03a3xy = 978\n\nAnd n = 9 (since there are 9 years of data)\n\nNow, plug these into the formulas for m and b.\n\nFirst, calculate m:\n\nm = [n*\u03a3(xy) - \u03a3x*\u03a3y] / [n*\u03a3(x^2) - (\u03a3x)^2]\n\n= [9*978 - 45*182] / [9*285 - 45^2]\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n9*978 = 8802\n\n45*182 = let's calculate that.\n\n40*182=7280\n\n5*182=910\n\nTotal=7280+910=8190\n\nSo, numerator = 8802 - 8190 = 612\n\nNow, denominator:\n\n9*285 = 2565\n\n45^2 = 2025\n\nSo, denominator = 2565 - 2025 = 540\n\nTherefore, m = 612 / 540 = 1.1333... (or 1.13 repeating)\n\nLet's calculate it more precisely.\n\n612 \u00f7 540 = 1.133333...\n\nSo, m \u2248 1.1333\n\nNow, calculate b:\n\nb = [\u03a3y - m*\u03a3x] / n\n\n= [182 - 1.1333*45] / 9\n\nFirst, calculate 1.1333*45:\n\n1.1333 * 45 =\n\nFirst, 1*45 = 45\n\n0.1333 * 45 =\n\n0.1*45 = 4.5\n\n0.0333*45:\n\n0.03*45 = 1.35\n\n0.0033*45 = 0.1485\n\n0.0003*45 = 0.0135\n\nSo, total is 45 + 4.5 + 1.35 + 0.1485 + 0.0135 = 51.012\n\nSo, 182 - 51.012 = 130.988\n\nThen, b = 130.988 / 9 \u2248 14.554\n\nSo, the regression equation is:\n\ny = 1.1333x + 14.554\n\nNow, we need to forecast year 11 registrations.\n\nSo, x = 11 (since year 1 to 9 are 1 to 9)\n\ny = 1.1333*11 + 14.554\n\nCalculate 1.1333*11:\n\n1*11 = 11\n\n0.1*11=1.1\n\n0.0333*11\u22480.3663\n\n0.0003*11\u22480.0033\n\nSo, total \u224811 + 1.1 + 0.3663 + 0.0033 \u224812.4696\n\nThen, y \u224812.4696 + 14.554 \u224827.0236\n\nSince registrations are in thousands, the forecast for year 11 is approximately 27.024 thousand rooms.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 27010\n\nB. 27020\n\nC. 27030\n\nD. 27040\n\nSo, 27.024 thousand is 27024 rooms. The closest option is B. 27020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 27020.\n\nBut I should check if there's any mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst, \u03a3y = 182 is correct.\n\n\u03a3x^2 = 285 is correct.\n\n\u03a3xy = 978 is correct.\n\nn=9\n\nm = [9*978 - 45*182] / [9*285 - 45^2] = [8802 - 8190] / [2565 - 2025] = 612 / 540 = 1.1333...\n\nb = [182 - 1.1333*45]/9 = [182 - 51.0015]/9 \u2248130.9985/9 \u224814.555\n\nThen, y = 1.1333x + 14.555\n\nFor x=11, y \u22481.1333*11 + 14.555 \u224812.4663 + 14.555 \u224827.0213\n\nWhich is approximately 27.02 thousand, matching option B. 27020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 27020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
