                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph that shows the number of injuries and illnesses reported per 100 full-time workers from 2003 to 2011. There's a solid line which is the regression line for the data, and a dotted line that connects the points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change over those eight years.\n\nSo, the question is asking which year the least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports. Basically, I need to find out in which year the actual data point is farthest from the regression line.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a least-squares regression line is. It's a line that best fits the data points, minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line. So, the points that are farthest from the line are the ones where the prediction error is the largest.\n\nLooking at the graph, I can see data points for each year from 2003 to 2011. The y-axis is cases per 100 full-time workers, ranging from 3.0 to 5.5. The x-axis is the years.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. 2003\n\nIn 2003, the data point seems to be right on the regression line. So, the prediction is perfect here. That means the residual is zero. So, this can't be the answer.\n\nB. 2005\n\nIn 2005, the data point is slightly above the regression line. Not too far, but there is some deviation.\n\nC. 2007\n\nIn 2007, the data point is close to the regression line, maybe a little below it.\n\nD. 2009\n\nIn 2009, the data point is significantly below the regression line. This looks like it has a larger residual compared to other years.\n\nE. 2010\n\nIn 2010, the data point is slightly below the regression line, but not as far as in 2009.\n\nFrom visual inspection, it seems that 2009 has the largest residual, meaning the regression line is least successful at predicting the actual number of injury and illness reports in that year.\n\nWait a minute, let me check the positions again to make sure.\n\n- 2003: on the line\n\n- 2004: slightly below\n\n- 2005: slightly above\n\n- 2006: slightly below\n\n- 2007: slightly below\n\n- 2008: slightly below\n\n- 2009: significantly below\n\n- 2010: slightly below\n\n- 2011: slightly below\n\nYes, 2009 stands out as having the largest deviation from the regression line.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the vertical distance between the actual data point and the regression line. In 2009, this distance is the greatest.\n\nTherefore, the least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in 2009.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 2009.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
