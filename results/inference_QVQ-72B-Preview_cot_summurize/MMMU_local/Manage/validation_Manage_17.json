                    "text": "So I need to calculate the commission on the sale of some stock using this brokerage rates table. Let's see, Mr. Samuels purchased 50 shares of stock when the round lot price was 146 and 1/8. The odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point. I need to use the table provided to find the commission on the sale.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a round lot and an odd lot are. I think a round lot is a standard batch of shares, usually 100 shares, and an odd lot is any amount below that, like 50 shares in this case. So, since he bought 50 shares, that's an odd lot.\n\nThe table gives brokerage rates on odd lots based on the amount of purchase. There are three categories:\n\n1. $100 - $799: 2.0% plus $4.40 up to $65\n\n2. $800 - $2,499: 1.3% plus $10 up to $65\n\n3. $2,500 and above: 0.9% plus $20 up to $65\n\nI need to find out which category applies to Mr. Samuels' purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total amount of the purchase. The round lot price was 146 and 1/8. I assume that's $146.125 per share. For 50 shares, that would be 50 * $146.125.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 * 146.125 = 7306.25\n\nSo, the total purchase amount is $7306.25.\n\nNow, looking at the table, the categories are up to $799, $800-$2,499, and $2,500 and above. Since $7306.25 is above $2,500, it falls into the third category.\n\nSo, for amounts $2,500 and above, the commission is 0.9% plus $20, with a maximum of $65.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.9% of $7306.25.\n\n0.9% of $7306.25 is 0.009 * 7306.25 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.009 * 7306.25 =\n\nFirst, 0.009 * 7000 = 63\n\n0.009 * 300 = 2.7\n\n0.009 * 6.25 = let's see, 0.009 * 6 = 0.054 and 0.009 * 0.25 = 0.00225, so total is 0.054 + 0.00225 = 0.05625\n\nSo, total is 63 + 2.7 + 0.05625 = 65.75625\n\nNow, add the $20.\n\n65.75625 + 20 = 85.75625\n\nBut there's a maximum of $65, so the commission would be $65.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions an odd-lot differential of 1/4 of a point. Does that affect the commission?\n\nI need to consider the odd-lot differential. The differential is 1/4 of a point. I think in stock trading, a point is $1 per share. So, 1/4 of a point would be $0.25 per share.\n\nFor 50 shares, that would be 50 * $0.25 = $12.50.\n\nSo, in addition to the commission, there might be an additional charge for the odd-lot differential.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's added to the commission or if it's already included in the commission calculation.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"the odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point.\" It doesn't specify whether this is in addition to the commission or included in it.\n\nMaybe I should just add the differential to the commission.\n\nSo, commission is $65, plus the differential of $12.50, totaling $77.50.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the differential is indeed added separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differential affects the purchase price, not the commission.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point.\" It's probably referring to the fact that when selling an odd lot, there's a differential in the price per share.\n\nBut since we're calculating the commission on the sale, maybe the differential affects the amount on which the commission is calculated.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the differential is subtracted from the sale price per share.\n\nSo, if the round lot price is $146.125, and the odd-lot differential is 1/4 point ($0.25), then the sale price per share would be $146.125 - $0.25 = $145.875.\n\nThen, the total sale amount would be 50 * $145.875 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n50 * 145.875 =\n\nFirst, 50 * 140 = 7000\n\n50 * 5.875 = ?\n\n50 * 5 = 250\n\n50 * 0.875 = 43.75\n\nSo, total is 7000 + 250 + 43.75 = 7293.75\n\nSo, the total sale amount is $7293.75.\n\nNow, using this amount to calculate the commission.\n\nLooking back at the table, for $2,500 and above, it's 0.9% plus $20, up to $65.\n\nSo, 0.9% of $7293.75 is 0.009 * 7293.75 = ?\n\n0.009 * 7000 = 63\n\n0.009 * 293.75 = ?\n\n0.009 * 200 = 1.8\n\n0.009 * 90 = 0.81\n\n0.009 * 3.75 = let's see, 0.009 * 4 = 0.036, but it's 3.75, so 0.009 * 3 = 0.027 and 0.009 * 0.75 = 0.00675, so total is 0.027 + 0.00675 = 0.03375\n\nSo, total is 63 + 1.8 + 0.81 + 0.03375 = 65.64375\n\nAdd the $20: 65.64375 + 20 = 85.64375\n\nBut there's a maximum of $65, so the commission would be $65.\n\nNow, considering the differential was already accounted for in the sale price, I don't think I need to add it again to the commission.\n\nTherefore, the commission on the sale is $65.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the differential seems to be part of the sale price, not directly related to the commission.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differential is an additional fee that needs to be added to the commission.\n\nBut I think it's already included in the sale price calculation.\n\nSo, my final answer is $65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{65} \\]"
