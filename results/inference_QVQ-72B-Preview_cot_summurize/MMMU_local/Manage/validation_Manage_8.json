                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph that shows the number of unemployed workers, in thousands, from June to October, broken down by their level of education. There are four categories:\n\n1. Less than a high school diploma\n\n2. High school diploma, no college\n\n3. Some college\n\n4. Bachelor's degree and higher\n\nEach category has a line representing the number of unemployed workers over these five months. My task is to find out in which month the difference between the number of unemployed high school graduates and those without a high school diploma was the smallest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants the smallest difference between two specific groups:\n\n- High school diploma, no college\n\n- Less than a high school diploma\n\nSo, for each month from June to October, I need to find the difference between these two groups and then determine which month has the smallest difference.\n\nAlright, let's look at the graph.\n\nStarting with June:\n\n- Less than a high school diploma: looks like around 12.5 thousand\n\n- High school diploma, no college: about 8.5 thousand\n\nDifference: 12.5 - 8.5 = 4 thousand\n\nNow, July:\n\n- Less than a high school diploma: about 12.8 thousand\n\n- High school diploma, no college: around 8.8 thousand\n\nDifference: 12.8 - 8.8 = 4 thousand\n\nAugust:\n\n- Less than a high school diploma: approximately 11.8 thousand\n\n- High school diploma, no college: about 8.8 thousand\n\nDifference: 11.8 - 8.8 = 3 thousand\n\nSeptember:\n\n- Less than a high school diploma: around 11.2 thousand\n\n- High school diploma, no college: about 8.8 thousand\n\nDifference: 11.2 - 8.8 = 2.4 thousand\n\nOctober:\n\n- Less than a high school diploma: approximately 12.2 thousand\n\n- High school diploma, no college: about 8.6 thousand\n\nDifference: 12.2 - 8.6 = 3.6 thousand\n\nSo, listing the differences:\n\n- June: 4.0 thousand\n\n- July: 4.0 thousand\n\n- August: 3.0 thousand\n\n- September: 2.4 thousand\n\n- October: 3.6 thousand\n\nThe smallest difference is in September at 2.4 thousand.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check these estimates to make sure I'm reading the graph correctly.\n\nIn June:\n\n- Less than high school: roughly 12.5\n\n- High school diploma: about 8.5\n\nDifference: 12.5 - 8.5 = 4.0\n\nJuly:\n\n- Less than high school: about 12.8\n\n- High school diploma: approximately 8.8\n\nDifference: 12.8 - 8.8 = 4.0\n\nAugust:\n\n- Less than high school: roughly 11.8\n\n- High school diploma: about 8.8\n\nDifference: 11.8 - 8.8 = 3.0\n\nSeptember:\n\n- Less than high school: about 11.2\n\n- High school diploma: approximately 8.8\n\nDifference: 11.2 - 8.8 = 2.4\n\nOctober:\n\n- Less than high school: roughly 12.2\n\n- High school diploma: about 8.6\n\nDifference: 12.2 - 8.6 = 3.6\n\nYes, September still has the smallest difference of 2.4 thousand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. September.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to interpret the question or if I might have misread the graph.\n\nThe question specifies \"the number of unemployed high school graduates and the number of unemployed workers without a high school diploma.\" That's clear.\n\nI don't think I've confused any of the categories. \"Less than a high school diploma\" is those who didn't complete high school, and \"high school diploma, no college\" is those who completed high school but didn't go to college.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there's a mistake in identifying the correct categories.\n\nAlso, all the lines seem to be consistent across the months, without any anomalies.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the smallest difference occurs in September.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. September}} \\]"
