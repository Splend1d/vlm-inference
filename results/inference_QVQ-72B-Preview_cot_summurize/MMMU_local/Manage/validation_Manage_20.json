They produced 19,500 nets last month, and we have the actual costs incurred. My task is to find the variance of price.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"variance of price\" refers to. In cost accounting, variances are differences between standard costs and actual costs. Price variances typically relate to the cost of inputs, like materials and labor, in terms of the price paid for them.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the standard costs for one net:\n\n- Direct materials: 15 pounds at 21 cents per pound, totaling $3.15.\n\n- Direct labor: 6 hours at $2.00 per hour, totaling $12.00.\n\n- Overhead costs:\n\n- Variable overhead: $1.20 per direct labor hour, which is 6 hours, so $7.20.\n\n- Fixed overhead: $0.85 per direct labor hour, which is 6 hours, so $5.10.\n\n- Total costs per net: $27.45.\n\nNow, for last month, they produced 19,500 nets, and the actual costs were:\n\n- Materials used: 296,000 pounds at 22 cents per pound, totaling $65,120.\n\n- Direct labor: 120,000 hours, totaling $252,000.\n\n- Overhead:\n\n- Variable overhead: $141,000.\n\n- Fixed overhead: $103,500.\n\nTotal production costs: $65,120 + $252,000 + $141,000 + $103,500 = Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, $65,120 + $252,000 = $317,120.\n\nThen, $317,120 + $141,000 = $458,120.\n\nFinally, $458,120 + $103,500 = $561,620.\n\nSo, total actual costs are $561,620.\n\nBut, standard total costs for 19,500 nets would be 19,500 nets * $27.45 per net.\n\nLet me calculate that: 19,500 * 27.45.\n\nFirst, 19,500 * 27 = 526,500.\n\nThen, 19,500 * 0.45 = 8,775.\n\nAdd them together: 526,500 + 8,775 = $535,275.\n\nSo, the standard cost is $535,275, and the actual cost is $561,620.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the variance of price. I think this refers to the price variance for materials and labor.\n\nLet me focus on materials first.\n\nStandard materials: 15 pounds per net at 21 cents per pound.\n\nActual materials: 296,000 pounds at 22 cents per pound.\n\nFirst, find the materials price variance.\n\nMaterials price variance = (Actual quantity * (Actual price - Standard price))\n\nActual quantity is 296,000 pounds.\n\nActual price is 22 cents per pound.\n\nStandard price is 21 cents per pound.\n\nSo, Materials price variance = 296,000 * (0.22 - 0.21) = 296,000 * 0.01 = $2,960.\n\nSince it's positive, it's an unfavorable variance.\n\nNow, for direct labor.\n\nStandard direct labor: 6 hours per net at $2.00 per hour.\n\nActual direct labor: 120,000 hours at total $252,000.\n\nFirst, find the labor rate variance.\n\nLabor rate variance = Actual hours * (Actual rate - Standard rate)\n\nActual hours: 120,000\n\nActual rate: $252,000 / 120,000 = $2.10 per hour.\n\nStandard rate: $2.00 per hour.\n\nSo, Labor rate variance = 120,000 * (2.10 - 2.00) = 120,000 * 0.10 = $12,000 unfavorable.\n\nNow, for overhead.\n\nVariable overhead: standard is $1.20 per direct labor hour.\n\nActual variable overhead: $141,000.\n\nActual hours: 120,000.\n\nVariable overhead rate variance = Actual hours * (Actual rate - Standard rate)\n\nActual rate = $141,000 / 120,000 = $1.175 per hour.\n\nStandard rate = $1.20 per hour.\n\nSo, Variance = 120,000 * (1.175 - 1.20) = 120,000 * (-0.025) = $-3,000, which is favorable.\n\nFixed overhead: standard is $0.85 per direct labor hour.\n\nActual fixed overhead: $103,500.\n\nActual hours: 120,000.\n\nFixed overhead rate variance = Actual hours * (Actual rate - Standard rate)\n\nActual rate = $103,500 / 120,000 = $0.8625 per hour.\n\nStandard rate = $0.85 per hour.\n\nSo, Variance = 120,000 * (0.8625 - 0.85) = 120,000 * 0.0125 = $1,500 unfavorable.\n\nNow, total price variances would be the sum of these variances:\n\nMaterials price variance: $2,960 U\n\nLabor rate variance: $12,000 U\n\nVariable overhead rate variance: $3,000 F\n\nFixed overhead rate variance: $1,500 U\n\nTotal price variances: $2,960 + $12,000 - $3,000 + $1,500 = $13,460 unfavorable.\n\nBut, I need to confirm if this is what the question is asking for.\n\nThe question mentions \"variance of price,\" which might specifically refer to materials and labor prices, so perhaps I should only consider materials and labor variances.\n\nSo, materials price variance + labor rate variance = $2,960 U + $12,000 U = $14,960 U.\n\nBut then, the overhead variances also involve prices, so maybe I should include them as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"variance of price\" refers to the total variance, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: \"Find the variance of price.\"\n\nIt's a bit unclear, but given the context, perhaps it's referring to the total price variance across all cost components.\n\nIn that case, it would be the sum of materials price variance, labor rate variance, and overhead rate variances.\n\nAs calculated, that's $13,460 unfavorable.\n\nBut, to be precise, I should check if there are any other variances that relate to price.\n\nFor example, there might be quantity variances as well, like materials quantity variance or labor efficiency variance.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"variance of price,\" which likely refers to the price-related variances, i.e., the differences in the costs due to changes in prices or rates.\n\nTherefore, my final answer would be the total of all price variances: $13,460 unfavorable.\n\nBut, to present it correctly, I should probably express it in terms of dollars, and indicate whether it's favorable or unfavorable.\n\nSo, the total price variance is $13,460 unfavorable.\n\nHowever, since the question might be expecting a single dollar amount without specifying favorable or unfavorable, perhaps it's looking for just the absolute value.\n\nBut, in cost accounting, variances are typically indicated with their direction (favorable or unfavorable), so I think including that is important.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total variance in cost, not just the price variances.\n\nIf that's the case, then it would be the difference between actual total cost and standard total cost.\n\nActual total cost: $561,620\n\nStandard total cost: $535,275\n\nDifference: $561,620 - $535,275 = $26,345 unfavorable.\n\nBut, I think the question is specifically asking for the variance of price, which I interpreted as the sum of price-related variances, i.e., materials price variance, labor rate variance, and overhead rate variances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it wants the total variance excluding any production volume variances or something, but I need to stick with what's given.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial calculation of $13,460 unfavorable as the total price variance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13460} \\]"
