                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about the information-oriented maturity model. It mentions that there are 15 capabilities which come from three information functions. The options are:\n\nA. Information collection and integration\n\nB. IT practices\n\nC. Information management\n\nD. Information Behavior and Values\n\nAnd I need to figure out which one of these is not included in the model.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the model looks like. From the description, it seems like the model is structured with three main categories, each representing an information function, and under each of these, there are several capabilities.\n\nSo, let's list out what's under each category based on the diagram mentioned.\n\nUnder \"Information technology practices capability,\" there are:\n\n1. IT for management support\n\n2. IT for innovation support\n\n3. IT for business process support\n\n4. IT for operational support\n\nThat's four capabilities under IT practices.\n\nUnder \"Information management practices capability,\" there are:\n\n1. Sensing\n\n2. Processing\n\n3. Maintaining\n\n4. Organizing\n\n5. Collecting\n\nThat's five capabilities under information management.\n\nUnder \"Information behaviours and values capability,\" there are:\n\n1. Proactiveness\n\n2. Sharing\n\n3. Transparency\n\n4. Control\n\n5. Formality\n\n6. Integrity\n\nThat's six capabilities under information behavior and values.\n\nSo, in total, that's 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 capabilities, which matches the description.\n\nNow, looking at option A: Information collection and integration. I need to see if this is included in any of these categories.\n\nLooking at the information management practices, under \"Information management practices capability,\" there is \"Collecting\" as one of the capabilities. So, collection is part of information management.\n\nBut option A mentions \"information collection and integration.\" While \"collecting\" is there, \"integration\" isn't explicitly listed.\n\nWait, in the information management practices, there's \"processing,\" which could involve integrating information, but it's not explicitly called \"integration.\"\n\nSo, perhaps \"information collection and integration\" isn't a direct category in the model.\n\nBut to be sure, let's think about it differently.\n\nMaybe \"information collection and integration\" is not a separate capability but rather part of other capabilities.\n\nFor example, \"collecting\" is under information management, and \"integration\" might be part of \"processing\" or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"information collection and integration\" isn't a distinct capability in the model, and the model covers collection but not explicitly integration.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Information collection and integration\n\nB. IT practices\n\nC. Information management\n\nD. Information Behavior and Values\n\nFrom the list of capabilities provided, \"IT practices,\" \"information management,\" and \"information behavior and values\" are all categories with multiple capabilities under them.\n\n\"Information collection and integration\" seems like it might be a specific capability, but based on the capabilities listed, \"collecting\" is under information management, and \"integration\" isn't directly listed.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is not a direct category in the model.\n\nBut maybe \"integration\" is part of \"processing\" in information management.\n\nLooking at the capabilities under information management:\n\n- Sensing\n\n- Processing\n\n- Maintaining\n\n- Organizing\n\n- Collecting\n\nProcessing could involve integrating information, but it's not explicitly labeled as integration.\n\nMoreover, the question is asking which ability is not included in the following options, assuming that the options are meant to represent categories or groupings within the model.\n\nGiven that, \"IT practices,\" \"information management,\" and \"information behavior and values\" are all categories with multiple capabilities under them, as shown in the diagram.\n\n\"Information collection and integration,\" however, seems to be a specific capability that isn't directly represented in the model's structure provided.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that option A is not included in the model as described.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"information collection and integration\" is considered part of information management, but since \"integration\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the capabilities, it might not be fully covered.\n\nIn any case, based on the capabilities listed, \"information collection and integration\" isn't a distinct capability in the model, whereas the other options are clearly part of the model's structure.\n\nSo, my answer would be option A: Information collection and integration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
