                    "text": "So I've got this table here that shows the monthly performance of 20 different stores over March, April, and May. For each store, it lists the total sales amount in thousands of dollars for each month, the average number of daily sales for each month, and then there's a column for the average length of visit in minutes. The question is asking about May specifically, comparing the store that had the fewest average daily sales in May with the store that had the most average daily sales in May, and seeing whether the store with the fewest sales had higher total dollar sales than the one with the most sales in that month.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to identify which store had the fewest average daily sales in May and which store had the most average daily sales in May. Then, I need to look at their total sales amounts for May and compare those figures.\n\nLet me start by looking at the \"Average number of daily sales\" column for May. I need to find the minimum and maximum values in that column.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Ashford: 123\n\n- Bennington: 80\n\n- Carlisle: 52\n\n- Depot: 112\n\n- Eddington: 118\n\n- Farpoint: 95\n\n- Greenville: 151\n\n- Harrington: 100\n\n- Iverton: 66\n\n- Jackson: 143\n\n- Kiplinger: 110\n\n- Landfield: 115\n\n- Midville: 70\n\n- Northfield: 78\n\n- Overton: 103\n\n- Princeville: 92\n\n- Queensland: 118\n\n- Riverton: 131\n\n- Southland: 115\n\n- Tuxedo: 128\n\nFrom these numbers, the lowest average daily sales in May is 52 for Carlisle, and the highest is 151 for Greenville.\n\nSo, Carlisle had the fewest average daily sales in May, and Greenville had the most.\n\nNow, I need to look at their total sales amounts for May.\n\nCarlisle's total sales in May: $465 thousand.\n\nGreenville's total sales in May: $508 thousand.\n\nThe statement says: \"The store that averaged the fewest sales in May had higher total dollar sales that month than the store that averaged the most sales in May.\"\n\nSo, according to the data, Carlisle had $465 thousand in sales, and Greenville had $508 thousand in sales. Clearly, $465 thousand is less than $508 thousand.\n\nTherefore, the store with the fewest average daily sales in May did not have higher total dollar sales than the store with the most average daily sales in May.\n\nHence, the statement is false.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I have the right stores.\n\nYes, Carlisle had the lowest average daily sales in May (52), and Greenville had the highest (151).\n\nAnd their total sales amounts are $465 thousand and $508 thousand, respectively.\n\nSo, Greenville had higher total sales despite having more daily sales on average. That means Carlisle did not have higher total sales than Greenville in May.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. False}} \\]"
