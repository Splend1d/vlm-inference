What proportion of American energy needs can be met through domestic production? How do current production levels compare with previous years? What do we know about trends in demand? And if we must import, how much of that need can be answered by Canada? Positioning the company as an American energy company would be the most positive stance but only if we can support it by showing that our product comes from if not U.S. wells at least North American sources. E-mail #2: E-mail from Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager: Domestic production is healthy, but while it may be true that U.S.-based companies now produce more than the United States imports, we certainly don't produce as much as we consume, as you can see in the following graph. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager: ABC Oil's headquarters may be in Texas, but it sources crude from 21 countries, including both relatively stable nations like Kazakhstan and nations with periodic violent crises like Chad. XYZ Oil's practices are similar. We're a global society now, and an \"American\" company just means where the company pays taxes, not necessarily where it produces. The United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but our local fields produce less than half that. The difference has to come from fields somewhere else, no matter what company owns them. This isn't local farming where you eat what's grown close to home. We may be able to focus attention on our ties to American plants and American workers, but the product is an international mix. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The idea of \"American\" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this. So, I've got this graph here that shows U.S. oil production and consumption from 1980 to around 2010. It's a line graph with two lines: one for consumption and one for production, both measured in millions of barrels per day. The x-axis is the years, starting from 1980 up to 2010, and the y-axis is the number of barrels, going up to 25 million.\n\nFirst, looking at the consumption line, it seems to be generally increasing over time. In 1980, it was about 17 million barrels per day, and by 2010, it's around 19.18 million. There are some fluctuations along the way, but the overall trend is upwards.\n\nNow, for production, it's a different story. In 1980, production was about 9 million barrels per day, and it has been decreasing steadily over the years, dropping to around 5.47 million by 2010. So, while consumption is going up, production is coming down. That means the gap between what we consume and what we produce is widening.\n\nThis brings up the issue of dependence on foreign oil. If the U.S. is consuming more oil than it produces, it has to import the difference from other countries. So, in 2010, consumption was 19.18 million barrels per day, and production was 5.47 million. That means we're importing roughly 13.71 million barrels per day.\n\nThe marketing manager is wondering how valid the image of the U.S. as dependent on foreign oil is, given that ABC Oil and XYZ Oil are profitable and possibly producing a lot of oil. But from the graph, it seems that even though U.S.-based companies might be producing a lot, it's not enough to meet domestic demand.\n\nResearcher #1 points out that domestic production is healthy, but it's not keeping up with consumption. The graph shows that production is decreasing, while consumption is increasing. So, even if U.S.-based companies are producing more, it's still not matching the domestic demand.\n\nResearcher #2 mentions that ABC Oil sources crude from 21 countries, including places like Kazakhstan and Chad. This suggests that the company is truly global in its operations, not just relying on domestic sources. XYZ Oil does the same. So, the idea of an \"American\" oil company might not be accurate because they operate internationally.\n\nThe researcher also notes that the United States consumes over 18 million barrels per day, but local fields produce less than half that. So, the majority of the oil consumed in the U.S. is imported from other countries.\n\nThe statement at the end says: \"The idea of 'American' oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries.\"\n\nBased on the information from the graph and the researchers' emails, this seems to be true. The graph shows that U.S. production is decreasing while consumption is increasing, meaning that more oil is being imported. Researcher #2 explicitly states that ABC Oil sources crude from 21 countries, indicating a global operation.\n\nMoreover, the researcher mentions that the product is an international mix, and it's not feasible to have a local farming approach to oil production due to the global nature of the industry.\n\nTherefore, the inference that the concept of \"American\" oil companies is outdated because they operate on a global scale is supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Yes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Yes}} \\]"
