It's from 2002, and it talks about five different planes that are all interconnected and important for making a website user-friendly. The options given are A. cooperate, B. scope, C. structure, and D. strategy. I need to pick which one isn't part of the model.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the five planes are. I remember that they start with strategy and go all the way to surface. Let me list them out to make sure:\n\n1. Strategy\n\n2. Scope\n\n3. Structure\n\n4. Skeleton\n\n5. Surface\n\nOkay, so these are the five planes. It's like a ladder, where each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring that the website is not only functional but also easy and pleasant to use.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. cooperate\n\nB. scope\n\nC. structure\n\nD. strategy\n\nI can see that \"cooperate\" isn't in the list of the five planes. \"Scope\" is the second plane, \"structure\" is the third, and \"strategy\" is the first. So, based on this, \"cooperate\" seems to be the odd one out.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should think about what each plane represents.\n\nStarting with Strategy: this is about the goals of the website, what it's trying to achieve, and who the target audience is. It's the foundational part.\n\nScope comes next: here, it's about determining the features and content that will help achieve the strategic goals. It's like outlining what the website will offer.\n\nStructure is about organizing the content and features in a way that makes sense to the users. It's the information architecture.\n\nSkeleton is the design phase, where the layout and interaction design are defined. It's about how the website looks and feels.\n\nFinally, Surface is the visual design, the aesthetics, and the user interface elements that users interact with directly.\n\n\"Cooperate\" doesn't fit into any of these descriptions. It sounds like it might relate to collaboration or teamwork, but that's not directly part of the user experience model for a website.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that \"cooperate\" is not part of the model definition. Therefore, the answer should be A. cooperate.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe \"cooperate\" is a typo or something, but I don't think so. It's clearly listed as an option, and it doesn't match any of the five planes.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ cooperate}} \\]"
