                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, Kimpel Products is thinking about making smaller ovens for schools and colleges. To do that, they need to build an experimental model, and there are several activities involved in that process. The table provided outlines these activities, their normal and crash times in weeks, the associated costs, and their immediate predecessors.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a predecessor is in this context. A predecessor is an activity that must be completed before another activity can start. So, for example, activity D can't start until activity A is finished, since A is its immediate predecessor. Similarly, activity G requires both D and E to be completed first.\n\nMy goal is to find the project completion date, and there are options provided with different slack values. Slack, as I recall, is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the entire project. So, if an activity has a slack of zero, it's on the critical path and any delay will delay the project.\n\nI think the first step is to identify the critical path, which is the longest sequence of activities from the start to the finish of the project. The duration of the critical path will give me the minimum time required to complete the project.\n\nTo do that, I need to:\n\n1. List out the activities in their dependency order.\n\n2. Calculate the early start (ES), early finish (EF), late start (LS), late finish (LF), and slack for each activity.\n\n3. Identify the path with zero slack; that's the critical path.\n\nLet's start by identifying the sequence of activities.\n\nActivity A has no predecessors, so it can start immediately.\n\nActivity B has no predecessors, so it can also start immediately.\n\nActivity C has no predecessors, so it can start immediately as well.\n\nActivity D depends on A, so it can't start until A is finished.\n\nActivity E depends on B, so it can't start until B is finished.\n\nActivity F depends on C, so it can't start until C is finished.\n\nActivity G depends on both D and E, so it can't start until both D and E are finished.\n\nNow, let's create a network diagram to visualize this.\n\n- A: 3 weeks normal time\n\n- B: 2 weeks normal time\n\n- C: 1 week normal time\n\n- D: 7 weeks normal time, depends on A\n\n- E: 6 weeks normal time, depends on B\n\n- F: 2 weeks normal time, depends on C\n\n- G: 4 weeks normal time, depends on D and E\n\nFrom this, I can see that there are multiple paths through this network.\n\nLet's identify the possible paths:\n\n1. A \u2192 D \u2192 G\n\n2. B \u2192 E \u2192 G\n\n3. C \u2192 F\n\n4. Any combinations thereof, but for project completion, we need to consider the longest path because G depends on both D and E.\n\nWait, actually, since G depends on both D and E, the path A \u2192 D \u2192 G and B \u2192 E \u2192 G are interconnected because G requires both D and E. So, the project completion time will be determined by the longer of the two paths A \u2192 D \u2192 G and B \u2192 E \u2192 G.\n\nActivity C \u2192 F seems to be independent of the other paths since its predecessor is C, which has no connection to G. So, C \u2192 F might be on a separate branch.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\n- Path 1: A \u2192 D \u2192 G\n\n- Path 2: B \u2192 E \u2192 G\n\n- Path 3: C \u2192 F\n\nNow, since G depends on both D and E, which are on paths 1 and 2, the project completion time will be determined by the longer of paths 1 and 2. Path 3, C \u2192 F, doesn't directly contribute to the completion of G, so its slack will be equal to the difference in time between the critical path and this path.\n\nWait, but in reality, since C \u2192 F doesn't feed into G, it might not affect the project completion date directly. But I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me recall that in critical path analysis, activities that are not on the critical path can have slack, meaning they can be delayed without delaying the project.\n\nSo, let's proceed to calculate the early start and early finish times for each activity.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the early start (ES) and early finish (EF) for each activity.\n\nStart with:\n\n- A: ES = 0, EF = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- B: ES = 0, EF = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n- C: ES = 0, EF = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, D depends on A, so ES_D = EF_A = 3, EF_D = ES_D + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nE depends on B, so ES_E = EF_B = 2, EF_E = ES_E + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nF depends on C, so ES_F = EF_C = 1, EF_F = ES_F + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nG depends on both D and E, so ES_G is the maximum of EF_D and EF_E, which is max(10, 8) = 10, EF_G = ES_G + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14\n\nSo, the project completion time is 14 weeks.\n\nBut let's check the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) to confirm the slacks.\n\nLS = LF - duration\n\nLF for the project is 14.\n\nSo, starting from the end:\n\nG: LF_G = 14, LS_G = LF_G - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10\n\nD: Since G depends on D, and D's EF is 10, which matches ES_G, then LF_D = LS_G = 10, LS_D = LF_D - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3\n\nE: Similarly, LF_E = LS_G = 10, LS_E = LF_E - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nA: Since D depends on A, LF_A = LS_D = 3, LS_A = LF_A - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nB: Since E depends on B, LF_B = LS_E = 4, LS_B = LF_B - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nC: F depends on C, LF_F = EF_F = 3 (since it's on the independent path), LS_F = LF_F - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nNow, slack for each activity is LS - ES.\n\nSo:\n\nA: 0 - 0 = 0\n\nB: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nC: 1 - 0 = 1\n\nD: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nE: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nF: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nG: 10 - 10 = 0\n\nSo, the slacks are: 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Slacks are: 0, 2, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0\n\nB. Slacks are: 0, 3, 10, 0, 3, 10, 0\n\nC. Slacks are: 0, 4, 9, 0, 4, 9, 0\n\nD. Slacks are: 0, 5, 11, 0, 5, 11, 0\n\nNone of these match my calculations. I have slacks of 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0 for A through G.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the letters. Let's check the table again.\n\nOh, in the table, the activities are listed as A through G, but in the options, they might be ordered differently. Wait, the options are given as \"slacks are: 0, 2, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0\", which seems to correspond to A through G, but with some inconsistencies.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are not labeled correctly, or maybe there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the early and late finish times.\n\nProject completion is determined by activity G, which is 14 weeks.\n\nFor activity G, EF_G = 14, LF_G = 14, LS_G = 10, slack = 4 weeks. Wait, earlier I had LS_G = 10, but according to my earlier calculation, LF_G = 14, LS_G = LF_G - duration = 14 - 4 = 10, which matches EF_D = 10, so ES_G = 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the late start and late finish calculations.\n\nLet's try again.\n\nStart from the end:\n\nG has no successors, so LF_G = EF_G = 14, LS_G = LF_G - duration = 14 - 4 = 10\n\nD is a predecessor of G, and its EF_D = 10, which matches ES_G = 10, so LF_D = LS_G = 10, LS_D = LF_D - duration = 10 - 7 = 3\n\nE is also a predecessor of G, and its EF_E = 8, which is less than ES_G = 10, so LF_E should be LS_G = 10, LS_E = LF_E - duration = 10 - 6 = 4\n\nA is predecessor of D, so LF_A = LS_D = 3, LS_A = LF_A - duration = 3 - 3 = 0\n\nB is predecessor of E, so LF_B = LS_E = 4, LS_B = LF_B - duration = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nC is predecessor of F, and F has no successors, so LF_F = EF_F = 3, LS_F = LF_F - duration = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nNow, slack for each activity:\n\nA: 0 - 0 = 0\n\nB: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nC: 1 - 0 = 1\n\nD: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nE: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nF: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nG: 10 - 10 = 0\n\nSo, slacks are: 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0 for A through G.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0, 2, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0\n\nB. 0, 3, 10, 0, 3, 10, 0\n\nC. 0, 4, 9, 0, 4, 9, 0\n\nD. 0, 5, 11, 0, 5, 11, 0\n\nNone of these match my calculations. It seems there might be an error in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the activities are ordered differently. Maybe the first option corresponds to A, B, C, D, E, F, G in that order.\n\nBut according to my calculations, it should be 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0.\n\nWait, maybe the options are mislabeled or there's a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the slack values in a different order, like in the order of the table.\n\nLooking back, the table lists activities A through G in order.\n\nOption A: 0, 2, 11, 0, 2, 11, 0\n\nThis doesn't match my calculations.\n\nOption B: 0, 3, 10, 0, 3, 10, 0\n\nStill doesn't match.\n\nOption C: 0, 4, 9, 0, 4, 9, 0\n\nNot matching.\n\nOption D: 0, 5, 11, 0, 5, 11, 0\n\nStill no match.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me re-examine the dependencies.\n\nActivity G depends on both D and E. So, ES_G is the maximum of EF_D and EF_E.\n\nEF_D is 10 (A=3, D=7), EF_E is 8 (B=2, E=6).\n\nSo, ES_G = max(10, 8) = 10, EF_G = 10 + 4 = 14.\n\nThen, LF_G = 14, LS_G = 10.\n\nFor D: LF_D = LS_G = 10, LS_D = 3.\n\nFor E: LF_E = LS_G = 10, LS_E = 4.\n\nFor A: LF_A = LS_D = 3, LS_A = 0.\n\nFor B: LF_B = LS_E = 4, LS_B = 2.\n\nFor C: LF_C is determined by F, which has no successors, so LF_F = EF_F = 3, LS_F = 1.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the project completion date is being asked in a different context, like considering crashing costs or something, but the question seems to be only about normal durations and slacks.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct slacks are 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0 for A through G.\n\nSince none of the options match, maybe there's a typo or misinterpretation in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to present the slacks in a different sequence, like considering only certain paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the project completion date is being asked in terms of the critical path, which is A \u2192 D \u2192 G or B \u2192 E \u2192 G, both of which are critical since their slacks are zero.\n\nWait, in my calculations, only A and D and G have zero slack, while B, E, and F have slack.\n\nBut according to the options, they show slacks for all seven activities.\n\nGiven that, and my calculations showing slacks of 0,2,1,0,2,2,0, none of the options match.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to present the slacks in a different order or considering only certain activities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my calculations: project completion date is 14 weeks, with slacks for A through G being 0,2,1,0,2,2,0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"
