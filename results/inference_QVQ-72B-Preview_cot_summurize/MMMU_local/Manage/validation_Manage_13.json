So, we have joint products M, N, and T with their respective units produced and sold, total separable costs after split-off, and total final sales values. The joint cost is $120,000, and we need to allocate this cost to each product using the net realizable value method.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the net realizable value method is. From what I recall, it's a way of allocating joint costs based on each product's ability to generate revenue. Specifically, it looks at the sales value minus any separable costs after the split-off point.\n\nSo, the net realizable value (NRV) for each product would be the total final sales value minus the total separable costs after split-off.\n\nLet me calculate that for each product:\n\nFor Product M:\n\nNRV_M = Sales Value_M - Separable Costs_M = $160,000 - $10,000 = $150,000\n\nFor Product N:\n\nNRV_N = $140,000 - $10,000 = $130,000\n\nFor Product T:\n\nNRV_T = $25,000 - $5,000 = $20,000\n\nNow, I need to find the total NRV for all products combined:\n\nTotal NRV = NRV_M + NRV_N + NRV_T = $150,000 + $130,000 + $20,000 = $300,000\n\nNext, I should allocate the joint cost proportionally to each product's NRV.\n\nSo, the allocation for each product would be:\n\nAllocation_M = (NRV_M / Total NRV) * Joint Cost = ($150,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 = 0.5 * $120,000 = $60,000\n\nAllocation_N = ($130,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 \u2248 0.4333 * $120,000 \u2248 $51,996\n\nAllocation_T = ($20,000 / $300,000) * $120,000 \u2248 0.0667 * $120,000 \u2248 $8,004\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check those calculations.\n\nFirst, $150,000 / $300,000 is indeed 0.5.\n\n0.5 * $120,000 = $60,000 for Product M.\n\nThen, $130,000 / $300,000 is approximately 0.4333.\n\n0.4333 * $120,000 = $51,996 for Product N.\n\nAnd $20,000 / $300,000 is approximately 0.0667.\n\n0.0667 * $120,000 = $8,004 for Product T.\n\nNow, let's see if these add up to the total joint cost.\n\n$60,000 + $51,996 + $8,004 = $120,000\n\nPerfect, no rounding errors here.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C shows M: $60,000; N: $51,996; T: $8,004, which matches my calculations.\n\nBut wait, option D has M: $60,000; N: $51,996; T: $12,000, which doesn't make sense because $12,000 is the separable cost for T, not the allocated joint cost.\n\nOption A has M: $57,000; N: $47,000; T: $16,000, which doesn't match our calculations.\n\nOption B has M: $57,000; N: $47,000; T: $20,000, which also doesn't match.\n\nSo, according to my calculations, option C is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm using the correct method.\n\nI recall that the net realizable value method allocates joint costs based on the proportion of each product's NRV to the total NRV.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the sales value at split-off point, but in this case, we have final sales values after separable costs, so using NRV seems appropriate.\n\nAnother method is the physical measure method, but that's not what's being asked here.\n\nSo, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me confirm the NRV calculations again.\n\nFor M: $160,000 - $10,000 = $150,000\n\nFor N: $140,000 - $10,000 = $130,000\n\nFor T: $25,000 - $5,000 = $20,000\n\nTotal NRV: $300,000\n\nJoint cost: $120,000\n\nAllocations:\n\nM: $60,000\n\nN: $51,996\n\nT: $8,004\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
