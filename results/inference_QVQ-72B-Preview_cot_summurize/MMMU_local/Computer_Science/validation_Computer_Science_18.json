The options are given, and I need to pick the correct sequence of vertices that I'd visit. Let me try to understand this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a depth-first search (DFS) is. DFS starts at a given vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack implicitly to keep track of the path.\n\nLooking at the adjacency list provided in the image, I can see the connections:\n\n- V1 points to V5 and V2\n\n- V2 points to V3\n\n- V3 points to V5 and V4\n\n- V4 points to V7 and V6\n\n- V5 points to V3 and V4\n\n- V6 points to V7\n\n- V7 points to V6\n\nWait, the image shows arrows indicating the directions of the edges. For example, V1 has arrows to V5 and V2; V2 has an arrow to V3, and so on.\n\nSo, starting from V1, I'll first visit V5, since it's one of the vertices V1 points to. Then, from V5, I'll visit V3 and V4, in the order they appear.\n\nFrom V3, I can see it points to V5 and V4, but since I've already visited V5 and V4, I'll skip them.\n\nFrom V4, I'll visit V7 and V6.\n\nFrom V7, it points to V6, which I've already visited.\n\nFrom V6, it points to V7, which I've already visited.\n\nSo, the sequence should be V1 -> V5 -> V3 -> V4 -> V7 -> V6.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this sequence. Option A is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\nHmm, maybe I missed V2. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from V1, it points to V5 and V2. I chose V5 first, but maybe I should consider V2 first.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStart at V1, visit V2.\n\nFrom V2, visit V3.\n\nFrom V3, visit V5 and V4.\n\nFrom V5, visit V3 and V4, but V3 and V4 are already visited.\n\nFrom V4, visit V7 and V6.\n\nFrom V7, visit V6.\n\nFrom V6, visit V7, but V7 is already visited.\n\nSo, the sequence is V1, V2, V3, V5, V4, V7, V6.\n\nBut this isn't matching any of the options directly. Option B is V1, V2, V3, V4, V7, V6, V5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not following the DFS correctly.\n\nLet me try to list the steps again.\n\nStart at V1.\n\nVisit V1.\n\nChoose V5 next (since it's first in the list).\n\nVisit V5.\n\nNow, from V5, visit V3.\n\nVisit V3.\n\nFrom V3, visit V5 and V4, but V5 is already visited, so visit V4.\n\nVisit V4.\n\nFrom V4, visit V7.\n\nVisit V7.\n\nFrom V7, visit V6.\n\nVisit V6.\n\nNow, from V6, visit V7, but V7 is already visited.\n\nSo, the sequence is V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6.\n\nBut looking back, option A is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\nOption B is V1, V2, V3, V4, V7, V6, V5.\n\nOption C is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V3, V2.\n\nOption D is V1, V5, V6, V4, V7, V2, V3.\n\nNone of them match my sequence exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after visiting V7 from V4, and then V6 from V7, I need to backtrack and visit V2 from V1.\n\nSo, continuing from V6, since V7 is already visited, maybe I need to go back to V1 and visit V2.\n\nBut in DFS, once you finish exploring a branch, you backtrack to the previous vertex and visit its unvisited neighbors.\n\nSo, after visiting V1 -> V5 -> V3 -> V4 -> V7 -> V6, since V7 is already visited from V6, I should go back to V4 and see if there are any unvisited neighbors, but V7 and V6 are already visited.\n\nThen, go back to V3, but V5 and V4 are already visited.\n\nThen, go back to V5, but V3 and V4 are already visited.\n\nThen, go back to V1, and visit V2.\n\nFrom V2, visit V3.\n\nFrom V3, visit V5 and V4, but they are already visited.\n\nSo, the complete sequence is V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\nBut V3 is visited twice, which might not be necessary. Maybe I should avoid visiting a vertex more than once.\n\nLooking back, when I backtracked to V3 after visiting V4 -> V7 -> V6, V3 was already visited, so I should skip it.\n\nSo, the sequence would be V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nThis matches option A: V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\nBut in my sequence, V3 is visited before V4, whereas in option A, it's V4 before V3.\n\nWait, in my sequence, it's V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nOption A is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\nSo, the difference is the order of V3 and V4.\n\nIn DFS, the order depends on the order in which we explore the neighbors.\n\nFrom V5, we visit V3 first and then V4.\n\nFrom V3, we visit V5 and V4, but V5 is already visited, so V4 next.\n\nSo, V3 before V4 seems correct.\n\nBut option A has V4 before V3, which doesn't match.\n\nOption C has V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V3, V2, which also has V4 before V3.\n\nOption D has V1, V5, V6, V4, V7, V2, V3, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the order.\n\nLet me try to draw the graph based on the adjacency list.\n\nVertices: V1 to V7.\n\nEdges:\n\nV1 -> V5\n\nV1 -> V2\n\nV2 -> V3\n\nV3 -> V5\n\nV3 -> V4\n\nV4 -> V7\n\nV4 -> V6\n\nV5 -> V3\n\nV5 -> V4\n\nV6 -> V7\n\nV7 -> V6\n\nWait, there are multiple edges between some vertices.\n\nLet me try to trace the DFS again.\n\nStart at V1.\n\nVisit V1.\n\nChoose V5 next.\n\nVisit V5.\n\nFrom V5, visit V3.\n\nVisit V3.\n\nFrom V3, visit V5 and V4, but V5 is already visited, so visit V4.\n\nVisit V4.\n\nFrom V4, visit V7.\n\nVisit V7.\n\nFrom V7, visit V6.\n\nVisit V6.\n\nFrom V6, visit V7, but V7 is already visited.\n\nNow, since there are no more unvisited neighbors, backtrack to V4.\n\nFrom V4, all neighbors (V7 and V6) are visited.\n\nBacktrack to V3.\n\nFrom V3, all neighbors (V5 and V4) are visited.\n\nBacktrack to V5.\n\nFrom V5, all neighbors (V3 and V4) are visited.\n\nBacktrack to V1.\n\nFrom V1, visit V2.\n\nVisit V2.\n\nFrom V2, visit V3.\n\nBut V3 is already visited.\n\nSo, the sequence is V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nThis matches option A, which is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3, except that in my sequence, V3 is before V4, but in option A, V4 is before V3.\n\nWait, perhaps the order depends on the implementation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that from V5, both V3 and V4 are options, and the order might differ based on the implementation.\n\nBut in the adjacency list, V5 points to V3 and then to V4.\n\nSo, V3 should be visited before V4.\n\nOption A has V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3, which seems incorrect based on this.\n\nOption C has V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V3, V2, which also has V4 before V3.\n\nOption D has V1, V5, V6, V4, V7, V2, V3, which is different.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is option A, even though it has V4 before V3, because perhaps the implementation visits V4 before V3 from V5.\n\nBut according to the adjacency list, V5 points to V3 first and then to V4.\n\nSo, V3 should be visited before V4.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to look at it differently.\n\nPerhaps the adjacency list is represented in a different order.\n\nLooking back at the image, the boxes are arranged in columns, with arrows indicating the connections.\n\nFrom the image:\n\n- V1 points to V5 and V2\n\n- V2 points to V3\n\n- V3 points to V5 and V4\n\n- V4 points to V7 and V6\n\n- V5 points to V3 and V4\n\n- V6 points to V7\n\n- V7 points to V6\n\nSo, starting from V1, visit V5.\n\nFrom V5, visit V3.\n\nFrom V3, visit V5 (already visited) and V4.\n\nVisit V4.\n\nFrom V4, visit V7.\n\nVisit V7.\n\nFrom V7, visit V6.\n\nVisit V6.\n\nFrom V6, visit V7 (already visited).\n\nNow, backtrack to V4, then to V3, then to V5, then to V1.\n\nFrom V1, visit V2.\n\nVisit V2.\n\nFrom V2, visit V3 (already visited).\n\nSo, the sequence is V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nThis matches option A, which is V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3, except that in option A, V4 is before V3, whereas in my sequence, V3 is before V4.\n\nPerhaps the implementation visits V4 before V3 from V5.\n\nBut according to the adjacency list, V5 points to V3 first and then to V4.\n\nSo, V3 should be visited before V4.\n\nUnless the adjacency list is ordered differently, but from the image, it seems V5 points to V3 and then to V4.\n\nMaybe the answer is option A, and the order is V4 before V3 due to some implementation detail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adjacency list is not strictly ordered, and the implementation can choose the order.\n\nBut in that case, both sequences could be considered correct, but the question likely expects one specific answer.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option A: V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2, V3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
