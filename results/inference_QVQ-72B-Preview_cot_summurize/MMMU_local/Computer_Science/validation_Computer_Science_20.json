                    "text": "So I have this database schema here with several tables: Employee, Department, Dept_Locations, Project, Works_On, and Dependent. There are relationships between these tables, indicated by the lines connecting them. I need to figure out if I can add a department even if there are no employees in the database yet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between these tables. Let's look at the Department table. It has columns: Dname, Dnumber, Mgr_ssn, and Mgr_start_date. The primary key seems to be Dnumber, and Mgr_ssn is likely a foreign key referencing the Employee table's Ssn.\n\nThe Employee table has columns: Fname, Minit, Lname, Ssn, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Super_ssn, and Dno. Here, Ssn is the primary key, and Dno is a foreign key referencing the Department table's Dnumber.\n\nDept_Locations has Dnumber and Dlocation, which probably reference the Department table.\n\nProject has Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, and Dnum, where Dnum references the Department table's Dnumber.\n\nWorks_On has Essn, Pno, and Hours, referencing Employee's Ssn and Project's Pnumber.\n\nDependent has Essn, Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate, and Relationship, referencing Employee's Ssn.\n\nNow, the question is whether I can add a department when there are no employees in the database. Specifically, I need to consider if there are any constraints that would prevent adding a department record without having an employee record first.\n\nLooking at the Department table, it has a Mgr_ssn field, which is presumably a foreign key to the Employee table's Ssn. This means that for each department, there must be a manager who is an employee in the database.\n\nSo, if there are no employees in the database, there would be no valid Ssn to reference in the Mgr_ssn field. This suggests that I cannot add a department without having at least one employee in the database to be the manager.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any possibility of default values or nulls being allowed in the Mgr_ssn field. If Mgr_ssn is allowed to be null, then I might be able to add a department without assigning a manager immediately.\n\nBut, in most database designs, especially in real-world scenarios, the manager of a department should be designated upon the department's creation. So, it's likely that Mgr_ssn is a required field and cannot be null.\n\nAdditionally, there might be business rules in place that prevent adding a department without having at least one employee assigned to it. But from the schema provided, I don't see a direct relationship that enforces this.\n\nWait a minute, the Department table has a Mgr_ssn field, which points to an employee who is the manager. So, to add a department, I need to have an employee who will be the manager. Without any employees, I can't assign a manager to the department, and thus, I shouldn't be able to add a department.\n\nBut, suppose that when creating a department, the manager can be assigned later. In that case, perhaps the Mgr_ssn field allows nulls temporarily, but this might not be a good practice.\n\nConsidering standard database design principles, I would say that without any employees in the database, it's not possible to add a department because there's no manager to assign to it.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps the company is just starting and hasn't hired any employees yet, but they want to set up the department structure in advance. In this case, they might want to add departments before hiring managers. However, based on the schema, this seems problematic because of the foreign key constraint on Mgr_ssn.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to create a department without a manager, but that would likely require relaxing the foreign key constraint, which isn't advisable.\n\nI should also consider the Dependent table. It references Essn, which is the employee's Ssn. So, without employees, there can't be any dependents. But this doesn't directly affect adding a department.\n\nSimilarly, the Works_On table relates employees to projects. Without employees, there can't be any work assignments, but again, this doesn't impact adding a department directly.\n\nThe Project table references the Department table via Dnum, so departments need to exist before projects can be added, but this doesn't help with adding departments without employees.\n\nDept_Locations simply lists locations for departments, referencing the Department table, so no direct dependency on employees there.\n\nTherefore, based on the schema and the relationships between tables, I conclude that it's not possible to add a department without having at least one employee in the database to serve as the department's manager.\n\nSo, the answer is B. No.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
