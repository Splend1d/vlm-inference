Let's try to understand the setup first.\n\nThere are four servers and four clients, all connected through a central hub or router, I guess. Each server connects to this central device with a link that has a capacity of 80 Mbps, and each client connects to it with a link of 60 Mbps. The central device itself has a total capacity of 300 Mbps, and it's supposed to share this fairly among the four pairs.\n\nOkay, so the path for each client-to-server pair goes like this: client to central device, then central device to server. Since there are four such paths sharing the central device, I need to consider how the central device's capacity is divided among them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the client-to-central link. Each client has a link with 60 Mbps capacity. But since the central device is shared among four clients, the central device's outgoing capacity to clients is 300 Mbps in total.\n\nWait, no. The central device has incoming links from servers and outgoing links to clients. Each server connects with 80 Mbps, and each client with 60 Mbps. But the central device itself has a capacity of 300 Mbps, which I think refers to its processing or forwarding capacity.\n\nI think the key here is that the central device has a total forwarding capacity of 300 Mbps, and it needs to fairly share this among the four traffic flows.\n\nSo, if the central device can forward a maximum of 300 Mbps in total, and there are four flows competing for this capacity, how does it allocate the bandwidth?\n\nIt says the middle link is fairly shared, meaning it divides its transmission rate equally among the flows. So, each flow would get 300 Mbps divided by 4, which is 75 Mbps.\n\nBut wait, each client has a link to the central device with 60 Mbps, and each server has a link with 80 Mbps. So, the bottleneck might not just be the central device's forwarding capacity but also the individual link capacities.\n\nI need to consider the entire path for each client-to-server pair. The path consists of:\n\n1. Client to central device (capacity 60 Mbps)\n\n2. Central device to server (capacity 80 Mbps)\n\n3. Central device's forwarding capacity (300 Mbps shared)\n\nBut since the central device is shared fairly, each flow gets 75 Mbps of its forwarding capacity.\n\nHowever, the client-to-central link is only 60 Mbps, which is less than 75 Mbps. So, for this particular path, the client-to-central link is the bottleneck.\n\nTherefore, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-to-server pair should be 60 Mbps.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the central device's forwarding capacity is the limiting factor?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf the central device can only forward 75 Mbps per flow, but the client-to-central link can only send at 60 Mbps, then the overall throughput can't exceed 60 Mbps because of the client-to-central link.\n\nUnless the central device can buffer data and forward it at a higher rate, but that's not indicated here.\n\nI think the answer is 60 Mbps per client-to-server pair.\n\nBut let me check another perspective.\n\nSuppose the central device can forward up to 300 Mbps in total, divided equally among four flows, so 75 Mbps each.\n\nBut each client can only send 60 Mbps to the central device.\n\nSo, even if the central device could handle 75 Mbps per flow, the client can't send that much.\n\nTherefore, the maximum achievable throughput is limited by the client's outgoing link, which is 60 Mbps.\n\nHence, the answer should be 60 Mbps.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something about the server's incoming link capacity.\n\nEach server has an 80 Mbps link to the central device, which is higher than 60 Mbps, so that shouldn't be the bottleneck.\n\nUnless the central device's forwarding capacity is the limiting factor.\n\nBut since 75 Mbps per flow is higher than 60 Mbps, and the client can only send 60 Mbps, the client's link is the bottleneck.\n\nSo, the maximum end-to-end throughput per client-to-server pair is 60 Mbps.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
