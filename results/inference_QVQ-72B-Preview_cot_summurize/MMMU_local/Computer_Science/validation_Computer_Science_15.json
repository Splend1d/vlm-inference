It's been labeled as a ternary relationship, which means it involves three entities, right? But looking at the diagram, I see three distinct sets: Employee, Works_For, and Department, with connections between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ternary relationship is. In database terms, a ternary relationship involves three entities, and the relationship itself is between all three. However, in this diagram, it seems like \"works_for\" is a relation that connects employees to departments, possibly through some intermediate roles or something.\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- On the left, there's the Employee set with elements e1 through e7 and so on.\n\n- In the middle, there's the Works_For set with elements r1 through r7 and so on.\n\n- On the right, there's the Department set with elements d1 through d3 and so on.\n\nThere are lines connecting employees to works_for and works_for to departments, forming a sort of bipartite graph between employees and departments via works_for.\n\nBut wait, if \"works_for\" is supposed to be a ternary relationship, maybe it's representing something more complex. Maybe each employee works for multiple departments or something like that, but that seems unusual in a typical organization.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In most organizational databases, an employee works for one department, and each department can have multiple employees. So, that would be a one-to-many relationship between department and employee. But here, there's this \"works_for\" in the middle, which might be representing multiple roles or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"works_for\" is not a ternary relationship but a junction entity in an entity-relationship diagram, representing many-to-many relationships between employees and departments.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall what a ternary relationship is. A ternary relationship involves three entities, and the relationship itself is between all three. For example, in a university database, you might have a ternary relationship between Student, Course, and Professor, where a student is taught by a professor in a particular course.\n\nBut in this case, we have Employee, Works_For, and Department. It seems like Works_For is the relationship between Employee and Department.\n\nLet me consider the options given for the type of relationship:\n\nA. 1:1\n\nB. 1:N\n\nC. N:1\n\nD. N:M\n\nE. None of the other answers.\n\nLooking at the diagram, each employee seems to be connected to multiple works_for relations, and each works_for relation is connected to multiple departments. But this seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently. Perhaps \"works_for\" is a relation that connects employees to departments, and the multiplicity depends on how many employees can work for how many departments.\n\nIf each employee can work for multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees, then it's a many-to-many relationship between Employee and Department.\n\nBut in the diagram, there's this intermediate \"works_for\" set, which might be representing roles or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"works_for\" is a role that employees have within departments, and each employee can have multiple roles in different departments.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about the type of relationship WORKS_ON in image 1. Hmm, but in this diagram, it's labeled as \"works_for\", not \"works_on\". Maybe there's a typo, and it should be \"works_for\".\n\nAssuming it's \"works_for\", let's proceed.\n\nIn the diagram, employees are connected to works_for relations, and works_for relations are connected to departments. It seems like each employee can be associated with multiple works_for relations, and each works_for relation is associated with multiple departments.\n\nThis suggests that it's a many-to-many relationship between Employee and Department, mediated by the works_for relation.\n\nBut in ER diagrams, a many-to-many relationship is often represented by a junction entity, which could be the works_for set in this case.\n\nSo, the relationship between Employee and Department is many-to-many, with works_for as the junction entity.\n\nTherefore, the type of relationship WORKS_FOR is N:M.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about WORKS_ON, but assuming it's a typo and should be WORKS_FOR, then the answer is N:M.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf it's a many-to-many relationship, then each employee can work for multiple departments, and each department can have multiple employees.\n\nSo, Employee to Department is N:M.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. N:M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
