                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. I've got an adjacency matrix for a weighted undirected graph, and I need to find the total weight of its minimum spanning tree. The options are 22, 20, 15, and 8. I'm a bit rusty on minimum spanning trees, but I remember that a minimum spanning tree connects all the vertices of a graph with the least possible total edge weight. Since the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix should be symmetric, which it is, so that's good.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an adjacency matrix is. It's a square matrix where the rows and columns represent the vertices of the graph, and the entries show the weights of the edges between them. A value of infinity (or in this case, \"\u221e\") typically represents no edge between two vertices.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\n```\n\n0   3   1   15  1   9\n\n3   \u221e   3   13  \u221e   8\n\n1   3   \u221e   1   1   2\n\n15  13  1   \u221e   18  \u221e\n\n1   \u221e   1   18  \u221e   2\n\n9   8   2   \u221e   2   \u221e\n\n```\n\nI should probably label the vertices to keep track of them. Let's say they are A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the columns and rows.\n\nSo, the matrix looks like this:\n\nA: 0, 3, 1, 15, 1, 9\n\nB: 3, \u221e, 3, 13, \u221e, 8\n\nC: 1, 3, \u221e, 1, 1, 2\n\nD: 15, 13, 1, \u221e, 18, \u221e\n\nE: 1, \u221e, 1, 18, \u221e, 2\n\nF: 9, 8, 2, \u221e, 2, \u221e\n\nNow, to find the minimum spanning tree, I can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. I think Kruskal's is simpler; I just sort all the edges in increasing order of weight and add them to the tree if they don't form a cycle.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the edges with their weights:\n\nFrom A to B: 3\n\nA to C: 1\n\nA to D: 15\n\nA to E: 1\n\nA to F: 9\n\nB to C: 3\n\nB to D: 13\n\nC to D: 1\n\nC to E: 1\n\nC to F: 2\n\nD to E: 18\n\nE to F: 2\n\nWait, looking back at the matrix:\n\nA: 0, 3, 1, 15, 1, 9\n\nB: 3, \u221e, 3, 13, \u221e, 8\n\nC: 1, 3, \u221e, 1, 1, 2\n\nD: 15, 13, 1, \u221e, 18, \u221e\n\nE: 1, \u221e, 1, 18, \u221e, 2\n\nF: 9, 8, 2, \u221e, 2, \u221e\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\n- A-B: 3\n\n- A-C: 1\n\n- A-D: 15\n\n- A-E: 1\n\n- A-F: 9\n\n- B-C: 3\n\n- B-D: 13\n\n- C-D: 1\n\n- C-E: 1\n\n- C-F: 2\n\n- D-E: 18\n\n- E-F: 2\n\nWait, there seems to be a discrepancy here. For example, from A to D it's 15, but from D to A should also be 15 since it's undirected. Similarly, from C to D it's 1, which should match D to C.\n\nNow, let's sort these edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\nEdge   Weight\n\nC-D    1\n\nA-C    1\n\nC-E    1\n\nC-F    2\n\nE-F    2\n\nA-B    3\n\nB-C    3\n\nA-F    9\n\nB-D    13\n\nD-E    18\n\nA-D    15\n\nNow, applying Kruskal's algorithm:\n\nStart with no edges and add the smallest edge as long as it doesn't form a cycle.\n\nStart with C-D: weight 1\n\nNext, A-C: weight 1 \u2013 but adding this would connect A and C, which are already connected via C-D, but since it's a new connection, it's fine.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful with the cycles. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Prim's algorithm, which might be easier here.\n\nLet's pick a starting vertex, say A, and build the minimum spanning tree step by step.\n\nFrom A, the smallest edge is to C with weight 1.\n\nSo, add A-C to the tree.\n\nNow, consider neighbors of A and C.\n\nFrom C, the smallest edge is to D with weight 1.\n\nAdd C-D to the tree.\n\nNow, from D, the smallest edge is to E with weight 1.\n\nWait, according to the matrix:\n\nFrom D to E: 18\n\nBut from E to D: 18\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nLooking back at the matrix:\n\nD: 15, 13, 1, \u221e, 18, \u221e\n\nWait, D to E is 18, but E to D is also 18.\n\nBut in the earlier list, I had C-E as 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing the edges.\n\nLet me re-list the edges with their weights properly.\n\nFrom the adjacency matrix:\n\nA-B: 3\n\nA-C: 1\n\nA-D: 15\n\nA-E: 1\n\nA-F: 9\n\nB-C: 3\n\nB-D: 13\n\nC-D: 1\n\nC-E: 1\n\nC-F: 2\n\nE-F: 2\n\nD-E: 18\n\nWait, C-D is 1, and D-C should also be 1.\n\nBut in the matrix, D to C is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the matrix earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the matrix:\n\nRows and columns are A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nA: 0, 3, 1, 15, 1, 9\n\nB: 3, \u221e, 3, 13, \u221e, 8\n\nC: 1, 3, \u221e, 1, 1, 2\n\nD: 15, 13, 1, \u221e, 18, \u221e\n\nE: 1, \u221e, 1, 18, \u221e, 2\n\nF: 9, 8, 2, \u221e, 2, \u221e\n\nSo, edges are:\n\nA-B: 3\n\nA-C: 1\n\nA-D: 15\n\nA-E: 1\n\nA-F: 9\n\nB-C: 3\n\nB-D: 13\n\nC-D: 1\n\nC-E: 1\n\nC-F: 2\n\nD-E: 18\n\nE-F: 2\n\nF-B: 8 (from F to B: 8)\n\nF-D: \u221e\n\nF-E: 2\n\nWait, F to E is 2.\n\nAlright, now let's sort the edges by weight:\n\nEdge   Weight\n\nC-D    1\n\nA-C    1\n\nC-E    1\n\nC-F    2\n\nE-F    2\n\nA-B    3\n\nB-C    3\n\nA-F    9\n\nB-D    13\n\nD-E    18\n\nA-D    15\n\nNow, applying Kruskal's algorithm:\n\nStart with no edges.\n\nAdd C-D: weight 1\n\nAdd A-C: weight 1 (no cycle)\n\nAdd C-E: weight 1 (no cycle)\n\nAdd C-F: weight 2 (no cycle)\n\nAdd E-F: weight 2 (no cycle)\n\nAdd A-B: weight 3 (no cycle)\n\nAdd B-C: weight 3 (but B is already connected via A-C and C-B, so this would create a cycle. Skip.)\n\nAdd A-F: weight 9 (no cycle)\n\nAdd B-D: weight 13 (no cycle)\n\nAdd D-E: weight 18 (no cycle)\n\nAdd A-D: weight 15 (no cycle)\n\nWait, but some of these additions might create cycles. I need to be more careful.\n\nAlternatively, using Prim's algorithm starting from A:\n\n1. Add A to the tree.\n\n2. Consider neighbors of A: B (3), C (1), D (15), E (1), F (9). Choose the smallest, which is C (1).\n\n3. Add A-C to the tree.\n\n4. Now, consider neighbors of A and C: B (3), D (15), E (1), F (2), and also C's neighbors: B (3), D (1), E (1), F (2).\n\nWait, need to consider all edges from A and C that haven't been added yet.\n\nFrom A: B (3), D (15), E (1), F (9)\n\nFrom C: B (3), D (1), E (1), F (2)\n\nChoose the smallest edge among these that doesn't form a cycle.\n\nAlready have A-C.\n\nNext smallest is C-D (1), add it.\n\nNow, have A-C and C-D.\n\nNext smallest is C-E (1), add it.\n\nNow, have A-C, C-D, C-E.\n\nNext smallest is C-F (2), add it.\n\nNow, have A-C, C-D, C-E, C-F.\n\nNext smallest is A-B (3), but B is not yet connected. Add A-B.\n\nNow, have A-C, C-D, C-E, C-F, A-B.\n\nNext smallest is B-C (3), but B is already connected via A-B, and adding B-C would create a cycle A-B-C-A. Skip.\n\nNext smallest is A-F (9), but F is already connected via C-F. Adding A-F would create a cycle A-C-F-A. Skip.\n\nNext smallest is B-D (13), but D is already connected via C-D. Adding B-D would create a cycle B-C-D-B. Skip.\n\nNext smallest is D-E (18), but E is already connected via C-E. Adding D-E would create a cycle D-C-E-D. Skip.\n\nNext smallest is A-D (15), but D is already connected via C-D. Adding A-D would create a cycle A-C-D-A. Skip.\n\nSo, the minimum spanning tree consists of edges:\n\nA-C (1), C-D (1), C-E (1), C-F (2), A-B (3)\n\nTotal weight: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8\n\nBut looking back at the options, 8 is one of them. But is this correct?\n\nWait, let me check if all vertices are included.\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nEdges in the tree: A-C, C-D, C-E, C-F, A-B.\n\nYes, all connected.\n\nBut let me see if there's a better way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, let's try Kruskal's algorithm properly.\n\nSort all edges:\n\nC-D:1\n\nA-C:1\n\nC-E:1\n\nC-F:2\n\nE-F:2\n\nA-B:3\n\nB-C:3\n\nA-F:9\n\nB-D:13\n\nD-E:18\n\nA-D:15\n\nAdd C-D (1)\n\nAdd A-C (1) \u2013 wait, A and C are now connected.\n\nAdd C-E (1) \u2013 no cycle\n\nAdd C-F (2) \u2013 no cycle\n\nAdd E-F (2) \u2013 no cycle\n\nAdd A-B (3) \u2013 no cycle\n\nAdd B-C (3) \u2013 but B is already connected via A-B and C (since A-B and A-C). Adding B-C would create a cycle A-B-C-A. Skip.\n\nAdd A-F (9) \u2013 F is connected via C-F. Adding A-F would create a cycle A-C-F-A. Skip.\n\nAdd B-D (13) \u2013 D is connected via C-D. Adding B-D would create a cycle B-C-D-B. Skip.\n\nAdd D-E (18) \u2013 E is connected via C-E. Adding D-E would create a cycle D-C-E-D. Skip.\n\nAdd A-D (15) \u2013 would create a cycle A-C-D-A. Skip.\n\nSo, the minimum spanning tree consists of C-D, A-C, C-E, C-F, A-B.\n\nTotal weight: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8\n\nWait, but in my earlier step with Prim's, I got the same result.\n\nBut the answer options include 22, 20, 15, and 8.\n\nIs there a possibility that I missed something?\n\nLet me try starting Prim's algorithm again.\n\nStart from A.\n\nFrom A: connections to B (3), C (1), D (15), E (1), F (9)\n\nChoose the smallest, which is C (1). Add A-C.\n\nNow, from C: connections to B (3), D (1), E (1), F (2)\n\nChoose the smallest, which is D (1). Add C-D.\n\nNow, from D: connections to E (18), which is larger than C-E (1), so skip.\n\nFrom C: connections to E (1). Add C-E.\n\nFrom E: connections to F (2). Add E-F.\n\nNow, from F: connections to C (2), E (2), B (8)\n\nBut C and E are already in the tree. B is not yet connected.\n\nAdd A-B (3)\n\nNow, all vertices are connected.\n\nTotal weight: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to connect them with a lower total weight.\n\nSuppose I choose different edges.\n\nWait, 8 seems to be the minimal possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the adjacency matrix interpretation.\n\nLooking back at the matrix:\n\nA: 0, 3, 1, 15, 1, 9\n\nB: 3, \u221e, 3, 13, \u221e, 8\n\nC: 1, 3, \u221e, 1, 1, 2\n\nD: 15, 13, 1, \u221e, 18, \u221e\n\nE: 1, \u221e, 1, 18, \u221e, 2\n\nF: 9, 8, 2, \u221e, 2, \u221e\n\nWait, in the matrix for E-F, it's 2, which matches.\n\nSo, my earlier approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph has some specific properties that make the minimal spanning tree different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw the graph to visualize.\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F\n\nEdges:\n\nA-B:3\n\nA-C:1\n\nA-D:15\n\nA-E:1\n\nA-F:9\n\nB-C:3\n\nB-D:13\n\nC-D:1\n\nC-E:1\n\nC-F:2\n\nD-E:18\n\nE-F:2\n\nF-B:8\n\nWait, F-B is 8, but in the matrix, F to B is 8.\n\nBut in the adjacency matrix, F to B is 8, but B to F is not directly given, but since it's undirected, B to F should also be 8.\n\nWait, in the matrix, B to F is 8, and F to B is 8.\n\nSo, B-F:8\n\nBut in my earlier list, I had A-F:9, but B-F:8.\n\nWait, in the matrix:\n\nF: 9, 8, 2, \u221e, 2, \u221e\n\nSo, F to A:9\n\nF to B:8\n\nF to C:2\n\nF to D:\u221e\n\nF to E:2\n\nF to F:\u221e\n\nSo, B-F is 8, which is less than A-F's 9.\n\nSo, in Prim's algorithm, when considering F's connections, B-F is 8, which is less than A-F's 9.\n\nSo, when I have F connected via C-F (2), and B connected via A-B (3) or B-F (8), but since C-F is already in the tree, and B is connected via A-B, which is already in the tree, no need to add B-F.\n\nSo, total weight remains 8.\n\nWait, but in Kruskal's, after adding A-C, C-D, C-E, C-F, A-B, total is 8.\n\nIs there a way to get a higher total?\n\nWait, maybe if I choose different edges, but that would likely increase the total weight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and the correct answer is 8.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
