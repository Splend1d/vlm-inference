                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about calculating the cost function for a simple linear regression model. The hypothesis is given as \\( h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 x \\), and there are three training examples plotted on a graph. The cost function is \\( J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{i}) - y^{i})^2 \\). I need to find \\( J(0) \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\) means in this context. If \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\), then \\( h_\\theta(x) = 0 \\cdot x = 0 \\). So, for any input \\( x \\), the prediction \\( h_\\theta(x) \\) is always 0.\n\nNow, looking at the graph, there are three points plotted:\n\n1. At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( h(x) = 1 \\)\n\n2. At \\( x = 2 \\), \\( h(x) = 2 \\)\n\n3. At \\( x = 3 \\), \\( h(x) = 3 \\)\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the points are plotted with 'x's at:\n\n- (1, 1)\n\n- (2, 2)\n\n- (3, 3)\n\nBut the y-axis is labeled \\( h(x) \\), and the x-axis is labeled \\( x \\). So, for each training example, \\( x^{i} \\) is the input and \\( y^{i} \\) is the target value.\n\nGiven that, for \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\), \\( h_\\theta(x^{i}) = 0 \\) for every \\( i \\), and \\( y^{i} \\) are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n\nThe cost function is \\( J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{i}) - y^{i})^2 \\), where \\( m = 3 \\).\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\( J(0) = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3} \\left[ (0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 + (0 - 3)^2 \\right] \\)\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\n1. \\( (0 - 1)^2 = 1 \\)\n\n2. \\( (0 - 2)^2 = 4 \\)\n\n3. \\( (0 - 3)^2 = 9 \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \\)\n\nNow, divide by \\( 2m \\), which is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\):\n\n\\( J(0) = \\frac{14}{6} \\)\n\nSimplifying, \\( \\frac{14}{6} = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.333 \\)\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1/6\n\nC. 1\n\nD. 14/6\n\nIt seems like \\( \\frac{14}{6} \\) is one of the options, which is D.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nFirst, confirm the cost function formula: \\( J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{i}) - y^{i})^2 \\ )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, \\( h_\\theta(x^{i}) = 0 \\) for all \\( i \\), since \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\).\n\nThe target values \\( y^{i} \\) are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, the differences are indeed 1, 2, and 3, and their squares are 1, 4, and 9.\n\nSum is 14.\n\nDivide by \\( 2m = 6 \\), get \\( \\frac{14}{6} \\).\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 14/6.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. The question says \"What is \\( J(0) \\)?\", and option D is 14/6, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if the cost function is being minimized or something, but no, it's just asking for the value of \\( J(0) \\).\n\nI don't think there's any mistake in my calculation, so I'll go with D. 14/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
