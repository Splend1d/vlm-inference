Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the process that happens when a client clicks on a link to get a web page, and the IP address isn't cached locally, so a DNS lookup is required. The problem says that four DNS servers are visited in total, with the first being the local DNS cache. The round-trip times (RTTs) for each of these servers are given:\n\n- Local DNS cache: RTT0 = 4 msecs\n\n- Second DNS server: RTT1 = 14 msecs\n\n- Third DNS server: RTT2 = 9 msecs\n\n- Fourth DNS server: RTT3 = 34 msecs\n\nAnd the RTT between the client and the HTTP server is RTTHTTP = 95 msecs.\n\nI need to find out the total time from the client clicking the link to receiving the object, assuming zero transmission time for the HTML object.\n\nOkay, so let's think about the sequence of events.\n\n1. The client makes a DNS request to resolve the URL.\n\n2. This request goes to the local DNS cache first. If the IP address isn't cached there, it forwards the request to another DNS server.\n\n3. Each DNS server that is queried will have its own RTT, and likely, the request will be forwarded from one server to another until the IP address is found.\n\n4. Once the IP address is obtained, the client can make an HTTP request to the web server to retrieve the object.\n\n5. The time for the HTTP request to go and come back is the RTTHTTP.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the total time for the DNS lookup plus the time for the HTTP request.\n\nFirst, let's consider the DNS lookup process.\n\nThe local DNS cache is queried first, with an RTT of 4 msecs. Since it doesn't have the IP address, it forwards the request to another DNS server. The problem mentions that four DNS servers are visited in total, including the local cache. So, the local cache is the first, and then three more servers are queried.\n\nEach of these servers has their own RTTs:\n\n- Second server: RTT1 = 14 msecs\n\n- Third server: RTT2 = 9 msecs\n\n- Fourth server: RTT3 = 34 msecs\n\nI think each of these RTTs represents the time for the request to go to that server and come back with a response.\n\nSo, the total time for the DNS lookup would be the sum of all these RTTs.\n\nTotal DNS time = RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nTotal DNS time = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 = 61 msecs\n\nThen, once the IP address is obtained, the client makes an HTTP request to the server, which has an RTT of 95 msecs.\n\nSo, the total time from clicking the link to receiving the object would be:\n\nTotal time = Total DNS time + RTTHTTP\n\nTotal time = 61 + 95 = 156 msecs\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Does the DNS lookup happen sequentially, meaning each RTT is added up one after another?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWhen the client makes a DNS request, it goes to the local cache first. If the local cache doesn't have the IP address, it forwards the request to another DNS server. This process may involve multiple forwards until the IP address is found.\n\nHowever, in terms of timing, each of these forwards adds to the total time.\n\nBut, do we need to consider that each server might have its own processing time, or is the RTT inclusive of processing time?\n\nThe problem seems to suggest that RTT is just the round-trip time for the request and response, so probably includes processing time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each server's RTT is independent, and we just add them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RTT between servers is different from the RTT from the client to the server.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram, it shows the client connecting to the local DNS cache with RTT0, and then the local DNS cache connecting to other DNS servers with their respective RTTs.\n\nSo, the client waits for the local DNS cache to respond, which includes the time for the local DNS cache to get the IP address from other servers.\n\nTherefore, the total DNS time for the client is the sum of all the RTTs from the local DNS cache to each DNS server it queries, plus the time for the local DNS cache to process the request and response.\n\nBut in the problem, only the RTTs are given, assuming zero transmission time for the HTML object.\n\nSo, perhaps the total DNS time is indeed the sum of RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3.\n\nThen, adding RTTHTTP for the HTTP request.\n\nSo, total time = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nBut, I'm a bit unsure because I think that in reality, the DNS lookup might not involve adding up all these RTTs linearly.\n\nMaybe some of these RTTs are overlapping in time.\n\nFor example, when the local DNS cache forwards the request to another server, it waits for a response, but perhaps it can time out and try another server.\n\nBut, for simplicity, maybe we can assume that each RTT is sequential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the RTTs from the local DNS cache to each server are added, and then the RTTHTTP is added separately.\n\nWait, let's look back at the diagram.\n\nThere is a client, connected to a local DNS cache with RTT0.\n\nThe local DNS cache connects to three DNS servers with RTT1, RTT2, RTT3, and to an HTTP server with RTTHTTP.\n\nWait, actually, in the diagram, the local DNS cache is connected to three DNS servers and one HTTP server.\n\nBut in the problem description, it says that four DNS servers are visited before the host receives the IP address.\n\nSo, perhaps the local DNS cache is querying three other DNS servers, and then getting the IP address from the fourth server.\n\nBut the HTTP server is separate.\n\nWait, but in the diagram, there is one HTTP server connected to the local DNS cache.\n\nBut in the problem, it says the Web server is connected with RTTHTTP = 95 msecs.\n\nSo, perhaps the local DNS cache has a connection to the HTTP server with RTTHTTP.\n\nBut, in reality, the client would make the HTTP request directly to the server, not through the local DNS cache.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nWhen the client needs to resolve a URL, it queries the local DNS cache.\n\nIf the local DNS cache doesn't have the IP address, it forwards the request to another DNS server.\n\nThis process may involve multiple DNS servers until the IP address is found.\n\nOnce the IP address is found, the local DNS cache responds to the client with the IP address.\n\nThen, the client makes an HTTP request directly to the web server at that IP address.\n\nSo, in this case, the total time would be:\n\n- Time for the DNS lookup: sum of RTTs from client to local DNS cache and from local DNS cache to each DNS server queried until the IP is found.\n\n- Plus the time for the HTTP request: RTTHTTP.\n\nGiven that, and assuming that the DNS lookup steps are sequential, then total DNS time is RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nBut, I'm still unsure because in reality, DNS lookups can be parallelized to some extent, or servers can time out and try other servers.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can assume a simple sequential model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the RTTs from the local DNS cache to the DNS servers are added, and RTT0 is the client to local DNS cache RTT.\n\nWait, but RTT0 is defined as the RTT between the client and the local DNS cache.\n\nSo, when the client makes a DNS request, it goes to the local DNS cache, which then forwards the request to other DNS servers.\n\nSo, the client waits for the local DNS cache to respond, which includes the time for the local DNS cache to query other DNS servers.\n\nTherefore, the total DNS time seen by the client is RTT0 plus the time the local DNS cache takes to get the IP address from other servers.\n\nBut in the diagram, the local DNS cache is connected to three DNS servers and one HTTP server.\n\nWait, but the HTTP server is separate; the client connects directly to the HTTP server after getting the IP address from DNS.\n\nSo, perhaps the total time is:\n\n- Time for DNS lookup: RTT0 (client to local DNS cache) + time for local DNS cache to get IP address from other servers.\n\n- Plus time for HTTP request: RTTHTTP.\n\nNow, the time for the local DNS cache to get the IP address from other servers would be the sum of the RTTs from local DNS cache to each DNS server queried.\n\nGiven that four DNS servers are visited, including the local cache, and the RTTs are RTT0, RTT1, RTT2, RTT3.\n\nBut RTT0 is client to local DNS cache, and RTT1, RTT2, RTT3 are local DNS cache to each DNS server.\n\nSo, total DNS time for local DNS cache to resolve the IP address is RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 = 14 + 9 + 34 = 57 msecs.\n\nThen, total DNS time seen by the client is RTT0 + total DNS time for local DNS cache = 4 + 57 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nWait, but I think I'm double-counting RTT0.\n\nRTT0 is client to local DNS cache, which includes the time for the DNS request to go to the local DNS cache and back.\n\nThen, the local DNS cache takes time to query other DNS servers, which is RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3.\n\nSo, total DNS time seen by the client is RTT0 plus the time the local DNS cache takes to resolve the IP address, which is RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3.\n\nTherefore, total DNS time is RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nBut, I'm still a bit unsure because in reality, DNS lookups can be more complex, with caching and recursive queries.\n\nMaybe I should look up how DNS resolution times are calculated.\n\nIn reality, DNS resolution time can vary based on several factors, including the number of recursive queries, the responsiveness of the DNS servers, and network conditions.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume a simple model where each query is sequential, and the RTTs add up linearly.\n\nGiven that, total DNS time is RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or parallelization that could reduce the total time.\n\nFor example, if the local DNS cache can query multiple DNS servers in parallel, then the time taken would be less than the sum of all RTTs.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to suggest that the DNS servers are visited sequentially, as four DNS servers are visited before the IP address is obtained.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the total DNS time is indeed the sum of all RTTs.\n\nTherefore, total time is 156 msecs.\n\nBut, I'm still not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the RTTs from the local DNS cache to the DNS servers are added, and RTT0 is separate.\n\nIn that case, total DNS time would be RTT0 + (RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3) = 4 + (14 + 9 + 34) = 4 + 57 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the last DNS server's RTT is added to RTT0.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because all DNS servers need to be queried.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the local DNS cache making recursive queries to other DNS servers, and each query has its own RTT.\n\nTherefore, the total time for the local DNS cache to resolve the IP address is the sum of the RTTs for each query.\n\nThen, the client waits for the local DNS cache to respond, which includes RTT0 plus the time the local DNS cache took to resolve the IP address.\n\nTherefore, total DNS time is RTT0 + RTT1 + RTT2 + RTT3 = 4 + 14 + 9 + 34 = 61 msecs.\n\nThen, total time is 61 + 95 = 156 msecs.\n\nI think that's the most straightforward way to interpret it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 156 msecs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]"
