I need to figure out what the values of X and Y will be if these transactions are executed serially, with T1 running before T2. The options are:\n\nA. X=20, Y=30\n\nB. X=50, Y=80\n\nC. X=70, Y=50\n\nD. None of the other answers\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each transaction does.\n\nLooking at T1:\n\n1. read_lock(Y);\n\n2. read_item(Y);\n\n3. unlock(Y);\n\n4. write_lock(X);\n\n5. read_item(X);\n\n6. X := X + Y;\n\n7. write_item(X);\n\n8. unlock(X);\n\nAnd T2:\n\n1. read_lock(X);\n\n2. read_item(X);\n\n3. unlock(X);\n\n4. write_lock(Y);\n\n5. read_item(Y);\n\n6. Y := X + Y;\n\n7. write_item(Y);\n\n8. unlock(Y);\n\nOkay, so both transactions are using read and write locks, which are likely to manage access to the variables to prevent data inconsistencies.\n\nSince they're executing serially, with T1 first, I should simulate the operations step by step.\n\nStarting with T1:\n\n- It starts by reading Y, so it locks Y for reading.\n\n- Then it reads the value of Y (which is 30).\n\n- Unlocks Y.\n\n- Then it locks X for writing.\n\n- Reads the current value of X (20).\n\n- Computes X = X + Y (20 + 30 = 50).\n\n- Writes the new value of X (50).\n\n- Unlocks X.\n\nSo after T1, X is 50, and Y remains 30.\n\nNow, T2 starts:\n\n- It locks X for reading.\n\n- Reads the value of X (50).\n\n- Unlocks X.\n\n- Then it locks Y for writing.\n\n- Reads the current value of Y (30).\n\n- Computes Y = X + Y (50 + 30 = 80).\n\n- Writes the new value of Y (80).\n\n- Unlocks Y.\n\nSo after T2, Y is 80, and X remains 50.\n\nTherefore, the final values should be X=50 and Y=80.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. X=20, Y=30\n\nB. X=50, Y=80\n\nC. X=70, Y=50\n\nD. None of the other answers\n\nSo option B seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIn T1, it reads Y, then writes X. In T2, it reads X, then writes Y. Since T1 is before T2, T2 sees the updated X from T1 and uses it to update Y.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be B. X=50, Y=80.\n\nI think that's it. Seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
