                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have Verbrugge Publishing Company's balance sheet and income statement from 2010, and they're planning a voluntary reorganization. There are some changes to the preferred stock and some debt being retired with cash. I need to figure out what the income available to common stockholders will be after this recapitalization.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's happening with the preferred stocks. There are two types of preferred stock currently:\n\n1. $6 preferred stock with a par value of $112.50 per share, and there are 1,200,000 shares outstanding.\n\n2. $10.50 preferred stock with no par value, callable at $150 per share, and there are 60,000 shares outstanding.\n\nIn the reorganization plan:\n\n- Each share of the $6 preferred will be exchanged for one share of $2.40 preferred with a par value of $37.50 plus one 8% subordinated income debenture with a par value of $75.\n\n- The $10.50 preferred issue will be retired with cash.\n\nOkay, so the $10.50 preferred stock is being retired with cash, which means that the dividends from this preferred stock will no longer be paid after the recapitalization.\n\nThe $6 preferred stock is being exchanged for a new type of preferred stock and some debentures. So, the dividends on the $6 preferred will stop, and new dividends will start on the new preferred stock.\n\nI need to calculate the new dividends that will be paid after the recapitalization and then adjust the income available to common stockholders accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current dividends paid on the preferred stocks:\n\n1. Dividends on $6 preferred: $7.2 million\n\n2. Dividends on $10.50 preferred: $0.6 million\n\nTotal current preferred dividends: $7.2 + $0.6 = $7.8 million\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\n- The $10.50 preferred is being retired, so no more dividends on that.\n\n- The $6 preferred is being exchanged for $2.40 preferred and some debentures.\n\nWait, the exchange is for one share of $2.40 preferred with a par value of $37.50 plus one 8% subordinated income debenture with a par value of $75.\n\nSo, for each share of $6 preferred, which there are 1,200,000 shares, they get one share of $2.40 preferred and one debenture of $75 par value paying 8% interest.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the new preferred dividends.\n\nThe new preferred stock pays $2.40 per share in dividends. There are 1,200,000 shares being exchanged, so the new preferred dividends will be:\n\n1,200,000 shares * $2.40 = $2,880,000 or $2.88 million\n\nAdditionally, the debentures issued pay 8% on a $75 par value. So, the interest payment per debenture is:\n\n$75 * 8% = $6 per debenture\n\nSince each preferred share is exchanged for one debenture, there are 1,200,000 debentures issued.\n\nTotal interest payment on debentures: 1,200,000 * $6 = $7,200,000 or $7.2 million\n\nWait a minute, but the debentures are called \"subordinated income debentures.\" I need to confirm what that means. Subordinated debentures are typically debt that ranks after other debts in terms of priority for payments. But \"income debentures\" might mean that the interest payment is dependent on the company's income.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, I'll assume that the interest is fixed at 8% of the par value, regardless of the company's income, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, after recapitalization, the preferred dividends are $2.88 million (from the new preferred stock), and there's interest expense of $7.2 million from the debentures.\n\nBut wait, the debentures are subordinated income debentures. Maybe the interest is treated differently for tax purposes or in terms of payment priority, but for now, I'll consider it as additional interest expense.\n\nNow, the income available to common stockholders is the net income minus the preferred dividends and plus any adjustments related to the debentures.\n\nIn the original income statement, the net income is $13.5 million, and after subtracting preferred dividends ($7.2 + $0.6 = $7.8 million), the income available to common stockholders is $5.7 million.\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\n- No dividends on the $10.50 preferred ($0.6 million saved)\n\n- New preferred dividends on the $2.40 preferred: $2.88 million\n\n- Interest on debentures: $7.2 million\n\nSo, the new net income before adjusting for the debentures would be:\n\nOriginal net income: $13.5 million\n\nAdd back: interest expense on debentures (since it's an expense reducing net income)\n\nBut wait, in the original income statement, there's EBT (Earnings Before Taxes) of $27.0 million, and taxes are $13.5 million (50% tax rate), resulting in net income of $13.5 million.\n\nIf we introduce new interest expense, we need to adjust EBT accordingly.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nIn the original income statement:\n\nEBT = $27.0 million\n\nTaxes (50%) = $13.5 million\n\nNet income = $13.5 million\n\nNow, with the new debentures, there's additional interest expense of $7.2 million.\n\nSo, new EBT = original EBT - interest on debentures = $27.0 - $7.2 = $19.8 million\n\nNew taxes = 50% of $19.8 million = $9.9 million\n\nNew net income = $19.8 - $9.9 = $9.9 million\n\nThen, subtract the new preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nIncome available to common stockholders = $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million\n\nRounding to the nearest million, that's $7 million.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other adjustment needed.\n\nWait, the $7.2 million interest expense is already reducing EBT, and taxes are based on EBT. So, the net income is adjusted for the interest expense through taxes.\n\nThen, preferred dividends are subtracted from net income to get income available to common stockholders.\n\nSo, yes, $9.9 million net income minus $2.88 million preferred dividends equals $7.02 million, which rounds to $7 million.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $7 million.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the debentures are considered as part of the capital structure, and their interest might be treated differently, but given the information, it seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way:\n\nCalculate the income available to common stockholders after the recapitalization:\n\nNet income after considering the new interest expense and new preferred dividends.\n\nOriginal net income: $13.5 million\n\nLess: original preferred dividends: $7.8 million\n\n= $5.7 million to common\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\nNet income: $13.5 million (from original) plus the savings from retiring the $10.50 preferred dividends ($0.6 million) minus the new preferred dividends ($2.88 million) minus the interest on debentures ($7.2 million)\n\nWait, but that seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the new net income considering the changes in expenses.\n\nOriginal EBT: $27.0 million\n\nAdd: other income: $3.0 million\n\nLess: operating expenses: $516.0 million\n\nNet sales: $540.0 million\n\nWait, no. The income statement shows:\n\nNet sales: $540.0 million\n\nOperating expense: $516.0 million\n\nNet operating income: $24.0 million\n\nOther income: $3.0 million\n\nEBT: $27.0 million\n\nTaxes (50%): $13.5 million\n\nNet income: $13.5 million\n\nDividends on preferred stocks: $7.2 + $0.6 = $7.8 million\n\nIncome to common: $13.5 - $7.8 = $5.7 million\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\nRetire $10.50 preferred: no more $0.6 million dividends\n\nExchange $6 preferred for $2.40 preferred and debentures paying 8% on $75 par value.\n\nSo, new preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nNew interest expense: $7.2 million\n\nThus, new net income calculation:\n\nOriginal net income: $13.5 million\n\nAdjust for new interest expense:\n\nOriginal EBT: $27.0 million\n\nLess new interest expense: $7.2 million\n\nNew EBT: $19.8 million\n\nLess taxes (50%): $9.9 million\n\nNew net income: $9.9 million\n\nLess new preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nIncome to common: $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million \u2248 $7 million\n\nYes, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $7 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ \\$7 \\text{ million}} \\]"
