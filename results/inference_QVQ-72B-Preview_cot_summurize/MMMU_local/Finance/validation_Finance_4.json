                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about McDougal Printing, Inc., for the year ended December 31, 2015. They had sales totaling $40,000,000, and there's a list of ratios provided. I need to use this information to find the operating profits. The options are A. $14,000,000, B. $8,000,000, C. $32,000,000, and D. $18,000,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what operating profits are. Operating profits are also known as operating income or profit before interest and taxes. It's the revenue minus the cost of goods sold and operating expenses, but before interest and taxes.\n\nLooking at the ratios provided, there's the operating profit margin, which is given as 35%. The operating profit margin is calculated as operating profits divided by sales.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nOperating Profit Margin = Operating Profits / Sales\n\nI know the sales are $40,000,000, and the operating profit margin is 35%, so I can plug in the values and solve for the operating profits.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n35% = Operating Profits / $40,000,000\n\nTo find the operating profits, I can multiply both sides by $40,000,000.\n\nOperating Profits = 35% * $40,000,000\n\nWait, but 35% is the same as 0.35 in decimal form.\n\nSo, Operating Profits = 0.35 * $40,000,000\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 0.35 * 40,000,000.\n\nWell, 0.35 * 40,000,000 = 14,000,000\n\nSo, that would be $14,000,000.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. $14,000,000 matches this calculation.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check if there's any other way to interpret the question or if there's another ratio that might affect this calculation.\n\nFor example, the gross profit margin is given as 80%, but that's before operating expenses, so it shouldn't directly affect the operating profit margin.\n\nNet profit margin is 8%, which is after all expenses including taxes and interest, so that shouldn't affect the operating profit margin directly.\n\nReturn on total assets is 16%, and return on common equity is 20%, but those are related to profitability in relation to assets or equity, not directly to operating profits.\n\nTotal asset turnover is 2, which relates to how efficiently assets are used to generate sales, but again, not directly related to operating profits.\n\nAverage collection period is 62.2 days, which is about how long it takes to collect money from sales, but that's more about liquidity and doesn't directly affect the operating profits.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems straightforward that the operating profits are $14,000,000.\n\nBut let me think about it differently, maybe using the DuPont analysis, which breaks down return on equity into various components.\n\nThe DuPont identity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Profit Margin * Total Asset Turnover * Equity Multiplier\n\nBut in this case, I don't have all the parts needed for that right now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the income statement structure.\n\nStarting with sales, then subtract cost of goods sold to get gross profit, then subtract operating expenses to get operating profit, then subtract interest and taxes to get net profit.\n\nGiven that gross profit margin is 80%, so gross profit is 80% of sales, which is 0.80 * $40,000,000 = $32,000,000.\n\nOperating profit is $14,000,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, operating expenses would be gross profit minus operating profit: $32,000,000 - $14,000,000 = $18,000,000.\n\nNet profit margin is 8%, so net profit is 8% of sales, which is 0.08 * $40,000,000 = $3,200,000.\n\nBut without knowing interest and taxes, it's harder to relate net profit directly to operating profit.\n\nStill, the direct calculation using the operating profit margin seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the return on assets.\n\nReturn on total assets is 16%, and total asset turnover is 2.\n\nReturn on assets = Net Income / Total Assets\n\nAnd Total Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets\n\nSo, if Return on Assets = 16%, and Total Asset Turnover = 2, then Net Income / Total Assets = 16%, and Sales / Total Assets = 2.\n\nFrom Sales / Total Assets = 2, Total Assets = Sales / 2 = $40,000,000 / 2 = $20,000,000.\n\nThen, Net Income = Return on Assets * Total Assets = 16% * $20,000,000 = $3,200,000, which matches the net profit margin calculation.\n\nNow, to find operating profits using this, perhaps I can use the profit margin relationships.\n\nBut I think I'm complicating things.\n\nGiven that the operating profit margin is 35% and sales are $40,000,000, the direct calculation of 35% of $40,000,000 is $14,000,000.\n\nUnless there's some adjustment needed, but based on the information provided, $14,000,000 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $14,000,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 14,000,000} \\]"
