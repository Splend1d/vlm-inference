                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got this table that shows the average annual rate of inflation expected over different periods:\n\n- 3 months: 5%\n\n- 2 years: 6%\n\n- 5 years: 8%\n\n- 10 years: 8.5%\n\n- 20 years: 9%\n\nAnd the problem says to assume that there's no maturity risk, meaning that the only factor affecting the nominal interest rate is the expected inflation rate. The real rate of interest is given as 2.5%. I need to find the nominal rate of interest for a 5-year U.S. Treasury bond.\n\nFirst, I recall that the nominal interest rate is composed of the real interest rate plus the expected inflation rate. There's a formula for this, which is:\n\n\\[ i = r + \\pi \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( i \\) is the nominal interest rate\n\n- \\( r \\) is the real interest rate\n\n- \\( \\pi \\) is the expected inflation rate\n\nGiven that, I have \\( r = 2.5\\% \\), and I need to find \\( \\pi \\) for the 5-year period, which is given in the table as 8%.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ i = 2.5\\% + 8\\% = 10.5\\% \\]\n\nLooking at the options, 10.5% is one of the choices, which is option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, is it really that straightforward? The problem mentions that there's no maturity risk, so I don't have to account for any additional risk premiums based on the bond's duration. Also, since it's a U.S. Treasury bond, I can assume it's risk-free in terms of default.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other factor I should consider. The problem refers to \"average annual rate of inflation\" over different periods, and for 5 years, it's 8%. It seems directly applicable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this inflation expectation is compounded annually or if it's a simple average. The table says \"average annual rate of inflation,\" so I think it's already providing the average rate, and I don't need to calculate further.\n\nPerhaps to be thorough, I should verify if the inflation rate is meant to be compounded over the period. For example, if inflation is compounding annually, the future purchasing power would be affected accordingly, but since we're dealing with average annual rates, I think the given rates already account for compounding.\n\nAlternatively, if the inflation is expected to be constant over the period, then the average annual rate would directly give me the expected inflation rate per year.\n\nWait, but the inflation rates given are averages over the periods, and they differ for different periods. For instance, 3 months have 5%, but 2 years have 6%, and so on. So, it seems that the inflation expectations are not constant across different time horizons.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem specifies to assume zero maturity risk, I think the simplest approach is to take the 5-year inflation rate as the expected inflation rate per year over that period, which is 8%.\n\nTherefore, the nominal interest rate for the 5-year bond would be:\n\n\\[ i = r + \\pi = 2.5\\% + 8\\% = 10.5\\% \\]\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 10.5%.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other concept that might affect this calculation. For example, if there were maturity risk, I would need to add a risk premium based on the bond's maturity. But the problem specifically states to assume zero maturity risk, so that's not an issue here.\n\nAlso, if the inflation rates were not constant within the periods, I might need to calculate a weighted average or consider the compounding effect, but again, the problem provides average annual rates directly.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the nominal interest rate for the 5-year U.S. Treasury bond is 10.5%, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
