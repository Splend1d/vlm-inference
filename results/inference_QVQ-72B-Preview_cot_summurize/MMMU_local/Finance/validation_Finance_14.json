                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I have to calculate the Economic Value Added (EVA) for Walmart at the end of fiscal 2017. From the data provided, there's a balance sheet and an income statement for fiscal 2017 and 2016, and some additional information like the number of shares outstanding, share price, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and the marginal corporate tax rate. Okay, let's gather what I need for the EVA calculation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what EVA is. EVA is a measure of a company's financial performance based on residual earnings concept. It's essentially the net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) minus the cost of capital multiplied by the capital employed. So, EVA = NOPAT - (WACC * Capital Employed).\n\nAlright, I need to find NOPAT and Capital Employed.\n\nStarting with NOPAT: Net Operating Profit After Tax.\n\nFrom the income statement, I have Net Income, which is $13,659 for fiscal 2017. But Net Income includes interest expense and tax, so it's not directly NOPAT.\n\nNOPAT is typically EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) adjusted for taxes.\n\nGiven that EBIT is provided: $20,437 for fiscal 2017.\n\nSo, NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - tax rate).\n\nThe marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, so NOPAT = 20,437 * (1 - 0.35) = 20,437 * 0.65.\n\nLet me calculate that: 20,437 multiplied by 0.65.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 0.65 = 13,000\n\nThen, 437 * 0.65 = let's see, 400 * 0.65 = 260, and 37 * 0.65 = roughly 24.05.\n\nSo, total NOPAT \u2248 13,000 + 260 + 24.05 = 13,284.05.\n\nAlright, so NOPAT is approximately $13,284.\n\nNext, Capital Employed.\n\nCapital Employed is generally Total Assets minus Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Assets for fiscal 2017 are $204,522.\n\nNow, Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities are typically current liabilities that don't bear interest, like Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\nAccounts Payable: $46,092\n\nOther Current Liabilities: $32,429\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $78,521\n\nLong-term Debt: $36,825\n\nOther Long-term Liabilities: $11,307\n\nTotal Liabilities: $126,653\n\nShareholders' Equity: $77,869\n\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity: $204,522\n\nSo, Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities would be Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities: 46,092 + 32,429 = 78,521.\n\nLong-term Debt and Other Long-term Liabilities might bear interest, so they're not included in Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities.\n\nTherefore, Capital Employed = Total Assets - Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities = 204,522 - 78,521 = 126,001.\n\nWait a minute, that seems off because Total Liabilities are $126,653, which includes Long-term Debt and Other Long-term Liabilities.\n\nMaybe another way to look at it: Capital Employed can also be calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest Bearing Current Liabilities.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with what I did.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Capital Employed is defined as Shareholders' Equity plus Interest Bearing Debt.\n\nShareholders' Equity: $77,869\n\nInterest Bearing Debt: Long-term Debt + Other Long-term Liabilities = 36,825 + 11,307 = 48,132.\n\nSo, Capital Employed = 77,869 + 48,132 = 126,001.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, Capital Employed is $126,001.\n\nNow, WACC is given as 5%.\n\nSo, EVA = NOPAT - (WACC * Capital Employed) = 13,284 - (0.05 * 126,001).\n\nFirst, calculate 0.05 * 126,001 = 6,300.05.\n\nThen, 13,284 - 6,300.05 = 6,983.95.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them are close to 6,983.95.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating NOPAT.\n\nLet me double-check NOPAT calculation.\n\nNOPAT = EBIT * (1 - tax rate)\n\nEBIT is $20,437\n\nTax rate is 35%, so 0.35\n\nNOPAT = 20,437 * 0.65\n\nLet me calculate that again.\n\n20,000 * 0.65 = 13,000\n\n437 * 0.65:\n\n400 * 0.65 = 260\n\n37 * 0.65 = 24.05\n\nSo, 13,000 + 260 + 24.05 = 13,284.05\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, Capital Employed is $126,001\n\nWACC is 5%, so 0.05 * 126,001 = 6,300.05\n\nThen, 13,284 - 6,300.05 = 6,983.95\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider Net Income instead of EBIT.\n\nWait, no, EVA is based on NOPAT, which is EBIT adjusted for taxes.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes EVA is calculated using Net Income adjusted for non-recurring items and normalized for taxes.\n\nBut in standard terms, NOPAT is EBIT * (1 - tax rate), which is what I used.\n\nPerhaps I need to use Net Income and adjust it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Capital Employed calculation is different.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nAnother formula for EVA is:\n\nEVA = Net Income - (WACC * Capital Invested)\n\nBut this might not be precise, as EVA is typically based on NOPAT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use Net Income and adjust it for the tax effect.\n\nWait, maybe I should use Net Income and add back tax-adjusted interest expense.\n\nBut this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look up the exact formula for EVA.\n\nUpon checking, EVA is indeed calculated as NOPAT minus (WACC * Capital Employed).\n\nNOPAT is EBIT adjusted for taxes, which is EBIT * (1 - tax rate).\n\nSo, my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Capital Employed is miscalculated.\n\nLet me recalculate Capital Employed.\n\nCapital Employed can be calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities.\n\nNon-Interest Bearing Liabilities are Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities: $78,521\n\nTotal Assets: $204,522\n\nCapital Employed = 204,522 - 78,521 = 126,001\n\nAlternatively, as Shareholders' Equity plus Interest Bearing Debt.\n\nShareholders' Equity: $77,869\n\nInterest Bearing Debt: Long-term Debt + Other Long-term Liabilities = 36,825 + 11,307 = 48,132\n\nTotal: 77,869 + 48,132 = 126,001\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Capital Employed should be calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider only Long-term Debt as Interest Bearing Debt, and Other Long-term Liabilities are not.\n\nLooking back, Other Long-term Liabilities might not be interest-bearing.\n\nBut typically, Long-term Debt is interest-bearing, and Other Long-term Liabilities may or may not be.\n\nAssuming Other Long-term Liabilities are not interest-bearing, then Interest Bearing Debt would be only Long-term Debt: $36,825\n\nThen, Capital Employed = Shareholders' Equity + Interest Bearing Debt = 77,869 + 36,825 = 114,694\n\nAlternatively, Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities would be Total Current Liabilities: $78,521 plus Other Long-term Liabilities: $11,307, totaling $89,828\n\nThen, Capital Employed = Total Assets - Non-Interest Bearing Liabilities = 204,522 - 89,828 = 114,694\n\nOkay, so perhaps Capital Employed is $114,694\n\nThen, EVA = NOPAT - (WACC * Capital Employed) = 13,284 - (0.05 * 114,694) = 13,284 - 5,734.7 = 7,549.3\n\nStill doesn't match any of the options exactly, but closest is $7,340.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider Net Income directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps EVA is calculated using a different approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider Net Income and adjust it for the capital employed.\n\nBut I'm getting confused now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Capital Employed should be based on the market value rather than the book value.\n\nGiven that the share price is provided ($106) and the number of shares outstanding (2,960 million), the market capitalization is 2,960,000,000 * 106 = let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 2,960 * 106:\n\n2,960 * 100 = 296,000\n\n2,960 * 6 = 17,760\n\nTotal: 296,000 + 17,760 = 313,760 million dollars.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 2,960 million shares times $106 each would be $313,760 million, which is $313.76 billion.\n\nBut that seems too high for Walmart, but perhaps it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shares are in thousands or another unit, but assuming they're in numbers, let's proceed.\n\nSo, Market Capitalization = $313,760 million\n\nThen, Total Capital Employed = Market Capitalization + Debt\n\nDebt is Long-term Debt + Other Long-term Liabilities = 36,825 + 11,307 = 48,132\n\nSo, Total Capital Employed = 313,760 + 48,132 = 361,892\n\nThen, EVA = NOPAT - (WACC * Capital Employed) = 13,284 - (0.05 * 361,892) = 13,284 - 18,094.6 = -4,810.6\n\nNegative EVA, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nClearly, this approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps using book value for Capital Employed is more appropriate for EVA calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe EVA is calculated based on shareholders' equity plus net debt.\n\nShareholders' Equity: $77,869\n\nNet Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Marketable Securities\n\nFrom Balance Sheet:\n\nTotal Debt = Long-term Debt + Other Long-term Liabilities = 36,825 + 11,307 = 48,132\n\nCash and Marketable Securities: 6,756\n\nNet Debt = 48,132 - 6,756 = 41,376\n\nThen, Capital Employed = Shareholders' Equity + Net Debt = 77,869 + 41,376 = 119,245\n\nThen, EVA = NOPAT - (WACC * Capital Employed) = 13,284 - (0.05 * 119,245) = 13,284 - 5,962.25 = 7,321.75\n\nThat's approximately $7,340, which matches option B.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $7,340\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
