                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about investments, and I need to calculate the rate of return for Investment B. Let me see what information I have.\n\nClare has $5,000 to invest, and there are four different investments listed: A, B, C, and D. Each requires an initial $5,000 payment. The table shows the single amount each investment will pay out at the end of its life and how many years each investment lasts.\n\nSpecifically, for Investment B, it shows a single amount of $15,900 after 15 years. So, she invests $5,000 today, and in 15 years, she gets $15,900.\n\nI need to find the rate of return on this investment, and the answer should be to the nearest 1%. The options provided are 11%, 8%, 10%, and 9%.\n\nAlright, to find the rate of return, I think I should use the concept of present value or future value in financial mathematics. Specifically, I need to find the interest rate that makes the present value of the future cash flow equal to the initial investment.\n\nSo, the formula for the future value of a single amount is:\n\n\\[ FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( FV \\) is the future value ($15,900 in this case)\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value ($5,000)\n\n- \\( r \\) is the interest rate per period\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods (15 years)\n\nI need to solve for \\( r \\) in this equation:\n\n\\[ 15,900 = 5,000 \\times (1 + r)^{15} \\]\n\nAlright, let's rearrange this equation to solve for \\( r \\):\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 5,000:\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = \\frac{15,900}{5,000} = 3.18 \\]\n\nNow, take the 15th root of both sides to solve for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 3.18^{ \\frac{1}{15} } \\]\n\nI can calculate the 15th root of 3.18 using a calculator. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, find \\( 3.18^{0.0666...} \\) because \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) is approximately 0.0666.\n\nWait, actually, it's better to use the exponentiation function on the calculator.\n\nSo, \\( (1 + r) = 3.18^{(1/15)} \\)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate 1/15, which is approximately 0.0666666667\n\nThen, 3.18 raised to the power of 0.0666666667\n\nUsing a calculator, I find that 3.18^(1/15) \u2248 1.0472\n\nSo, \\( 1 + r \u2248 1.0472 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( r \u2248 0.0472 \\), or 4.72%\n\nBut the options are to the nearest 1%, so that would be 5%, but that's not one of the options provided. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \\( 3.18^{(1/15)} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the natural logarithm to solve for \\( r \\) more accurately.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = 3.18 \\]\n\nTake natural log on both sides:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times \\ln(1 + r) = \\ln(3.18) \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\ln(1 + r) = \\frac{\\ln(3.18)}{15} \\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\ln(3.18) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(3.18) \u2248 1.1553 \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\ln(1 + r) = \\frac{1.1553}{15} \u2248 0.07702 \\]\n\nNow, take the exponential of both sides to solve for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + r = e^{0.07702} \u2248 1.0799 \\]\n\nSo, \\( r \u2248 0.0799 \\), or 7.99%, which rounds to 8%.\n\nLooking back at the options, 8% is one of them.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I calculated using the root, and I got approximately 4.72%, but using the natural log method, I get about 8%. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = 3.18 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 3.18^{(1/15)} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 3.18^{(1/15)} \\):\n\nUsing a calculator, \\( 3.18^{0.0666666667} \\) is approximately 1.0799, which matches the second calculation.\n\nSo, the correct rate is approximately 7.99%, which rounds to 8%.\n\nI must have made an error in my first calculation using the root method, probably due to incorrect usage of the calculator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 8%.\n\nTo confirm, I can plug the rate back into the original formula to see if it makes sense.\n\n\\[ FV = PV \\times (1 + r)^n \\]\n\n\\[ 15,900 = 5,000 \\times (1.08)^{15} \\]\n\nCalculate \\( 5,000 \\times (1.08)^{15} \\):\n\nFirst, \\( 1.08^{15} \u2248 3.173 \\)\n\nThen, \\( 5,000 \\times 3.173 = 15,865 \\), which is very close to $15,900. The slight difference is due to rounding errors.\n\nTherefore, the rate of return is approximately 8%.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\%} \\]"
