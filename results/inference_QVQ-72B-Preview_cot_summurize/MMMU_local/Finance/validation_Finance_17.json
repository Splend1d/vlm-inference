So, I have this table with different bonds, each having their own par value, coupon interest rate, years to maturity, and required stated annual return. The specific bond I need to focus on is Bond B, and I need to calculate its value, given that all these bonds pay interest semiannually.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each term means:\n\n- **Par value:** This is the face value of the bond, which is the amount the issuer will pay back at maturity.\n\n- **Coupon interest rate:** This is the annual interest rate paid by the bond, usually in regular intervals, like semiannually.\n\n- **Years to maturity:** The number of years until the bond's par value is repaid.\n\n- **Required stated annual return:** This is the annual yield or discount rate that investors expect for bonds with similar risk.\n\nFor Bond B, the details are:\n\n- Par value: $1,000\n\n- Coupon interest rate: 12%\n\n- Years to maturity: 20 years\n\n- Required stated annual return: 12%\n\nSince the bonds pay interest semiannually, I need to adjust all these figures for the semiannual compounding.\n\nHere's the formula to calculate the bond value:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bond value} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Coupon payment}}{\\text{Periodic yield}} \\right) \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\text{Periodic yield})^{n}} \\right) + \\frac{\\text{Par value}}{(1 + \\text{Periodic yield})^{n}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- Coupon payment = Par value \u00d7 (Coupon rate / 2)\n\n- Periodic yield = Required annual return / 2\n\n- n = Number of periods = Years to maturity \u00d7 2\n\nLet me plug in the numbers for Bond B:\n\n1. Calculate the semiannual coupon payment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Coupon payment} = 1000 \\times \\frac{12\\%}{2} = 1000 \\times 6\\% = \\$60 \\]\n\n2. Determine the semiannual required yield:\n\n\\[ \\text{Periodic yield} = \\frac{12\\%}{2} = 6\\% \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of semiannual periods:\n\n\\[ n = 20 \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ periods} \\]\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Bond value} = \\left( \\frac{60}{0.06} \\right) \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + 0.06)^{40}} \\right) + \\frac{1000}{(1 + 0.06)^{40}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the present value of the coupon payments:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60}{0.06} = 1000 \\]\n\nThen, calculate the term \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + 0.06)^{40}} \\):\n\n\\[ (1 + 0.06)^{40} = \\text{let's calculate this.} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.06^{40} = \\text{approximately } 10.46 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{10.46} = 1 - 0.0956 = 0.9044 \\]\n\nSo, the present value of the coupon payments is:\n\n\\[ 1000 \\times 0.9044 = \\$904.40 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the present value of the par value:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{1.06^{40}} = \\frac{1000}{10.46} = \\$95.60 \\]\n\nFinally, add them up to get the bond's value:\n\n\\[ \\$904.40 + \\$95.60 = \\$1000.00 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. The par value is $1000, and the required return equals the coupon rate, so according to bond valuation, when the coupon rate equals the required return, the bond should sell at par. But in this case, the required return is 12% annually, but since it's paid semiannually, the periodic yield is 6%, which matches the semiannual coupon payment of 6%, so yes, the bond should be at par.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nRe-calculating \\( 1.06^{40} \\):\n\nUsing a calculator, \\( 1.06^{40} = 10.462 \\) (approximately)\n\nThen, \\( \\frac{1}{10.462} \\approx 0.09558 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 1 - 0.09558 = 0.90442 \\)\n\nPresent value of coupons: \\( 1000 \\times 0.90442 = \\$904.42 \\)\n\nPresent value of par: \\( \\frac{1000}{10.462} \\approx \\$95.58 \\)\n\nTotal bond value: \\( \\$904.42 + \\$95.58 = \\$1000.00 \\)\n\nOkay, that checks out. So, the bond is valued at its par value of $1000.\n\nBut the question is to calculate the value of bond B, and it's multiple-choice, but since no options are provided, perhaps it's to show the calculation process, which I've done here.\n\nIn summary, for Bond B:\n\n- Par value: $1,000\n\n- Coupon rate: 12% paid semiannually\n\n- Required return: 12% annually (6% semiannually)\n\n- Years to maturity: 20 years (40 periods)\n\nBond value = Present value of coupons + Present value of par = $1,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1000} \\]"
