                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to compute the price-to-earnings ratio for an industry based on some fundamental data. The data includes things like the forecast industry earnings retention rate, return on equity, industry beta, government bond yield, and equity risk premium. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is a common valuation metric used to assess the fairness of a stock's price based on its earnings. The formula for the P/E ratio is P0 divided by E1, where P0 is the current stock price and E1 is the expected earnings per share for the next year.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with an entire industry, and we're given industry-level data, not specific company data. So, I need to find a way to use this industry data to derive the P/E ratio.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Forecast industry earnings retention rate: 40%\n\n- Forecast industry return on equity: 25%\n\n- Industry beta: 1.2\n\n- Government bond yield: 6%\n\n- Equity risk premium: 5%\n\nI think I need to use some form of the dividend discount model or the Gordon growth model to derive the P/E ratio. The Gordon growth model relates the stock price to the expected future dividends, discounted at the required rate of return.\n\nThe formula for the Gordon growth model is:\n\nP0 = D1 / (r - g)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P0 is the current stock price\n\n- D1 is the expected dividend per share one year from now\n\n- r is the required rate of return\n\n- g is the growth rate of dividends\n\nBut here, I don't have direct information about dividends or the growth rate of dividends. However, I do have information about earnings retention and return on equity, which can help me find the growth rate.\n\nI recall that the growth rate (g) can be calculated using the retention rate (b) and the return on equity (ROE):\n\ng = b * ROE\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\ng = 0.40 * 0.25 = 0.10 or 10%\n\nNext, I need to find the required rate of return (r). I can use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) for that.\n\nThe CAPM formula is:\n\nr = r_f + \u03b2 * (r_m - r_f)\n\nWhere:\n\n- r is the required rate of return\n\n- r_f is the risk-free rate (government bond yield)\n\n- \u03b2 is the industry beta\n\n- (r_m - r_f) is the equity risk premium\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nr = 0.06 + 1.2 * 0.05 = 0.06 + 0.06 = 0.12 or 12%\n\nNow that I have both g and r, I can plug them back into the Gordon growth model formula to find P0/E1.\n\nWait a minute, but D1 is expected dividends, and E1 is expected earnings. I need to relate D1 to E1.\n\nI know that dividends are equal to earnings minus retained earnings:\n\nD1 = E1 * (1 - b)\n\nWhere b is the retention rate.\n\nSo, D1 = E1 * (1 - 0.40) = E1 * 0.60\n\nNow, plug D1 into the Gordon growth model:\n\nP0 = D1 / (r - g) = 0.60 * E1 / (0.12 - 0.10) = 0.60 * E1 / 0.02 = 30 * E1\n\nTherefore, P0 = 30 * E1\n\nSo, the P/E ratio (P0 / E1) is 30.\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check the relationships between these variables.\n\nI used the Gordon growth model, which assumes that the stock price is equal to the present value of future dividends. The growth rate is determined by the retention rate and the return on equity, which makes sense.\n\nThe required rate of return is calculated using CAPM, which accounts for the risk-free rate, the market risk premium, and the industry's beta.\n\nBut, I should consider whether there are any limitations or assumptions in this approach.\n\nOne potential issue is that the Gordon growth model assumes a constant growth rate forever, which might not hold for all industries, especially if the industry is mature or facing changing growth prospects.\n\nAlso, the retention rate and ROE are assumed to be constant, which might not be the case in reality.\n\nAdditionally, the equity risk premium is given as 5%, but this is a subjective estimate and can vary over time and across markets.\n\nMoreover, the government bond yield is used as the risk-free rate, but the maturity of the bond matters; longer-term bonds might have different yields.\n\nAnother consideration is that the P/E ratio derived this way is based on expected future earnings, and actual P/E ratios can differ due to market sentiment, investor expectations, and other factors.\n\nHowever, given the information provided, this seems like a reasonable approach to estimate the P/E ratio.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider using the earnings yield approach.\n\nThe earnings yield is the reciprocal of the P/E ratio, so earnings yield = E1 / P0.\n\nI could try to find the earnings yield and then take its reciprocal to get the P/E ratio.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to find the earnings yield directly from the given data.\n\nPerhaps I can relate the required rate of return to the earnings yield.\n\nIn the Gordon growth model, the earnings yield can be expressed as:\n\nEarnings yield = r - g + (D1 / P0 - g)\n\nBut this seems circular because D1 is already related to E1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that in the context of the dividend discount model, the stock price is equal to the present value of future dividends, and earnings are related to dividends through the retention rate.\n\nI think my initial approach is valid.\n\nLet me check the units to make sure I'm not making a mistake there.\n\nGiven that P0 is in dollars per share and E1 is in dollars per share, the P/E ratio should be dimensionless, which it is in my calculation.\n\nAlso, ensuring that all percentages are converted to decimal form, which I have done.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the growth rate is sustainable.\n\nGiven that the industry is mature, a 10% growth rate might be high, but it's possible if the retention rate and ROE support it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a lower growth rate or adjust the retention rate accordingly.\n\nBut since the problem provides the retention rate and ROE, I should use them as given.\n\nUnless there's additional information that suggests otherwise, which isn't provided here.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation, the P/E ratio is 30.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some models, especially for mature companies, the P/E ratio might be lower because growth is expected to be slower.\n\nHowever, according to this calculation, it's 30, which might be considered high for a mature industry.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the growth rate is equal to the retention rate times ROE.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nIn the dividend growth model, the growth rate g is indeed equal to the retention rate b multiplied by the return on equity ROE, assuming that the company reinvests its earnings back into the business at its ROE.\n\nSo, g = b * ROE = 0.40 * 0.25 = 0.10 or 10%.\n\nThen, the required rate of return r is calculated using CAPM: r = r_f + \u03b2 * (r_m - r_f) = 0.06 + 1.2 * 0.05 = 0.12 or 12%.\n\nPlugging into the Gordon growth model:\n\nP0 = D1 / (r - g) = (0.60 * E1) / (0.12 - 0.10) = (0.60 * E1) / 0.02 = 30 * E1\n\nThus, P0 / E1 = 30\n\nThis seems correct mathematically, but perhaps there's a different perspective or another factor I should consider.\n\nFor example, maybe the retention rate should be adjusted based on the industry's maturity.\n\nIf the industry is mature, it might pay out a higher percentage of earnings as dividends, meaning a lower retention rate.\n\nBut according to the data provided, the retention rate is 40%, which is relatively low, implying a 60% dividend payout ratio.\n\nGiven that, the growth rate would be 10%, as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the return on equity is higher than typical for a mature industry, but again, without more context, it's best to use the provided numbers.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps I should consider the industry's P/E ratio in relation to the market P/E ratio.\n\nBut I don't have information about the market P/E ratio, so that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the price-to-book ratio or other valuation metrics, but the problem specifically asks for the P/E ratio.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe straightforward approach using the Gordon growth model seems appropriate here.\n\nTherefore, the price-to-earnings ratio for the industry is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{30} \\]"
