                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the Adams family has provided a list of their assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015, and I need to prepare a balance sheet for them. Then, using that balance sheet, I have to calculate their net working capital (NWC) for the year. The hint says NWC is the difference between total liquid assets and total current liabilities. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a balance sheet is. A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company's or an individual's assets, liabilities, and net worth at a specific point in time. The basic equation is:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Net Worth\n\nFrom the list provided, I can see various assets and liabilities, and there's also a net worth figure given. But I should make sure that the net worth is calculated correctly based on the assets and liabilities.\n\nLet me list out all the assets and liabilities first:\n\nAssets:\n\n- Cash: $300\n\n- Checking: $3,000\n\n- Savings: $1,200\n\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n\n- 2014 Sebring: $15,000\n\n- 2010 Jeep: $8,000\n\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n\n- Jewelry and artwork: $3,000\n\n- Household furnishings: $4,200\n\n- Retirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n\n- Real estate: $150,000\n\nLiabilities:\n\n- Auto loan: $8,000\n\n- Mortgage: $100,000\n\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nNet Worth: $76,500\n\nOkay, before I proceed, I should verify if the net worth is correctly calculated. Net worth should be equal to total assets minus total liabilities.\n\nFirst, let's sum up the assets:\n\nCash: $300\n\nChecking: $3,000\n\nSavings: $1,200\n\nIBM stock: $2,000\n\n2014 Sebring: $15,000\n\n2010 Jeep: $8,000\n\nMoney market funds: $1,200\n\nJewelry and artwork: $3,000\n\nHousehold furnishings: $4,200\n\nRetirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n\nReal estate: $150,000\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n$300 + $3,000 = $3,300\n\n$3,300 + $1,200 = $4,500\n\n$4,500 + $2,000 = $6,500\n\n$6,500 + $15,000 = $21,500\n\n$21,500 + $8,000 = $29,500\n\n$29,500 + $1,200 = $30,700\n\n$30,700 + $3,000 = $33,700\n\n$33,700 + $4,200 = $37,900\n\n$37,900 + $2,000 = $39,900\n\n$39,900 + $150,000 = $190,000\n\nSo, total assets are $190,000.\n\nNow, let's sum up the liabilities:\n\nAuto loan: $8,000\n\nMortgage: $100,000\n\nMedical bills payable: $250\n\nUtility bills payable: $150\n\nCredit card balance: $2,000\n\nPersonal loan: $3,000\n\nAdding these up:\n\n$8,000 + $100,000 = $108,000\n\n$108,000 + $250 = $108,250\n\n$108,250 + $150 = $108,400\n\n$108,400 + $2,000 = $110,400\n\n$110,400 + $3,000 = $113,400\n\nSo, total liabilities are $113,400.\n\nNow, net worth should be total assets minus total liabilities:\n\n$190,000 - $113,400 = $76,600\n\nWait a minute, the list shows net worth as $76,500, but according to my calculation, it should be $76,600. There's a discrepancy of $100. Maybe there's an error in the provided figures or I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check the asset total:\n\nCash: 300\n\nChecking: 3,000 \u2192 total so far: 3,300\n\nSavings: 1,200 \u2192 total: 4,500\n\nIBM stock: 2,000 \u2192 total: 6,500\n\n2014 Sebring: 15,000 \u2192 total: 21,500\n\n2010 Jeep: 8,000 \u2192 total: 29,500\n\nMoney market funds: 1,200 \u2192 total: 30,700\n\nJewelry and artwork: 3,000 \u2192 total: 33,700\n\nHousehold furnishings: 4,200 \u2192 total: 37,900\n\nRetirement funds, IRA: 2,000 \u2192 total: 39,900\n\nReal estate: 150,000 \u2192 total: 190,000\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, liabilities:\n\nAuto loan: 8,000\n\nMortgage: 100,000 \u2192 total: 108,000\n\nMedical bills payable: 250 \u2192 total: 108,250\n\nUtility bills payable: 150 \u2192 total: 108,400\n\nCredit card balance: 2,000 \u2192 total: 110,400\n\nPersonal loan: 3,000 \u2192 total: 113,400\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNet worth: 190,000 - 113,400 = 76,600\n\nBut the list shows net worth as $76,500. There might be a typo or an unaccounted liability of $100. For the purpose of this problem, I'll assume that net worth is $76,600, based on the provided assets and liabilities.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the net working capital (NWC). The hint says NWC is the difference between total liquid assets and total current liabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which assets are liquid. Liquid assets are those that can be easily converted into cash within a short period, typically less than a year. These usually include cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, money market funds, and sometimes marketable securities like stocks.\n\nSo, liquid assets would include:\n\n- Cash: $300\n\n- Checking: $3,000\n\n- Savings: $1,200\n\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n\nTotal liquid assets: $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 = $7,700\n\nWait, is real estate considered a liquid asset? No, real estate is illiquid because it cannot be easily converted to cash quickly without incurring significant costs. Similarly, vehicles like the Sebring and Jeep are also relatively illiquid compared to cash or bank accounts.\n\nTherefore, assets like real estate, vehicles, jewelry, artwork, and household furnishings are non-liquid assets.\n\nNow, total current liabilities are the liabilities that are due within a short period, typically within one year. These include:\n\n- Auto loan: $8,000\n\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nWait, mortgages are typically long-term liabilities, but in a balance sheet, the portion due within one year might be considered current. However, for simplicity, perhaps the entire mortgage is considered long-term. But in reality, some mortgages have balloon payments or other features that might make part of it current.\n\nFor now, I'll consider auto loan, medical bills payable, utility bills payable, credit card balance, and personal loan as current liabilities, totaling $8,000 + $250 + $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $13,400\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"total current liabilities,\" and the hint defines NWC as total liquid assets minus total current liabilities.\n\nSo, NWC = total liquid assets - total current liabilities = $7,700 - $13,400 = -$5,700\n\nNegative NWC means that current liabilities exceed liquid assets.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none of them are negative. The options are:\n\nA. $2,100\n\nB. $3,100\n\nC. $4,100\n\nD. $5,100\n\nThis suggests that either I've miscalculated something or there's a misunderstanding in how NWC is calculated.\n\nLet me re-examine my calculations.\n\nFirst, liquid assets:\n\n- Cash: $300\n\n- Checking: $3,000\n\n- Savings: $1,200\n\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n\nTotal liquid assets: $7,700\n\nIs IBM stock considered a liquid asset? Generally, stocks are considered liquid assets because they can be sold quickly for cash, although there might be some associated costs.\n\nNow, current liabilities:\n\n- Auto loan: $8,000\n\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nTotal current liabilities: $13,400\n\nBut since NWC is liquid assets minus current liabilities, $7,700 - $13,400 = -$5,700, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nPerhaps I've misclassified some liabilities as current when they should be long-term.\n\nFor example, auto loans and personal loans are typically multi-year obligations, so only a portion of them would be due within one year. Similarly, the mortgage is a long-term liability, but again, a portion might be due within one year.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's hard to know how much of these loans is current.\n\nMaybe I should consider only the utility bills payable and credit card balance as current liabilities, assuming that auto loan and personal loan are long-term.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nCurrent liabilities: medical bills payable ($250) + utility bills payable ($150) + credit card balance ($2,000) = $2,400\n\nThen, NWC = $7,700 - $2,400 = $5,300\n\nStill not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the auto loan and personal loan are considered current liabilities in their entirety.\n\nBut that seems unlikely unless they're short-term loans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mortgage is being considered as a long-term liability, and auto loan and personal loan are current liabilities.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nCurrent liabilities: auto loan ($8,000) + medical bills payable ($250) + utility bills payable ($150) + credit card balance ($2,000) + personal loan ($3,000) = $13,400\n\nNWC = $7,700 - $13,400 = -$5,700\n\nStill negative.\n\nGiven that, and since none of the options are negative, perhaps I'm misclassifying some assets or liabilities.\n\nLet me consider if real estate is a liquid asset. No, real estate is not liquid; it takes time to sell and convert to cash.\n\nSimilarly, vehicles like cars are also not liquid assets.\n\nMaybe I need to include only the most liquid assets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only certain assets as liquid.\n\nLet me look back at the definition of liquid assets. They are assets that can be easily converted into cash without significant loss of value within a short period, usually 90 days.\n\nSo, cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, money market funds, and possibly short-term investments like stocks.\n\nBut stocks can fluctuate in value, so they might not be 100% liquid in terms of value stability, but they are still considered fairly liquid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only cash, checking, and savings as liquid assets.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nLiquid assets: cash ($300) + checking ($3,000) + savings ($1,200) = $4,500\n\nThen, current liabilities: auto loan ($8,000) + medical bills payable ($250) + utility bills payable ($150) + credit card balance ($2,000) + personal loan ($3,000) = $13,400\n\nNWC = $4,500 - $13,400 = -$8,900\n\nStill negative and not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only medical and utility bills are current liabilities, and the rest are long-term.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nCurrent liabilities: medical bills payable ($250) + utility bills payable ($150) = $400\n\nNWC = $4,500 - $400 = $4,100\n\nThat matches option C. $4,100.\n\nPerhaps this is the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I include money market funds and IBM stock as liquid assets, total liquid assets would be $4,500 + $1,200 + $2,000 = $7,700\n\nThen, with current liabilities as $400, NWC would be $7,700 - $400 = $7,300, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider only cash and checking as liquid assets: $300 + $3,000 = $3,300\n\nAnd current liabilities as $400, then NWC = $3,300 - $400 = $2,900, which isn't an option either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to consider cash, checking, savings, and money market funds as liquid assets: $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 = $5,900\n\nAnd current liabilities as $400, then NWC = $5,900 - $400 = $5,500, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to include IBM stock as well: $5,900 + $2,000 = $7,900\n\nThen, NWC = $7,900 - $400 = $7,500, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they consider only cash and checking as liquid assets, totaling $3,300, and current liabilities as $400, leading to NWC = $2,900, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that some liabilities are long-term and only a portion is current.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to allocate.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, it seems that the intended approach is to consider only medical and utility bills as current liabilities, totaling $400, and liquid assets as cash, checking, and savings, totaling $4,500, leading to NWC = $4,100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. $4,100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
