                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got Eagle Sport Supply's financial statements for 2019 and 2018, and we need to figure out their external funding needs for 2020. They're planning to grow by 15%, and they pay out 50% of their earnings as dividends. Also, their assets are proportional to sales, which should make things a bit simpler.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what external funds are required for growth. I recall that the formula for external funds needed (EFN) involves the projected increase in assets minus the spontaneous increase in liabilities and the retention earnings. But let's make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nGiven that assets are proportional to sales, I can use the percentage of sales method here. So, first, I need to find out how assets and sales are related. From the balance sheet, in 2019, sales were $950, and net assets were $3,000. In 2018, sales were $2,700, and net assets were $2,700. Wait, that seems off. Wait, no, the income statement shows sales of $950, and the balance sheet shows net assets of $3,000 in 2019 and $2,700 in 2018. So, sales increased from $2,700 to $950? That doesn't make sense because sales decreased, but assets increased. Maybe there's a typo here. Let's assume that the sales figure in 2018 was $2,700, and in 2019, it's $950. That seems like a big decrease, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the sales in 2018 were $2,700, and in 2019, $950. That would be a significant drop, but perhaps there was a one-time event or something. Anyway, I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nFirst, let's find the asset-sales ratio based on 2019 data. Net assets are $3,000 for sales of $950. So, the asset-sales ratio is $3,000 / $950 \u2248 3.1579. But that seems high because typically, assets are less than sales. Maybe I need to consider that net assets might include fixed assets and working capital, and sales are revenue. Alternatively, perhaps \"net assets\" here refer to total assets minus liabilities, which is equity. But in the balance sheet, debt is $1,000, and equity is $2,000, totaling $3,000, which matches net assets. So, net assets seem to be total assets.\n\nWait, perhaps \"net assets\" are total assets, and debt is separate. So, total assets are $3,000, debt is $1,000, and equity is $2,000. That makes sense. So, assets are $3,000 for sales of $950.\n\nNow, they plan to grow sales by 15% in 2020. So, projected sales for 2020 would be $950 * 1.15 = $1,092.50.\n\nUsing the asset-sales ratio, projected assets would be $1,092.50 * 3.1579 \u2248 $3,450. But wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check the asset-sales ratio. If assets are $3,000 for sales of $950, then $950 * 3.1579 should give $3,000. Yes, that checks out.\n\nNow, we need to see how much additional funding is needed. The increase in assets is $3,450 - $3,000 = $450.\n\nNext, we need to see how much spontaneous funding is available. Spontaneous funding typically includes increases in current liabilities that occur automatically with increased sales. However, in this problem, only debt and equity are given, and debt seems to be long-term debt since it's separate from equity. There's no mention of current liabilities like accounts payable or accrued expenses. So, perhaps there are no spontaneous increases in liabilities, or we need to assume that only equity increases spontaneously.\n\nWait, but equity increases through retained earnings. So, if they retain some portion of their earnings, that can be a source of funding.\n\nGiven that they pay out 50% of their earnings as dividends, they retain the other 50%. So, retained earnings would increase by 50% of net income.\n\nFirst, let's find the net income for 2020. They plan a 15% growth in sales, so sales are $1,092.50. Costs in 2019 were $250 on sales of $950. Assuming costs remain proportional, cost ratio is $250 / $950 \u2248 0.2632 or 26.32%. So, costs in 2020 would be $1,092.50 * 0.2632 \u2248 $287.50.\n\nPretax income would be sales minus costs, so $1,092.50 - $287.50 = $805.\n\nTaxes are at 28.6%, so taxes would be $805 * 0.286 \u2248 $230.50.\n\nNet income would be $805 - $230.50 = $574.50.\n\nNow, they pay out 50% as dividends, so dividends are $574.50 * 0.50 = $287.25.\n\nRetained earnings are $574.50 - $287.25 = $287.25.\n\nSo, the increase in equity due to retained earnings is $287.25.\n\nNow, total funding needed is the increase in assets, which is $450.\n\nInternal funding from retained earnings is $287.25.\n\nExternal funding needed would be $450 - $287.25 = $162.75.\n\nBut looking at the options, $162.5 is one of them. So, perhaps due to rounding, it's $162.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $162.5.\n\nBut to make sure, let's verify the calculations again.\n\nSales 2019: $950\n\nProjected sales 2020: $950 * 1.15 = $1,092.50\n\nAsset-sales ratio: $3,000 / $950 = 3.1579\n\nProjected assets 2020: $1,092.50 * 3.1579 \u2248 $3,450\n\nIncrease in assets: $3,450 - $3,000 = $450\n\nNet income 2020: sales $1,092.50 - costs (26.32% of sales) = $1,092.50 * 0.2632 \u2248 $287.50\n\nPretax income: $1,092.50 - $287.50 = $805\n\nTaxes: $805 * 0.286 \u2248 $230.50\n\nNet income: $805 - $230.50 = $574.50\n\nDividends: $574.50 * 0.50 = $287.25\n\nRetained earnings: $574.50 - $287.25 = $287.25\n\nExternal funding: $450 - $287.25 = $162.75, which rounds to $162.5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 162.5} \\]"
