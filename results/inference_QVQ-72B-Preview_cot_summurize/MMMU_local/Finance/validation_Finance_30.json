                    "text": "Let's tackle this bond valuation problem. So, I have this table with different bonds, and I need to calculate the value of Bond D. From the table, Bond D has a par value of $1,000, a coupon interest rate of 14%, 10 years until maturity, and a required stated annual return of 10%. It also pays interest semiannually. Okay, so I need to find the present value of this bond given these details.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a bond is. A bond is essentially a loan that investors make to an entity, and in return, the entity pays back the loan with interest. The par value is the face value of the bond, which is what the investor gets back at maturity. The coupon rate is the interest rate paid on the bond, usually at regular intervals, and the required return is the rate of return that investors demand for holding the bond.\n\nSince the bond pays interest semiannually, I need to adjust all the figures to match the semiannual periods. That means I'll need to divide the annual coupon rate and the required return by 2, and multiply the number of years by 2 to get the number of payment periods.\n\nSo, for Bond D:\n\n- Par value (face value) = $1,000\n\n- Coupon rate = 14% per annum, so semiannual coupon rate = 14%/2 = 7% per period\n\n- Years to maturity = 10 years, so number of semiannual periods = 10 * 2 = 20 periods\n\n- Required annual return = 10%, so semiannual required return = 10%/2 = 5% per period\n\nNow, the value of the bond is the present value of its future cash flows, which consist of:\n\n1. The semiannual coupon payments\n\n2. The par value received at maturity\n\nThe formula for the bond value is:\n\nBond Value = (Coupon Payment / Required Semiannual Return) * [1 - (1 + Required Semiannual Return)^(-Number of Periods)] + (Par Value / (1 + Required Semiannual Return)^Number of Periods)\n\nAlternatively, it's often simplified as:\n\nBond Value = (Coupon Payment) * Present Value Interest Factor of an Annuity (PVIFA) + (Par Value) * Present Value Factor (PVF)\n\nWhere:\n\n- PVIFA = [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\n- PVF = 1 / (1 + r)^n\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Coupon Payment = $1,000 * 7% = $70 per period\n\n- Required Semiannual Return (r) = 5%\n\n- Number of Periods (n) = 20\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nBond Value = $70 * [1 - (1 + 0.05)^-20] / 0.05 + $1,000 / (1 + 0.05)^20\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.05)^20:\n\n(1.05)^20 \u2248 2.6533\n\nSo, 1 - 2.6533^-1 \u2248 1 - 0.3769 \u2248 0.6231\n\nThen, $70 * (0.6231 / 0.05) = $70 * 12.462 \u2248 $872.34\n\nNext, $1,000 / 2.6533 \u2248 $376.99\n\nAdding them up: $872.34 + $376.99 \u2248 $1,249.33\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula directly:\n\nBond Value = (Coupon Payment) * PVIFA(r, n) + Par Value * PVF(r, n)\n\nUsing financial tables or a calculator for PVIFA and PVF:\n\nPVIFA(5%, 20) \u2248 12.4622\n\nPVF(5%, 20) \u2248 0.3769\n\nSo, Bond Value = $70 * 12.4622 + $1,000 * 0.3769 \u2248 $872.35 + $376.90 \u2248 $1,249.25\n\nHmm, still getting the same result. Maybe it's correct, but I feel like it's too high compared to the par value.\n\nLet me consider if I'm using the correct required return. The required stated annual return is 10%, and since it's semiannual, it should indeed be divided by 2 to get the semiannual rate of 5%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider if the bond is selling at a premium or discount based on the relationship between the coupon rate and the required return.\n\nSince the coupon rate is 14% per annum (7% per period) and the required return is 10% per annum (5% per period), the bond should be selling at a premium because the coupon rate is higher than the required return.\n\nSo, a bond with a higher coupon rate than the required return should indeed sell for more than its par value, which is what I'm getting.\n\nLet me try another way to verify this.\n\nThe formula for the present value of a bond is:\n\nBond Value = (C / r) * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] + (F / (1 + r)^n)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C = coupon payment per period\n\n- r = required return per period\n\n- n = number of periods\n\n- F = par value\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nBond Value = ($70 / 0.05) * [1 - (1 + 0.05)^-20] + ($1,000 / (1 + 0.05)^20)\n\n= $1,400 * [1 - 0.3769] + $376.99\n\n= $1,400 * 0.6231 + $376.99\n\n= $872.34 + $376.99\n\n= $1,249.33\n\nSame result again. It seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the annuity formula for the coupons and add the present value of the par value.\n\nCoupon Annuity Present Value = C * PVIFA(r, n) = $70 * 12.4622 \u2248 $872.35\n\nPar Value Present Value = F * PVF(r, n) = $1,000 * 0.3769 \u2248 $376.90\n\nTotal Bond Value = $872.35 + $376.90 = $1,249.25\n\nStill the same. Maybe I'm missing something, but mathematically, it seems correct.\n\nLet me think about the context. The problem states that all bonds pay interest semiannually, and Bond D has a par value of $1,000, a 14% coupon rate, 10 years to maturity, and a required return of 10%.\n\nGiven that, and the semiannual compounding, the calculations should be accurate.\n\nPerhaps to confirm, I can use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet to compute the bond value.\n\nAssuming semiannual payments:\n\n- N = 20 periods\n\n- I/Y = 5% (since it's semiannual)\n\n- PMT = $70\n\n- FV = $1,000\n\n- Compute PV: should be approximately -$1,249.25 (negative because it's an outflow)\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value of Bond D is approximately $1,249.25.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all of which pay interest semiannually,\" but doesn't specify anything else that might affect the valuation.\n\nI think I've covered all the aspects correctly, and the calculation consistently gives me $1,249.25.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that could affect the bond value.\n\n- Is the bond callable? If it's callable, that would affect its value, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\n- Is there any conversion feature? Again, nothing mentioned.\n\n- Is the bond subject to taxes? Unless specified, we can assume it's a tax-free environment.\n\n- Is the bond currently trading at a certain price? No, we're calculating its intrinsic value based on the given parameters.\n\nTherefore, assuming no other factors, the calculated value should hold.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the effective annual yield.\n\nThe effective annual yield is (1 + r/m)^m - 1, where r is the annual rate and m is the number of compounding periods per year.\n\nHere, r = 10%, m = 2, so effective annual yield is (1 + 0.10/2)^2 - 1 = (1.05)^2 - 1 = 1.1025 - 1 = 10.25%.\n\nSimilarly, the effective annual coupon rate is (1 + 14%/2)^2 - 1 = (1.07)^2 - 1 = 1.1449 - 1 = 14.49%.\n\nSo, since the effective coupon rate (14.49%) is higher than the effective yield (10.25%), the bond should trade at a premium, which aligns with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the effective annual rates in the calculation, I would need to adjust the periodic rates accordingly, but given that the payments are semiannual, using semiannual rates is more straightforward and accurate.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the value of Bond D is approximately $1,249.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1249.25} \\]"
