                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have National Bromide's sales forecast for the first four months of 2019, and we need to find the expected cash inflow from operations for months 3 and 4. The sales are broken down into cash sales and sales on credit, and there's a payment pattern for the credit sales.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the payment terms for credit sales. It says that on average, 50% of credit sales are paid in the current month, 30% in the next month, and the remaining 20% in the month after that. So, for each month's credit sales, we'll split the payment over three months based on these percentages.\n\nLet me summarize the sales data:\n\n- Month 1:\n\n- Cash sales: $15,000\n\n- Credit sales: $100,000\n\n- Month 2:\n\n- Cash sales: $24,000\n\n- Credit sales: $120,000\n\n- Month 3:\n\n- Cash sales: $18,000\n\n- Credit sales: $90,000\n\n- Month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\nNow, for each month, the cash inflow will be the cash sales plus the payments received for previous credit sales.\n\nLet's calculate the cash inflow for month 3 first.\n\nFor month 3:\n\n- Cash sales: $18,000\n\n- Credit sales from month 3: $90,000\n\nBut we need to consider the payments from month 2's credit sales and month 1's credit sales as well.\n\nFrom month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 30% paid in month 3: 0.30 * $120,000 = $36,000\n\nFrom month 1's credit sales ($100,000):\n\n- 20% paid in month 3: 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000\n\nSo, total cash inflow for month 3 = cash sales + payments from month 2's credit sales + payments from month 1's credit sales\n\n= $18,000 + $36,000 + $20,000 = $74,000\n\nWait, but none of the options have $74,000 for month 3. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me check the payment terms again. It says:\n\n- 50% paid in the current month\n\n- 30% paid in the next month\n\n- 20% paid in the month after that\n\nSo, for month 3:\n\n- Cash sales: $18,000\n\n- Credit sales: $90,000, of which:\n\n- 50% in month 3: 0.50 * $90,000 = $45,000\n\n- 30% in month 4\n\n- 20% in month 5\n\nAdditionally, from month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 30% in month 3: 0.30 * $120,000 = $36,000\n\nAnd from month 1's credit sales ($100,000):\n\n- 20% in month 3: 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000\n\nSo, total cash inflow for month 3 = $18,000 (cash sales) + $45,000 (50% of month 3 credit) + $36,000 (30% of month 2 credit) + $20,000 (20% of month 1 credit) = $18,000 + $45,000 + $36,000 + $20,000 = $119,000\n\nOkay, that matches option D for month 3.\n\nNow, let's calculate for month 4.\n\nFor month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\nFrom month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% paid in month 4: 0.20 * $90,000 = $18,000\n\nFrom month 4's credit sales ($70,000):\n\n- 50% paid in month 4: 0.50 * $70,000 = $35,000\n\nFrom month 2's credit sales, we've already accounted for 50% in month 2 and 30% in month 3, so 20% was in month 4: 0.20 * $120,000 = $24,000\n\nWait, but according to the payment terms, for month 2's credit sales:\n\n- 50% in month 2\n\n- 30% in month 3\n\n- 20% in month 4\n\nSo, for month 4, we have:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- 50% of month 4 credit sales: 0.50 * $70,000 = $35,000\n\n- 20% of month 3 credit sales: 0.20 * $90,000 = $18,000\n\n- 20% of month 2 credit sales: 0.20 * $120,000 = $24,000\n\nTotal cash inflow for month 4 = $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Month 3: $31,000; Month 4: $30,000\n\nB. Month 3: $81,000; Month 4: $96,000\n\nC. Month 3: $91,000; Month 4: $86,000\n\nD. Month 3: $119,000; Month 4: $100,000\n\nMy calculations show month 3: $119,000 and month 4: $91,000, which don't exactly match any of the options. However, option D has month 3: $119,000 and month 4: $100,000, which is close to my calculation for month 3 but not for month 4.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in calculating month 4.\n\nLet me double-check month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\nFrom month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $18,000\n\nFrom month 4's credit sales ($70,000):\n\n- 50% in month 4: $35,000\n\nFrom month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $24,000\n\nTotal: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nYes, that seems correct. But option D has month 4 as $100,000, which doesn't match my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let's look again.\n\nOption D: Month 3: $119,000; Month 4: $100,000\n\nMy calculation for month 4 is $91,000, which doesn't match. Maybe there's an error in the question or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed something in the payment terms. Let's review the payment terms again:\n\n- 50% of credit sales are paid in the current month\n\n- 30% are paid in the next month\n\n- The remainder (20%) are paid in the month after that.\n\nSo, for month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000, of which:\n\n- 50% in month 4: $35,000\n\n- 30% in month 5: $21,000\n\n- 20% in month 6: $14,000\n\n- From month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $18,000\n\n- From month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $24,000\n\nTotal cash inflow for month 4: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut option D has month 4 as $100,000. Maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that month 4's credit sales don't contribute to month 4's cash inflow because they are paid in subsequent months. Wait, no, according to the terms, 50% of month 4's credit sales are paid in month 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the credit sales payments are received in the same month for the 50% part.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nFor month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000, of which:\n\n- 50% paid in month 4: $35,000\n\n- 30% paid in month 5: $21,000\n\n- 20% paid in month 6: $14,000\n\n- From month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% paid in month 4: $18,000\n\n- From month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 20% paid in month 4: $24,000\n\nTotal cash inflow for month 4: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nYes, that seems accurate.\n\nBut option D has month 4 as $100,000. Maybe there's a typo or I misread the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that month 4's credit sales are $70,000, and 50% of that is $35,000 paid in month 4, but maybe there's another component I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the credit sales payments are based on the previous months' credit sales, but month 4 also has its own credit sales payments.\n\nLet me try recalculating month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\nFrom month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $18,000\n\nFrom month 4's credit sales ($70,000):\n\n- 50% in month 4: $35,000\n\nFrom month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $24,000\n\nTotal: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nStill $91,000. But option D has $100,000 for month 4.\n\nMaybe there's an error in the options, or perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the payment terms are applied only to the credit sales, and cash sales are received in full in the current month.\n\nWait, that's what I assumed. Cash sales are received in full in the current month, and credit sales are paid over three months as specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the remaining payments from previous months' credit sales are also included in the current month's cash inflow.\n\nWait, I think I might have double-counted the payments.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFor month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\nFrom month 3's credit sales ($90,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $18,000\n\nFrom month 4's credit sales ($70,000):\n\n- 50% in month 4: $35,000\n\nFrom month 2's credit sales ($120,000):\n\n- 20% in month 4: $24,000\n\nTotal: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut option D has $100,000 for month 4. Maybe there's a mistake in the options or the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that month 4's credit sales don't contribute to month 4's cash inflow because they are paid in subsequent months. But according to the payment terms, 50% of credit sales are paid in the current month.\n\nWait, no, that's already included in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the credit sales payments are based on the percentage of the credit sales from previous months.\n\nWait, I think I'm going in circles here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is option D for month 3 ($119,000) and option C for month 4 ($91,000), but since the options don't match exactly, maybe there's a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to round the numbers or consider that the percentages might not sum up perfectly due to rounding errors, but in this case, the calculations are straightforward.\n\nGiven that, I think the closest answer is option D for month 3 ($119,000) and option C for month 4 ($91,000), but since I can't select both, perhaps the question expects us to choose the option that matches one of the months, and the other month's figure is incorrect in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me try another method.\n\nPerhaps I should create a table to track the cash inflows month by month, considering the payment terms for credit sales.\n\nMonth | Cash Sales | Credit Sales | 50% of CS | 30% of CS | 20% of CS | Total Cash Inflow\n\n1 | $15,000 | $100,000 | $50,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | $115,000\n\n2 | $24,000 | $120,000 | $60,000 | $36,000 | $24,000 | $144,000\n\n3 | $18,000 | $90,000 | $45,000 | $27,000 | $18,000 | $108,000\n\n4 | $14,000 | $70,000 | $35,000 | $21,000 | $14,000 | $84,000\n\nWait, but this doesn't match my earlier calculations.\n\nHold on, I think I misunderstood the payment terms.\n\nIt says: \"on average 50% of credit sales are paid for in the current month, 30% are paid in the next month, and the remainder are paid in the month after that.\"\n\nSo, for each month's credit sales, 50% is paid in that month, 30% in the next month, and 20% in the month after that.\n\nSo, for month 4:\n\n- Cash sales: $14,000\n\n- Credit sales: $70,000\n\n- Payments from month 3's credit sales: 20% of $90,000 = $18,000\n\n- Payments from month 2's credit sales: 20% of $120,000 = $24,000\n\n- 50% of month 4's credit sales: 50% of $70,000 = $35,000\n\nTotal cash inflow for month 4: $14,000 + $35,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 = $91,000\n\nYes, that matches my initial calculation.\n\nFor month 3:\n\n- Cash sales: $18,000\n\n- Credit sales: $90,000\n\n- Payments from month 2's credit sales: 30% of $120,000 = $36,000\n\n- Payments from month 1's credit sales: 20% of $100,000 = $20,000\n\n- 50% of month 3's credit sales: 50% of $90,000 = $45,000\n\nTotal cash inflow for month 3: $18,000 + $45,000 + $36,000 + $20,000 = $1"
