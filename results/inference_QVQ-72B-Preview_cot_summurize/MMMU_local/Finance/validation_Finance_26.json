                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a table with four perpetuities, each having an annual amount and a discount rate. The question is asking us to determine the interest rate and the present value of perpetuity C. Looking at the options, it seems like one of them should match the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a perpetuity is. A perpetuity is an annuity that pays a constant stream of payments indefinitely. The formula to find the present value of a perpetuity is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{C}{r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( PV \\) is the present value,\n\n- \\( C \\) is the constant annual cash flow,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate.\n\nGiven that, I need to identify perpetuity C's annual amount and discount rate from the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Perpetuity A: $20,000 at 8%\n\n- Perpetuity B: $100,000 at 10%\n\n- Perpetuity C: $3,000 at 6%\n\n- Perpetuity D: $60,000 at 5%\n\nSo, for perpetuity C, the annual amount is $3,000 and the discount rate is 6%.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"determine the interest rate and present value of perpetuity C.\" But in the options, they are giving different interest rates and present values. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nLet me look again. The table has \"Perpetuity,\" \"Annual amount,\" and \"Discount rate.\" For perpetuity C, it's $3,000 at 6%. So, the discount rate is 6%, not the interest rate, but in perpetuities, the discount rate is often considered the same as the interest rate because perpetuities are typically discounted at the interest rate.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3000}{0.06} = 50,000 \\]\n\nThat matches option D: interest rate = 6.0%; present value = $50,000.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: interest rate = 5.0%; present value = $1,200,000\n\nIf I plug in 5% for r:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3000}{0.05} = 60,000 \\]\n\nThat's not matching.\n\nOption B: interest rate = 10.0%; present value = $1,000,000\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3000}{0.10} = 30,000 \\]\n\nNot matching.\n\nOption C: interest rate = 8.0%; present value = $250,000\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3000}{0.08} = 37,500 \\]\n\nStill not matching.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait, but the question says \"determine the interest rate and present value of perpetuity C.\" It might be trying to test understanding by presenting different rates and values, but according to the table, perpetuity C has a discount rate of 6% and an annual amount of $3,000, leading to a present value of $50,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of what the question is asking. Let's read it again: \"Determine the interest rate and present value of perpetuity C.\"\n\nIs it possible that the interest rate is different from the discount rate? In financial contexts, the discount rate is often used interchangeably with the interest rate, especially in the context of perpetuities.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to ask for the implied interest rate given the present value, but the options provided seem to suggest different scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo or misalignment in the options. Given the information, option D seems to align with the calculation for perpetuity C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. interest rate = 6.0%; present value = $50,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
