The company is selling 100,000 shares, and there are various bids with different prices and shares offered. In a discriminatory auction, each bidder pays the exact price they bid for the shares they receive. So, unlike a uniform price auction, where all buyers pay the same price, here each buyer pays their own specified price.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided, which lists different quantities of shares and their corresponding prices:\n\n- 20,000 shares at $80\n\n- 10,000 shares at $78\n\n- 15,000 shares at $73\n\n- 25,000 shares at $70\n\n- 10,000 shares at $69\n\n- 8,000 shares at $67\n\n- 14,000 shares at $66\n\n- 15,000 shares at $65\n\n- 30,000 shares at $61\n\nMy goal is to calculate the total receipts for the company from selling 100,000 shares based on these bids.\n\nFirst, I should make sure that the total shares allocated add up to 100,000. Let me add up the shares:\n\n20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000\n\n30,000 + 15,000 = 45,000\n\n45,000 + 25,000 = 70,000\n\n70,000 + 10,000 = 80,000\n\n80,000 + 8,000 = 88,000\n\n88,000 + 14,000 = 102,000\n\nWait a minute, that adds up to 102,000 shares, but the company is only selling 100,000 shares. So, there's an overallocation here. I need to adjust for that.\n\nPerhaps the last bid for 30,000 shares at $61 is not fully allocated, or maybe there's another way to handle it. Since the total shares bid exceed the available shares, the company can choose to allocate up to 100,000 shares to the highest bidders.\n\nIn a discriminatory auction, the highest bidders get their shares first, and lower bidders get the remaining shares, provided there are still shares left.\n\nSo, let's rank the bids from highest to lowest price:\n\n1. 20,000 shares at $80\n\n2. 10,000 shares at $78\n\n3. 15,000 shares at $73\n\n4. 25,000 shares at $70\n\n5. 10,000 shares at $69\n\n6. 8,000 shares at $67\n\n7. 14,000 shares at $66\n\n8. 15,000 shares at $65\n\n9. 30,000 shares at $61\n\nNow, let's allocate the shares starting from the highest bidder until we reach 100,000 shares.\n\nFirst bidder: 20,000 shares at $80\n\nSecond bidder: 10,000 shares at $78 \u2192 total so far: 30,000 shares\n\nThird bidder: 15,000 shares at $73 \u2192 total so far: 45,000 shares\n\nFourth bidder: 25,000 shares at $70 \u2192 total so far: 70,000 shares\n\nFifth bidder: 10,000 shares at $69 \u2192 total so far: 80,000 shares\n\nSixth bidder: 8,000 shares at $67 \u2192 total so far: 88,000 shares\n\nSeventh bidder: 14,000 shares at $66 \u2192 total so far: 102,000 shares\n\nBut we only have 100,000 shares to allocate, so we need to adjust the seventh bidder's allocation.\n\nThe seventh bidder wants 14,000 shares at $66, but we only have 20,000 shares left (100,000 - 80,000 = 20,000). Wait, no: after allocating 88,000 shares, we have 12,000 shares left (100,000 - 88,000 = 12,000).\n\nSo, we can allocate 12,000 shares to the seventh bidder at $66, instead of their full request of 14,000 shares.\n\nThen, the eighth and ninth bidders wouldn't get any shares because there are no more shares left.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total receipts:\n\n1. 20,000 shares at $80: 20,000 * 80 = 1,600,000\n\n2. 10,000 shares at $78: 10,000 * 78 = 780,000\n\n3. 15,000 shares at $73: 15,000 * 73 = 1,095,000\n\n4. 25,000 shares at $70: 25,000 * 70 = 1,750,000\n\n5. 10,000 shares at $69: 10,000 * 69 = 690,000\n\n6. 8,000 shares at $67: 8,000 * 67 = 536,000\n\n7. 12,000 shares at $66: 12,000 * 66 = 792,000\n\nNow, add all these up to get the total receipts:\n\n1,600,000 + 780,000 = 2,380,000\n\n2,380,000 + 1,095,000 = 3,475,000\n\n3,475,000 + 1,750,000 = 5,225,000\n\n5,225,000 + 690,000 = 5,915,000\n\n5,915,000 + 536,000 = 6,451,000\n\n6,451,000 + 792,000 = 7,243,000\n\nSo, the total receipts would be $7,243,000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the addition to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1,600,000 + 780,000 = 2,380,000\n\n2,380,000 + 1,095,000 = 3,475,000\n\n3,475,000 + 1,750,000 = 5,225,000\n\n5,225,000 + 690,000 = 5,915,000\n\n5,915,000 + 536,000 = 6,451,000\n\n6,451,000 + 792,000 = 7,243,000\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that in a discriminatory auction, each bidder pays their own bid price for the shares they receive, and the allocation is based on the order of bids from highest to lowest price until the total shares are allocated.\n\nIn this case, since the total shares bid exceed the available shares, only the highest bidders get their shares, and the last bidder's allocation is prorated based on the remaining shares.\n\nIn my calculation, I allocated 12,000 shares to the seventh bidder instead of their full request of 14,000 shares, as only 12,000 shares were left after allocating to the higher bidders.\n\nTherefore, the total receipts should indeed be $7,243,000.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if there's any other way to interpret the auction mechanism. In a discriminatory auction, also known as a first-price sealed-bid auction, each bidder pays the price they bid for the quantity they bid, provided they are among the highest bidders.\n\nIn this scenario, since the total shares bid exceed the available shares, the company would allocate shares to the highest bidders until the 100,000 shares are allocated.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in auctions, there might be a different approach, like a uniform price auction, where all successful bidders pay the same price, typically the lowest successful bid price. But in this problem, it specifies a discriminatory auction, where each bidder pays their own bid price.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation should hold.\n\nSo, the company's total receipts from the sale would be $7,243,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7243000} \\]"
