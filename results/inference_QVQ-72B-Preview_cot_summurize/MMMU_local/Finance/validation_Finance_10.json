Then, they're planning to buy another 15,000 watches in 3 months for another 1 million francs. The exchange rate in 90 days is given as 0.50 francs to $1. I need to find out how much Desreumaux will have to pay in dollars for the watches in 90 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current spot and forward rates. The table provides both US Dollar/Franc and Franc/US Dollar rates for different time periods: spot, 30-day forward, 90-day forward, and 180-day forward.\n\nLooking at the 90-day forward rate:\n\n- US Dollar/Franc is 1.6460\n\n- Franc/US Dollar is 0.6075\n\nBut the problem mentions that in 90 days, the exchange rate is 0.50 francs to $1. This seems a bit confusing because it's phrased differently from the table. Maybe it's a typo or misphrased. Typically, exchange rates are quoted as either units of foreign currency per dollar or dollars per unit of foreign currency.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- If the rate is 0.50 francs to $1, that means $1 buys 0.50 francs.\n\n- Alternatively, to find francs per dollar, it's 0.50 francs per dollar.\n\nWait, that seems off because typically, the franc is weaker than the dollar, so $1 should buy more than 1 franc. In the table, the spot rate is 1.6590 US Dollar/Franc, which means $1.6590 per franc. So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, no. The table shows:\n\n- Spot: 1.6590 USD/FRANC\n\n- 90-day forward: 1.6460 USD/FRANC\n\nSo, $1.6460 per franc in 90 days.\n\nBut the problem says \"the exchange rate for the Swiss franc is 0.50 to $1 in 90 days.\" That would mean $1 buys 0.50 francs, which is the same as 2 dollars per franc. That contradicts the table's 90-day forward rate of 1.6460 USD/FRANC.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem as stated. Perhaps the rate was supposed to be 0.50 dollars per franc, which would be 2.00 francs per dollar. But even that doesn't match the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rate is supposed to be 0.50 francs per dollar, which would be 2.00 dollars per franc. But again, that doesn't align with the table's 1.6460 USD/FRANC.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that the rate is 0.50 francs per dollar, meaning $1 buys 0.50 francs, or equivalently, 1 franc costs $2.00.\n\nBut the table shows 1.6460 USD/FRANC, which means 1 franc costs $1.6460.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Perhaps the problem is misstated, and the rate should be 0.60 francs per dollar, which would correspond to about 1.667 dollars per franc, closer to the table's 1.6460.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rate is supposed to be 0.60 dollars per franc, which would be 1.6667 dollars per franc, again closer to the table's 1.6460.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the \"0.50\" is a typo, and it should be \"0.60.\"\n\nAssuming that, I'll proceed with the 90-day forward rate from the table: 1.6460 USD/FRANC.\n\nSo, if Desreumaux buys 1 million francs worth of watches in 90 days, and the exchange rate is 1.6460 USD/FRANC, then the cost in dollars would be:\n\nCost in dollars = 1,000,000 francs * 1.6460 USD/FRANC = 1,646,000 USD\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions purchasing 15,000 watches for 1 million francs twice: once at today's spot rate and once in 90 days.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to calculate the cost in dollars for both purchases.\n\nFirst purchase at spot rate:\n\nCost in dollars = 1,000,000 francs * 1.6590 USD/FRANC = 1,659,000 USD\n\nSecond purchase in 90 days at forward rate:\n\nCost in dollars = 1,000,000 francs * 1.6460 USD/FRANC = 1,646,000 USD\n\nTotal cost in dollars = 1,659,000 + 1,646,000 = 3,305,000 USD\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the amount Desreumaux will have to pay in 90 days, which is only the second purchase.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1,646,000 USD.\n\nHowever, considering the confusion in the problem statement regarding the exchange rate, perhaps I need to use the rate provided in the problem, which is 0.50 francs to $1 in 90 days.\n\nBut as I previously thought, this seems inconsistent with the table's 90-day forward rate.\n\nIf I use the rate from the problem: 0.50 francs to $1, that means $1 buys 0.50 francs, or 1 franc costs $2.00.\n\nSo, cost in dollars = 1,000,000 francs / 0.50 francs per dollar = 2,000,000 USD\n\nBut this contradicts the table's 90-day forward rate of 1.6460 USD/FRANC, which would give a cost of 1,646,000 USD.\n\nI need to decide which rate to use. Since the table provides specific forward rates, perhaps the \"0.50\" in the problem is a mistake, and I should use the 90-day forward rate from the table.\n\nTherefore, the cost in 90 days would be 1,646,000 USD.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1646000} \\]"
