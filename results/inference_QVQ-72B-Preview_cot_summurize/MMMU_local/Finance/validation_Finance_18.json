                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem using the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model. The problem gives me a three-factor model with specific risk premiums for each factor, and I need to calculate the expected rate of return for a stock that has average exposure to each factor. The risk-free rate is also provided, which is 7%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the APT model is. I recall that the APT model is an alternative to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for explaining the expected return of an asset. Unlike CAPM, which uses a single factor (market risk), APT considers multiple factors that can influence asset returns.\n\nIn APT, the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a premium for each factor to which the asset is exposed. The formula for APT is generally expressed as:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 + \\ldots + b_{in}RP_n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on asset i.\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( b_{in} \\) is the sensitivity of the asset to the nth factor.\n\n- \\( RP_n \\) is the risk premium for the nth factor.\n\nIn this problem, there are three factors:\n\n1. Change in gross national product (GNP) with a risk premium of +5%.\n\n2. Change in energy prices with a risk premium of -1%.\n\n3. Change in long-term interest rates with a risk premium of +2%.\n\nThe stock in question has average exposure to each factor, meaning each beta \\( b \\) is 1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values into the APT formula:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 7\\% + 1 \\times 5\\% + 1 \\times (-1\\%) + 1 \\times 2\\% \\]\n\nNow, I'll calculate the sum of the factor premiums:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 5\\% = 5\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\times (-1\\%) = -1\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 2\\% = 2\\% \\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[ 5\\% - 1\\% + 2\\% = 6\\% \\]\n\nFinally, adding this factor premium to the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 7\\% + 6\\% = 13\\% \\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 7%\n\nC. 13%\n\nD. 15.5%\n\nIt seems that the correct answer is C. 13%.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the risk-free rate is 7%.\n\nThe factor loadings are all 1 since the stock has average exposure to each factor.\n\nThe risk premiums are:\n\n- GNP: +5%\n\n- Energy prices: -1%\n\n- Interest rates: +2%\n\nSo, the total factor premium should be:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 5\\% + 1 \\times (-1\\%) + 1 \\times 2\\% = 5\\% - 1\\% + 2\\% = 6\\% \\]\n\nAdding this to the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 7\\% + 6\\% = 13\\% \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the factor loadings are all 1, and the risk premiums are as given, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether the factor loadings are being multiplied correctly with the risk premiums.\n\nLet me try breaking it down again.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + b_1 \\times RP_1 + b_2 \\times RP_2 + b_3 \\times RP_3 \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( R_f = 7\\% \\)\n\n- \\( b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( RP_1 = 5\\% \\)\n\n- \\( RP_2 = -1\\% \\)\n\n- \\( RP_3 = 2\\% \\)\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 7\\% + 1 \\times 5\\% + 1 \\times (-1\\%) + 1 \\times 2\\% \\]\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 7\\% + 5\\% - 1\\% + 2\\% \\]\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 13\\% \\]\n\nYes, I get the same result again.\n\nI think I might be overthinking this. The answer should be 13%, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed.\n\nIs there any possibility of a fourth factor? The problem states that it's a three-factor APT model, so I don't think so.\n\nMaybe the stock has different exposures to each factor, but in this case, it's specified that the stock has average exposure to each factor, which is a beta of 1 for each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the risk premiums need to be adjusted in some way, but I don't think so based on the information provided.\n\nNo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the expected rate of return for the stock is 13%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
