From the information given, there are free cash flows (FCFs) projected for the next three years, and after that, the FCF is expected to grow at a constant rate of 7%. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 13%. There's also a table showing the free cash flows for years 1 through 3:\n\n- Year 1: -\\$20 million\n\n- Year 2: \\$30 million\n\n- Year 3: \\$40 million\n\nAlright, so the first step in valuing a company's operations is to calculate the present value of its future free cash flows. The general approach is to discount each of these cash flows back to the present using the WACC, and then sum them up.\n\nSo, for the first three years, I'll discount each year's FCF separately, and then I'll calculate the terminal value, which is the value of all the cash flows after year 3, since they're growing at a constant rate.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the present value of a future cash flow:\n\nPV = FCF / (1 + WACC)^t\n\nWhere:\n\n- PV is the present value\n\n- FCF is the free cash flow in year t\n\n- WACC is the weighted average cost of capital\n\n- t is the time period\n\nSo, for year 1:\n\nPV1 = -\\$20 / (1 + 0.13)^1\n\n= -\\$20 / 1.13\n\n= -\\$17.70 million\n\nFor year 2:\n\nPV2 = \\$30 / (1 + 0.13)^2\n\n= \\$30 / 1.2769\n\n= \\$23.53 million\n\nFor year 3:\n\nPV3 = \\$40 / (1 + 0.13)^3\n\n= \\$40 / 1.4428\n\n= \\$27.72 million\n\nNow, after year 3, the FCF is expected to grow at a constant rate of 7%. To find the terminal value, I can use the Gordon Growth Model formula:\n\nTerminal Value = FCF3 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)\n\nWhere:\n\n- FCF3 is the free cash flow in year 3\n\n- g is the constant growth rate\n\n- WACC is the weighted average cost of capital\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTerminal Value = \\$40 million * (1 + 0.07) / (0.13 - 0.07)\n\n= \\$40 * 1.07 / 0.06\n\n= \\$40 * 1.07 / 0.06\n\n= \\$40 * 17.8333...\n\nWait, let me calculate that properly.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\$40 * 1.07 = \\$42.8 million\n\nThen, divide by (0.13 - 0.07) = 0.06\n\nSo, \\$42.8 million / 0.06 = \\$713.33 million\n\nNow, I need to find the present value of this terminal value, discounted back to the present at the WACC.\n\nThe terminal value is at the end of year 3, so I need to discount it back 3 years.\n\nPV_terminal = \\$713.33 million / (1 + 0.13)^3\n\n= \\$713.33 / 1.4428\n\n= \\$494.48 million\n\nNow, to find the total current value of operations, I need to sum the present values of the FCFs for years 1, 2, 3, and the terminal value.\n\nTotal PV = PV1 + PV2 + PV3 + PV_terminal\n\n= -\\$17.70 million + \\$23.53 million + \\$27.72 million + \\$494.48 million\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n- \\$23.53 - \\$17.70 = \\$5.83 million\n\n- \\$5.83 + \\$27.72 = \\$33.55 million\n\n- \\$33.55 + \\$494.48 = \\$528.03 million\n\nSo, the current value of operations for Dozier Corporation is \\$528.03 million.\n\nWait a minute, the question asks for the answer in millions, right? Yes, it's in millions already.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, the present values for years 1 to 3:\n\nYear 1: -\\$20 / 1.13 = -\\$17.70 million \u2192 correct\n\nYear 2: \\$30 / 1.2769 = \\$23.53 million \u2192 correct\n\nYear 3: \\$40 / 1.4428 = \\$27.72 million \u2192 correct\n\nTerminal value calculation:\n\nFCF3 = \\$40 million\n\nGrowth rate, g = 7% = 0.07\n\nWACC = 13% = 0.13\n\nTerminal Value = FCF3 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g) = \\$40 * 1.07 / 0.06 = \\$713.33 million \u2192 correct\n\nPresent value of terminal value: \\$713.33 / 1.4428 = \\$494.48 million \u2192 correct\n\nTotal PV: -17.70 + 23.53 + 27.72 + 494.48 = \\$528.03 million \u2192 correct\n\nLooks like everything checks out.
