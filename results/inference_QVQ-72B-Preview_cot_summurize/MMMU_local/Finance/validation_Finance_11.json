                    "text": "Let's see here. Solar Designs is thinking about expanding their product line, and they have two options: Expansion A and Expansion B. Both require an initial investment of $12,000. The table provides different rates of return based on pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic scenarios for each expansion.\n\nSo, for Expansion A, the rates are:\n\n- Pessimistic: 16%\n\n- Most likely: 20%\n\n- Optimistic: 24%\n\nFor Expansion B, they are:\n\n- Pessimistic: 10%\n\n- Most likely: 20%\n\n- Optimistic: 30%\n\nThe question is asking for the range of the rates of return for each project. Range, in this context, probably means the difference between the highest and lowest possible rates.\n\nFor Expansion A:\n\n- The lowest rate is 16%\n\n- The highest rate is 24%\n\n- So, the range is 24% - 16% = 8%\n\nFor Expansion B:\n\n- The lowest rate is 10%\n\n- The highest rate is 30%\n\n- So, the range is 30% - 10% = 20%\n\nBut looking at the options, they are showing different ranges, not necessarily the difference, but maybe the span of possible rates.\n\nOption A says:\n\n- Expansion A: 20% to 24%\n\n- Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nOption B:\n\n- Expansion A: 16% to 24%\n\n- Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nOption C:\n\n- Expansion A: 16% to 24%\n\n- Expansion B: 20% to 30%\n\nOption D:\n\n- Expansion A: 20% to 24%\n\n- Expansion B: 20% to 30%\n\nFrom the table, Expansion A has pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic rates of 16%, 20%, and 24% respectively. So, the possible rates range from 16% to 24%. That matches with options B and C.\n\nFor Expansion B, the rates are 10%, 20%, and 30%. So, the possible rates range from 10% to 30%. That matches with options B and C again.\n\nWait, both options B and C have Expansion A as 16% to 24%, and Expansion B as 10% to 30% in option B, and 20% to 30% in option C.\n\nBut for Expansion B, the pessimistic rate is 10%, so the range should be from 10% upwards to 30%. So, option B seems correct.\n\nOption C has Expansion B as 20% to 30%, but that excludes the pessimistic scenario, which is 10%. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait, but option A has Expansion A as 20% to 24%, but according to the table, the pessimistic rate is 16%, so that should be included. So, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B has both expansions covering the full range from pessimistic to optimistic rates.\n\nOption C incorrectly excludes the pessimistic rate for Expansion B.\n\nOption D has Expansion A from 20% to 24%, missing the pessimistic rate, and Expansion B from 20% to 30%, which again misses the pessimistic rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: Expansion A: 16% to 24%; Expansion B: 10% to 30%.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
