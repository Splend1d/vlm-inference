                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have this table with different cases, each having an annuity amount, an interest rate, and a deposit period in years. The question is asking me to calculate the future value of the annuity for case A, assuming it's an ordinary annuity. The options are A. $126,827, B. $223,248, C. $36,216, and D. $4,058.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what an ordinary annuity is. From what I recall, an ordinary annuity involves making payments at the end of each period, and the interest is compounded at the end of each period as well. So, in this case, since it's an ordinary annuity, the payments are made at the end of each year.\n\nFor case A, the annuity amount is $2,500, the interest rate is 8%, and the deposit period is 10 years. I need to find the future value of this annuity.\n\nI remember there's a formula for calculating the future value of an ordinary annuity. It's:\n\n\\[ FV = P \\times \\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the annuity payment amount (the amount deposited each period)\n\n- \\( r \\) is the interest rate per period\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods\n\nIn this case, \\( P = \\$2,500 \\), \\( r = 8\\% \\) or 0.08, and \\( n = 10 \\) years.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ FV = 2500 \\times \\frac{(1 + 0.08)^{10} - 1}{0.08} \\]\n\nFirst, I need to calculate \\( (1 + 0.08)^{10} \\):\n\n\\[ (1 + 0.08)^{10} = (1.08)^{10} \\]\n\nI can calculate 1.08 to the power of 10 step by step.\n\nLet me calculate 1.08 squared first:\n\n\\[ 1.08^2 = 1.08 \\times 1.08 = 1.1664 \\]\n\nThen 1.08 cubed:\n\n\\[ 1.08^3 = 1.08 \\times 1.1664 \\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.08 \u00d7 1.1664 =\n\nFirst, 1 \u00d7 1.1664 = 1.1664\n\nThen, 0.08 \u00d7 1.1664 = 0.093312\n\nAdded together: 1.1664 + 0.093312 = 1.259712\n\nSo, 1.08^3 = 1.259712\n\nNext, 1.08 to the power of 4:\n\n1.08^4 = 1.08 \u00d7 1.259712\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 \u00d7 1.259712 = 1.259712\n\n0.08 \u00d7 1.259712 = 0.10077696\n\nAdded together: 1.259712 + 0.10077696 = 1.36048896\n\nSo, 1.08^4 \u2248 1.36048896\n\nContinuing this process for higher powers would be time-consuming. Maybe I should use a calculator for this part.\n\nBut since I'm writing this explanation, I'll assume that I have a calculator available for the computations.\n\nCalculating 1.08^10:\n\n1.08^10 \u2248 2.158925\n\nNow, subtract 1 from that:\n\n2.158925 - 1 = 1.158925\n\nThen divide by the interest rate, which is 0.08:\n\n1.158925 / 0.08 = 14.4865625\n\nFinally, multiply by the annuity payment:\n\nFV = 2500 \u00d7 14.4865625 = $36,216.41\n\nLooking back at the options, C. $36,216 is the closest to my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if I did the calculations correctly.\n\nFirst, confirm 1.08^10:\n\n1.08^10 = 2.158925... that seems right.\n\nThen, 2.158925 - 1 = 1.158925\n\nDivide by 0.08:\n\n1.158925 / 0.08 = 14.4865625\n\nMultiply by $2,500:\n\n2500 \u00d7 14.4865625 = $36,216.41\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the future value annuity due formula, but since it's an ordinary annuity, payments are at the end of each period, so the formula I used should be correct.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the future value manually by summing the future values of each individual payment.\n\nFor example, the first payment earns interest for 10 periods, the second for 9, and so on, down to the last payment which earns no interest.\n\nSo, the future value would be:\n\nFV = $2,500 \u00d7 (1.08)^10 + $2,500 \u00d7 (1.08)^9 + ... + $2,500 \u00d7 (1.08)^1 + $2,500 \u00d7 (1.08)^0\n\nThis is essentially the same as the formula I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which is:\n\n\\[ S_n = a \\times \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since it's an ordinary annuity, the formula I used is more straightforward and directly applicable.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the correct answer is $36,216.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any trick or additional consideration I might have missed.\n\nFor instance, does the term \"deposit period\" imply anything different from the number of years? Probably not; it seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, is the interest compounded annually? The problem doesn't specify otherwise, so I'll assume it's annual compounding.\n\nIf it were compounded more frequently, I'd need to adjust the formula accordingly, but for now, I'll stick with annual compounding.\n\nTherefore, the future value of the annuity for case A is $36,216.\n\nSo, the correct choice is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
