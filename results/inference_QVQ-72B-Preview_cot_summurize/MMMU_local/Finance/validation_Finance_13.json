                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I've got the stockholders' equity section for Golden Mine, Inc. for the years 2014 and 2015, and I need to figure out how and why the total stockholders' equity increased from $2,370,000 in 2014 to $9,080,000 in 2015. Also, given that the company paid total dividends of $240,000 during fiscal 2015, I need to find out the average price per share of the new stock sold in 2015. The options are A. $7.25, B. $8.75, C. $9.75, and D. $10.75.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of stockholders' equity. There's common stock, paid-in capital in excess of par, and retained earnings.\n\nStarting with common stock:\n\n- Par value is $1.00 per share.\n\n- Authorized shares are 5,000,000.\n\n- Outstanding shares are 1,200,000 in 2015 and 600,000 in 2014.\n\nSo, the common stock amount in 2014 is $600,000, which is 600,000 shares times $1 par value.\n\nIn 2015, it's $1,200,000, which is 1,200,000 shares times $1 par value.\n\nThis suggests that during 2015, the company issued an additional 600,000 shares (1,200,000 - 600,000 = 600,000).\n\nNext, paid-in capital in excess of par:\n\n- In 2014, it's $250,000.\n\n- In 2015, it's $5,500,000.\n\nSo, the increase in paid-in capital is $5,500,000 - $250,000 = $5,250,000.\n\nThis likely comes from the additional shares sold above par value.\n\nRetained earnings:\n\n- In 2014, it's $1,520,000.\n\n- In 2015, it's $2,380,000.\n\nSo, the increase in retained earnings is $2,380,000 - $1,520,000 = $860,000.\n\nGiven that the company paid dividends of $240,000 in 2015, the net increase in retained earnings would be the net income minus dividends.\n\nLet's denote net income as NI.\n\nThen, retained earnings increase = NI - dividends.\n\nSo, $860,000 = NI - $240,000.\n\nTherefore, NI = $860,000 + $240,000 = $1,100,000.\n\nNow, total stockholders' equity increased by $9,080,000 - $2,370,000 = $6,710,000.\n\nThis increase comes from two sources:\n\n1. Additional capital raised from selling new shares.\n\n2. Retained earnings increase (net income minus dividends).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the additional capital raised from selling new shares.\n\nThe common stock increased by $600,000 (from $600,000 to $1,200,000).\n\nBut since the par value is $1, this represents 600,000 shares issued.\n\nThe paid-in capital in excess of par increased by $5,250,000.\n\nSo, the total additional capital raised from selling new shares is $600,000 (common stock) + $5,250,000 (paid-in capital in excess of par) = $5,850,000.\n\nWait a minute, but if the par value is $1 per share, and 600,000 shares were issued, the total par value is $600,000, and the paid-in capital in excess of par is $5,250,000.\n\nSo, the total cash received from issuing these shares is $600,000 + $5,250,000 = $5,850,000.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated that retained earnings increased by $860,000, which is net income minus dividends.\n\nSo, total increase in equity is:\n\nIncrease from new shares: $5,850,000\n\nPlus increase from retained earnings: $860,000\n\nTotal increase: $5,850,000 + $860,000 = $6,710,000\n\nWhich matches the total increase from $2,370,000 to $9,080,000.\n\nNow, the question asks for the average price per share of the new stock sold during 2015.\n\nWe know that 600,000 new shares were issued, and the total cash received from these shares is $5,850,000.\n\nSo, average price per share = total cash received / number of shares.\n\nAverage price = $5,850,000 / 600,000 = $9.75 per share.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is $9.75.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirm the increase in common stock: 2015 - 2014 = $1,200,000 - $600,000 = $600,000.\n\nIncrease in paid-in capital: $5,500,000 - $250,000 = $5,250,000.\n\nTotal cash from new shares: $600,000 + $5,250,000 = $5,850,000.\n\nNumber of new shares: 1,200,000 - 600,000 = 600,000 shares.\n\nAverage price = $5,850,000 / 600,000 = $9.75 per share.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the average price.\n\nIs there any mention of stock splits, dividends payable in stock, or any other transactions that might impact the share count or the equity?\n\nNo, the problem only mentions the balance sheet changes and the dividend payment.\n\nTherefore, the average price per share of the new stock sold in 2015 is $9.75, which is option C.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
