I need to find the Additional Funds Needed (AFN) for the coming year. The balance sheet from December 31, 2010, is given, and there are some specifics about the company's operations that I need to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what AFN is. AFN is essentially the external financing a company needs to support its growth in sales. It's calculated based on the projected increase in assets minus the increase in spontaneous liabilities and minus the projected retained earnings.\n\nGiven that fixed assets are currently used at only 50% capacity, but current assets are at their proper levels in relation to sales, I need to account for this in my calculations.\n\nLet's start by identifying which assets and liabilities are expected to increase with sales growth.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash: $100\n\n- Accounts receivable: $200\n\n- Inventories: $200\n\n- Net fixed assets: $500\n\n- Total assets: $1,000\n\n- Accounts payable: $50\n\n- Notes payable: $150\n\n- Accruals: $50\n\n- Long-term debt: $400\n\n- Common stock: $100\n\n- Retained earnings: $250\n\n- Total liabilities and equity: $1,000\n\nNow, it's stated that all assets except fixed assets must increase at the same rate as sales. But fixed assets would also have to increase at the same rate if there wasn't excess capacity. However, since there is excess capacity (50% used), I need to determine how much additional fixed assets are needed.\n\nFirst, let's find out the relationship between sales and assets.\n\nGiven that current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventories) are at their proper levels in relation to sales, I can assume that these assets vary directly with sales.\n\nSo, for current assets:\n\n- Cash: $100 at $1,000 sales\n\n- Accounts receivable: $200 at $1,000 sales\n\n- Inventories: $200 at $1,000 sales\n\nTherefore, the ratios are:\n\n- Cash to sales: $100 / $1,000 = 0.10\n\n- Accounts receivable to sales: $200 / $1,000 = 0.20\n\n- Inventories to sales: $200 / $1,000 = 0.20\n\nSo, for the new sales level of $2,000:\n\n- Projected cash: 0.10 * $2,000 = $200\n\n- Projected accounts receivable: 0.20 * $2,000 = $400\n\n- Projected inventories: 0.20 * $2,000 = $400\n\nNow, for fixed assets:\n\nThe company is using only 50% of its capacity. The current net fixed assets are $500, and that's at 50% capacity. So, total capacity is $500 / 0.50 = $1,000.\n\nNow, if sales double to $2,000, and assuming that capacity needs to double to meet the new sales level, but considering that fixed assets are currently at $500 for $1,000 capacity, I need to see how much additional fixed assets are needed.\n\nWait a minute, I need to think carefully here.\n\nIf current net fixed assets are $500 and that supports $1,000 sales at 50% capacity, then full capacity is $1,000.\n\nBut sales are doubling to $2,000, which would require double the capacity, i.e., $2,000 capacity.\n\nGiven that current net fixed assets support $1,000 capacity, to support $2,000 capacity, net fixed assets would need to be $500 * 2 = $1,000.\n\nTherefore, additional net fixed assets needed are $1,000 - $500 = $500.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf $500 in net fixed assets support $1,000 capacity, then to support $2,000 capacity, it would indeed require $1,000 in net fixed assets. So, yes, additional net fixed assets needed are $500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is operating at 50% capacity at $1,000 sales, then full capacity is $2,000 sales, and since they're only using $500 in net fixed assets to achieve $1,000 sales, to reach full capacity ($2,000 sales), they would need to invest another $500 in net fixed assets.\n\nEither way, it seems that additional net fixed assets needed are $500.\n\nNow, let's look at the liabilities and equity side.\n\nAccounts payable: $50\n\nNotes payable: $150\n\nAccruals: $50\n\nLong-term debt: $400\n\nCommon stock: $100\n\nRetained earnings: $250\n\nTotal liabilities and equity: $1,000\n\nI need to determine which liabilities will increase spontaneously with sales.\n\nAccounts payable and accruals are typically spontaneous liabilities that vary with sales.\n\nSo, accounts payable: $50 at $1,000 sales, ratio = 0.05\n\nAccruals: $50 at $1,000 sales, ratio = 0.05\n\nTherefore, projected spontaneous increases in liabilities:\n\n- Accounts payable: 0.05 * $2,000 = $100\n\n- Accruals: 0.05 * $2,000 = $100\n\nTotal spontaneous increase in liabilities: $100 + $100 = $200\n\nNotes payable and long-term debt are likely not spontaneous increases, so I won't include them in the spontaneous liability increases.\n\nNow, common stock is existing equity, and retained earnings are earnings retained from previous periods.\n\nThe company's after-tax profit margin is forecasted to be 5%, and the payout ratio is 60%.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net income for the projected sales of $2,000.\n\nNet income = sales * profit margin = $2,000 * 0.05 = $100\n\nRetained earnings = net income * (1 - payout ratio) = $100 * (1 - 0.60) = $100 * 0.40 = $40\n\nSo, internal equity generation (retained earnings addition) = $40\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nProjected increase in assets:\n\n- Current assets: cash + accounts receivable + inventories = $200 + $400 + $400 = $1,000\n\n- Fixed assets: $500 (additional needed)\n\nTotal assets increase: $1,000 + $500 = $1,500\n\nProjected spontaneous increase in liabilities: $200\n\nProjected internal equity generation: $40\n\nTherefore, AFN = Increase in assets - Increase in spontaneous liabilities - Internal equity generation\n\nAFN = $1,500 - $200 - $40 = $1,260\n\nWait, but I should double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes AFN is calculated as:\n\nAFN = (A*/S0) * \u0394S - (L*/S0) * \u0394S - Retained Earnings\n\nWhere:\n\nA* = assets that vary directly with sales\n\nL* = spontaneous liabilities that vary directly with sales\n\nS0 = base sales\n\n\u0394S = change in sales\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the numbers:\n\nA* = current assets + fixed assets that need to increase\n\nCurrent assets: cash + accounts receivable + inventories = $100 + $200 + $200 = $500\n\nFixed assets to increase: $500 (as calculated earlier)\n\nSo, A* = $500 + $500 = $1,000\n\nL* = accounts payable + accruals = $50 + $50 = $100\n\nS0 = $1,000\n\n\u0394S = $2,000 - $1,000 = $1,000\n\nRetained Earnings = $40 (as calculated earlier)\n\nTherefore:\n\nAFN = ($1,000 / $1,000) * $1,000 - ($100 / $1,000) * $1,000 - $40\n\nAFN = (1 * $1,000) - (0.1 * $1,000) - $40\n\nAFN = $1,000 - $100 - $40 = $860\n\nWait a minute, earlier I got $1,260, but now I'm getting $860. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the first method, I added the increase in fixed assets to the increase in current assets to get the total assets increase, then subtracted the increase in spontaneous liabilities and the internal equity generation.\n\nIn the second method, I used the AFN formula directly.\n\nThe difference is in the calculation of A*.\n\nIn the first method, I calculated the projected increase in current assets as $1,000 (cash + receivables + inventories) and added the additional fixed assets needed ($500), totaling $1,500.\n\nIn the second method, I considered A* as the total assets that vary with sales, which is current assets plus the portion of fixed assets that vary with sales.\n\nGiven that fixed assets are currently at $500 for $1,000 sales, and full capacity is $1,000 in fixed assets for $2,000 sales, then the relationship is $500 in fixed assets for $1,000 sales.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nIf fixed assets are $500 at $1,000 sales, and sales are doubling to $2,000, then fixed assets should double to $1,000, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, A* should be current assets plus fixed assets that vary with sales.\n\nGiven that, A* should be $500 (current assets) + $500 (fixed assets) = $1,000, which is what I used in the second method.\n\nBut in the first method, I calculated the projected increase in current assets as $200 + $400 + $400 = $1,000, and the increase in fixed assets as $500, totaling $1,500.\n\nWait, but in the AFN formula, it's (A*/S0)*\u0394S, which is ($1,000 / $1,000)*$1,000 = $1,000.\n\nBut in the first method, I have $1,000 (increase in current assets) plus $500 (increase in fixed assets) = $1,500.\n\nThere's inconsistency here.\n\nI think the confusion is in understanding whether fixed assets are part of A* or not.\n\nLet me refer back to the problem statement:\n\n\"All assets except fixed assets must increase at the same rate as sales, and fixed assets would also have to increase at the same rate if the current excess capacity did not exist.\"\n\nGiven that fixed assets are currently at 50% capacity, meaning that to double sales, fixed assets need to double from $500 to $1,000, requiring an additional $500.\n\nTherefore, fixed assets do vary with sales, and thus should be included in A*.\n\nTherefore, A* should include both current assets and fixed assets that vary with sales.\n\nGiven that, A* = current assets + fixed assets = $500 + $500 = $1,000.\n\nL* = spontaneous liabilities = $100.\n\nS0 = $1,000.\n\n\u0394S = $1,000.\n\nRetained earnings = $40.\n\nTherefore, AFN = ($1,000 / $1,000)*$1,000 - ($100 / $1,000)*$1,000 - $40 = $1,000 - $100 - $40 = $860.\n\nThis seems consistent now.\n\nEarlier, in the first method, I added the increases separately, which might not be the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct AFN should be $860.\n\nSo, the answer is $860.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{860} \\]"

The current net fixed assets are $500, and that's at 50% capacity. So, total capacity is $500 / 0.50 = $1,000.\n\nNow, if sales double to $2,000, and assuming that capacity needs to double to meet the new sales level, but considering that fixed assets are currently at $500 for $1,000 capacity, I need to see how much additional fixed assets are needed.\n\nWait a minute, I need to think carefully here.\n\nIf current net fixed assets are $500 and that supports $1,000 sales at 50% capacity, then full capacity is $1,000.\n\nBut sales are doubling to $2,000, which would require double the capacity, i.e., $2,000 capacity.\n\nGiven that current net fixed assets support $1,000 capacity, to support $2,000 capacity, net fixed assets would need to be $500 * 2 = $1,000.\n\nTherefore, additional net fixed assets needed are $1,000 - $500 = $500.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf $500 in net fixed assets support $1,000 capacity, then to support $2,000 capacity, it would indeed require $1,000 in net fixed assets. So, yes, additional net fixed assets needed are $500.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, if the company is operating at 50% capacity at $1,000 sales, then full capacity is $2,000 sales, and since they're only using $500 in net fixed assets to achieve $1,000 sales, to reach full capacity ($2,000 sales), they would need to invest another $500 in net fixed assets.\n\nEither way, it seems that additional net fixed assets needed are $500.\n\nNow, let's look at the liabilities and equity side.\n\nAccounts payable: $50\n\nNotes payable: $150\n\nAccruals: $50\n\nLong-term debt: $400\n\nCommon stock: $100\n\nRetained earnings: $250\n\nTotal liabilities and equity: $1,000\n\nI need to determine which liabilities will increase spontaneously with sales.\n\nAccounts payable and accruals are typically spontaneous liabilities that vary with sales.\n\nSo, accounts payable: $50 at $1,000 sales, ratio = 0.05\n\nAccruals: $50 at $1,000 sales, ratio = 0.05\n\nTherefore, projected spontaneous increases in liabilities:\n\n- Accounts payable: 0.05 * $2,000 = $100\n\n- Accruals: 0.05 * $2,000 = $100\n\nTotal spontaneous increase in liabilities: $100 + $100 = $200\n\nNotes payable and long-term debt are likely not spontaneous increases, so I won't include them in the spontaneous liability increases.\n\nNow, common stock is existing equity, and retained earnings are earnings retained from previous periods.\n\nThe company's after-tax profit margin is forecasted to be 5%, and the payout ratio is 60%.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net income for the projected sales of $2,000.\n\nNet income = sales * profit margin = $2,000 * 0.05 = $100\n\nRetained earnings = net income * (1 - payout ratio) = $100 * (1 - 0.60) = $100 * 0.40 = $40\n\nSo, internal equity generation (retained earnings addition) = $40\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nProjected increase in assets:\n\n- Current assets: cash + accounts receivable + inventories = $200 + $400 + $400 = $1,000\n\n- Fixed assets: $500 (additional needed)\n\nTotal assets increase: $1,000 + $500 = $1,500\n\nProjected spontaneous increase in liabilities: $200\n\nProjected internal equity generation: $40\n\nTherefore, AFN = Increase in assets - Increase in spontaneous liabilities - Internal equity generation\n\nAFN = $1,500 - $200 - $40 = $1,260\n\nWait, but I should double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes AFN is calculated as:\n\nAFN = (A*/S0) * \u0394S - (L*/S0) * \u0394S - Retained Earnings\n\nWhere:\n\nA* = assets that vary directly with sales\n\nL* = spontaneous liabilities that vary directly with sales\n\nS0 = base sales\n\n\u0394S = change in sales\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the numbers:\n\nA* = current assets + fixed assets that need to increase\n\nCurrent assets: cash + accounts receivable + inventories = $100 + $200 + $200 = $500\n\nFixed assets to increase: $500 (as calculated earlier)\n\nSo, A* = $500 + $500 = $1,000\n\nL* = accounts payable + accruals = $50 + $50 = $100\n\nS0 = $1,000\n\n\u0394S = $2,000 - $1,000 = $1,000\n\nRetained Earnings = $40 (as calculated earlier)\n\nTherefore:\n\nAFN = ($1,000 / $1,000) * $1,000 - ($100 / $1,000) * $1,000 - $40\n\nAFN = (1 * $1,000) - (0.1 * $1,000) - $40\n\nAFN = $1,000 - $100 - $40 = $860\n\nWait a minute, earlier I got $1,260, but now I'm getting $860.
