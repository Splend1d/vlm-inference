                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I'm looking at the acquisition of Denham by Corton Inc., and I've got some financial data for both companies. There's information about forecast earnings per share, forecast dividend per share, the number of shares, and the stock prices for both Corton and Denham. Additionally, there's a mention about expected growth rates for Denham's earnings and dividends, which are currently at 6%, but under new management, they could increase to 8% without needing additional capital.\n\nThe question is asking how the cost of the share offer would change if the expected growth rate wasn't changed by the merger. It provides four options: $3,000,000, $4,000,000, $4,500,000, or $5,000,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. The \"cost of the share offer\" likely refers to the total amount Corton would need to pay to acquire Denham, using shares as the currency. So, if Corton is offering shares to Denham's shareholders in exchange for Denham's shares, the cost would be based on the number of Denham shares and the exchange ratio or the price per share offered.\n\nGiven that, I need to calculate the total cost of this acquisition under the current expectations and then see how it changes if the growth rate remains at 6% instead of increasing to 8%.\n\nBut before jumping into that, I should probably understand how the stock prices are related to the growth rates. The stock price of a company can be related to its earnings and dividends, and the expected growth rates play a role in determining those prices.\n\nLet me recall some basic valuation formulas. One common way to value a stock is using the Gordon Growth Model, which is a dividend discount model that assumes dividends grow at a constant rate. The formula for the stock price using this model is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{\\text{Dividend}}{\\text{Required Return} - \\text{Growth Rate}} \\]\n\nIn this problem, I have the forecast dividend per share and the stock price for both companies. For Denham, I know that investors expect a 6% growth in earnings and dividends. So, perhaps the stock price of Denham is based on this 6% growth rate.\n\nLet me see if I can use this model to confirm Denham's stock price. Given:\n\n- Forecast dividend per share for Denham: $0.80\n\n- Growth rate: 6% (0.06)\n\n- Stock price: $20\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ 20 = \\frac{0.80}{\\text{Required Return} - 0.06} \\]\n\nSolving for the required return:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required Return} - 0.06 = \\frac{0.80}{20} = 0.04 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Required Return} = 0.04 + 0.06 = 0.10 \\text{ or } 10\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required return for Denham is 10%.\n\nSimilarly, for Corton:\n\n- Forecast dividend per share: $3.00\n\n- Stock price: $90\n\nBut I don't know Corton's growth rate. However, since the problem mentions that under new management, Denham's growth rate would increase to 8%, perhaps I can assume that Corton's growth rate is higher, but that's not directly stated.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The problem seems to be focusing on the acquisition of Denham by Corton and how the expected growth rate affects the valuation.\n\nLet me consider that if Denham's growth rate increases from 6% to 8%, this should lead to an increase in its stock price, which in turn affects the cost of the acquisition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Corton is offering a certain number of shares for each Denham share, based on the relative valuations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the current cost of acquiring Denham based on its stock price and the number of shares outstanding.\n\nDenham has 600,000 shares outstanding, and each share is priced at $20. So, the total acquisition cost would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 600,000 \\times 20 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nSo, $12,000,000 is the current cost to acquire Denham.\n\nBut the options provided are much lower than that, ranging from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000. This suggests that the cost isn't simply the market capitalization of Denham.\n\nPerhaps Corton is offering a certain number of its shares for each Denham share, and the exchange ratio is based on the relative P/E ratios or dividend yields.\n\nLet me consider the P/E ratios. The P/E ratio is Price per share divided by Earnings per share.\n\nFor Corton:\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E} = \\frac{90}{5.00} = 18 \\]\n\nFor Denham:\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E} = \\frac{20}{1.50} \\approx 13.33 \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use these P/E ratios to determine the exchange ratio or the cost of the acquisition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is determined based on the present value of future cash flows, considering the growth rate.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that under new management, Denham's growth rate would increase to 8%, and no additional capital is needed. So, maybe Corton is offering a premium based on this expected higher growth.\n\nBut the question is asking for the cost of the share offer if the expected growth rate was not changed by the merger, meaning the growth rate remains at 6%.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to recalculate Denham's value based on a 6% growth rate instead of 8%.\n\nLet me try to approach this using the Gordon Growth Model again.\n\nFirst, with a 6% growth rate, Denham's stock price is $20, as given.\n\nIf the growth rate remains at 6%, and the required return is 10%, as I calculated earlier, then the stock price should still be $20.\n\nBut if the growth rate increases to 8%, the stock price would change.\n\nLet me recalculate the stock price with an 8% growth rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10 - 0.08} = \\frac{0.80}{0.02} = 40 \\]\n\nSo, if the growth rate increases to 8%, Denham's stock price should be $40 per share.\n\nTherefore, if Corton's acquisition leads to an 8% growth rate, Denham's shareholders would expect a higher price per share, say $40 instead of $20.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the cost of the share offer if the growth rate is not changed, meaning it stays at 6%, so the stock price remains at $20.\n\nGiven that, the cost of acquiring Denham would be 600,000 shares times $20, which is $12,000,000, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the provided options, which are much lower.\n\nPerhaps the acquisition isn't being valued based on Denham's current stock price but on some other basis, like its intrinsic value or some multiple of earnings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Corton is offering a certain number of its shares for each Denham share, and the exchange ratio is based on the relative stock prices.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf Corton's stock is priced at $90 per share, and Denham's at $20 per share, perhaps there's an exchange ratio where one Denham share is exchanged for a certain number of Corton shares.\n\nFor example, if the exchange ratio is 1 Denham share for X Corton shares, then the cost would be X times $90 per Corton share.\n\nBut I don't have information about the exchange ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is based on the present value of Denham's future dividends at a 6% growth rate.\n\nLet me try to calculate that.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{\\text{Dividend}}{\\text{Required Return} - \\text{Growth Rate}} \\]\n\nI already have Denham's stock price at $20 with a 6% growth rate and a required return of 10%.\n\nBut if I use the formula again with the same growth rate and required return, I get back to $20.\n\nSo, the total cost would still be 600,000 shares times $20, which is $12,000,000.\n\nThis doesn't align with the provided options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the number of shares Corton needs to issue to acquire Denham.\n\nIf Corton is offering its shares in exchange for Denham's shares, the number of Corton shares issued would be the number of Denham shares divided by the exchange ratio.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exchange ratio, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is expressed in terms of the number of Corton shares needed to acquire Denham, and then valued based on Corton's stock price.\n\nWait, maybe the cost is the number of Corton shares needed to acquire Denham, multiplied by Corton's stock price.\n\nGiven that, if Corton issues, say, Y shares to acquire Denham, the cost would be Y times $90.\n\nBut I need to find Y.\n\nTo find Y, I need to know the exchange ratio.\n\nSuppose Corton offers X Corton shares for each Denham share.\n\nThen, the total number of Corton shares issued would be:\n\n\\[ Y = 600,000 \\times X \\]\n\nAnd the cost would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = Y \\times 90 = 600,000 \\times X \\times 90 \\]\n\nBut I don't know X.\n\nPerhaps I can find X by equating the stock prices.\n\nIf Corton is offering X shares for each Denham share, then the value received by Denham shareholders per share is X times $90.\n\nThis should be equal to the value of one Denham share, which is $20.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ X \\times 90 = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{20}{90} \\approx 0.2222 \\]\n\nTherefore, the exchange ratio is approximately 0.2222 Corton shares for each Denham share.\n\nThen, the total number of Corton shares issued would be:\n\n\\[ Y = 600,000 \\times 0.2222 \\approx 133,320 \\]\n\nAnd the cost would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 133,320 \\times 90 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nAgain, this brings me back to $12,000,000, which isn't among the options.\n\nThis suggests that I might be missing something in my approach.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Perhaps the cost is based on the present value of Denham's earnings, considering the growth rate.\n\nGiven that, maybe I need to use the earnings per share instead of the dividend per share.\n\nFor Denham, the forecast earnings per share is $1.50.\n\nIf the growth rate is 6%, and the required return is 10%, the stock price per share would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{1.50}{0.10 - 0.06} = \\frac{1.50}{0.04} = 37.50 \\]\n\nWait, but earlier, using the dividend discount model, with a dividend of $0.80, I got $20.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nPerhaps I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock price is based on the dividend yield.\n\nLet me calculate the dividend yield for Denham:\n\n\\[ \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\frac{0.80}{20} = 0.04 \\text{ or } 4\\% \\]\n\nSimilarly, for Corton:\n\n\\[ \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\frac{3.00}{90} \\approx 0.0333 \\text{ or } 3.33\\% \\]\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nMaybe I should consider the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nFor Denham:\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E} = \\frac{20}{1.50} \\approx 13.33 \\]\n\nFor Corton:\n\n\\[ \\text{P/E} = \\frac{90}{5.00} = 18 \\]\n\nPerhaps the acquisition is being valued based on P/E multiples.\n\nIf Corton is acquiring Denham, maybe it's offering a certain P/E multiple for Denham's earnings.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exchange ratio or the premium, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the cost is not simply the market capitalization of Denham, but rather the value based on the growth rate.\n\nLet me think about the present value of Denham's future earnings if the growth rate remains at 6%.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model for earnings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{\\text{Earnings per Share}}{\\text{Required Return} - \\text{Growth Rate}} = \\frac{1.50}{0.10 - 0.06} = \\frac{1.50}{0.04} = 37.50 \\]\n\nSo, if the growth rate remains at 6%, Denham's intrinsic value per share is $37.50.\n\nTherefore, the total value of Denham would be:\n\n\\[ 600,000 \\times 37.50 = 22,500,000 \\]\n\nBut this is higher than any of the provided options.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is still off.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the present value of future dividends instead of earnings.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model for dividends:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10 - 0.06} = \\frac{0.80}{0.04} = 20 \\]\n\nWhich matches Denham's current stock price of $20.\n\nIf the growth rate remains at 6%, then the stock price should still be $20.\n\nTherefore, the cost of acquiring Denham would be:\n\n\\[ 600,000 \\times 20 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nBut since this doesn't match the options, maybe I need to consider the cost in terms of Corton's shares.\n\nIf Corton is offering its shares to acquire Denham, the cost would be the number of Corton shares issued times Corton's stock price.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, if the exchange ratio is approximately 0.2222 Corton shares per Denham share, then:\n\n\\[ Y = 600,000 \\times 0.2222 \\approx 133,320 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 133,320 \\times 90 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nStill, this doesn't match the options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the acquisition involves a premium over the current stock price.\n\nLet's assume that Corton is offering a certain premium to Denham's shareholders to make the acquisition attractive.\n\nSuppose the premium is X%, then the offer price per share would be:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times (1 + X\\%) \\]\n\nThen, the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 600,000 \\times 20 \\times (1 + X\\%) \\]\n\nBut without knowing X%, this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is based on the present value of Denham's future dividends at a different growth rate.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that under new management, the growth rate would increase to 8% without needing additional capital.\n\nBut the question is asking for the cost if the growth rate is not changed by the merger, meaning it stays at 6%.\n\nSo, perhaps the cost is based on the present value of Denham's future dividends at a 6% growth rate.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model:\n\n\\[ \\text{Stock Price} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10 - 0.06} = 20 \\]\n\nAgain, leading back to $12,000,000.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the options are incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is expressed in terms of the number of Corton shares needed to acquire Denham, and the value is based on Corton's stock price.\n\nIf Corton is offering, say, 0.2222 of its shares for each Denham share, as I calculated earlier, then the total number of Corton shares issued would be:\n\n\\[ 600,000 \\times 0.2222 \\approx 133,320 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 133,320 \\times 90 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the acquisition is structured differently, or that there are synergies or other factors affecting the valuation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is based on the book value or some other metric not provided here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to look back at the options and see if any of them could make sense.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. the cost of merger through stocks offer is $3,000,000\n\nB. the cost of merger through stocks offer is $4,000,000\n\nC. the cost of merger through stocks offer is $4,500,000\n\nD. the cost of merger through stocks offer is $5,000,000\n\nNone of these match the $12,000,000 I've been calculating.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question or missing a key piece of information.\n\nLet me try to re-read the question carefully.\n\n\"The cost of the share offer change if the expected growth rate was not changed by the merger?\"\n\nIt seems like the problem is asking for the cost of the share offer under the condition that the growth rate remains at 6%, compared to if it were to increase to 8%.\n\nPerhaps the original cost was calculated assuming an 8% growth rate, and now we need to find the cost assuming a 6% growth rate.\n\nIn that case, if the growth rate is 6%, the stock price should be"
