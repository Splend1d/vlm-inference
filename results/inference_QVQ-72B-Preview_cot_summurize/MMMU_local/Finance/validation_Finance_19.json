                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that asks for the standard deviation of a random variable q with a given probability distribution. The table provided shows three values for q: 0, 1, and 2, with their corresponding probabilities: 0.25, 0.25, and 0.50, respectively. The options for the standard deviation are A. 0.9397, B. 0.9492, C. 0.8292, and D. 0.8194.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what standard deviation is and how to calculate it for a probability distribution. I recall that the standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the random variable from its mean. So, to find the standard deviation, I need to find the mean first and then see how much each value deviates from that mean, taking into account the probabilities.\n\nLet me start by calculating the mean (\u03bc) of the random variable q. The formula for the mean in a probability distribution is:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\sum (q \\times P(q))\n\\]\n\nWhere q are the values of the random variable and P(q) are their corresponding probabilities.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = (0 \\times 0.25) + (1 \\times 0.25) + (2 \\times 0.50) = 0 + 0.25 + 1.00 = 1.25\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the mean is 1.25.\n\nNext, I need to find the variance (\u03c3\u00b2), which is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean. The formula for variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\sum [(q - \\mu)^2 \\times P(q)]\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, find (q - \u03bc) for each value:\n\n- For q = 0: 0 - 1.25 = -1.25\n\n- For q = 1: 1 - 1.25 = -0.25\n\n- For q = 2: 2 - 1.25 = 0.75\n\nThen, square these deviations:\n\n- (-1.25)^2 = 1.5625\n\n- (-0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\n- (0.75)^2 = 0.5625\n\nNow, multiply each squared deviation by the corresponding probability:\n\n- 1.5625 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.390625\n\n- 0.0625 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.015625\n\n- 0.5625 \u00d7 0.50 = 0.28125\n\nFinally, sum these products to get the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = 0.390625 + 0.015625 + 0.28125 = 0.6875\n\\]\n\nNow, the standard deviation (\u03c3) is the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{0.6875}\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that. First, I know that 0.8^2 = 0.64 and 0.9^2 = 0.81. So, it's between 0.8 and 0.9. Let me use a calculator for more precision.\n\nWait, since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can check which option squares to approximately 0.6875.\n\nLet's see, option C is 0.8292. Let's square that:\n\n0.8292^2 = ?\n\nWell, 0.8^2 = 0.64\n\n0.0292^2 = approximately 0.00085 (but I should calculate it properly)\n\n2 * 0.8 * 0.0292 = 0.04672\n\nSo, 0.64 + 0.04672 + 0.00085 \u2248 0.68757\n\nHmm, that's close to 0.6875.\n\nAlternatively, let's check option D: 0.8194\n\n0.8194^2 = ?\n\n8^2 = 64\n\n0.194^2 = approximately 0.0037636\n\n2 * 0.8 * 0.194 = 0.3104\n\nSo, 0.64 + 0.3104 + 0.0037636 \u2248 0.9541636, which is not close to 0.6875.\n\nOption A: 0.9397\n\n0.9397^2 should be around 0.8832 (since 0.9^2 = 0.81 and 0.0397^2 is roughly 0.0016, plus 2*0.9*0.0397 = 0.07146, so 0.81 + 0.07146 + 0.0016 \u2248 0.88306)\n\nThat's not close to 0.6875.\n\nOption B: 0.9492\n\n0.9492^2 = ?\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n0.0492^2 \u2248 0.00242064\n\n2 * 0.9 * 0.0492 = 0.08856\n\nSo, 0.81 + 0.08856 + 0.00242064 \u2248 0.89998064, which is also not close to 0.6875.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the closest, as its square is approximately 0.6875.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I calculated the mean \u03bc = 1.25, which seems correct.\n\nThen, the variance \u03c3\u00b2 = 0.6875, which also seems right.\n\nThen, the standard deviation \u03c3 = \u221a0.6875.\n\nLet me calculate \u221a0.6875 more accurately.\n\nI know that 0.8^2 = 0.64\n\n0.82^2 = 0.6724\n\n0.83^2 = 0.6889\n\nSo, 0.8292^2 = ?\n\nLet me calculate it properly:\n\n0.8292^2 = 0.8292 \u00d7 0.8292\n\nFirst, 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.64\n\nThen, 0.8 \u00d7 0.0292 = 0.02336\n\nSimilarly, 0.0292 \u00d7 0.0292 = approximately 0.00085\n\nSo, total is 0.64 + 0.02336 + 0.02336 + 0.00085 = approximately 0.68752\n\nYes, that matches the variance of 0.6875.\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation is indeed approximately 0.8292.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 0.8292\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
