                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a table with some interest rates and exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and the Lilliputian nano. The spot exchange rate is 15 nanos per dollar. We need to find the dollar interest rate for 1 year, and there are a few missing values in the table that probably need to be filled in to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table and see what we know and what we don't know.\n\n|           | 1 Month | 3 Months | 1 Year |\n|-----------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Dollar interest rate (annually compounded) | 4.0 | 4.5 | ? |\n| Nano interest rate (annually compounded) | 8.2 | ? | 9.8 |\n| Forward nanos per dollar | ? | ? | 15.6 |\n| Forward discount on nano (% per year) | ? | 4.8 | ? |\n\nAnd the spot rate is 15 nanos per dollar.\n\nOkay, so we have some known values and some unknowns. It seems like we need to use the relationships between interest rates and forward exchange rates to find the missing values, particularly the 1-year dollar interest rate.\n\nI recall that there's a relationship between interest rates and forward exchange rates called interest rate parity. The formula for interest rate parity is:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) * (F / S)\n\nWhere:\n\n- r_d is the domestic interest rate (dollar interest rate)\n\n- r_f is the foreign interest rate (nano interest rate)\n\n- F is the forward exchange rate\n\n- S is the spot exchange rate\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use this formula to fill in some of the missing values.\n\nFirst, let's consider the 1-year values since that's what the question is asking about directly.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Dollar interest rate for 1 year: ?\n\n- Nano interest rate for 1 year: 9.8%\n\n- Forward nanos per dollar for 1 year: 15.6\n\n- Forward discount on nano for 1 year: ?\n\nAnd the spot rate is 15 nanos per dollar.\n\nMaybe I can plug into the interest rate parity formula for 1 year:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + 9.8%) * (15.6 / 15)\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1 + 9.8% = 1 + 0.098 = 1.098\n\nThen, 15.6 / 15 = 1.04\n\nSo, 1 + r_d = 1.098 * 1.04\n\nLet's multiply that:\n\n1.098 * 1.04 = 1.14392\n\nThen, r_d = 1.14392 - 1 = 0.14392 or 14.392%\n\nSo, the 1-year dollar interest rate would be approximately 14.39%.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them are 14.39. The closest is 15.18%, but that's not quite matching. Maybe I need to check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the compounding frequency. The interest rates are annually compounded, so for 1 year, it's straightforward. But just to be sure, let's confirm.\n\nIf the interest is compounded annually, then for 1 year, the formula should hold directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to find the relationship between the interest rates and the forward rates.\n\nLet me think about the forward discount formula. The forward discount on nano is given for 3 months, but not for 1 year. Maybe I can find a relationship there.\n\nThe forward discount formula is:\n\nForward discount = (Spot rate - Forward rate) / Spot rate * 100%\n\nBut in the table, it's given as forward discount on nano, which might be the opposite, i.e., (Forward rate - Spot rate) / Forward rate * 100%.\n\nI need to clarify that.\n\nLooking back, the table says \"forward discount on nano (% per year)\", so it's likely expressed in terms of nano.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the percentage discount on the nano in the forward market, meaning the dollar is at a premium in the forward market.\n\nGiven that, maybe the formula should be:\n\nForward discount on nano = (Spot rate - Forward rate) / Forward rate * 100%\n\nLet's assume that.\n\nFor 3 months, the forward discount on nano is 4.8% per year.\n\nGiven that, and assuming 3 months is 1/4 of a year, but need to adjust for the annual rate.\n\nWait, the forward discount is given per year, but the time period is 3 months, so perhaps it's already annualized.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick to the interest rate parity formula and see if I can find another way to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between the forward rate and the interest rates to find the missing values.\n\nLet me try to find the missing nano interest rate for 3 months.\n\nGiven that the forward discount on nano for 3 months is 4.8% per year, and assuming it's for the 3-month period, I can find the forward rate for 3 months and then use it to find the missing nano interest rate.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm how the forward discount is defined.\n\nIf forward discount on nano is (Spot rate - Forward rate) / Forward rate * 100%, then for 3 months, given the spot rate is 15, and the forward discount is 4.8% per year, I can find the forward rate for 3 months.\n\nGiven that 3 months is 1/4 of a year, the discount for 3 months would be 4.8% * (3/12) = 1.2%.\n\nSo, Forward rate = Spot rate * (1 - discount) = 15 * (1 - 0.012) = 15 * 0.988 = approximately 14.82\n\nNow, using interest rate parity for 3 months:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) * (F / S)\n\nWhere r_d is the 3-month dollar interest rate, r_f is the 3-month nano interest rate, F is the forward rate, and S is the spot rate.\n\nGiven that, plug in the known values.\n\nFor 3 months:\n\nr_d = 4.5% (from the table)\n\nF = approximately 14.82\n\nS = 15\n\nr_f = ?\n\nSo:\n\n1 + 0.045 = (1 + r_f) * (14.82 / 15)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.045 = (1 + r_f) * (14.82 / 15)\n\nFirst, calculate 14.82 / 15:\n\n14.82 \u00f7 15 = 0.988\n\nSo:\n\n1.045 = (1 + r_f) * 0.988\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.988:\n\n1.045 / 0.988 \u2248 1.0577\n\nSo, 1 + r_f \u2248 1.0577\n\nTherefore, r_f \u2248 0.0577 or 5.77%\n\nSo, the 3-month nano interest rate is approximately 5.77%.\n\nNow, looking back at the table, the 3-month nano interest rate is missing, and we've just calculated it as approximately 5.77%.\n\nBut the table shows the nano interest rate for 1 month is 8.2%, and for 1 year is 9.8%. Wait, that seems inconsistent because typically, interest rates increase with longer maturities.\n\nWait, perhaps the nano interest rates are expressed differently. Maybe they are not directly comparable to the dollar interest rates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the compounding frequency for the different time periods.\n\nGiven that the interest rates are annually compounded, I need to adjust them for different time periods.\n\nFor example, for 1 month, which is 1/12 of a year, the annually compounded rate is given, so the effective monthly rate would be (1 + annual rate)^(1/12) - 1.\n\nBut since the rates are already given as annually compounded, perhaps I need to use them directly in the interest rate parity formula.\n\nLet me try to re-examine the interest rate parity formula for different time periods.\n\nFor 1 month:\n\nGiven r_d = 4.0% per year, r_f = 8.2% per year, F = ?, S = 15\n\nFor 3 months:\n\nr_d = 4.5% per year, r_f = ?, F = ?, S = 15\n\nFor 1 year:\n\nr_d = ?, r_f = 9.8% per year, F = 15.6, S = 15\n\nOur goal is to find the 1-year dollar interest rate, which is the missing value in the table.\n\nFrom the interest rate parity formula:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) * (F / S)\n\nFor 1 year:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + 0.098) * (15.6 / 15)\n\nCalculate right-hand side:\n\n(1.098) * (15.6 / 15) = 1.098 * 1.04 = 1.14392\n\nTherefore, 1 + r_d = 1.14392\n\nSo, r_d = 1.14392 - 1 = 0.14392 or 14.392%\n\nEarlier, I thought this was approximately 14.39%, but looking back at the options, none match this value. The closest is 15.18%, but that's higher.\n\nMaybe I need to consider more precise calculations or check if there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forward discount on nano can be used to find the missing values.\n\nGiven that for 3 months, the forward discount on nano is 4.8% per year, I can use that to find the forward rate for 3 months and then use interest rate parity to find the missing nano interest rate.\n\nWait, I already did that earlier and found the 3-month nano interest rate to be approximately 5.77%.\n\nBut perhaps I need to use this to find the missing forward rates for 1 month and 3 months.\n\nGiven that, for 1 year, the forward rate is given as 15.6, and the spot rate is 15, the forward discount on nano would be:\n\nForward discount = (Spot - Forward) / Forward * 100% = (15 - 15.6) / 15.6 * 100% = (-0.6)/15.6 * 100% \u2248 -3.84%\n\nSo, a premium of 3.84% per year.\n\nWait, but the table shows forward discount on nano, which is positive for 3 months, but for 1 year, it's negative, meaning forward premium.\n\nSo, for 1 year, forward discount is -3.84%, meaning forward premium.\n\nNow, perhaps I can use the relationship between interest rates and forward premiums or discounts.\n\nThere's a formula that relates the interest rate differential to the forward premium or discount:\n\nForward premium or discount (%) = (F - S) / S * 100% = (r_f - r_d) / (1 + r_d) * 100%\n\nBut I need to check the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the covered interest arbitrage approach.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can set up an arbitrage condition to find the missing values.\n\nLet me consider the 1-year case again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Spot rate: 15 nanos per dollar\n\n- 1-year forward rate: 15.6 nanos per dollar\n\n- Nano interest rate: 9.8% per year\n\n- Dollar interest rate: ?\n\nUsing interest rate parity:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + 0.098) * (15.6 / 15)\n\nCalculate:\n\n(1 + r_d) = 1.098 * 1.04 = 1.14392\n\nSo, r_d = 1.14392 - 1 = 0.14392 or 14.392%\n\nThis seems consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none match this value. The closest is 15.18%, which is higher.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interest rates are compounded differently, or there's a different formula I should be using.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between spot and forward rates in terms of interest rate differentials.\n\nThe forward rate can be expressed as:\n\nF = S * [(1 + r_f) / (1 + r_d)]^t\n\nWhere t is the time in years.\n\nFor t = 1, this simplifies to:\n\nF = S * (1 + r_f) / (1 + r_d)\n\nRearranged, this is the interest rate parity formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the interest rates are expressed in different terms, such as continuously compounded or something else.\n\nBut the table specifies \"annually compounded,\" so I think it's safe to use the formula as is.\n\nGiven that, and my calculations leading to r_d = 14.392%, perhaps the correct answer is approximately 14.4%, but that's not among the options.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.58\n\nB. 2.34\n\nC. 15.18\n\nD. 3.85\n\nNone of these match 14.392%.\n\nMaybe there's a different way to approach the problem.\n\nLet me consider the concept of covered interest arbitrage.\n\nSuppose I borrow dollars, convert to nanos, invest in nanos, and then convert back to dollars using the forward contract.\n\nThe return from this should be equal to the return from borrowing and investing directly in dollars.\n\nLet's set up the arbitrage condition.\n\nFor 1 year:\n\nBorrow $1 at 1 + r_d\n\nConvert to nanos at spot rate: $1 * 15 nanos/$ = 15 nanos\n\nInvest in nanos at 1 + 0.098\n\nSo, after 1 year: 15 * 1.098 = 16.47 nanos\n\nConvert back to dollars at forward rate: 16.47 / 15.6 \u2248 $1.0558\n\nSo, the return is $1.0558, which should equal the return from investing $1 at r_d for 1 year.\n\nSo:\n\n1 + r_d = 1.0558\n\nTherefore, r_d = 0.0558 or 5.58%\n\nWait a minute, that's option A: 5.58.\n\nBut earlier, using the interest rate parity formula, I got 14.392%.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check the covered interest arbitrage calculation again.\n\nBorrow $1, convert to 15 nanos, invest at 9.8% to get 15 * 1.098 = 16.47 nanos, then convert back at 15.6 nanos/$ to get $1.0558.\n\nSo, the effective return is 5.58%.\n\nTherefore, the dollar interest rate should be 5.58% to prevent arbitrage.\n\nBut earlier, using interest rate parity, I got 14.392%.\n\nThere must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me check the interest rate parity formula again.\n\nInterest rate parity formula:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) * (F / S)\n\nPlugging in for 1 year:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + 0.098) * (15.6 / 15) = 1.098 * 1.04 = 1.14392\n\nSo, r_d = 0.14392 or 14.392%\n\nBut according to the covered interest arbitrage, r_d should be 5.58%.\n\nThere's a conflict here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the interest rate parity formula.\n\nLet me confirm the formula.\n\nInterest rate parity formula is indeed:\n\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) * (F / S)\n\nWhere:\n\n- r_d is the domestic interest rate (dollars)\n\n- r_f is the foreign interest rate (nanos)\n\n- F is the forward exchange rate\n\n- S is the spot exchange rate\n\nGiven that, and plugging in the values, I get r_d = 14.392%, but the covered interest arbitrage suggests r_d = 5.58%.\n\nThere must be an error in one of these approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interest rates are expressed differently, or there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nWait, the problem states that the interest rates are \"annually compounded,\" and the time periods are 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year.\n\nPerhaps the interest rates given are effective annual rates, and I need to consider the compounding frequency for different time periods.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nFor example, for 1 month, which is 1/12 of a year, the annually compounded rate is given, so the monthly rate would be (1 + annual rate)^(1/12) - 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 months (1/4 of a year), the quarterly rate would be (1 + annual rate)^(1/4) - 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to adjust the interest rates accordingly.\n\nBut in the problem, the interest rates are given as annually compounded, so they should be directly applicable to the interest rate parity formula.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the relationship between the forward rate and the interest rates.\n\nThe forward rate can be expressed as:\n\nF = S * [(1 + r_f) / (1 + r_d)]^t\n\nWhere t is the time in years.\n\nFor t = 1:\n\nF = S * (1 + r_f) / (1 + r_d)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n15.6 = 15 * (1 + 0"
