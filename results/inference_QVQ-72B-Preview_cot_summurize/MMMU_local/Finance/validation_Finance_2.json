                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and I need to calculate the expected rate of return for a stock that's uncorrelated with three factors: change in GNP, energy prices, and long-term interest rates. The risk-free rate is 7%, and there's a table with risk premiums for these factors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the APT is. I know that the APT is a model that describes the relationship between expected returns and factors that influence those returns. Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which uses only one factor (market risk), APT considers multiple factors that can affect asset returns.\n\nThe general formula for APT is:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 + \\ldots + b_{in}RP_n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on asset i.\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( b_{in} \\) is the sensitivity of asset i to factor n.\n\n- \\( RP_n \\) is the risk premium for factor n.\n\nIn this problem, there are three factors:\n\n1. Change in Gross National Product (GNP): +5%\n\n2. Change in energy prices: -1%\n\n3. Change in long-term interest rates: +2%\n\nAnd the stock's return is uncorrelated with all three factors. That means the stock's returns don't move in response to these factors, right? So, its factor loadings (\\( b_i \\)) should be zero for all three factors.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"uncorrelated,\" which means that the correlation between the stock's return and each factor is zero. In APT, the factor loadings represent the sensitivity of the stock's return to changes in each factor. If the stock is uncorrelated with the factors, its factor loadings should be zero.\n\nSo, plugging into the APT formula:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 + b_{i3}RP_3 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( b_{i1} = b_{i2} = b_{i3} = 0 \\), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f \\]\n\nWhich is just the risk-free rate, which is 7%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If the stock is uncorrelated with all the factors that are being considered in the APT model, then its expected return should be equal to the risk-free rate. That makes sense because the APT model adjusts the expected return based on the stock's sensitivity to the factors beyond the risk-free rate.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other information I might be missing. The problem mentions that the stock's return is uncorrelated with all three factors, and the risk-free rate is 7%. There doesn't seem to be any other information provided that would affect the expected return calculation.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 7%\n\nC. 13%\n\nD. 15.5%\n\nGiven my reasoning, the answer should be B. 7%, because the stock is uncorrelated with all the factors, so its expected return should just be the risk-free rate.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps the stock has some idiosyncratic risk that isn't captured by these factors, but in APT, the focus is on systematic risk related to the factors, and if the stock is uncorrelated with those factors, its systematic risk should be zero, making its expected return equal to the risk-free rate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that in APT, the factors are the systematic risks that affect asset returns, and the factor loadings measure how much each asset is exposed to those risks. If an asset has zero exposure to all factors, it should have no systematic risk, and thus its expected return should be the risk-free rate.\n\nSo, I think the answer is indeed B. 7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
