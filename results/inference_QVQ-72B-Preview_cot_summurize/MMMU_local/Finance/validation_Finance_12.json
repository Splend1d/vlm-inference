                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three stocks, A, B, and C, with their respective prices and shares outstanding at times 0, 1, and 2. Stock C splits two-for-one in the last period, which means that for every one share at time 1, there are two shares at time 2, and the price adjusts accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to calculate the rate of return for the second period, which is from time t=1 to t=2. Rate of return is generally calculated as the change in value over time, plus any dividends or other distributions, divided by the initial value. But in this case, since we're dealing with stocks and their prices and shares, I think we're looking at a portfolio or index return.\n\nSince there's no mention of weights or specific portfolio composition, I'll assume that the rate of return is based on the market capitalization of each stock at the respective times.\n\nLet's define some terms:\n\n- \\( P_t \\): Price at time t\n\n- \\( Q_t \\): Shares outstanding at time t\n\n- Market capitalization at time t for stock i: \\( MC_t^i = P_t^i \\times Q_t^i \\)\n\n- Total market capitalization at time t: \\( TC_t = \\sum_{i=A}^{C} MC_t^i \\)\n\nThe rate of return from time t=1 to t=2 can be calculated using the total market capitalization at these times:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{TC_2 - TC_1}{TC_1} \\]\n\nNow, let's tabulate the given data:\n\n| Stock | \\( P_0 \\) | \\( Q_0 \\) | \\( P_1 \\) | \\( Q_1 \\) | \\( P_2 \\) | \\( Q_2 \\) |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| A     | 90        | 100       | 95        | 100       | 95        | 100       |\n| B     | 50        | 200       | 45        | 200       | 45        | 200       |\n| C     | 100       | 200       | 110       | 200       | 55        | 400       |\n\nWait a minute, stock C has a two-for-one split in the last period, which is from t=1 to t=2. That means that at t=2, the number of shares outstanding doubles, and the price is halved, but the market capitalization should remain the same, assuming no change in value besides the split.\n\nBut looking at the table, at t=1, \\( P_1^C = 110 \\) and \\( Q_1^C = 200 \\), so \\( MC_1^C = 110 \\times 200 = 22,000 \\).\n\nAt t=2, \\( P_2^C = 55 \\) and \\( Q_2^C = 400 \\), so \\( MC_2^C = 55 \\times 400 = 22,000 \\). So, the market capitalization for stock C remains the same despite the split.\n\nNow, let's calculate the market capitalizations for all stocks at t=1 and t=2.\n\nAt t=1:\n\n- A: \\( 95 \\times 100 = 9,500 \\)\n\n- B: \\( 45 \\times 200 = 9,000 \\)\n\n- C: \\( 110 \\times 200 = 22,000 \\)\n\nTotal \\( TC_1 = 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500 \\)\n\nAt t=2:\n\n- A: \\( 95 \\times 100 = 9,500 \\)\n\n- B: \\( 45 \\times 200 = 9,000 \\)\n\n- C: \\( 55 \\times 400 = 22,000 \\)\n\nTotal \\( TC_2 = 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500 \\)\n\nWait, both totals are 40,500, which would mean the rate of return is zero:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{40,500 - 40,500}{40,500} = 0 \\]\n\nBut looking back at the options, zero is one of the choices, but maybe there's more to this.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nAt t=1:\n\n- A: 95 * 100 = 9,500\n\n- B: 45 * 200 = 9,000\n\n- C: 110 * 200 = 22,000\n\nTotal: 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500\n\nAt t=2:\n\n- A: 95 * 100 = 9,500\n\n- B: 45 * 200 = 9,000\n\n- C: 55 * 400 = 22,000\n\nTotal: 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500\n\nYes, no change in total market capitalization, so the rate of return is zero.\n\nBut perhaps we need to consider the fact that stock C had a split, which might affect the calculation differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should consider using the formula for a price-weighted index or some other method, but the question seems to suggest using prices and shares outstanding to calculate returns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider individual stock returns and then take a portfolio-weighted average.\n\nLet me explore that approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the individual stock returns from t=1 to t=2.\n\nFor stock A:\n\n\\( R_A = \\frac{P_2^A - P_1^A}{P_1^A} = \\frac{95 - 95}{95} = 0 \\)\n\nFor stock B:\n\n\\( R_B = \\frac{P_2^B - P_1^B}{P_1^B} = \\frac{45 - 45}{45} = 0 \\)\n\nFor stock C:\n\n\\( R_C = \\frac{P_2^C - P_1^C}{P_1^C} = \\frac{55 - 110}{110} = \\frac{-55}{110} = -0.5 \\) or -50%\n\nWait, but stock C had a two-for-one split, which should not affect the return calculation directly because the split adjusts the price proportionally.\n\nBut according to the data, the price halved and shares doubled, so the market capitalization remained the same, implying no change in value.\n\nSo, the individual return for stock C is actually zero, but according to the formula above, it's -50%, which doesn't make sense because splits don't change the intrinsic value.\n\nI think I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the split adjusts the price, but the value remains the same, so the return should be zero.\n\nLet me check the concept again.\n\nWhen a stock splits two-for-one, each share is replaced by two shares at half the price. So, if you had one share at $110, after the split, you have two shares at $55 each, total value remains $110.\n\nSo, the return for stock C should indeed be zero, as the value hasn't changed.\n\nTherefore, the individual returns are:\n\n- A: 0%\n\n- B: 0%\n\n- C: 0%\n\nThus, the portfolio return is also zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 0\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the change in market capitalization weighted by the shares outstanding.\n\nBut in this case, since total market capitalization didn't change, the return is still zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider the price index or some other method, but given the information, it seems that the straightforward calculation leads to zero return.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 0"
