                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've got this table that shows the average annual rate of inflation expected over different periods:\n\n- 3 months: 5%\n\n- 2 years: 6%\n\n- 5 years: 8%\n\n- 10 years: 8.5%\n\n- 20 years: 9%\n\nAnd the problem says to assume that there's no maturity risk, meaning that the only factor affecting the nominal interest rate is the expected inflation rate. Additionally, it says that the real rate of interest is currently 2.5%. I need to find the nominal rate of interest for a 3-month bill.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between the real interest rate, the nominal interest rate, and the inflation rate. I remember that there's a formula called the Fisher equation, which states that:\n\nNominal Interest Rate = Real Interest Rate + Inflation Rate\n\nBut I think this is an approximation, especially for short-term interest rates. For more precise calculations, especially for longer terms, we should use the exact Fisher equation:\n\n(1 + Nominal Rate) = (1 + Real Rate) * (1 + Inflation Rate)\n\nHowever, for small interest rates, the approximation is often used because it's simpler. But in this case, since we're dealing with different periods and possibly compounding, I should be careful about how I apply this.\n\nWait a minute, the problem specifies that there's no maturity risk, so I don't have to worry about that. Also, it mentions that the real rate is currently 2.5%, and I need to find the nominal rate for a 3-month bill.\n\nGiven that, I should use the inflation expectation for 3 months, which is 5%, and the real interest rate of 2.5% to find the nominal rate.\n\nUsing the approximation:\n\nNominal Rate \u2248 Real Rate + Inflation Rate\n\nSo, Nominal Rate \u2248 2.5% + 5% = 7.5%\n\nBut I should check if this is precise enough. Maybe I should use the exact Fisher equation for more accuracy.\n\nThe exact Fisher equation is:\n\n(1 + Nominal Rate) = (1 + Real Rate) * (1 + Inflation Rate)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n(1 + Nominal Rate) = (1 + 0.025) * (1 + 0.05) = 1.025 * 1.05 = 1.07675\n\nTherefore, Nominal Rate = 1.07675 - 1 = 0.07675 or 7.675%\n\nSo, using the exact formula, the nominal rate is approximately 7.675%, which is very close to 7.5%.\n\nGiven that the options provided are in whole percentages, I think 7.5% is close enough, and probably the approximation is acceptable here.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 7.5%\n\nB. 8.5%\n\nC. 10.5%\n\nD. 11.5%\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer based on the calculation.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. The inflation rate for 3 months is 5%, and the real rate is 2.5%. Using the approximation, 5% + 2.5% = 7.5%. Even with the exact formula, it's roughly the same.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here about compounding because we're dealing with a 3-month bill, which is typically considered simple interest, especially in the context of T-bills.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 7.5%, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
