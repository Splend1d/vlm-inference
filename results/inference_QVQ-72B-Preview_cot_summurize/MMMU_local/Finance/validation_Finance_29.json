                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three projects, A, B, and C, each with their own cash flows over several years. The table provided shows the cash flows for each project at different times (from C0 to C5, which I assume are cash flows at time 0 to time 5 years). My task is to calculate the discounted payback period for each project and then determine which option correctly identifies these periods.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a discounted payback period is. The discounted payback period is the time it takes for the cumulative discounted cash inflows to equal the initial investment. So, it's similar to the regular payback period but takes into account the time value of money by discounting the cash flows.\n\nTo calculate the discounted payback period for each project, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial investment (C0), which is usually negative because it's an outflow.\n\n2. Discount each cash inflow back to the present using an appropriate discount rate.\n\n3. Cumulate the discounted cash inflows until they equal the initial investment.\n\n4. The time at which this cumulative sum equals the initial investment is the discounted payback period.\n\nOkay, now I need to know the discount rate to proceed. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify a discount rate. Maybe it's assumed to be 10%, or perhaps it's omitted. Wait, looking back, the problem might expect me to use a standard discount rate, like 10%, but I'm not sure. For the sake of this exercise, I'll assume a discount rate of 10%.\n\nLet me write down the formula for discounting cash flows. The discounted cash flow (DCF) for each period is:\n\nDCF_t = C_t / (1 + r)^t\n\nWhere:\n\n- C_t is the cash flow in period t\n\n- r is the discount rate (10% or 0.10)\n\n- t is the time period\n\nAlright, let's apply this to each project.\n\n**Project A:**\n\nInitial investment (C0) = -1,000\n\nCash flows:\n\nC1 = +1,000\n\nC2 = 0\n\nC3 = 0\n\nC4 = 0\n\nC5 = 0\n\nSo, the only cash inflow is +1,000 in year 1.\n\nFirst, discount the cash inflow:\n\nDCF1 = 1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = 1,000 / 1.10 = 909.09\n\nNow, the cumulative discounted cash flows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09\n\nThis needs to cover the initial investment of 1,000. So, the discounted payback period is exactly 1 year because 909.09 < 1,000, and there are no further cash inflows.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the regular payback period should be 1 year, but the discounted payback might be longer due to the discounting.\n\nBut in this case, since the cash inflow exactly covers the initial investment in the first year, even when discounted, it still seems to be 1 year.\n\nLet me check again. Initial investment is -1,000, and the discounted cash inflow in year 1 is 909.09. So, after year 1, the cumulative discounted cash inflow is 909.09, which is less than 1,000. Since there are no further cash inflows, the investment is not fully recovered on a discounted basis. Therefore, the discounted payback period does not exist for Project A.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. If the discounted cash inflow is 909.09 and the initial investment is 1,000, then indeed, the investment is not fully recovered in one year. Since there are no further cash inflows, the discounted payback period does not exist for Project A.\n\nOkay, so Option A says \"Project A: 3 years,\" which seems incorrect based on my calculation.\n\nOption B says \"Project A: 3 years,\" which also seems wrong.\n\nOption C says \"Project A: does's exist,\" which seems to have a typo, probably meaning \"doesn't exist.\"\n\nOption D says \"Project A: does's exist,\" again, likely a typo, meaning \"doesn't exist.\"\n\nSo, based on my calculation, Project A has a discounted payback period that doesn't exist.\n\n**Project B:**\n\nInitial investment (C0) = -2,000\n\nCash flows:\n\nC1 = +1,000\n\nC2 = +1,000\n\nC3 = +4,000\n\nC4 = +1,000\n\nC5 = +1,000\n\nAlright, let's discount each cash inflow:\n\nDCF1 = 1,000 / 1.10 = 909.09\n\nDCF2 = 1,000 / (1.10)^2 = 1,000 / 1.21 = 826.45\n\nDCF3 = 4,000 / 1.331 = 4,000 / 1.331 \u2248 3,004.51\n\nDCF4 = 1,000 / 1.4641 \u2248 1,000 / 1.4641 \u2248 682.68\n\nDCF5 = 1,000 / 1.6105 \u2248 1,000 / 1.6105 \u2248 620.87\n\nNow, let's cumulate these discounted cash flows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09\n\nYear 2: 909.09 + 826.45 = 1,735.54\n\nYear 3: 1,735.54 + 3,004.51 = 4,739.95\n\nYear 4: 4,739.95 + 682.68 = 5,422.63\n\nYear 5: 5,422.63 + 620.87 = 6,043.50\n\nThe initial investment is 2,000. So, we need to see when the cumulative discounted cash inflows equal or exceed 2,000.\n\nLooking at the cumulative amounts:\n\n- Year 1: 909.09 < 2,000\n\n- Year 2: 1,735.54 < 2,000\n\n- Year 3: 4,739.95 > 2,000\n\nSo, the discounted payback period falls between year 2 and year 3.\n\nTo find the exact time, we can interpolate within year 3.\n\nThe formula for the discounted payback period is:\n\nDiscounted payback period = years before full recovery + (amount needed in the final year to reach the initial investment) / discounted cash flow in that year\n\nSo, at the end of year 2, the cumulative discounted cash flow is 1,735.54, which is less than 2,000. The amount still needed is 2,000 - 1,735.54 = 264.46\n\nThe discounted cash flow in year 3 is 3,004.51\n\nTherefore, the discounted payback period is 2 + (264.46 / 3,004.51) years\n\nCalculating that:\n\n264.46 / 3,004.51 \u2248 0.0879 years\n\nSo, approximately 2.0879 years, which is roughly 2 years and about 1 month.\n\nBut since the options are given in whole years, we can round this to 3 years.\n\nTherefore, Project B's discounted payback period is approximately 3 years.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Project A: 3 years; Project B: 3 years; Project C: doesn't exist\n\nOption B: Project A: 3 years; Project B: doesn't exist; Project C: 3 years\n\nOption C: Project A: doesn't exist; Project B: 3 years; Project C: 5 years\n\nOption D: Project A: doesn't exist; Project B: doesn't exist; Project C: doesn't exist\n\nBased on my calculations so far, Option C seems partially correct, but I need to check Project C as well.\n\n**Project C:**\n\nInitial investment (C0) = -3,000\n\nCash flows:\n\nC1 = +1,000\n\nC2 = +1,000\n\nC3 = 0\n\nC4 = +1,000\n\nC5 = +1,000\n\nDiscount each cash inflow:\n\nDCF1 = 1,000 / 1.10 = 909.09\n\nDCF2 = 1,000 / 1.21 = 826.45\n\nDCF3 = 0 / 1.331 = 0\n\nDCF4 = 1,000 / 1.4641 \u2248 682.68\n\nDCF5 = 1,000 / 1.6105 \u2248 620.87\n\nNow, cumulate these discounted cash flows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09\n\nYear 2: 909.09 + 826.45 = 1,735.54\n\nYear 3: 1,735.54 + 0 = 1,735.54\n\nYear 4: 1,735.54 + 682.68 = 2,418.22\n\nYear 5: 2,418.22 + 620.87 = 3,039.09\n\nThe initial investment is 3,000. So, we need to see when the cumulative discounted cash inflows equal or exceed 3,000.\n\nLooking at the cumulative amounts:\n\n- Year 1: 909.09 < 3,000\n\n- Year 2: 1,735.54 < 3,000\n\n- Year 3: 1,735.54 + 0 = 1,735.54 < 3,000\n\n- Year 4: 1,735.54 + 682.68 = 2,418.22 < 3,000\n\n- Year 5: 2,418.22 + 620.87 = 3,039.09 > 3,000\n\nSo, the discounted payback period falls between year 4 and year 5.\n\nTo find the exact time, we can interpolate within year 5.\n\nAmount needed at the end of year 4: 3,000 - 2,418.22 = 581.78\n\nDiscounted cash flow in year 5: 620.87\n\nTherefore, discounted payback period = 4 + (581.78 / 620.87) \u2248 4 + 0.937 years \u2248 4.937 years\n\nSo, approximately 5 years.\n\nTherefore, Project C's discounted payback period is approximately 5 years.\n\nNow, summarizing:\n\n- Project A: doesn't exist\n\n- Project B: approximately 3 years\n\n- Project C: approximately 5 years\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: Project A: 3 years; Project B: 3 years; Project C: doesn't exist\n\nOption B: Project A: 3 years; Project B: doesn't exist; Project C: 3 years\n\nOption C: Project A: doesn't exist; Project B: 3 years; Project C: 5 years\n\nOption D: Project A: doesn't exist; Project B: doesn't exist; Project C: doesn't exist\n\nBased on my calculations, Option C seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, Option C says \"Project C: 5 years,\" which matches my calculation, but it also says \"Project A: doesn't exist\" and \"Project B: 3 years,\" which also align with my calculations.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, Project A:\n\nInitial investment: -1,000\n\nCash inflow in year 1: +1,000\n\nDiscounted cash inflow in year 1: 1,000 / 1.10 = 909.09\n\nSince there are no further cash inflows, the cumulative discounted cash inflows are 909.09, which is less than 1,000. Therefore, the discounted payback period doesn't exist for Project A.\n\nProject B:\n\nInitial investment: -2,000\n\nDiscounted cash inflows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09\n\nYear 2: 826.45\n\nYear 3: 3,004.51\n\nCumulative discounted cash flows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09 < 2,000\n\nYear 2: 1,735.54 < 2,000\n\nYear 3: 4,739.95 > 2,000\n\nSo, discounted payback period is between year 2 and year 3.\n\nInterpolating, as done earlier, gives approximately 3 years.\n\nProject C:\n\nInitial investment: -3,000\n\nDiscounted cash inflows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09\n\nYear 2: 826.45\n\nYear 4: 682.68\n\nYear 5: 620.87\n\nCumulative discounted cash flows:\n\nYear 1: 909.09 < 3,000\n\nYear 2: 1,735.54 < 3,000\n\nYear 4: 2,418.22 < 3,000\n\nYear 5: 3,039.09 > 3,000\n\nSo, discounted payback period is between year 4 and year 5.\n\nInterpolating gives approximately 5 years.\n\nTherefore, Option C is correct.\n\nWait, but Option C says \"Project C: 5 years,\" which matches, but it also correctly identifies Project A as \"doesn't exist\" and Project B as \"3 years.\"\n\nOption D says all don't exist, which is incorrect.\n\nOption B says Project A: 3 years; Project B: doesn't exist; Project C: 3 years, which is incorrect.\n\nOption A says Project A: 3 years; Project B: 3 years; Project C: doesn't exist, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
