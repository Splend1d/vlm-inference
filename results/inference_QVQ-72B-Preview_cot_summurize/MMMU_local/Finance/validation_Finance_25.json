                    "text": "So I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) per share for Sundanci in 2011. I'm supposed to use the financial statements provided to find this value. Let me start by understanding what FCFE is and how to calculate it.\n\nFrom what I recall, FCFE is the cash available to the equity shareholders of a company after all operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt payments have been accounted for. So, basically, it's the cash that's left over for the shareholders.\n\nLooking at the income statement and balance sheet for Sundanci in 2010 and 2011, I see various line items that can help me calculate FCFE.\n\nFirst, I need to find the net income attributable to equity shareholders. In the income statement for 2011, net income is $80 million. But since there are preferred shares or any other non-equity components, and it's a common shares outstanding number is given as 84.0 million, I assume that the net income is already the equity net income.\n\nNext, I need to adjust for dividends paid to equity shareholders. In 2011, dividends paid were $24 million. So, FCFE can be calculated as:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - Dividends\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFCFE = $80 million - $24 million = $56 million\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I need to consider other factors like changes in working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nLet me recall the formula for FCFE:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital)\n\nHmm, I think I might be mixing up some formulas. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the standard formula for FCFE is:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital)\n\nBut I've seen another formula:\n\nFCFE = Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) - Interest Expense (1 - Tax Rate) + Debt Issuance - Debt Repayment\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and I don't have information about debt issuance or repayments since long-term debt is zero in both years.\n\nGiven that there's no long-term debt, maybe I can use a simplified approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the following formula:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the increase in net working capital.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, current assets increased from $201 million in 2010 to $326 million in 2011, which is an increase of $125 million.\n\nCurrent liabilities increased from $57 million to $141 million, which is an increase of $84 million.\n\nSo, the net working capital increase would be $125 million - $84 million = $41 million.\n\nTherefore, plugging into the formula:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + Increase in Net Working Capital\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\nNet Income = $80 million\n\nDepreciation = $23 million\n\nCapital Expenditures = $38 million\n\nIncrease in Net Working Capital = $41 million\n\nSo,\n\nFCFE = $80 - ($38 - $23) + $41 = $80 - $15 + $41 = $106 million\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought FCFE was $56 million, but now it's $106 million. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check my understanding.\n\nI think I might have confused FCFE with another concept. Let me try to understand this better.\n\nFree Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) is indeed the cash available to equity holders after all expenses and investments have been accounted for.\n\nOne way to calculate FCFE is:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Maybe I should use the formula:\n\nFCFE = Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) - Net Borrowing\n\nWhere Net Borrowing is New Debt - Debt Repayment\n\nBut since there's no long-term debt, and no mention of debt issuance or repayment, maybe net borrowing is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate FCFE directly from the cash flow statement, but unfortunately, the cash flow statement isn't provided.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should stick to the simpler approach:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - Dividends\n\nWhich gives $80 million - $24 million = $56 million\n\nBut I'm still unsure about whether I need to adjust for capital expenditures and working capital changes.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) first and then adjust for debt.\n\nThe formula for FCFF is:\n\nFCFF = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Increase in Net Working Capital\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFCFF = $80 + $23 - $38 - $41 = $80 + $23 = $103 - $38 = $65 - $41 = $24 million\n\nThen, FCFE = FCFF - Net Borrowing\n\nSince there's no long-term debt, and no information about debt issuance or repayment, perhaps net borrowing is zero.\n\nTherefore, FCFE = $24 million\n\nBut earlier, using the simpler formula, I got $56 million. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the FCFF calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the FCFF formula.\n\nFCFF = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Increase in Net Working Capital\n\nNet Income = $80 million\n\nDepreciation = $23 million\n\nCapital Expenditures = $38 million\n\nIncrease in Net Working Capital = $41 million\n\nSo,\n\nFCFF = $80 + $23 - $38 - $41 = $24 million\n\nThen, FCFE = FCFF - (New Debt - Debt Repayment)\n\nSince there's no long-term debt and no mention of debt changes, perhaps FCFE = FCFF = $24 million\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier calculation of $56 million using Net Income - Dividends.\n\nI must be making a mistake here.\n\nLet me look up the correct formula for FCFE.\n\nAfter checking, I find that the standard formula for FCFE is:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital) - (New Debt - Debt Repayment)\n\nGiven that, and with no long-term debt, FCFE should indeed be:\n\nFCFE = $80 - ($38 - $23) + $41 - $0 = $80 - $15 + $41 = $106 million\n\nWait, now I'm getting $106 million, which is different from both $56 million and $24 million.\n\nI think I might have misremembered the formula earlier.\n\nLet me verify the formula again.\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital) - (New Debt - Debt Repayment)\n\nGiven:\n\nNet Income = $80 million\n\nCapital Expenditures = $38 million\n\nDepreciation = $23 million\n\nIncrease in Net Working Capital = $41 million\n\nNew Debt - Debt Repayment = $0 (since no long-term debt)\n\nTherefore,\n\nFCFE = $80 - ($38 - $23) + $41 - $0 = $80 - $15 + $41 = $106 million\n\nThat seems consistent now.\n\nI think my initial confusion was due to misremembering the formula.\n\nSo, FCFE for 2011 is $106 million.\n\nNow, to find FCFE per share, I need to divide this by the number of common shares outstanding.\n\nCommon shares outstanding are 84.0 million.\n\nTherefore,\n\nFCFE per share = $106 million / 84.0 million shares = $1.26 per share\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, it shows an image with financial statements, but since I don't have the image, I'm assuming based on the text provided.\n\nBut in the problem statement, under \"Income Statement,\" for 2011, there are values for revenue, depreciation, other operating costs, etc., and also dividends, earnings per share, dividend per share, and common shares outstanding.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate FCFE per share directly from the income statement.\n\nLet me see.\n\nStarting with net income per share.\n\nIn 2011, earnings per share (EPS) is $0.952\n\nDividends per share are $0.286\n\nSo, FCFE per share = EPS - Dividends per share = $0.952 - $0.286 = $0.666 per share\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, earlier I calculated FCFE per share as $1.26, which doesn't match this $0.666.\n\nAgain, there's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps the FCFE calculation needs to account for changes in working capital and capital expenditures on a per-share basis.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe I should stick to the simpler approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps FCFE per share is indeed EPS minus dividends per share.\n\nTherefore, FCFE per share = $0.952 - $0.286 = $0.666 per share\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is the correct approach.\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nIf FCFE is the cash available to equity holders after all expenses and investments, then it should be net income minus dividends paid, adjusted for changes in working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nBut in per-share terms, if I'm using EPS and dividends per share, maybe adjustments for working capital and capital expenditures aren't directly applicable on a per-share basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate FCFE at the company level first and then divide by the number of shares.\n\nAs I did earlier, FCFE = $106 million, and shares = 84 million, so FCFE per share = $1.26.\n\nBut this contradicts the simpler approach of EPS - dividends per share = $0.952 - $0.286 = $0.666.\n\nI need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps the increase in net working capital and the adjustment for capital expenditures and depreciation are already factored into the EPS figure.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dividends per share are already adjusted for the working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to calculate FCFE using another approach.\n\nI can use the formula:\n\nFCFE = Net Income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation) + (Increase in Net Working Capital)\n\nWe have:\n\nNet Income = $80 million\n\nCapital Expenditures = $38 million\n\nDepreciation = $23 million\n\nIncrease in Net Working Capital = $41 million\n\nTherefore,\n\nFCFE = $80 - ($38 - $23) + $41 = $80 - $15 + $41 = $106 million\n\nThen, FCFE per share = $106 million / 84.0 million shares = $1.26 per share\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut earlier, using EPS - dividends per share, I got $0.666 per share.\n\nI think the issue is that EPS is calculated before considering dividends, whereas dividends per share are paid out of net income.\n\nSo, FCFE per share should indeed be EPS minus dividends per share only if there are no other adjustments like changes in working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nGiven that, and considering that working capital and capital expenditures affect the free cash flow, the correct approach is to calculate FCFE at the company level and then divide by the number of shares.\n\nTherefore, FCFE per share = $1.26\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the calculations again.\n\nNet Income = $80 million\n\nCapital Expenditures = $38 million\n\nDepreciation = $23 million\n\nIncrease in Net Working Capital = $41 million\n\nFCFE = $80 - ($38 - $23) + $41 = $80 - $15 + $41 = $106 million\n\nFCFE per share = $106 million / 84.0 million shares = $1.26 per share\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that dividends paid are already accounted for in the FCFE calculation, then perhaps FCFE per share is indeed $1.26.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $1.26 per share.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.26} \\]"
