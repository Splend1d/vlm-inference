The question is asking about adult hoverflies, and it mentions that they're considered garden allies because they're natural pest predators. That sounds interesting. Let me see what options I have.\n\nOption A says \"nectar, pollen, and honeydew.\" Hmm, I know that hoverflies are often confused with bees because of their appearance, and bees collect nectar and pollen. But the question is about their diet, especially since they're known for being pest predators. Maybe nectar and pollen are part of their diet, but I'm not sure about honeydew.\n\nOption B is \"caterpillars.\" Caterpillars are the larvae of butterflies and moths, and I know that some insects feed on them. But I thought that hoverflies were more known for eating aphids. Maybe caterpillars are also part of their diet, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption C is \"don't know and don't want to guess.\" Well, I'd really like to get this right, so I'll try to think harder before resorting to this.\n\nOption D is \"mealybugs.\" Mealybugs are small, soft-bodied insects that can be pests in gardens, especially on plants like citrus and ornamentals. I know that some predators eat mealybugs, like ladybugs and lacewings, but I'm not sure about hoverflies. Maybe they do, but again, I thought aphids were their main prey.\n\nOption E is \"aphids.\" This seems familiar. I've heard that hoverflies eat aphids, which are common garden pests that suck plant juices. Aphids can multiply quickly and cause a lot of damage, so having insects that eat them is beneficial. Plus, I recall that hoverflies are known for their appetite for aphids, which makes them valuable in gardens and farms.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider all the options again. Nectar, pollen, and honeydew are more associated with their energy sources, perhaps, but the question is about their diet in terms of being pest predators. Caterpillars could be part of their diet, but I think aphids are more prominently known as their prey. Mealybugs might be eaten by hoverflies, but I don't think they're as preferred as aphids. And option C is out of the question since I want to make an educated guess.\n\nSo, between aphids and caterpillars, I think aphids are more accurately the primary prey of adult hoverflies. Therefore, I'll go with option E: aphids.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
