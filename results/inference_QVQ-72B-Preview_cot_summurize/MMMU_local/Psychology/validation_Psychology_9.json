                    "text": "So I've got this newspaper clipping from a psychology classified ad looking for research participants. It's about a study on authority and behavior. Let me try to understand what this study might be about and what the independent variable could be.\n\nFirst, the ad says they need college students for a psychological study on authority and behavior. Participants have to be available for five 30-minute sessions during the fall semester. It also mentions that the research involves some use of confederates, and they'll assess responses to different kinds of authority. Importantly, participants can leave at any time without penalty, and all IRB procedures will be followed. For more info or to apply, you have to go to room 248 in Jordan Hall.\n\nOkay, so the study is about authority and behavior, and it involves confederates, which are probably researchers or actors pretending to be participants or authorities in the experiment. They want to see how people respond to different kinds of authority figures.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most likely independent variable in this study. The independent variable is what the researchers manipulate to observe its effect on the dependent variable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Perception of authority\n\nB. Conformity\n\nC. Perception of behavior\n\nD. Response to authority\n\nE. Age\n\nLet's think about each one.\n\nA. Perception of authority: This could be a dependent variable, as they might be measuring how participants perceive different authority figures.\n\nB. Conformity: This could also be a dependent variable, measuring how much participants conform to the behavior of the authority figures.\n\nC. Perception of behavior: Again, this seems like something that might be measured, not manipulated.\n\nD. Response to authority: This could be a dependent variable, measuring how participants respond to different authority figures.\n\nE. Age: While age could be a variable in the study, it's not likely the primary independent variable being manipulated in this context.\n\nGiven that the study involves different kinds of authority and uses confederates to possibly portray these different authorities, I think the independent variable is likely the type or perception of authority being presented to the participants.\n\nBut let's consider the options again. The question is asking for the most likely independent variable, and among the choices, which one would be most plausible as the manipulated variable.\n\nOption A is \"perception of authority.\" If the study is manipulating different perceptions of authority, that could make sense. For example, some confederates might present themselves as highly authoritative, while others as less authoritative, and see how participants respond.\n\nOption D is \"response to authority,\" which seems more like the dependent variable, as it's the participants' behavior or reaction to the authority that's being measured.\n\nOption E, age, might be a variable they're controlling for or considering, but it's not likely the main independent variable being manipulated.\n\nSo between options A and D, A seems more like the manipulated variable. If they're presenting different perceptions of authority and seeing how participants respond, then perception of authority would be the independent variable, and response to authority would be the dependent variable.\n\nWait, but the ad mentions assessing responses to different kinds of authority. So maybe both are being manipulated and measured, but typically, in an experiment, you manipulate one and measure the other.\n\nPerhaps the independent variable is the type of authority presented, and the dependent variable is the response to that authority.\n\nGiven that, option A, perception of authority, could be the independent variable if they're manipulating how authority is perceived, for example, by having confederates act in certain ways.\n\nBut option D, response to authority, sounds more like the dependent variable they're measuring.\n\nOption B, conformity, could be another dependent variable, measuring how much participants conform to the authority's requests or behavior.\n\nOption C, perception of behavior, is a bit vague but might also be a measured variable.\n\nOption E, age, is probably a demographic variable, not the main independent variable.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the most likely independent variable in this study is the perception of authority, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
