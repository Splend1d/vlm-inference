Proponents argue that human cognition evolved from primary sensorimotor processing and this necessitates understanding cognitive mechanisms as an interaction between the mind and body. An example of embodied cognition can be seen in mental imagery. There is strong evidence in favor of the visual imagery of an action conflicting with the performance of that action, such as visualizing an 'X' while writing an 'O'. Memory is also believed to be embodied. Proponents of theories of embodied cognition view memory as a representation of the event or object, linked to the sensorimotor information, which defines the possibilities of that event or object. To test whether sensorimotor experience aids decision making, researchers asked professional hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey to read aloud either sentences that described hockey-specific situations or situations encountered in a normal day. An example of a hockey specific situation was reading the sentence \"the player knocked over the net\" and a picture of a hockey net tipped over (match) or right side up (mismatch) was displayed. An example of a situation encountered in a normal day was \"an umbrella was put into the closet\", with a closed (match) or open (mismatch) umbrella pictured. The subject pressed a button to indicate the sentence had been read; a fixation point was shown for 500 msec before a picture was displayed. The time was recorded between the picture presentation and the response of match or mismatch. Figure 1 shows the data from this experiment.

Results for both hockey and nonhockey related scenarios are displayed. <image 1> How does the model for embodied cognition differ from the information-processing model?\n\nA.

Let's see, the question is asking how the model for embodied cognition differs from the information-processing model. There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what embodied cognition is. From the explanation provided, it seems like embodied cognition is an approach that emphasizes the role of the body and the environment in shaping cognitive processes. It suggests that our thoughts and perceptions are influenced by our physical experiences and the interactions we have with the world around us.\n\nNow, the information-processing model is something I've heard of before. It's often compared to a computer, where the mind processes information in a systematic way, using various cognitive operations to transform and manipulate data.\n\nSo, option A says that the information-processing model is characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer, whereas the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience. That sounds plausible. It seems to capture the essence of both models.\n\nOption B says that both models are characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer and are rule-based and logic-driven, but then it says that the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive and problem-solving as based on the computation of inputs and outputs. This contradicts what I've learned about embodied cognition. Embodied cognition is not about passive processing; rather, it emphasizes active engagement with the environment through the body.\n\nOption C says they are essentially the same, which I don't think is accurate. There are clear differences in how they view the nature of cognitive processes.\n\nOption D reverses the characteristics, suggesting that the embodied cognition model is like a computer, while the information-processing model is about represented actions, environment, and past experience. That doesn't seem right.\n\nGiven these options, option A seems to be the most accurate description of how the embodied cognition model differs from the information-processing model. The information-processing model views the mind as a computer that processes information, while embodied cognition sees cognition as emerging from the interaction of represented actions, the environment, and past experiences.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing something, let me think about it differently. In the information-processing model, cognition is seen as the manipulation of symbols or information inside the mind, similar to how a computer processes data. Embodied cognition, on the other hand, argues that cognitive processes are deeply influenced by our bodily interactions with the world, and that abstract concepts are often grounded in concrete sensorimotor experiences.\n\nSo, yes, this aligns with option A. The information-processing model is like a computer, and embodied cognition is about the interplay of action, environment, and experience.\n\nI should also consider the role of past experience in both models. In information processing, past experiences might be stored as memories that can be retrieved and processed, but the emphasis is on the internal mental operations. In embodied cognition, past experiences shape our understanding and cognition through the sensorimotor systems that interact with the world.\n\nTherefore, option A accurately captures the difference between the two models.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
