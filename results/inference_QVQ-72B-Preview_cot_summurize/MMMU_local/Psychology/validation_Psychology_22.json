Some patients cope with stress by adopting unhealthy habits (like drinking, smoking, or withdrawing from social relationships), which can increase symptom severity and result in poor quality of life both during and after cancer treatment. Conversely, individuals who manage stress with healthy techniques can experience symptom relief and improved quality of life. A group of oncologists hope to promote healthy stress reduction and decide to focus their efforts on deep breathing. They postulate that a deep breathing exercise will induce the relaxation response, a physical state of deep rest that is the physiological opposite of a stress response (or fight or flight). They believe that when patients learn to breathe more slowly and deeply, their muscles will relax, blood pressure will decrease, and heart rates will slow down (all characteristics of the relaxation response). When testing the exercise with two patients they notice significant decreases in blood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate. They conclude that the exercise could decrease select physical symptoms of stress. The oncologists decide to expand their testing, and develop several deep-breathing exercises to be delivered in a group format. They believe that the combined exercises will help patients cope during times of stress. The program consists of 30-minute guided group breathing classes that occur biweekly for 8 weeks. Patients are also asked to complete home deep breathing practices. To test their theory, they recruit 10 adult cancer patients to participate in their program. The patient group is homogenous in type and stage of cancer. All patients have recently received their cancer diagnosis. The patients are all between 45 and 55 years old (mean age 48.6) and there are equal numbers of men and women in the group. Each patient completes a stress symptom checklist both before and after the intervention. The stress symptoms checklist can be found in Table 1. The symptom checklist is divided into four categories, with six possible symptoms in each category. Patients are instructed to circle any and all symptoms they are currently experiencing. The results from the study can be found in Figure 1 <image 1>. Which coping strategy best describes the deep breathing program?\n\nA. Appraisal focused coping because it challenges patient's assumptions about cancer and relaxation.\nB. Emotion focused coping because it teaches patients to manage emotions that accompany perception of stress.\nC. Problem focused coping because the program is aimed at learning more about stress and taking control.\nD. Avoidance focused coping because patients distance themselves from their physiological reaction to stressful experiences.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this. So, the question is about a deep breathing program for cancer patients to help them manage stress. The program involves guided group breathing classes twice a week for eight weeks, and patients also practice at home. Before and after the program, patients filled out a stress symptom checklist, and their responses were compared.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of coping strategy this deep breathing program represents. The options are appraisal-focused, emotion-focused, problem-focused, and avoidance-focused coping.\n\nLet's recall what each type means:\n\n1. **Appraisal-focused coping**: This involves changing the way we think about the stressful situation, perhaps by reevaluating our assumptions or finding positive aspects.\n\n2. **Emotion-focused coping**: This strategy aims to regulate and manage the emotions that arise from stressors without necessarily changing the stressors themselves.\n\n3. **Problem-focused coping**: This involves taking direct action to tackle the stressor or change the situation that is causing stress.\n\n4. **Avoidance-focused coping**: This strategy involves distancing oneself from the stressor or ignoring it, which can be maladaptive if used excessively.\n\nNow, looking at the deep breathing program:\n\n- It teaches patients techniques to induce the relaxation response, which is the body's way of countering the stress response.\n\n- By practicing deep breathing, patients learn to physically relax, which can reduce stress symptoms like high blood pressure and rapid heart rate.\n\n- The program is group-based, which might also provide social support and a sense of community.\n\n- Patients are encouraged to practice at home, integrating the technique into their daily lives.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the program is primarily aimed at managing the emotional and physical responses to stress rather than changing the stressor itself (which in this case is cancer and its treatment-related stresses).\n\nLet's look at each option more closely:\n\n**Option A: Appraisal-focused coping**\n\n- The program might help patients feel more in control by teaching them a technique to manage their stress response, but it's not directly about changing their thoughts or assumptions about cancer and relaxation.\n\n- While there might be some appraisal elements, such as feeling more capable of handling stress, the main focus is on the physiological response rather than reevaluating the stressor.\n\n**Option B: Emotion-focused coping**\n\n- This type of coping is about managing the emotions that come with stress.\n\n- Deep breathing helps regulate emotions by inducing a state of relaxation, which can make difficult emotions more manageable.\n\n- The program teaches patients techniques to handle the anxiety and worry that often come with a cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Option C: Problem-focused coping**\n\n- This involves taking direct action to solve the problem causing stress.\n\n- While managing stress is important, the program doesn't directly address the cancer itself or change the treatment plan.\n\n- It provides tools to cope with the stress of having cancer, but doesn't alter the stressor.\n\n**Option D: Avoidance-focused coping**\n\n- This strategy involves ignoring or distancing oneself from the stressor.\n\n- Deep breathing is a technique to manage the stress response, not to avoid thinking about the stressor.\n\n- While it might temporarily shift focus away from worries, it's not primarily an avoidance mechanism.\n\nGiven this analysis, the deep breathing program seems to align best with **emotion-focused coping**. It teaches patients to manage their emotional responses to stress through physiological techniques, rather than changing their thoughts about the stressor or avoiding it.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any combination of these strategies at play.\n\n- **Appraisal-focused**: There might be some element of reappraisal if patients start to view their ability to handle stress differently after learning the technique.\n\n- **Problem-focused**: The program helps manage stress, which can indirectly make coping with cancer easier, but it doesn't directly solve the problem of having cancer.\n\n- **Avoidance-focused**: Not applicable, as the technique is about facing and managing stress rather than avoiding it.\n\nHowever, the primary mechanism seems to be emotion regulation through physiological means, which is a key aspect of emotion-focused coping.\n\nAdditionally, considering the table and figure mentioned:\n\n- **Table 1** lists emotional, physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms of stress.\n\n- **Figure 1** shows a bar graph comparing the mean number of symptoms reported before and after the intervention.\n\nFrom the description, it seems that after the intervention, there are reductions in reported symptoms across all categories, particularly in emotional and physical symptoms.\n\nThis suggests that the deep breathing program effectively reduces stress symptoms by helping patients manage their emotional responses to stress, which in turn affects physical symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is **Option B: Emotion-focused coping**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
