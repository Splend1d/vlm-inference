                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about the relationship between arousal and performance on a challenging task, and there are five different graphs to choose from. I need to pick the one that best represents this relationship.\n\nFirst, I should understand what arousal means in this context. Arousal refers to the level of alertness or activation of the nervous system. So, it's about how awake and ready to respond someone is.\n\nNow, performance on a challenging task would depend on various factors, including the person's arousal level. I recall there's a theory called the Yerkes-Dodson Law that talks about the relationship between arousal and performance. It suggests that there's an optimal level of arousal for performance; too little or too much arousal can lead to decreased performance.\n\nSo, if I remember correctly, performance increases with arousal up to a point and then starts to decrease as arousal increases further. That sounds like an inverted U-shape relationship.\n\nLooking at the graphs:\n\nImage 1 shows a U-shaped curve, with performance increasing as arousal increases from low to high.\n\nImage 2 shows a straight line decreasing from left to right, meaning as arousal increases, performance decreases linearly.\n\nImage 3 shows a V-shaped curve, with performance decreasing to a point and then increasing again as arousal increases.\n\nImage 4 shows a straight line increasing from left to right, meaning as arousal increases, performance increases linearly.\n\nImage 5 shows an inverted U-shaped curve, with performance increasing to a peak and then decreasing as arousal increases further.\n\nGiven that, according to the Yerkes-Dodson Law, performance improves with arousal up to an optimal point and then declines, the graph that best represents this relationship should be the one with an inverted U-shape.\n\nSo, image 5 seems to fit this description.\n\nBut let me double-check. In image 5, performance starts low, increases to a peak, and then decreases as arousal increases further. That matches the inverted U-shape I'm thinking of.\n\nImage 1 is a U-shape, which is the opposite of what we're looking for.\n\nImage 2 is a decreasing straight line, which suggests that higher arousal leads to lower performance, which isn't what the Yerkes-Dodson Law predicts.\n\nImage 3 is a V-shape, which is similar to a U-shape but sharper, again not matching the inverted U-shape we expect.\n\nImage 4 is an increasing straight line, suggesting that higher arousal leads to higher performance, which again doesn't account for the optimal point where performance peaks.\n\nTherefore, image 5 is the correct choice because it shows the inverted U-shape relationship between arousal and performance on a challenging task.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other theories or factors that might affect this relationship. For example, maybe the type of task or the individual's personality could influence how arousal affects performance.\n\nHowever, the question specifies a \"challenging task,\" which is generally where the Yerkes-Dodson Law applies. For simple or well-learned tasks, perhaps higher arousal could be beneficial, but for complex or challenging tasks, there is typically an optimal level of arousal beyond which performance declines.\n\nSo, based on this, image 5 still seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that low arousal might make a person too relaxed and unresponsive, while high arousal might lead to anxiety or overexcitement, both of which can impair performance. The sweet spot is in the middle, where arousal is optimal for peak performance.\n\nYes, that aligns with the inverted U-shape in image 5.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The other graphs don't match the expected relationship between arousal and performance on a challenging task.\n\nTherefore, the answer is image 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
