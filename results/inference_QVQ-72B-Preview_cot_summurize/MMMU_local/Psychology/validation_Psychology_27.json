                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have an experiment with four groups of college students in an introductory calculus class. They all took the same exam, but each group got a different introductory statement that set varying expectations for their performance. The groups are:\n\n- Group A: Told that most students are expected to pass the exam.\n\n- Group B: Told that most students are expected to fail the exam.\n\n- Group C: Given statistics showing that female students perform worse than male students on similar exams.\n\n- Group D: No information provided about expected performance.\n\nThe performance is shown in a bar graph with averages for male and female students in each group. The scores are:\n\n- Group A: Male ~85, Female ~80\n\n- Group B: Male ~70, Female ~65\n\n- Group C: Male ~78, Female ~65\n\n- Group D: Male ~75, Female ~75\n\nThe question is asking what phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B specifically.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to explain why Group A performed better than Group B, based on the introductory statements they received.\n\nGroup A was told that most students are expected to pass, which likely instilled confidence in them. Group B was told that most students are expected to fail, which might have had a negative impact on their confidence.\n\nSo, it seems like expectations influenced their performance. Now, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Social facilitation\n\nThis is when people perform better on tasks when in the presence of others. It doesn't directly relate to expectations set by an introduction.\n\nB. Group polarization\n\nThis occurs when group discussions amplify the dominant opinions, leading to more extreme positions. Doesn't seem relevant here since the groups didn't have discussions; they just received an introduction.\n\nC. Self-serving bias\n\nThis is when people attribute success to themselves and failure to external factors. It's about how individuals perceive their own role in outcomes, not about group expectations affecting performance.\n\nD. Unstable attribution\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's about attributing causes to temporary or unstable factors. Again, not directly related to expectations set by an introduction.\n\nE. The Pygmalion effect\n\nThis is when higher expectations lead to an increase in performance. It's also known as the Rosenthal effect, where expectations placed on an individual by others cause the individual to perform in a manner that confirms those expectations.\n\nGiven that Group A was expected to pass and performed well, while Group B was expected to fail and performed poorly, it seems like the Pygmalion effect is at play here.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. Is the Pygmalion effect solely about positive expectations leading to better performance? What about negative expectations leading to worse performance? Does the Pygmalion effect account for both?\n\nActually, the Pygmalion effect typically refers to the principle that higher expectations lead to better performance. The negative counterpart might be considered as well, but I think the Pygmalion effect primarily focuses on positive expectations.\n\nLooking back at the groups, Group A had positive expectations and performed well, while Group B had negative expectations and performed poorly. So, it seems like the Pygmalion effect could explain both the positive and negative impacts of expectations on performance.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the Pygmalion effect only covers the positive side, and that there's a different phenomenon for negative expectations, perhaps the self-fulfilling prophecy or the Golem effect.\n\nBut in the context of this question, and given the options provided, the Pygmalion effect seems the most fitting answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the data. For example, could there be a difference in the way males and females performed based on the introductions?\n\nLooking at Group C, where the introduction highlighted that female students perform worse, we see that female students in Group C scored lower than male students, which might suggest stereotype threat or confirmation of the stereotype.\n\nBut the question is specifically about Groups A and B, not Group C.\n\nGroup D, with no introduction, serves as a control group, and their scores are around 75 for both males and females.\n\nComparing Group A (high expectations) to Group B (low expectations), we see that both male and female students in Group A outperformed those in Group B.\n\nThis suggests that the expectations set by the introduction had a significant impact on performance.\n\nTherefore, the Pygmalion effect is the most appropriate explanation for the performance differences between Groups A and B.\n\nSo, my answer is E. The Pygmalion effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
