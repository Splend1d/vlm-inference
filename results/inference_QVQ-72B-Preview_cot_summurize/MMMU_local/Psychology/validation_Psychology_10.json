                    "text": "So I've got this question here about identifying the lobes of the brain in a figure. The figure is labeled with numbers 1 through 4, each pointing to different parts of the brain. The options provided are:\n\nA. Temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, frontal lobe\n\nB. Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe\n\nC. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe\n\nD. Temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe\n\nFirst, I need to recall the locations of each lobe in the brain. I know that the brain has four main lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.\n\nStarting from the front of the brain:\n\n- The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, behind the forehead. It's responsible for functions like problem-solving, planning, and controlling emotions.\n\n- Next to that, towards the top and back of the head, is the parietal lobe. It's involved in processing sensory information like touch, temperature, and pain.\n\n- At the back of the head is the occipital lobe, which is primarily responsible for visual processing.\n\n- And finally, on the sides of the brain, above the ears, are the temporal lobes, which handle hearing and memory.\n\nLooking at the figure, which is a lateral view of the brain:\n\n- Label 1 appears to be the largest section, covering the front part of the brain. This should be the frontal lobe.\n\n- Label 2 is adjacent to the frontal lobe, towards the top and back, which should be the parietal lobe.\n\n- Label 3 is located at the very back of the brain, which should be the occipital lobe.\n\n- Label 4 is on the side of the brain, near the base, which should be the temporal lobe.\n\nSo, matching these labels to the lobes:\n\n1. Frontal lobe\n\n2. Parietal lobe\n\n3. Occipital lobe\n\n4. Temporal lobe\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems to match this arrangement: Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe.\n\nOption A suggests temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe, which doesn't match the positions.\n\nOption B proposes frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, which also doesn't align with the labels in the figure.\n\nOption D suggests temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, which again doesn't match the positions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check the positions:\n\n- Label 1: Frontal lobe \u2013 correct, it's at the front.\n\n- Label 2: Parietal lobe \u2013 yes, it's behind the frontal lobe and covers the top and upper back part of the head.\n\n- Label 3: Occipital lobe \u2013 properly located at the back of the head.\n\n- Label 4: Temporal lobe \u2013 correctly placed on the side of the brain, near the base.\n\nEverything seems to align perfectly with option C. So, I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
