The question is asking for the mean of Data Set A, and there are options provided: A. 3, B. 11, C. 12, D. 13, E. 18. Okay, to find the mean of a data set, I know that I need to add up all the numbers in the set and then divide by the count of numbers in the set. So, first things first, I need to sum all the values in Data Set A and then divide by how many numbers there are.\n\nLooking at Data Set A, the numbers are: 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19. Let me add these up. Starting with 3 plus 4 is 7, then 7 plus 6 is 13, 13 plus 12 is 25, 25 plus 16 is 41, 41 plus 17 is 58, and 58 plus 19 is 77. So, the total sum of Data Set A is 77.\n\nNow, how many numbers are there in Data Set A? Let's count them: 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19. That's seven numbers. So, to find the mean, I need to divide the sum by the count, which is 77 divided by 7.\n\nLet me calculate that. 7 times 11 is 77. So, 77 divided by 7 equals 11. Therefore, the mean of Data Set A is 11.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 11 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I'll verify the sum again. Starting with 3 plus 4 is indeed 7, 7 plus 6 is 13, 13 plus 12 is 25, 25 plus 16 is 41, 41 plus 17 is 58, and 58 plus 19 is 77. Yes, the sum is correct.\n\nNow, counting the numbers again: 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19. That's seven numbers. Dividing 77 by 7 gives 11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. The mean of Data Set A is 11, which corresponds to option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what the other options might represent. Option A is 3, which is the smallest number in Data Set A, so that doesn't make sense as the mean. Option C is 12, which is close to the mean but not exactly. Option D is 13, which is higher than the mean, and option E is 18, which is the highest number in the set. So, none of these seem to be the correct mean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
