                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Hicks Products, which sells patio furniture. They have some cost data for the year ending December 31, 2017, and I need to figure out what their total revenue is. The options are A. $3,100,000, B. $2,616,000, C. $2,474,000, and D. $484,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what total revenue means. Revenue is the total amount of money a company earns from selling its products or services. So, in this case, it's the total sales revenue from selling patio furniture.\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\n- Sales revenue: $3,100,000\n\n- Straight-line depreciation on office equipment: $90,000\n\n- Advertising and marketing expense: $625,000\n\n- Administrative salaries: $136,000\n\n- Cost of goods sold: $1,700,000\n\n- Rent on corporate headquarters: $65,000\n\nIt seems like these are all expenses except for the sales revenue. So, maybe the total revenue is just the sales revenue, which is $3,100,000. But let's think carefully.\n\nSometimes, companies have other sources of revenue, like interest income or sales of assets, but in this case, it looks like the only revenue is from sales.\n\nWait a minute, there's a line called \"sales revenue,\" which is $3,100,000. So, option A is $3,100,000, which matches this directly. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other revenue that might not be listed here. For example, maybe there are other products they sell or services they provide. But based on the information given, it seems like patio furniture is their only product line.\n\nAlso, sometimes companies have multiple channels of sales, like direct sales, online sales, and sales through dealers. In this case, Hicks Products sells through a national dealership network, so presumably, the sales revenue listed is from those dealers.\n\nI don't see any mention of other revenue streams, so I think it's safe to assume that the sales revenue is the total revenue of the company.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps some of these expenses are related to generating revenue, but they are already subtracted from revenue to get to net income or something like that. But no, revenue is before any expenses are subtracted.\n\nLet me recall the basic accounting equation: Revenue - Expenses = Net Income. So, revenue is separate from expenses. In the income statement, you start with revenue, then subtract the cost of goods sold to get gross profit, then subtract operating expenses like depreciation, advertising, salaries, and rent, to get net income.\n\nSo, in this list, we have revenue and several expenses, but no indication of other revenue sources.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue should indeed be $3,100,000.\n\nWait, but maybe there's something about the way the question is phrased that might make me consider adjusting this number. The question says, \"What is total revenue?\" and lists these costs for the year ending December 31, 2017.\n\nIs there any possibility that some of these costs could affect revenue? For example, if there were returns or allowances that reduced sales revenue, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nAlso, cost of goods sold is typically matched against sales revenue to determine gross profit, but again, that doesn't change the total revenue figure.\n\nSimilarly, depreciation, advertising, administrative salaries, and rent are all period expenses that are subtracted from revenue to find net income, but they don't affect the revenue itself.\n\nSo, I think the answer is clearly A. $3,100,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any reason to choose one of the other options.\n\nOption B is $2,616,000, which might be a result of subtracting some expenses from revenue, but that doesn't make sense because expenses are subtracted from revenue to find profit, not to define revenue.\n\nOption C is $2,474,000, which might be another misinterpretation of the data.\n\nOption D is $484,000, which seems too low compared to the sales revenue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. $3,100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 3,100,000} \\]"
