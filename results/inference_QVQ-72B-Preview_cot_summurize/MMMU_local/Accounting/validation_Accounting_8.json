                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Tim-Buck-II who rents jet skis in three different models: Junior, Adult, and Expert. Each model has its own sales price and variable cost per unit, and there are fixed costs that are shared among these models. We're given the current product mix in units and need to find the sales price per composite unit. The options are \\(\\$ 660\\), \\$760, \\$650, and \\$750.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a composite unit is. A composite unit is a combined unit of multiple products, weighted by their sales mix. So, given the product mix of 5:4:1 for Junior, Adult, and Expert respectively, we can assume that for every 10 units rented, 5 are Junior, 4 are Adult, and 1 is Expert.\n\nMy goal is to find the sales price per composite unit. To do that, I think I need to calculate the total sales revenue for one composite unit, which consists of the sales prices of each model multiplied by their respective mix ratios.\n\nSo, let's list out the sales prices:\n\n- Junior: \\$50\n\n- Adult: \\$75\n\n- Expert: \\$110\n\nAnd the variable costs:\n\n- Junior: \\$15\n\n- Adult: \\$25\n\n- Expert: \\$60\n\nBut I'm not sure if the variable costs are relevant right now, since we're focusing on sales price per composite unit. Maybe they'll be useful later.\n\nThe product mix is 5:4:1, so for every 10 units, it's 5 Junior, 4 Adult, and 1 Expert.\n\nTo find the total sales revenue for one composite unit, I need to sum the sales prices of each model multiplied by their mix ratios.\n\nSo, total sales revenue per composite unit = (5 * \\$50) + (4 * \\$75) + (1 * \\$110)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\(5 * 50=250\\)\n\n\\(4 * 75=300\\)\n\n\\(1 * 110=110\\)\n\nTotal sales revenue per composite unit = \\$250 + \\$300 + \\$110 = \\$660\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let's double-check if there's more to it.\n\nI recall that in cost-volume-profit analysis, the sales price per composite unit is used to determine the break-even point when multiple products are involved. But since the question is only asking for the sales price per composite unit, maybe that's all we need to do.\n\nHowever, sometimes, we might need to account for variable costs as well, especially if we're dealing with contribution margins. But in this case, the question specifically asks for the sales price per composite unit, not the contribution margin per composite unit.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct. The sales price per composite unit is \\$660, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this calculation. For example, fixed costs are mentioned, but they shouldn't impact the sales price per composite unit directly. Fixed costs are relevant when calculating the break-even point or profit, but not the sales price per composite unit.\n\nMaybe I should consider the variable costs to find the contribution margin per composite unit, but again, the question is about the sales price, not the contribution margin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a need to calculate the weighted average sales price per unit, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the question is trying to ask for the sales price per equivalent unit or per composite unit in terms of contribution margin, but no, it clearly says sales price per composite unit.\n\nSo, I think the answer is \\$660, option A.\n\nJust to make sure, let's verify with another approach. If we consider the sales mix ratios as weights, and calculate the weighted average sales price, it should match our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, weighted average sales price = (5/10 * \\$50) + (4/10 * \\$75) + (1/10 * \\$110)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\(5 / 10=0.5\\), times \\$50 = \\$25\n\n\\(4 / 10=0.4\\), times \\$75 = \\$30\n\n\\(1 / 10=0.1\\), times \\$110 = \\$11\n\nTotal weighted average sales price = \\$25 + \\$30 + \\$11 = \\$66 per unit\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because we're supposed to find the sales price per composite unit, which should be for the entire composite, not per unit.\n\nAh, perhaps I need to clarify what \"per composite unit\" means. If one composite unit consists of 5 Junior + 4 Adult + 1 Expert, then the total sales revenue for one composite unit is indeed \\$660.\n\nYes, I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{660} \\]"
