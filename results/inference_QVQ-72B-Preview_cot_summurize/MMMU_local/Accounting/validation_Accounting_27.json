                    "text": "So I have this balance sheet for Harrison, Inc., and I need to calculate the debt-equity ratio based on book values. I'm a bit rusty on financial ratios, but I think I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a debt-equity ratio is. From what I recall, the debt-equity ratio is a measure of a company's financial leverage, showing the relationship between the amount of capital provided by creditors and the amount provided by shareholders. Essentially, it's the total debt divided by the total shareholders' equity.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, there are two main sections: Assets and Total Debt and Equity. The assets are divided into current assets and net fixed assets, which add up to total assets. On the other side, there's total debt and shareholders' equity, which also add up to total assets. This makes sense because assets should equal liabilities plus equity.\n\nNow, the debt-equity ratio is total debt divided by total shareholders' equity. So, I need to find the total debt and the total shareholders' equity from the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the total debt, it's given as $220,000,000. And total shareholders' equity is $280,000,000. So, the debt-equity ratio should be $220,000,000 divided by $280,000,000.\n\nLet me double-check that. Total debt is $220,000,000, and total shareholders' equity is $280,000,000. Dividing 220 by 280 should give me the ratio.\n\nLet's do the division: 220 \u00f7 280. First, I can simplify this by dividing both numbers by 20, which gives me 11 \u00f7 14.\n\n11 divided by 14 is approximately 0.7857. So, the debt-equity ratio is roughly 0.786.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.820\n\nB. 0.693\n\nC. 0.786\n\nIt seems like option C is 0.786, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any chance that the total debt or total equity is calculated differently?\n\nLooking at the balance sheet again, under total debt and equity, it shows total debt as $220,000,000 and total shareholders' equity as $280,000,000, with the components of equity listed: common stock, capital surplus, and accumulated retained earnings. So, total equity is indeed $280,000,000.\n\nAdding total debt and total equity gives $500,000,000, which matches the total assets. That checks out.\n\nSo, unless there's some trick here, the debt-equity ratio should simply be $220,000,000 / $280,000,000 = 0.7857 or approximately 0.786.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether there are any other liabilities or something that aren't included here. For example, sometimes companies have other types of liabilities like deferred taxes or pensions that aren't included in total debt.\n\nBut in this case, the balance sheet clearly shows total debt as $220,000,000, and total shareholders' equity as $280,000,000. So, I think it's safe to assume that those are the figures to use for the debt-equity ratio.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the debt-equity ratio should be calculated using book values or market values. The question specifies to use book values, so I don't need to worry about market prices here.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let me plug the numbers into the formula again:\n\nDebt-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity = $220,000,000 / $280,000,000 = 0.7857 \u2248 0.786\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.786.\n\nI think that's it. No need to overcomplicate things here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
