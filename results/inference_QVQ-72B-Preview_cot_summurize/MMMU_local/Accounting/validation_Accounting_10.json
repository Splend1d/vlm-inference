I need to find two things for Rocket Transport: first, the net cash provided by or used in investing activities, and second, the net increase or decrease in cash for the year. I'm given a list of cash transactions, each with an amount, and I need to categorize and sum them appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes investing activities. Generally, investing activities involve long-term assets and other investments not related to everyday operations. This includes purchasing or selling assets like property, plant, and equipment, and buying or selling investments in other companies.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000\n\nI need to identify which of these are investing activities.\n\nStarting with the purchase of a bus: that sounds like an asset used in the business, so that should be part of investing activities. It's a cash outflow, so it's negative for net cash provided by investing activities.\n\nNext, sales of old equipment: that's selling an asset, which is also an investing activity. This is a cash inflow, so it's positive.\n\nSo, for investing activities, I have:\n\n- Purchase of bus: ($33,000)\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\nNet cash from investing activities = $72,000 - $33,000 = $39,000\n\nWait a minute, the options are given in terms of (1) net cash provided by or used in investing activities and (2) net increase or decrease in cash for the year. The options for (1) are $39,000, $36,000, and $38,650. My calculation gives $39,000, which matches option A for (1).\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. Are there any other transactions that might be considered investing activities?\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n- Cash dividend: This is likely a financing activity, as dividends are paid to shareholders.\n\n- Interest paid on debt: This could be considered an operating activity, but sometimes interest paid is treated as a financing activity. I need to be careful here.\n\n- Repurchase of stock: This is typically a financing activity.\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: This is clearly an operating activity.\n\n- Cash collections from customers: Also an operating activity.\n\nSo, only the purchase and sale of equipment are investing activities. Therefore, net cash from investing activities is indeed $72,000 - $33,000 = $39,000.\n\nNow, moving on to find the net increase or decrease in cash for the year. To find this, I need to look at the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities and sum them up.\n\nFirst, I need to categorize all the given transactions into operating, investing, and financing activities.\n\nStarting with operating activities:\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000 (inflow)\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: ($95,000) (outflow)\n\nAdditionally, interest paid on debt: ($25,000) (outflow)\n\nSo, net cash from operating activities = $300,000 - $95,000 - $25,000 = $180,000\n\nWait, is interest paid considered an operating activity? In some accounting methods, interest paid is included in operating cash flows, while in others, it's considered a financing activity. I think it's safer to consider it as part of operating activities.\n\nMoving on to financing activities:\n\n- Cash dividend paid: ($80,000)\n\n- Repurchase of stock: ($55,000)\n\nThese are both cash outflows related to financing.\n\nSo, net cash from financing activities = ($80,000) + ($55,000) = ($135,000)\n\nWe already calculated net cash from investing activities as $39,000.\n\nTherefore, net increase in cash for the year = net cash from operating activities + net cash from investing activities + net cash from financing activities\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNet increase in cash = $180,000 + $39,000 + ($-135,000) = $84,000\n\nSo, the net increase in cash for the year is $84,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (1)$39,000 ; (2)84,000\n\nB. (1)$36,000 ; (2)77,000\n\nC. (1)$38,650 ; (2)82,910\n\nOption A matches both my calculations.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check if there are any other transactions that I might have missed or misclassified.\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n- Cash dividend: financing\n\n- Purchase of bus: investing\n\n- Interest paid on debt: operating\n\n- Sales of old equipment: investing\n\n- Repurchase of stock: financing\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: operating\n\n- Cash collections from customers: operating\n\nI think I've covered all the transactions correctly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: (1)$39,000 ; (2)84,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
