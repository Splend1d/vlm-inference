                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a manufacturing company with various inventory accounts and some costs incurred during the year. We need to find the cost of materials used in production. The options are close to each other, so I need to be careful with my calculations.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Beginning raw materials inventory: \\$15,394\n\n- Ending raw materials inventory: \\$17,432\n\n- Purchases of raw materials: \\$77,321\n\n- Direct labor costs: \\$125,900\n\n- Overhead is applied at 75\\% of direct labor cost.\n\nWe need to find the cost of materials used in production.\n\nI recall that the cost of materials used in production can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCost of materials used = Beginning raw materials inventory + Purchases of raw materials - Ending raw materials inventory\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nCost of materials used = \\$15,394 + \\$77,321 - \\$17,432\n\nLet's add \\$15,394 and \\$77,321 first:\n\n\\$15,394\n\n+ \\$77,321\n\n= \\$92,715\n\nNow, subtract the ending raw materials inventory:\n\n\\$92,715 - \\$17,432 = \\$75,283\n\nLooking at the options, D. \\$75,283 seems to be the answer. But wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me verify the addition:\n\n\\$15,394\n\n+ \\$77,321\n\nAdding 15,394 and 77,321:\n\n94 + 321 = 415 \u2192 but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-align the numbers.\n\nWait, actually, I should add the beginning inventory and purchases:\n\n\\$15,394 (beginning raw materials)\n\n+ \\$77,321 (purchases)\n\n= \\$92,715\n\nThen subtract ending inventory:\n\n\\$92,715 - \\$17,432\n\nLet me subtract digit by digit:\n\n92,715\n\n- 17,432\n\n= 75,283\n\nYes, that matches option D.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any other way this could be calculated? Maybe considering direct labor and overhead? Wait, no, because the cost of materials used should only relate to the raw materials inventory accounts.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies use direct materials used in their calculations, but I think the formula I used is correct for cost of materials used.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the material flow:\n\nBeginning raw materials + Purchases = Raw materials available for use\n\nThen, raw materials used = Raw materials available - Ending raw materials\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, I think \\$75,283 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Let's consider if there are any other factors that could affect the cost of materials used.\n\nFor example, if there were any returns or adjustments to the raw materials, but the problem doesn't mention any such events. So, probably not.\n\nAlso, direct labor and overhead are related to the conversion costs, not directly to the materials used, so they shouldn't factor into the cost of materials used calculation.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. \\$75,283.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. \\$72,283\n\nB. \\$73,283\n\nC. \\$74,283\n\nThese are all \\$1,000 apart, which might suggest a miscalculation somewhere, but based on my calculations, \\$75,283 seems accurate.\n\nPerhaps if I misread one of the inventory figures, but let's check:\n\nBeginning raw materials: \\$15,394\n\nEnding raw materials: \\$17,432\n\nPurchases: \\$77,321\n\nAdding 15,394 and 77,321:\n\n15,394\n\n+77,321\n\n= 92,715\n\nSubtracting 17,432:\n\n92,715 - 17,432 = 75,283\n\nNo, it's consistently coming up as \\$75,283.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\$75,283.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
