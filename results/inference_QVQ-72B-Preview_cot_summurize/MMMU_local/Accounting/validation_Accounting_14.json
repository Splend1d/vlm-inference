                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about job costing for a new company that's started production. There are two jobs: Job 1 and Job 2. Job 1 is completed, and Job 2 is still in production. I have some data from their job cost sheets, and I need to find the balance in finished goods inventory. The options are A. $10,208, B. $10,308, C. $10,408, and D. $10,508.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what finished goods inventory represents. Finished goods inventory includes the cost of completed products that haven't been sold yet. So, in a job-order costing system, like the one being used here, each job has its own cost sheet that tracks direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.\n\nLooking at Job 1, it's completed, so its total cost should be in finished goods inventory. The total cost for Job 1 is $10,308. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, Job 2 is still in production, so its costs are still being accumulated and should be in work in process inventory, not finished goods inventory. So, the costs for Job 2 shouldn't affect the finished goods inventory balance at this point.\n\nTherefore, the balance in finished goods inventory should just be the total cost of Job 1, which is $10,308.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In job-order costing, when a job is completed, its cost is transferred from work in process inventory to finished goods inventory. Since Job 1 is completed, its cost should indeed be in finished goods inventory.\n\nJob 2 is still in production, so its costs are still in work in process inventory. Therefore, the finished goods inventory should only include Job 1's cost.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. $10,308 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any possibility that Job 2's costs could be included in finished goods inventory? No, because it's still in production.\n\nAlso, checking the image again, for Job 1, the total cost is $10,308, and for Job 2, the costs are listed as direct materials $4,060, direct labor $1,955, and manufacturing overhead $1,700, which adds up to $7,715. But since Job 2 is still in production, that $7,715 should be in work in process inventory, not finished goods.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. $10,308.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
