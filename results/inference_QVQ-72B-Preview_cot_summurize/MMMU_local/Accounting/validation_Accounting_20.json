                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we're dealing with the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which is a model that describes the relationship between expected returns and factors that influence those returns. Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which uses only one factor (the market return), APT considers multiple factors that can affect security returns.\n\nFrom the problem, we have a table that shows two portfolios, A and B, each with their betas on two factors, F1 and F2, and their corresponding expected returns. We also have the risk-free rate, which is the yield on T-bills, at 6%. Our goal is to find the expected rate of return on a stock that is fairly priced according to this model.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how APT works. The APT model suggests that the expected return on a security can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = r_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 + \\dots + b_{in}RP_n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on security i.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( b_{in} \\) is the beta of security i with factor n.\n\n- \\( RP_n \\) is the risk premium for factor n.\n\nIn this problem, there are two factors, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = r_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 \\]\n\nWe are given two portfolios, A and B, with their betas on F1 and F2, and their expected returns. We can set up two equations based on this data:\n\nFor Portfolio A:\n\n\\[ 31\\% = 6\\% + 1.5 \\times RP_1 + 2.0 \\times RP_2 \\]\n\nFor Portfolio B:\n\n\\[ 27\\% = 6\\% + 2.2 \\times RP_1 + (-0.2) \\times RP_2 \\]\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, RP1 and RP2.\n\nLet's write these equations again for clarity:\n\n1. \\( 31 = 6 + 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\)\n\n2. \\( 27 = 6 + 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\ )\n\nFirst, I'll simplify both equations by subtracting 6% from both sides:\n\n1. \\( 25 = 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\)\n\n2. \\( 21 = 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\)\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for RP1 and RP2. I can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. I think the elimination method might be easier here.\n\nLet's try to eliminate RP2. To do that, I can multiply the second equation by 10 to make the coefficients of RP2 comparable.\n\nMultiplying equation 2 by 10:\n\n\\[ 210 = 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 \\]\n\nNow, I can add this to equation 1 multiplied by 2 to eliminate RP2.\n\nFirst, multiply equation 1 by 2:\n\n\\[ 50 = 3RP_1 + 4RP_2 \\]\n\nNow, add this to the modified equation 2:\n\n\\[ 210 + 50 = 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 + 3RP_1 + 4RP_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 260 = 25RP_1 + 2RP_2 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations.\n\nActually, when I add equation 1 multiplied by 2 to equation 2 multiplied by 10, I should be careful with the signs.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nEquation 1 * 2:\n\n\\[ 50 = 3RP_1 + 4RP_2 \\]\n\nEquation 2 * 10:\n\n\\[ 210 = 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 \\]\n\nNow, if I add these two equations:\n\n\\[ 50 + 210 = 3RP_1 + 4RP_2 + 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 260 = 25RP_1 + 2RP_2 \\]\n\nHmm, this seems correct. Now, I have:\n\n\\[ 260 = 25RP_1 + 2RP_2 \\]\n\nBut this is just one equation. I need another equation to solve for RP1 and RP2. Wait, I already have two equations; I think I messed up the elimination process.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can solve one of the original equations for one variable and substitute into the other.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n\\[ 25 = 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\]\n\nLet's solve for RP1:\n\n\\[ 1.5RP_1 = 25 - 2.0RP_2 \\]\n\n\\[ RP_1 = \\frac{25 - 2.0RP_2}{1.5} \\]\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\n\\[ 21 = 2.2\\left( \\frac{25 - 2.0RP_2}{1.5} \\right) - 0.2RP_2 \\]\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to solve this system.\n\nAlternatively, I can use matrices to solve the system. Let's write the system in matrix form:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1.5 & 2.0 \\\\ 2.2 & -0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} RP_1 \\\\ RP_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 25 \\\\ 21 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( \\begin{bmatrix} RP_1 \\\\ RP_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\), I can multiply both sides by the inverse of the coefficient matrix.\n\nFirst, find the inverse of the matrix:\n\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.5 & 2.0 \\\\ 2.2 & -0.2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nThe inverse of A is:\n\n\\[ A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(1.5)(-0.2) - (2.0)(2.2)} \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2 & -2.0 \\\\ -2.2 & 1.5 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nCalculate the determinant:\n\n\\[ \\text{det}(A) = (1.5)(-0.2) - (2.0)(2.2) = -0.3 - 4.4 = -4.7 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-4.7} \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2 & -2.0 \\\\ -2.2 & 1.5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.042553 & 0.425532 \\\\ 0.468085 & -0.319149 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nNow, multiply A^{-1} by the constants vector:\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} RP_1 \\\\ RP_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.042553 & 0.425532 \\\\ 0.468085 & -0.319149 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 25 \\\\ 21 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\nCalculate each component:\n\n\\[ RP_1 = (0.042553)(25) + (0.425532)(21) \\]\n\n\\[ RP_1 = 1.063825 + 8.936174 = 10\\% \\]\n\n\\[ RP_2 = (0.468085)(25) + (-0.319149)(21) \\]\n\n\\[ RP_2 = 11.702125 - 6.702129 = 5\\% \\]\n\nSo, RP1 = 10% and RP2 = 5%.\n\nNow, the APT model equation is:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = r_f + b_{i1}RP_1 + b_{i2}RP_2 \\]\n\nFor a fairly priced stock, this should hold true. But the problem is asking for the expected rate of return on this stock if the market views the stock as fairly priced. I think it's implying that given the factors and their risk premiums, what would be the expected return for a stock with certain betas.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify the betas for this particular stock. It only provides the betas for portfolios A and B. Maybe I need to assume that the stock has the same betas as one of the portfolios or perhaps a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock is one of these portfolios. Let's see.\n\nIf the stock is Portfolio A, then its expected return would be 31%, but that seems too high. Maybe it's a different stock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has betas that are a combination of A and B.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide specific betas for the stock in question, which makes it tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the stock's betas are such that its expected return matches the APT model with the risk premiums I just calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing whether I can derive the expected return for a stock with specific betas using the APT model.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: \"find the expected rate of return on this stock if the market views the stock as fairly priced.\"\n\nIt seems like the stock's betas are not provided, but perhaps I need to find the expected return such that the stock is fairly priced given the APT model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the risk premiums to find the expected return for a stock with betas equal to 1 for both factors.\n\nBut that's just a guess. Let's try that.\n\nIf a stock has beta on F1 = 1 and beta on F2 = 1, then its expected return would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1 \\times 10\\% + 1 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 10\\% + 5\\% = 21\\% \\]\n\nBut 21% is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has betas proportional to the market portfolio. But without more information, that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the information from portfolios A and B to find the market portfolio's betas and then use that to find the expected return.\n\nBut that seems like CAPM thinking, and we're dealing with APT here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can use the APT model to find the expected return for a stock with zero betas.\n\nBut again, without specific betas, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is implying that the stock is fairly priced, meaning that its expected return should satisfy the APT model, and I need to find the expected return that aligns with the risk premiums I've calculated.\n\nBut again, without knowing the stock's betas, it's challenging to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the expected return for a stock with betas equal to the average of portfolios A and B.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nPortfolio A: beta on F1 = 1.5, beta on F2 = 2.0\n\nPortfolio B: beta on F1 = 2.2, beta on F2 = -0.2\n\nAverage beta on F1: (1.5 + 2.2)/2 = 1.85\n\nAverage beta on F2: (2.0 - 0.2)/2 = 0.9\n\nThen, the expected return for a stock with these average betas would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.85 \\times 10\\% + 0.9 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 18.5\\% + 4.5\\% = 29\\% \\]\n\nBut 29% isn't among the options either.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the expected return on a stock that is fairly priced, meaning that its expected return is such that it lies on the APT security market line, and perhaps it's a minimal variance portfolio or something similar.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the risk premiums I calculated are based on the assumption that the portfolios are fairly priced, and now I need to find the expected return for a stock that is also fairly priced, meaning its expected return should satisfy the APT model with those risk premiums.\n\nBut again, without knowing the stock's betas, I can't proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I understand that in a no-arbitrage equilibrium, the expected return of any stock should be consistent with the factor risk premiums derived from the market portfolios.\n\nBut this is getting too theoretical.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I need to use the concept of arbitrage to find the expected return.\n\nSuppose I have a stock with certain betas, and I want to ensure that its expected return is such that there's no arbitrage opportunity.\n\nBut without knowing the stock's betas, it's hard to apply this directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is implying that the stock has betas that are a combination of A and B, and I need to find the expected return that makes the stock fairly priced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can derive the expected return for a stock with betas equal to the factor loadings.\n\nBut I'm still stuck without specific betas.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. 17.4%\n\nB. 18.1%\n\nC. 18.5%\n\nNone of these match the calculations I've done so far.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the stock has betas of 1 for both factors.\n\nThen, the expected return would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1 \\times 10\\% + 1 \\times 5\\% = 21\\% \\]\n\nBut that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock has betas equal to the risk premiums.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the risk premiums are the slopes of the factor loadings.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is testing whether I can use the APT model to find the expected return for a stock with zero betas.\n\nIn that case, the expected return would be equal to the risk-free rate, which is 6%, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can find the expected return for a stock with betas that are the averages of the market betas.\n\nBut I already tried that and got 29%, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the stock has betas proportional to the market portfolio.\n\nBut without more information, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing whether I can use the APT model to find the expected return for a stock with betas that are the market betas.\n\nBut again, without specific betas, it's hard to proceed.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps the problem is missing some information, like the betas for the stock in question.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's impossible to determine the expected return without knowing the stock's factor loadings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate the expected return for a stock with betas that are the risk premiums divided by some factor.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the risk premiums are such that the expected return for a stock with unit betas is the risk-free rate plus the risk premiums.\n\nBut that still doesn't give me a specific expected return.\n\nLet me try to think about this differently. Maybe the problem is testing whether I can use the APT model to find the expected return for a stock that is fairly priced, meaning that its expected return is consistent with the factor risk premiums.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to set up the APT equation for the stock and solve for the expected return.\n\nGiven that the risk premiums are RP1 = 10% and RP2 = 5%, and assuming the stock has betas of 1 for both factors, then:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1 \\times 10\\% + 1 \\times 5\\% = 21\\% \\]\n\nBut that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has betas that are half of the risk premiums.\n\nFor example, beta on F1 = RP1 / 2 = 5%, and beta on F2 = RP2 / 2 = 2.5%.\n\nThen, the expected return would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 5\\% \\times 10\\% + 2.5\\% \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 0.5\\% + 0.125\\% = 6.625\\% \\]\n\nStill not among the options.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider that the risk premiums correspond to the differences in expected returns between the portfolios and the risk-free rate.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFor Portfolio A:\n\n\\[ 31\\% = 6\\% + 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 25\\% = 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\]\n\nFor Portfolio B:\n\n\\[ 27\\% = 6\\% + 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 21\\% = 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\]\n\nNow, solving this system again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me use the elimination method again.\n\nMultiply the first equation by 0.2:\n\n\\[ 0.2 \\times 25\\% = 0.2 \\times (1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2) \\]\n\n\\[ 5\\% = 0.3RP_1 + 0.4RP_2 \\]\n\nNow, multiply the second equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 21\\% = 2 \\times (2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP"
