                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on process costing, but I remember that the weighted-average method combines the costs of beginning work in process (WIP) and the costs added during the period, then calculates the equivalent units based on the units completed and transferred out, plus the equivalent units in ending WIP.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what equivalent units are. They represent the amount of work done, taking into account both the units completed and the units in process. Since materials are added at the beginning of the process, the materials portion is fully complete for all units that were started, regardless of whether they're completed or still in process. However, conversion costs (like labor and overhead) are added throughout the process, so the completion percentage for conversion costs in the ending WIP is given for each quarter.\n\nBut wait, the table shows \"Beginning Work in Process,\" \"Started,\" \"Transferred Out,\" and \"Conversion (\\%)\u201d for each quarter. It also mentions that materials are added at the beginning of the process, so for equivalent units of materials, all units started are considered 100% complete for materials, regardless of their stage of completion for conversion costs.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that materials are added at the beginning of the process, so perhaps all units started are considered to have materials fully added, even if they haven't been fully processed yet.\n\nLet me recall the formula for equivalent units:\n\nEquivalent Units = Units Transferred Out + (Ending WIP Inventory \u00d7 Percentage Complete)\n\nBut in this case, I need to calculate equivalent units for conversion costs. Materials are added at the beginning, so for materials, the equivalent units would be different.\n\nWait, but the question is only asking for conversion costs, so I don't need to calculate materials separately. That simplifies things.\n\nLet me look at the table again:\n\nTable:![Picture 1]\n\n\n\nFor each quarter, I need to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what the ending WIP is for each quarter.\n\nStarting with Quarter 1:\n\nBeginning WIP: \u2014\n\nStarted: 255,000\n\nTransferred Out: 235,000\n\nConversion (\\%): 50\n\nSo, ending WIP for Quarter 1 is Started minus Transferred Out.\n\nEnding WIP = 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs in Quarter 1:\n\nUnits Transferred Out: 235,000\n\nEnding WIP: 20,000 units \u00d7 50\\% = 10,000 equivalent units\n\nTotal equivalent units for conversion costs in Quarter 1: 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nWait, but that seems straightforward. Is there something I'm missing?\n\nLet me check Quarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500\n\nStarted: 275,000\n\nTransferred Out: 250,000\n\nConversion (\\%): 40\n\nEnding WIP = Started - Transferred Out = 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs:\n\nUnits Transferred Out: 250,000\n\nEnding WIP: 25,000 units \u00d7 40\\% = 10,000 equivalent units\n\nTotal equivalent units: 250,000 + 10,000 = 260,000\n\nWait, but the beginning WIP is 2,500 units. Does that affect the calculation?\n\nIn the weighted-average method, the beginning WIP is already included in the units transferred out or the ending WIP. Since the beginning WIP is part of the units started, I need to account for it properly.\n\nMaybe I should use the formula:\n\nEquivalent units = Units transferred out + (Ending WIP \u00d7 Percentage Complete)\n\nBut in this case, the beginning WIP might already be considered in the units transferred out.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps I should calculate the total units to account for, which includes the beginning WIP and the units started.\n\nFor Quarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTotal units to account for: 2,500 + 275,000 = 277,500 units\n\nTransferred Out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 277,500 - 250,000 = 27,500 units\n\nBut earlier, I calculated ending WIP as started minus transferred out, which was 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the beginning WIP is already in process and may have some conversion costs already invested.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up the formula for equivalent units in the weighted-average method.\n\nIn the weighted-average method, the equivalent units for conversion costs are calculated as:\n\nEquivalent units = Units transferred out + (Ending WIP inventory \u00d7 Percentage complete for conversion)\n\nBeginning WIP is already included in the units transferred out or in the ending WIP, depending on their completion status.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor Quarter 2:\n\nUnits transferred out: 250,000\n\nEnding WIP: Started - Transferred out = 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs: 250,000 + (25,000 \u00d7 40\\%) = 250,000 + 10,000 = 260,000\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the total units to account for are 277,500, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the beginning WIP is part of the units transferred out.\n\nLet me see:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: Started - Transferred out = 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units\n\nBut total units accounted for: Transferred out + Ending WIP = 250,000 + 25,000 = 275,000, which matches the units started.\n\nSo where does the beginning WIP fit in? It seems like the beginning WIP is part of the units transferred out.\n\nWait, perhaps the beginning WIP is included in the units transferred out.\n\nLet me assume that the beginning WIP is completed and transferred out in the current period.\n\nSo, for Quarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: Started - Transferred out = 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units\n\nBut total units accounted for: Transferred out + Ending WIP = 250,000 + 25,000 = 275,000, which matches the units started.\n\nHowever, the beginning WIP is already in process and may have some conversion costs already applied.\n\nIn the weighted-average method, the beginning WIP is considered as part of the units transferred out.\n\nTherefore, the units transferred out include both the beginning WIP and the units started and completed in the current period.\n\nSo, in Quarter 2:\n\nUnits transferred out: 250,000\n\nEnding WIP: 25,000 units at 40\\% complete for conversion\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs: 250,000 + (25,000 \u00d7 40\\%) = 250,000 + 10,000 = 260,000\n\nSimilarly, for Quarter 1:\n\nBeginning WIP: none\n\nStarted: 255,000\n\nTransferred out: 235,000\n\nEnding WIP: 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units at 50\\% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 50\\%) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nFor Quarter 3:\n\nBeginning WIP: 3,600 units\n\nStarted: 290,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 275,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 290,000 - 275,000 = 15,000 units at 45\\% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 275,000 + (15,000 \u00d7 45\\%) = 275,000 + 6,750 = 281,750\n\nFor Quarter 4:\n\nBeginning WIP: 6,500 units\n\nStarted: 300,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 280,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 300,000 - 280,000 = 20,000 units at 60\\% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 280,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 60\\%) = 280,000 + 12,000 = 292,000\n\nNow, adding up the equivalent units for all four quarters:\n\nQuarter 1: 245,000\n\nQuarter 2: 260,000\n\nQuarter 3: 281,750\n\nQuarter 4: 292,000\n\nTotal equivalent units: 245,000 + 260,000 + 281,750 + 292,000 = 1,078,750\n\nBut the question says to assume that the quarters are independent, so perhaps I need to consider each quarter separately.\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided are:\n\nA. 132,625\n\nB. 134,485\n\nC. 135,332\n\nD. 132,685\n\nNone of these match the total I calculated, which is 1,078,750. Maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter separately, and I need to choose from the options provided, which seem to be individual quarter totals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total equivalent units for all quarters combined, but the options are in thousands or something, but that doesn't make sense because my total is over a million.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not summing all quarters but asking for a specific quarter's equivalent units.\n\nLooking back, the question says: \"what are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method? Assume that the quarters are independent.\"\n\nThen, it presents multiple-choice options, but they are likely for a specific quarter, not the total.\n\nGiven that, perhaps each option corresponds to one of the quarters.\n\nLooking at my calculations:\n\nQuarter 1: 245,000\n\nQuarter 2: 260,000\n\nQuarter 3: 281,750\n\nQuarter 4: 292,000\n\nNone of these match the options provided directly, as the options are in the 130,000 range.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the options are for a different scenario or perhaps there's a miscalculation in my approach.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation for Quarter 1.\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nBeginning WIP: none\n\nStarted: 255,000\n\nTransferred out: 235,000\n\nEnding WIP: 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units at 50% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 235,000 + (20,000 * 0.5) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units at 40% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 250,000 + (25,000 * 0.4) = 250,000 + 10,000 = 260,000\n\nAgain, seems correct.\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nBeginning WIP: 3,600 units\n\nStarted: 290,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 275,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 290,000 - 275,000 = 15,000 units at 45% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 275,000 + (15,000 * 0.45) = 275,000 + 6,750 = 281,750\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nBeginning WIP: 6,500 units\n\nStarted: 300,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 280,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 300,000 - 280,000 = 20,000 units at 60% complete\n\nEquivalent units: 280,000 + (20,000 * 0.6) = 280,000 + 12,000 = 292,000\n\nTotal equivalent units: 245,000 + 260,000 + 281,750 + 292,000 = 1,078,750\n\nBut the options are in the 130,000 range, which doesn't match any of my calculations.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Let's read it again:\n\n\"The following data show the units in beginning work in process inventory, the number of units started, the number of units transferred, and the percent completion of the ending work in process for conversion. Given that materials are added at the beginning of the process, what are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method? Assume that the quarters are independent.\"\n\nThen, there's an image reference, which isn't present here, but assuming it's the same table as provided.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for a specific quarter, not the total across all quarters.\n\nBut the options are A. 132,625, B. 134,485, C. 135,332, D. 132,685, which don't match any of my per-quarter calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the equivalent units for materials, even though it specifies conversion costs.\n\nWait, the question explicitly says \"for conversion costs,\" so I should focus only on conversion costs.\n\nGiven that materials are added at the beginning, perhaps there's a different approach needed.\n\nLet me consider that materials are 100% complete for all units started, regardless of their stage of completion for conversion costs.\n\nTherefore, for materials, the equivalent units would be:\n\nUnits started + ending WIP (since materials are 100% complete for all units started)\n\nBut since the question is only about conversion costs, I can ignore materials for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the beginning WIP has some conversion costs already applied, and I need to account for that in the equivalent units.\n\nLet me try a different approach for Quarter 2.\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units at an unknown completion percentage for conversion costs.\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units at 40% complete for conversion costs.\n\nIn the weighted-average method, the beginning WIP's conversion costs are already included in the units transferred out.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent units for conversion costs would be:\n\nUnits transferred out + (ending WIP \u00d7 percentage complete)\n\n= 250,000 + (25,000 \u00d7 0.4)\n\n= 250,000 + 10,000\n\n= 260,000\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a miscalculation in the ending WIP.\n\nLet me verify the ending WIP calculation.\n\nIn Quarter 2:\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units\n\nBut the table shows \"Beginning Work in Process\" as 2,500 units for Quarter 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the beginning WIP is part of the units started.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nTotal units to account for in Quarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\nStarted: 275,000 units\n\nTotal units available: 2,500 + 275,000 = 277,500 units\n\nTransferred out: 250,000 units\n\nEnding WIP: 277,500 - 250,000 = "
