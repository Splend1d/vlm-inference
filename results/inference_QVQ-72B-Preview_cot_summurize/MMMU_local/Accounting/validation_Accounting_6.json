                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have job cost sheets with some information about four jobs: AA2, AA4, AA5, and AA3. The table provided shows costs for January, February, and March, and also indicates when each job was completed and sold. The question is asking for the balances in Work in Process Inventory, Finished Goods Inventory, and Cost of Goods Sold for January.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these accounts represents:\n\n1. **Work in Process Inventory (WIP):** This account includes the costs of incomplete jobs at the end of the period.\n\n2. **Finished Goods Inventory:** This account includes the costs of completed jobs that haven't been sold yet.\n\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This is the cost of the jobs that have been completed and sold during the period.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine the balances for January, so I should focus on the status of each job as of the end of January.\n\nLet's look at each job one by one:\n\n1. **Job AA2:**\n\n- January cost: $2,500\n\n- February cost: $1,200\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: Not sold\n\nSo, in January, $2,500 was spent on AA2, but since it was completed in February, it was still in progress in January. Therefore, this $2,500 should be in WIP for January.\n\n2. **Job AA4:**\n\n- January cost: $4,838\n\n- Completed: January\n\n- Sold: February\n\nThis job was completed in January and sold in February. So, in January, it was finished but not yet sold. Therefore, its cost should be in Finished Goods Inventory at the end of January.\n\n3. **Job AA5:**\n\n- February cost: $3,250\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: March\n\nSince there's no January cost for AA5, it must have started in February. It was completed in February and sold in March. So, in January, this job didn't exist yet, hence no impact on January's balances.\n\n4. **Job AA3:**\n\n- February cost: $3,409\n\n- March cost: $2,319\n\n- Completed: April\n\n- Sold: Not sold\n\nThis job started in February, continued in March, and was completed in April. So, in January, it hadn't started yet, meaning no costs allocated to it in January.\n\nNow, let's summarize the costs and their statuses as of January:\n\n- **WIP Inventory (January):** This includes the costs of jobs that are in progress at the end of January.\n\n- Job AA2: $2,500\n\n- Job AA4: Not in progress in January; it was completed in January.\n\nWait a minute, if Job AA4 was completed in January, it shouldn't be in WIP at the end of January because it was finished during the month.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider the timing of when jobs are started, completed, and sold.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should track the costs incurred each month and see where they land based on the job's status.\n\nBut the question is specifically about January's balances.\n\nLet me consider the total costs incurred up to January for each job and see their status at the end of January.\n\nFirst, let's list all the costs for each job:\n\n1. **Job AA2:**\n\n- January: $2,500\n\n- February: $1,200\n\n- Total cost: $2,500 + $1,200 = $3,700\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: Not sold\n\n2. **Job AA4:**\n\n- January: $4,838\n\n- Total cost: $4,838\n\n- Completed: January\n\n- Sold: February\n\n3. **Job AA5:**\n\n- February: $3,250\n\n- Total cost: $3,250\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: March\n\n4. **Job AA3:**\n\n- February: $3,409\n\n- March: $2,319\n\n- Total cost: $3,409 + $2,319 = $5,728\n\n- Completed: April\n\n- Sold: Not sold\n\nNow, for January's balances:\n\n- **Work in Process (WIP):** Includes the costs of jobs that are started but not completed by the end of January.\n\n- Job AA2 was in progress in January and not completed until February, so its January cost ($2,500) should be in WIP.\n\n- Job AA4 was completed in January, so its costs should be transferred out of WIP.\n\n- Jobs AA5 and AA3 hadn't started yet in January, so no costs in WIP related to them.\n\nWait, but Job AA4 was completed in January, so its costs should have been moved from WIP to Finished Goods Inventory since it was finished but not yet sold in January.\n\nSimilarly, Job AA2 was still in progress in January, so its $2,500 should remain in WIP.\n\nBut according to the table, Job AA4 was completed in January and sold in February. So, in January, it was finished but not sold yet, so its cost should be in Finished Goods Inventory.\n\nBut when we complete a job, we transfer its cost from WIP to Finished Goods Inventory, and when we sell it, we transfer its cost from Finished Goods Inventory to Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nGiven that, let's see the sequence:\n\n- **WIP Inventory:** Costs of jobs in progress.\n\n- **Finished Goods Inventory:** Costs of completed jobs not yet sold.\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** Costs of jobs sold during the period.\n\nNow, for January:\n\n- WIP should include the costs of jobs that were in progress at the end of January.\n\n- Finished Goods Inventory should include the costs of jobs completed in January that weren't sold by the end of January.\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold should include the costs of jobs sold in January.\n\nLooking back at the jobs:\n\n1. **Job AA2:**\n\n- In progress in January, completed in February.\n\n- Costs: $2,500 (Jan) + $1,200 (Feb) = $3,700 total.\n\n- In WIP in January: $2,500.\n\n- In WIP in February: $2,500 + $1,200 = $3,700.\n\n- Completed in February, so its costs would be transferred to Finished Goods in February.\n\n2. **Job AA4:**\n\n- Started and completed in January.\n\n- Costs: $4,838.\n\n- Since it was completed in January, its costs should be in Finished Goods Inventory in January.\n\n- Sold in February, so in January, it's in Finished Goods.\n\n3. **Job AA5:**\n\n- Started in February, completed in February.\n\n- Costs: $3,250.\n\n- Not started in January, so no impact on January's WIP.\n\n- Completed in February, sold in March.\n\n4. **Job AA3:**\n\n- Started in February, continued in March, completed in April.\n\n- Costs: $3,409 (Feb) + $2,319 (Mar) = $5,728 total.\n\n- Not started in January, so no impact on January's WIP.\n\n- Completed in April, so its costs would be in WIP in February and March, then transferred to Finished Goods in April.\n\nNow, considering all this, let's calculate the balances for January:\n\n- **WIP Inventory (January):** Only Job AA2's January costs, which is $2,500.\n\n- **Finished Goods Inventory (January):** Job AA4's costs, which is $4,838.\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (January):** No jobs were sold in January, as Job AA4 was sold in February.\n\nWait, but according to the options, some show Cost of Goods Sold in January, but according to the information, nothing was sold in January. So, COGS for January should be $0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2,500 4,838 0\n\nB. 3,409 6,950 4,838\n\nC. 5,728 3,700 3,250\n\nD. 5,728 3,409 2,500\n\nOption A seems to align with my calculations:\n\n- WIP: $2,500 (Job AA2's January costs)\n\n- Finished Goods: $4,838 (Job AA4's costs)\n\n- COGS: $0 (no jobs sold in January)\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any possibility of other jobs contributing to these balances.\n\nLooking again at Job AA5 and AA3, since they started in February, their costs don't affect January's balances.\n\nIs there any other job that might have been started in January but not listed here? The table includes all jobs mentioned, so I assume these are the only jobs in consideration.\n\nTherefore, the correct balances for January are:\n\n- WIP: $2,500\n\n- Finished Goods: $4,838\n\n- COGS: $0\n\nWhich corresponds to option A.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
