                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Baxter Company with a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The cost data given is for 25,000 units, and it's average variable costs per unit. The question is asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs if 15,000 units are produced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's included in manufacturing overhead. From the table provided, we have direct materials, direct labor, indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed selling and administrative expenses, and variable sales commissions. Manufacturing overhead typically includes both fixed and variable costs that are indirect to the production process. So, in this case, manufacturing overhead would consist of indirect materials and both fixed and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Direct materials: \\$10\n\n- Direct labor: \\$9\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\n- Fixed selling and administrative expenses: \\$8\n\n- Variable sales commissions: \\$14\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is indirect materials (\\$3) plus fixed manufacturing overhead (\\$6) plus variable manufacturing overhead (\\$2), which totals to \\$11 per unit.\n\nNow, the question is, if 15,000 units are produced, what are the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred?\n\nI need to consider how fixed and variable costs behave with changes in production volume.\n\nVariable costs change in direct proportion to changes in production volume, while fixed costs remain constant in total regardless of production volume, within the relevant range.\n\nSo, for variable manufacturing overhead, which is \\$2 per unit at 25,000 units, if production decreases to 15,000 units, the variable manufacturing overhead per unit should still be \\$2 per unit, assuming no changes in variable cost per unit.\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead, on the other hand, remains constant in total but is spread over fewer units at lower production levels. So, the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead will increase when production decreases.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nGiven that fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 per unit at 25,000 units, the total fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 multiplied by 25,000 units, which equals \\$150,000.\n\nNow, if production decreases to 15,000 units, the same total fixed manufacturing overhead of \\$150,000 will be spread over fewer units.\n\nSo, the new fixed manufacturing overhead per unit would be \\$150,000 divided by 15,000 units, which is \\$10 per unit.\n\nIndirect materials are likely variable costs because they vary with production volume. At 25,000 units, it's \\$3 per unit, so at 15,000 units, it should remain \\$3 per unit.\n\nNow, to find the total manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units, I need to add the variable components and the fixed component:\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\nIndirect materials: \\$3\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: \\$10\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit = \\$2 + \\$3 + \\$10 = \\$15 per unit.\n\nWait a minute, but none of the options provided is \\$15. The options are:\n\nA. \\$10\n\nB. \\$11\n\nC. \\$12\n\nD. \\$13\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, at 25,000 units:\n\nManufacturing overhead per unit = indirect materials + fixed manufacturing overhead + variable manufacturing overhead \\(=\\$ 3+\\$ 6+\\$ 2=\\$ 11\\)\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead = \\$11 * 25,000 = \\$275,000\n\nWait, but total fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 * 25,000 = \\$150,000, and variable manufacturing overhead is \\$2 * 25,000 = \\$50,000, plus indirect materials, which are variable, \\$3 * 25,000 = \\$75,000.\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead should indeed be \\$150,000 (fixed) + \\$50,000 (variable overhead) + \\$75,000 (indirect materials) = \\$275,000.\n\nNow, at 15,000 units:\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead per unit = total fixed overhead / number of units = \\$150,000 / 15,000 = \\$10 per unit.\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead per unit remains \\$2.\n\nIndirect materials per unit remains \\$3.\n\nSo, total manufacturing overhead per unit = \\$10 (fixed) + \\$2 (variable overhead) + \\$3 (indirect materials) = \\$15 per unit.\n\nBut again, this is not among the options. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nPerhaps indirect materials are not variable costs, but I think they typically are, as they vary with production volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fixed manufacturing overhead shouldn't be included in manufacturing overhead for this context, but that doesn't make sense because fixed manufacturing overhead is indeed part of manufacturing overhead.\n\nWait, maybe the question is only asking for variable manufacturing overhead, excluding fixed components.\n\nBut no, the question says per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred, which would include both fixed and variable components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be just the variable component, which would be indirect materials plus variable manufacturing overhead, which is \\$3 + \\$2 = \\$5 per unit, but that's not among the options either.\n\nOr maybe they want only the fixed manufacturing overhead, which is \\$10 per unit at 15,000 units, but that's also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the cost classification.\n\nLet me look back at the table:\n\n- Direct materials: \\$10\n\n- Direct labor: \\$9\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\n- Fixed selling and administrative expenses: \\$8\n\n- Variable sales commissions: \\$14\n\nTotal per unit cost at 25,000 units: \\$10 + \\$9 + \\$3 + \\$6 + \\$2 + \\$8 + \\$14 = \\$52 per unit.\n\nNow, manufacturing overhead includes indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead per unit = \\$3 + \\$6 + \\$2 = \\$11 per unit.\n\nIf production decreases to 15,000 units, the variable costs remain the same per unit, so indirect materials are still \\$3, variable manufacturing overhead is still \\$2.\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead per unit increases to \\$10, as calculated earlier.\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit should be \\$3 + \\$2 + \\$10 = \\$15, but since that's not an option, maybe I need to consider that some costs don't change per unit with production volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed manufacturing overhead is supposed to be allocated based on a different method.\n\nWait, maybe the relevant range affects the fixed costs. The problem states that the relevant range is between 15,000 and 30,000 units, and the cost data is for 25,000 units.\n\nIf production decreases to 15,000 units, which is still within the relevant range, the fixed costs should remain the same in total, as you assumed.\n\nSo, total fixed manufacturing overhead is still \\$150,000, and per unit it becomes \\$10 at 15,000 units.\n\nBut again, total manufacturing overhead per unit is \\$15, which isn't an option.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that indirect materials are not variable costs or that there's another component I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only fixed manufacturing overhead to be considered as manufacturing overhead, excluding variable components.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as manufacturing overhead typically includes both fixed and variable components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"manufacturing overhead costs incurred\" refers only to fixed manufacturing overhead, in which case at 15,000 units, it's \\$10 per unit.\n\nBut that still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the total fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nAt 25,000 units, fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 per unit, so total fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 * 25,000 = \\$150,000.\n\nAt 15,000 units, total fixed manufacturing overhead remains \\$150,000, so per unit it's \\$150,000 / 15,000 = \\$10 per unit.\n\nSimilarly, variable manufacturing overhead is \\$2 per unit, which should remain \\$2 per unit at 15,000 units.\n\nIndirect materials are \\$3 per unit, assuming they are variable, so they should remain \\$3 per unit at 15,000 units.\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit: \\$2 + \\$3 + \\$10 = \\$15.\n\nStill getting \\$15, which isn't an option.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem itself or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the cost behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indirect materials are semi-variable or have some fixed component, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed manufacturing overhead changes at different production levels, but the problem states that the relevant range is between 15,000 and 30,000 units, so fixed costs should remain constant within this range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost data provided is not just for variable costs but includes fixed costs as well, and I need to consider the total costs per unit.\n\nWait, the problem says \"average variable costs per unit for 25,000 units of production.\"\n\nBut fixed costs are not variable costs; they are constant within the relevant range.\n\nSo, perhaps the cost data provided is for variable costs only, and fixed manufacturing overhead is a separate component.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says: \"the following cost data represents average variable costs per unit for 25,000 units of production.\"\n\nBut in the table, it lists direct materials, direct labor, indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed selling and administrative expenses, and variable sales commissions.\n\nWait, that's confusing. If the cost data represents average variable costs per unit, then fixed costs shouldn't be included in that data.\n\nBut in the table, fixed manufacturing overhead is listed, which is a fixed cost.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"average cost per unit\" table includes both variable and fixed costs, but the problem mentions that the cost data represents average variable costs per unit.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing average costs per unit, including both variable and fixed costs, but that contradicts the problem statement that the cost data represents average variable costs per unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is showing average costs per unit at 25,000 units, including both variable and fixed costs, and I need to separate the variable and fixed components.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's assume that at 25,000 units, the total costs are:\n\nDirect materials: \\$10 * 25,000 = \\$250,000\n\nDirect labor: \\$9 * 25,000 = \\$225,000\n\nIndirect materials: \\$3 * 25,000 = \\$75,000\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6 * 25,000 = \\$150,000\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 * 25,000 = \\$50,000\n\nFixed selling and administrative expenses: \\$8 * 25,000 = \\$200,000\n\nVariable sales commissions: \\$14 * 25,000 = \\$350,000\n\nTotal costs at 25,000 units: \\$250,000 + \\$225,000 + \\$75,000 + \\$150,000 + \\$50,000 + \\$200,000 + \\$350,000 = \\$1,290,000\n\nNow, if production decreases to 15,000 units, variable costs will decrease proportionally, while fixed costs remain the same.\n\nSo, new variable costs:\n\nDirect materials: \\$10 * 15,000 = \\$150,000\n\nDirect labor: \\$9 * 15,000 = \\$135,000\n\nIndirect materials: \\$3 * 15,000 = \\$45,000\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 * 15,000 = \\$30,000\n\nVariable sales commissions: \\$14 * 15,000 = \\$210,000\n\nTotal variable costs at 15,000 units: \\$150,000 + \\$135,000 + \\$45,000 + \\$30,000 + \\$210,000 = \\$570,000\n\nFixed costs remain the same:\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: \\$150,000\n\nFixed selling and administrative expenses: \\$200,000\n\nTotal fixed costs: \\$150,000 + \\$200,000 = \\$350,000\n\nTotal costs at 15,000 units: \\$570,000 + \\$350,000 = \\$920,000\n\nNow, manufacturing overhead includes indirect materials, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be:\n\nIndirect materials: \\$3\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: \\$10\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit: \\$15\n\nStill getting \\$15, which isn't an option.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated based on a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only fixed manufacturing overhead to be considered, excluding variable components.\n\nIn that case, fixed manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units is \\$10, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the cost behavior.\n\nWait, perhaps indirect materials are not variable costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects manufacturing overhead to include only variable components, excluding fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects manufacturing overhead to include only variable components, and fixed manufacturing overhead is considered separately.\n\nIn that case, manufacturing overhead per unit would be indirect materials (\\$3) plus variable manufacturing overhead (\\$2), totaling \\$5 per unit.\n\nBut \\$5 isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects manufacturing overhead to include only fixed manufacturing overhead, which is \\$10 per unit at 15,000 units.\n\nBut again, that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the total fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nWait, maybe the fixed manufacturing overhead is not \\$6 per unit but something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem:\n\n\"The following cost data represents average variable costs per unit for 25,000 units of production.\"\n\nBut in the table, fixed manufacturing overhead is listed as \\$6 per unit.\n\nThis is confusing because fixed costs shouldn't vary per unit; they should be constant in total within the relevant range.\n\nPerhaps the \\$6 per unit is a mislabeling, and it should be variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is showing total per unit costs, including both variable and fixed components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate manufacturing overhead per unit based on the given data, considering that some costs are fixed and others are variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that at 15,000 units, the fixed manufacturing overhead per unit increases to \\$10, as calculated, and the variable components remain the same, leading to a total manufacturing overhead per unit of \\$15.\n\nBut since \\$15 isn't an option, perhaps there's an error in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects only fixed manufacturing overhead to be considered as manufacturing overhead, excluding variable components.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be \\$10 per unit, which is option A.\n\nBut that seems incomplete because manufacturing overhead typically includes both fixed and variable components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing whether students understand that manufacturing overhead includes both fixed and variable components and can calculate the per unit cost accordingly.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier calculations leading to \\$15 per unit, but with \\$15 not being an option, I'm inclined to select option A. \\$10, assuming that only fixed manufacturing overhead is considered.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident in this choice due to the discrepancy in calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem that I'm missing.\n\nLet me try another method.\n\nSuppose that at 25,000 units, the total manufacturing overhead is \\$11 per unit (as calculated earlier), totaling \\$275,000.\n\nIf production decreases to 15,000 units, the variable manufacturing overhead would be \\$2 + \\$3 = \\$5 per unit, totaling \\$75,000.\n\nThe fixed manufacturing overhead remains \\$150,000.\n\nTherefore, total manufacturing overhead at 15,000 units is \\$75,000 (variable) + \\$150,000 (fixed) = \\$225,000.\n\nPer unit, that's \\$225,000 / 15,000 units = \\$15 per unit.\n\nAgain, arriving at \\$15 per unit, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the fixed manufacturing overhead to be considered as manufacturing overhead, excluding variable components, hence \\$10 per unit, which is option A.\n\nGiven that, and despite my initial calculations, I'll go with option A. \\$10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ \\$10} \\]"
