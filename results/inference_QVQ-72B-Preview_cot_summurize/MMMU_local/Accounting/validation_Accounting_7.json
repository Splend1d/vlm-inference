                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I'm a consultant for a manufacturing corporation that's thinking about taking on a project. The project has some after-tax cash flows, and there's a beta involved, which relates to the risk of the project. I need to find out the highest possible beta estimate for this project before its Net Present Value (NPV) turns negative. That means I need to make sure the NPV is still positive or zero, but not negative.\n\nFirst, let's understand what NPV is. NPV is a method used in capital budgeting to assess the profitability of a project or investment. It's the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows, discounted at a certain rate that reflects the risk of the project.\n\nGiven that the project's beta is 1.8, and I need to find the highest beta before NPV becomes negative. Wait, but the project's beta is already given as 1.8. Maybe there's some confusion here. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Years from Now After-Tax Cash Flow\"\n\n\"0 -40\"\n\n\"1-10 15\"\n\n\"The project's beta is 1.8. Assuming that rf = 8% and E(rM) = 16%, what is the highest possible beta estimate for the project before its NPV becomes negative?\"\n\nOkay, so the project has an initial outlay of -40 (million dollars, I assume), and then for each of the next 10 years, it generates an after-tax cash flow of 15 (million dollars each year). The risk-free rate (rf) is 8%, and the expected return on the market (E(rM)) is 16%. The project's beta is 1.8, but the question is asking for the highest possible beta before NPV becomes negative.\n\nI think what they're asking is, given the cash flows and the current beta of 1.8, what's the highest beta that would still allow the NPV to be zero or positive. In other words, beyond that beta, the NPV would turn negative.\n\nTo calculate NPV, I need to discount the future cash flows back to the present and subtract the initial investment. The discount rate should reflect the risk of the project, which can be determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\n\nThe CAPM formula is:\n\nRequired Return = rf + beta * (E(rM) - rf)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nRequired Return = 8% + 1.8 * (16% - 8%) = 8% + 1.8 * 8% = 8% + 14.4% = 22.4%\n\nSo, at a beta of 1.8, the discount rate is 22.4%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the NPV at this discount rate.\n\nThe cash flows are:\n\nYear 0: -40\n\nYears 1 through 10: 15 each year.\n\nSo, NPV = -40 + Sigma (from t=1 to 10) of 15 / (1 + 0.224)^t\n\nI can calculate this using the formula for the present value of an annuity.\n\nPV of annuity = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n\nWhere:\n\nC = cash flow per period (15)\n\nr = discount rate (0.224)\n\nn = number of periods (10)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1 + 0.224)^-10] / 0.224\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.224)^10:\n\n1.224^10 = let's say it's approximately 6.19 (I'll calculate it precisely later).\n\nSo, PV \u2248 15 * [1 - 1/6.19] / 0.224\n\nCalculate 1/6.19 \u2248 0.1616\n\nThen, 1 - 0.1616 = 0.8384\n\nNow, 15 * 0.8384 / 0.224 \u2248 15 * 3.74 \u2248 56.1\n\nSo, NPV = -40 + 56.1 = 16.1 (million dollars)\n\nThat's positive, so at beta = 1.8, NPV is positive.\n\nNow, I need to find the highest beta where NPV is still zero or positive.\n\nIn other words, find the beta where NPV = 0.\n\nLet's set up the equation for NPV = 0.\n\nNPV = -40 + 15 * [1 - (1 + r)^-10] / r = 0\n\nWhere r = rf + beta * (E(rM) - rf)\n\nSo, r = 0.08 + beta * (0.16 - 0.08) = 0.08 + beta * 0.08 = 0.08 * (1 + beta)\n\nLet me denote r = 0.08 * (1 + beta)\n\nNow, plug r back into the NPV equation:\n\n-40 + 15 * [1 - (1 + r)^-10] / r = 0\n\nThis is a bit complicated because r depends on beta, which I need to solve for.\n\nMaybe I can express beta in terms of r.\n\nFrom r = 0.08 * (1 + beta), we get beta = (r / 0.08) - 1\n\nNow, I need to substitute this expression for beta back into the NPV equation and solve for r, then find beta.\n\nSo, NPV = -40 + 15 * [1 - (1 + r)^-10] / r = 0\n\nThis is an equation that relates NPV to r.\n\nI need to find the value of r where NPV = 0.\n\nThen, use beta = (r / 0.08) - 1 to find beta.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as finding the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project and then finding the beta that corresponds to that IRR using the CAPM equation.\n\nIRR is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0.\n\nSo, IRR = r when NPV = 0.\n\nThen, beta = (IRR / 0.08) - 1\n\nWait, no. Earlier, I had r = 0.08 * (1 + beta), so beta = (r / 0.08) - 1\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, first, find r such that NPV = 0, then find beta using the above formula.\n\nBut solving for r in the NPV equation is not straightforward algebraically because it involves r inside the annuity formula.\n\nSo, I might need to use numerical methods to find r.\n\nAlternatively, I can use trial and error to find the r that makes NPV = 0.\n\nLet me try to calculate NPV at different r values and see when it crosses zero.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the PV of the annuity.\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1 + r)^-10] / r\n\nAnd NPV = -40 + PV\n\nLet me try r = 0.25 (25%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.25)^-10] / 0.25 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0561] / 0.25 \u2248 15 * 0.9439 / 0.25 \u2248 15 * 3.7756 \u2248 56.63\n\nNPV = -40 + 56.63 = 16.63 (positive)\n\nNow, r = 0.30 (30%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.3)^-10] / 0.3 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0513] / 0.3 \u2248 15 * 0.9487 / 0.3 \u2248 15 * 3.1623 \u2248 47.43\n\nNPV = -40 + 47.43 = 7.43 (still positive)\n\nr = 0.35 (35%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.35)^-10] / 0.35 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0362] / 0.35 \u2248 15 * 0.9638 / 0.35 \u2248 15 * 2.7537 \u2248 41.30\n\nNPV = -40 + 41.30 = 1.30 (still positive)\n\nr = 0.40 (40%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.4)^-10] / 0.4 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0256] / 0.4 \u2248 15 * 0.9744 / 0.4 \u2248 15 * 2.436 \u2248 36.54\n\nNPV = -40 + 36.54 = -3.46 (negative)\n\nSo, between r = 0.35 and r = 0.40, NPV changes from positive to negative.\n\nTherefore, the IRR is somewhere between 0.35 and 0.40.\n\nLet's try r = 0.375 (37.5%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.375)^-10] / 0.375 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0312] / 0.375 \u2248 15 * 0.9688 / 0.375 \u2248 15 * 2.583 \u2248 38.74\n\nNPV = -40 + 38.74 = -1.26 (negative)\n\nHmm, that's negative. Wait, earlier at r=0.35, NPV was positive, and at r=0.375, it's negative. That's not right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate PV at r=0.375.\n\n(1.375)^10 \u2248 10.292\n\nSo, (1 - 1/10.292) \u2248 0.899\n\nThen, 15 * 0.899 / 0.375 \u2248 15 * 2.397 \u2248 35.95\n\nNPV = -40 + 35.95 = -4.05 (negative)\n\nWait, but earlier at r=0.35, NPV was positive, now at r=0.375, it's negative. That suggests that the IRR is between 0.35 and 0.375.\n\nLet's try r=0.36 (36%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.36)^-10] / 0.36 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0409] / 0.36 \u2248 15 * 0.9591 / 0.36 \u2248 15 * 2.664 \u2248 39.96\n\nNPV = -40 + 39.96 = -0.04 (negative)\n\nStill negative. Wait, at r=0.35, NPV was positive, at r=0.36, it's negative. So, IRR is between 0.35 and 0.36.\n\nLet's try r=0.355 (35.5%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.355)^-10] / 0.355 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0385] / 0.355 \u2248 15 * 0.9615 / 0.355 \u2248 15 * 2.708 \u2248 40.62\n\nNPV = -40 + 40.62 = 0.62 (positive)\n\nNow, at r=0.355, NPV is positive, at r=0.36, it's negative.\n\nSo, the IRR is between 0.355 and 0.36.\n\nLet's try r=0.3575 (35.75%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.3575)^-10] / 0.3575 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0392] / 0.3575 \u2248 15 * 0.9608 / 0.3575 \u2248 15 * 2.687 \u2248 40.31\n\nNPV = -40 + 40.31 = 0.31 (positive)\n\nNow, at r=0.3575, NPV is positive, at r=0.36, it's negative.\n\nSo, IRR is between 0.3575 and 0.36.\n\nLet's try r=0.35875 (35.875%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.35875)^-10] / 0.35875 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0390] / 0.35875 \u2248 15 * 0.9610 / 0.35875 \u2248 15 * 2.680 \u2248 40.20\n\nNPV = -40 + 40.20 = 0.20 (positive)\n\nStill positive.\n\nAt r=0.36, NPV is negative.\n\nSo, IRR is between 0.35875 and 0.36.\n\nLet's try r=0.359375 (35.9375%)\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1.359375)^-10] / 0.359375 \u2248 15 * [1 - 0.0389] / 0.359375 \u2248 15 * 0.9611 / 0.359375 \u2248 15 * 2.674 \u2248 40.11\n\nNPV = -40 + 40.11 = 0.11 (positive)\n\nStill positive.\n\nAt r=0.36, NPV is negative.\n\nSo, IRR is approximately 0.359375 to 0.36.\n\nLet's assume IRR \u2248 0.3595 or 35.95%\n\nNow, this is the required return when NPV = 0.\n\nNow, using the CAPM formula, r = rf + beta * (E(rM) - rf)\n\nSo, 0.3595 = 0.08 + beta * (0.16 - 0.08)\n\n0.3595 = 0.08 + beta * 0.08\n\nbeta * 0.08 = 0.3595 - 0.08 = 0.2795\n\nbeta = 0.2795 / 0.08 \u2248 3.49375\n\nSo, the highest beta before NPV becomes negative is approximately 3.49.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.31\n\nB. 3.47\n\nC. 3.65\n\nThe closest is B. 3.47, but my calculation gives 3.49375, which is slightly higher than 3.47.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the IRR calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options have limited precision, and 3.49 rounds to 3.5, which isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider more decimal places in my IRR calculation.\n\nLet me try to find a more precise IRR.\n\nEarlier, at r=0.359375, NPV=0.11\n\nAt r=0.36, NPV=-0.04\n\nUsing linear interpolation:\n\nDelta r = 0.36 - 0.359375 = 0.000625\n\nDelta NPV = -0.04 - 0.11 = -0.15\n\nSo, for every unit change in r, NPV changes by delta NPV / delta r = -0.15 / 0.000625 = -240\n\nSo, to make NPV = 0 from 0.11, need to increase r by 0.11 / 240 \u2248 0.000458\n\nTherefore, IRR \u2248 0.359375 + 0.000458 \u2248 0.359833\n\nNow, plug this back into the CAPM formula:\n\n0.359833 = 0.08 + beta * 0.08\n\nbeta * 0.08 = 0.279833\n\nbeta \u2248 3.4979\n\nStill approximately 3.5, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the project's beta is already given as 1.8, and I need to find the highest possible beta estimate before NPV becomes negative.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the question.\n\nLet me read it again.\n\n\"The project's beta is 1.8. Assuming that rf = 8% and E(rM) = 16%, what is the highest possible beta estimate for the project before its NPV becomes negative?\"\n\nSo, the project has a beta of 1.8, and I need to find the highest beta before NPV becomes negative.\n\nWait, but"
