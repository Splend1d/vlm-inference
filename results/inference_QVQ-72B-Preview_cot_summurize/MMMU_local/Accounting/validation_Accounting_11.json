                    "text": "So I have this problem about options trading, specifically about a strangle strategy. I'm supposed to calculate the maximum possible loss per share for this strategy at expiration. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a strangle strategy is. From what I remember, a strangle involves buying a put option and a call option with different strike prices but the same expiration date. It's similar to a straddle, but with the strike prices being different. Usually, a strangle is used when you expect a big move in the stock price, but you're not sure which direction it will go.\n\nIn this case, the client believes that the stock price of TRT Materials could move substantially in either direction due to an expected court decision. The current stock price is $58 per share. The options available are a call option with a strike price of $60 and a put option with a strike price of $55, both expiring in 90 days. The call option costs $5, and the put option costs $4.\n\nSo, if I were to implement a strangle strategy, I would buy the call option with a strike of $60 and the put option with a strike of $55. The idea is that if the stock price moves significantly above $60 or below $55, the options would be in the money and I could exercise them for a profit.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the maximum possible loss per share at expiration. To find this, I need to consider the worst-case scenario for this strategy.\n\nLet's think about the possible scenarios at expiration:\n\n1. The stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration.\n\nIn this case, both the call and put options would expire out of the money. So, I would have lost the premiums I paid for both options. The total loss per share would be $5 (call premium) + $4 (put premium) = $9.\n\n2. The stock price is above $60 at expiration.\n\nHere, the call option would be in the money, and the put option would be out of the money. So, I would exercise the call option.\n\nThe profit from the call option would be the stock price at expiration minus the strike price of $60, minus the premium paid for the call option ($5).\n\nFor example, if the stock price is $65 at expiration:\n\nProfit from call = $65 - $60 - $5 = $0\n\nIf the stock price is $70 at expiration:\n\nProfit from call = $70 - $60 - $5 = $5\n\nAnd since the put option is out of the money, I lose the $4 premium.\n\nSo, total profit per share would be:\n\nProfit from call - $4 (put premium)\n\nIf the stock price is $65:\n\nTotal profit = $0 - $4 = -$4\n\nIf the stock price is $70:\n\nTotal profit = $5 - $4 = $1\n\nSo, in this scenario, the loss is less than the maximum loss.\n\n3. The stock price is below $55 at expiration.\n\nIn this case, the put option would be in the money, and the call option would be out of the money. So, I would exercise the put option.\n\nThe profit from the put option would be the strike price of $55 minus the stock price at expiration, minus the premium paid for the put option ($4).\n\nFor example, if the stock price is $50 at expiration:\n\nProfit from put = $55 - $50 - $4 = $1\n\nIf the stock price is $45 at expiration:\n\nProfit from put = $55 - $45 - $4 = $6\n\nAnd since the call option is out of the money, I lose the $5 premium.\n\nSo, total profit per share would be:\n\nProfit from put - $5 (call premium)\n\nIf the stock price is $50:\n\nTotal profit = $1 - $5 = -$4\n\nIf the stock price is $45:\n\nTotal profit = $6 - $5 = $1\n\nAgain, in this scenario, the loss is less than the maximum loss.\n\nFrom these scenarios, it seems that the worst-case scenario is when the stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration, because in that case, both options expire worthless, and I lose both premiums, totaling $9 per share.\n\nWait a minute, but in the second and third scenarios, the total loss is less than $9. For example, if the stock price is $65, I break even on the call option and lose the put premium, so total loss is $4. If the stock price is $50, I make $1 on the put option and lose the call premium, so total loss is $4.\n\nSo, the maximum loss occurs when both options expire worthless, which is when the stock price is between the two strike prices at expiration.\n\nLet me confirm this.\n\nIf the stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration:\n\n- Call option expires worthless (loss of $5)\n\n- Put option expires worthless (loss of $4)\n\nTotal loss per share: $9\n\nIf the stock price is above $60:\n\n- Call option profit = (S - 60) - 5\n\n- Put option loss = 4\n\nTotal profit = (S - 60 - 5) - 4 = S - 69\n\nSo, as long as S > 60, this is positive for S > 69, and negative otherwise.\n\nIf the stock price is below $55:\n\n- Put option profit = (55 - S) - 4\n\n- Call option loss = 5\n\nTotal profit = (55 - S - 4) - 5 = 46 - S\n\nSo, as long as S < 55, this is positive for S < 46, and negative otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the maximum loss occurs when both options expire worthless, which is when the stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration, resulting in a loss of $9 per share.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the current stock price is $58, which is between $55 and $60. So, if the stock price remains between $55 and $60 at expiration, I lose both premiums, which is $9 per share.\n\nIf the stock price goes above $60, I start making a profit when the stock price is above $69 (since profit = S - 69).\n\nIf the stock price goes below $55, I start making a profit when the stock price is below $46 (since profit = 46 - S).\n\nSo, the breakeven points are at $69 and $46.\n\nBetween $46 and $69, I have limited losses, with the maximum loss being $9 per share.\n\nOutside of that range, I can make unlimited profits in either direction.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible loss per share for this long strangle strategy at expiration is $9.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $9.00\n\nB. $5.00\n\nC. the Maximum possible loss is unlimited\n\nThe correct answer should be A. $9.00.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where the loss could be more than $9 per share?\n\nAs I've analyzed, the worst-case scenario is when the stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration, resulting in a loss of $9 per share.\n\nIf the stock price goes above $60, the profit increases as the stock price increases.\n\nSimilarly, if the stock price goes below $55, the profit increases as the stock price decreases.\n\nTherefore, the maximum loss is indeed $9 per share.\n\nSo, the answer is A. $9.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
