                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these finance concepts, but I think I can figure it out with the information given.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the required rate of return for SmileWhite Corporation using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM formula is:\n\n\\[ r = r_f + \\beta \\times (r_m - r_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the stock's beta.\n\n- \\( r_m \\) is the expected market return.\n\nFrom the table, I have:\n\n- Risk-free rate (\\( r_f \\)) = 4.50%\n\n- Expected market return (\\( r_m \\)) = 14.50%\n\n- Beta for SmileWhite = 1.15\n\nPlugging these values into the CAPM formula:\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 1.15 \\times (14.5\\% - 4.5\\%) \\]\n\nLet me calculate the difference inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 14.5\\% - 4.5\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nNow, multiply that by the beta:\n\n\\[ 1.15 \\times 10\\% = 11.5\\% \\]\n\nFinally, add the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 11.5\\% = 16\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required rate of return for SmileWhite is 16%.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. 14%\n\nB. 15%\n\nC. 16%\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be C. 16%.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the CAPM formula seems right: required return equals the risk-free rate plus beta times the market risk premium.\n\nI have the risk-free rate as 4.5%, which is given.\n\nThe expected market return is 14.5%.\n\nThe beta for SmileWhite is 1.15.\n\nSo, plugging those numbers in:\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 1.15 \\times (14.5\\% - 4.5\\%) \\]\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 1.15 \\times 10\\% \\]\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 11.5\\% \\]\n\n\\[ r = 16\\% \\]\n\nEverything checks out. Seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the required return.\n\nThe problem mentions that Janet Ludlow's firm requires analysts to use a two-stage dividend discount model (DDM) and the CAPM to value stocks. However, since the question only asks for the required rate of return and provides the CAPM inputs, it seems appropriate to use the CAPM directly.\n\nIf I were to use the DDM, I'd need information about the dividends and the growth rates, which isn't provided here. So, I think using the CAPM is the way to go for this specific question.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the required return should be adjusted based on other factors not included in the CAPM, like size, value, or momentum factors. But the problem specifies using the CAPM, so I should stick with that.\n\nAdditionally, the table includes information about QuickBrush, such as its beta, market price, intrinsic value, and so on. But since the question is about SmileWhite, I don't think those details are relevant here.\n\nWait, just to be sure, let's look back at the problem:\n\n\"Using the CAPM and DDM, Ludlow has valued QuickBrush Company at $63 per share. She now must value SmileWhite Corporation. Calculate the required rate of return for SmileWhite by using the information in the following table.\"\n\nThe table provides data for both QuickBrush and SmileWhite, but the notes only mention the risk-free rate and expected market return, which are common to both.\n\nSo, again, focusing on SmileWhite, with its beta of 1.15, and applying the CAPM formula, I arrive at 16%.\n\nI think that's the answer: 16%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16\\%} \\]"
