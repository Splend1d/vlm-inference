                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Baxter Company with a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The cost data given is for 25,000 units, and we need to find out the per unit manufacturing overhead costs if 30,000 units are produced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's included in manufacturing overhead. From the table, we have direct materials, direct labor, indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed selling and administrative expenses, and variable sales commissions. Manufacturing overhead typically includes both variable and fixed costs related to the manufacturing process, so that would be indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nSo, from the table:\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3 per unit\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6 per unit\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 per unit\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is \\$3 + \\$6 + \\$2 = \\$11 per unit.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs if 30,000 units are produced. Since we're dealing with variable and fixed costs, I need to consider how these costs behave with changes in production volume.\n\nVariable costs change in proportion to the level of production, while fixed costs remain constant within the relevant range.\n\nSo, variable manufacturing overhead should increase proportionally with production, but fixed manufacturing overhead should stay the same in total, even though the per unit fixed cost will decrease as production increases.\n\nLet me think about this again.\n\nAt 25,000 units:\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 per unit\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6 per unit\n\nBut per unit costs can be misleading. Maybe I should find the total manufacturing overhead at 25,000 units and then see how it changes at 30,000 units.\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead at 25,000 units:\n\n- Variable: \\$2 per unit * 25,000 units = \\$50,000\n\n- Fixed: \\$6 per unit * 25,000 units = \\$150,000 (but wait, fixed costs don't change with production volume, so maybe I shouldn't multiply by units.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to treat fixed manufacturing overhead as a total cost and then find the per unit cost at different production levels.\n\nLet me assume that fixed manufacturing overhead is a total cost within the relevant range. So, at 25,000 units, the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6, meaning the total fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 * 25,000 = \\$150,000.\n\nSimilarly, variable manufacturing overhead is \\$2 per unit, so total variable manufacturing overhead at 25,000 units is \\$2 * 25,000 = \\$50,000.\n\nNow, if production increases to 30,000 units, the total variable manufacturing overhead would be \\$2 * 30,000 = \\$60,000.\n\nThe total manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units would be total variable + total fixed = \\$60,000 + \\$150,000 = \\$210,000.\n\nThen, the per unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units would be total manufacturing overhead divided by the number of units: \\$210,000 / 30,000 = \\$7 per unit.\n\nWait a minute, but in the options, \\$7 is one of them. So, according to this calculation, the answer should be B. \\$7.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirm that fixed manufacturing overhead doesn't change within the relevant range, which is between 15,000 and 30,000 units. Since 30,000 units are within this range, the total fixed manufacturing overhead should remain the same as at 25,000 units, which is \\$150,000.\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead should increase proportionally with production, so from \\$50,000 at 25,000 units to \\$60,000 at 30,000 units.\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units: \\$60,000 + \\$150,000 = \\$210,000.\n\nPer unit manufacturing overhead: \\$210,000 / 30,000 = \\$7.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to consider the behavior of costs using the high-low method or another cost estimation technique, but given the information provided, it seems straightforward to use the variable and fixed cost components to calculate the per unit manufacturing overhead at the new production level.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the per unit fixed cost changes because fixed costs are spread over more units, leading to a lower per unit fixed cost.\n\nAt 25,000 units: \\$6 per unit\n\nAt 30,000 units: \\$150,000 / 30,000 = \\$5 per unit\n\nSo, per unit fixed cost decreases to \\$5, and variable remains at \\$2, totaling \\$7 per unit.\n\nWait, earlier I thought fixed costs don't change per unit, but actually, in cost accounting, fixed costs per unit do change with production volume because they're spread over more units.\n\nSo, my initial approach was correct in calculating total fixed costs and then dividing by the number of units to get the per unit fixed cost at different production levels.\n\nTherefore, the per unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units is indeed \\$7.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$7} \\]"
