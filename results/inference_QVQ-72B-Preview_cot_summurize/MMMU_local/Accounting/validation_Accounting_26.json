                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Baghdad Company makes one product, and they've found out that they can raise the price by 10% without losing any customers. All other costs stay the same. I need to find out what their new break-even point is in terms of units and dollars after this price increase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the CVP (Cost-Volume-Profit) analysis they provided. Here's what it shows:\n\n- Units sold: 1,450\n\n- Sales price per unit: \\$90\n\n- Variable cost per unit: \\$40\n\n- Contribution margin per unit: \\$50\n\n- Fixed costs: \\$20,650\n\n- Break-even (in units): 413\n\n- Break-even (in dollars): \\$37,170\n\n- Sales: \\$130,500\n\n- Variable costs: \\$58,000\n\n- Contribution margin: \\$72,500\n\n- Fixed costs: \\$20,650\n\n- Net income (loss): \\$51,850\n\nOkay, so the current sales price is \\$90 per unit, and they're selling 1,450 units, which matches the sales of \\$130,500 (because 1,450 * 90 = 130,500). The variable cost per unit is \\$40, so the contribution margin per unit is \\$50 (90 - 40 = 50), and the total contribution margin is \\$72,500 (50 * 1,450 = 72,500). Fixed costs are \\$20,650, and the net income is \\$51,850 (72,500 - 20,650 = 51,850). The break-even point in units is 413, which makes sense because fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit is 20,650 / 50 = 413 units, and in dollars, it's 37,170 (413 * 90 = 37,170).\n\nNow, they can increase the price by 10% without changing any other costs. So, the sales price goes up by 10% of \\$90, which is \\$9 (10% of 90), so the new sales price is \\$99 per unit (90 + 9 = 99).\n\nThe variable cost per unit remains \\$40, since it's not changing. So, the new contribution margin per unit is \\$59 (99 - 40 = 59).\n\nFixed costs remain \\$20,650.\n\nTo find the new break-even point in units, I use the formula:\n\nBreak-even units = Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nBreak-even units = \\$20,650 / \\$59 per unit\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n20,650 divided by 59.\n\nWell, 59 * 350 = 59 * 300 = 17,700 + 59 * 50 = 2,950, total 20,650.\n\nWait, 59 * 350 = 59 * 300 = 17,700 + 59 * 50 = 2,950, yes, 17,700 + 2,950 = 20,650.\n\nSo, break-even units are 350 units.\n\nNow, to find the break-even point in dollars, I multiply the break-even units by the new sales price per unit:\n\nBreak-even dollars = 350 units * \\$99 per unit = \\$34,650\n\nWait, but none of the options have exactly \\$34,650. The closest is option A, which has \\$34,647.65, but that's not exactly \\$34,650. Maybe I need to calculate it more precisely.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n350 * 99 = 34,650.\n\nBut perhaps they want a more precise calculation, considering the exact division.\n\nLet me see: 20,650 / 59 = exactly 350, since 59*350=20,650.\n\nSo, 350 units is exact.\n\nNow, for dollars, 350 * 99 = 34,650.\n\nBut option A has \\$34,647.65, which is different.\n\nMaybe there's a miscalculation in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the break-even point using the contribution margin ratio.\n\nLet me try that method.\n\nContribution margin ratio = Contribution margin per unit / Sales price per unit\n\nCurrently, it's 50 / 90 = approximately 0.5556 or 55.56\\%\n\nWith the new sales price, contribution margin per unit is 59, so new contribution margin ratio is 59 / 99 \u2248 0.5959 or 59.59\\%\n\nBreak-even in dollars = Fixed costs / Contribution margin ratio\n\nSo, break-even in dollars = 20,650 / 0.5959 \u2248 34,647.65\n\nWhich matches option A's dollar amount.\n\nBut earlier, I had 350 units * \\$99 = \\$34,650, but according to this, it's \\$34,647.65.\n\nThe discrepancy is due to rounding.\n\nSince 350 units * \\$99 is exactly \\$34,650, but using the contribution margin ratio method gives \\$34,647.65.\n\nPerhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I need to round differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the break-even units are not exactly 350.\n\nLet me check 20,650 / 59.\n\n59 * 350 = 20,650, so yes, exactly 350 units.\n\nBut multiplying by \\$99 gives \\$34,650, while dividing fixed costs by the contribution margin ratio gives \\$34,647.65.\n\nThere's a slight difference due to rounding.\n\nPerhaps I should use the contribution margin ratio to find the break-even in dollars.\n\nSo, break-even in dollars = fixed costs / CM ratio = 20,650 / (59 / 99) = 20,650 / 0.5959183673 \u2248 34,647.645\n\nWhich rounds to \\$34,647.65.\n\nAnd the units would be 350.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 350 units and \\$34,647.65.\n\nBut I need to confirm if the units are exactly 350.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nBreak-even units = fixed costs / (new sales price - variable cost)\n\n= 20,650 / (99 - 40) = 20,650 / 59 = exactly 350 units.\n\nSo, yes, 350 units.\n\nAnd break-even in dollars is 350 * 99 = \\$34,650.\n\nBut according to the contribution margin ratio, it's \\$34,647.65.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break-even in dollars should be calculated as:\n\nBreak-even dollars = break-even units * sales price per unit\n\n= 350 * 99 = 34,650.\n\nBut option A has \\$34,647.65, which doesn't match exactly.\n\nHowever, since 350 units * \\$99 is \\$34,650, and the contribution margin ratio method gives \\$34,647.65, the difference is negligible and due to rounding.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is A. 350 units and \\$34,647.65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
