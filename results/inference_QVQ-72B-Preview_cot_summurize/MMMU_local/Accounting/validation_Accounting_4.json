                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about owner's equity for different companies, and I need to calculate the missing values for Company 2. Let me first make sure I understand the formula for owner's equity.\n\nFrom the table provided, it seems like the formula being used is:\n\nBeginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions = Ending Balance\n\nThat makes sense because owner's equity increases with net income and investments, and decreases with net losses and distributions to owners.\n\nNow, looking at Company 1, all the values are given except for Investments. So, I can plug in the numbers and solve for Investments.\n\nCompany 1:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$163,800\n\nNet Income: \\$16,500\n\nNet Loss: \\$0\n\nInvestments: ?\n\nDistributions: \\$1,750\n\nEnding Balance: \\$254,150\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$163,800 + \\$16,500 - \\$0 + ? - \\$1,750 = \\$254,150\n\nLet me calculate the known parts:\n\n\\$163,800 + \\$16,500 = \\$180,300\n\nThen, \\$180,300 + ? - \\$1,750 = \\$254,150\n\nLet me rearrange to solve for Investments:\n\n? = \\$254,150 - \\$180,300 + \\$1,750\n\nWait, no, I need to make sure I'm handling the signs correctly.\n\nActually, the formula is:\n\nBeginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions = Ending Balance\n\nSo, Investments = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance - Net Income + Net Loss + Distributions\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\nInvestments = \\$254,150 - \\$163,800 - \\$16,500 + \\$0 + \\$1,750\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\$254,150 - \\$163,800 = \\$90,350\n\n\\$90,350 - \\$16,500 = \\$73,850\n\n\\$73,850 + \\$0 = \\$73,850\n\n\\$73,850 + \\$1,750 = \\$75,600\n\nSo, Investments for Company 1 is \\$75,600. But wait, the question is to calculate the missing values for Company 2. Maybe I should verify if this is necessary for solving Company 2's missing value.\n\nOkay, moving on to Company 2, where the missing value is the Ending Balance.\n\nCompany 2:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$63,180\n\nNet Income: \\$0\n\nNet Loss: \\$12,000\n\nInvestments: \\$0\n\nDistributions: \\$51,180\n\nEnding Balance: ?\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$63,180 + \\$0 - \\$12,000 + \\$0 - \\$51,180 = ?\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\$63,180 - \\$12,000 = \\$51,180\n\n\\$51,180 - \\$51,180 = \\$0\n\nSo, the Ending Balance for Company 2 is \\$0.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that.\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$63,180\n\nNet Income: \\$0\n\nNet Loss: \\$12,000\n\nInvestments: \\$0\n\nDistributions: \\$51,180\n\nSo, according to the formula:\n\n\\$63,180 + \\$0 - \\$12,000 + \\$0 - \\$51,180 = \\$63,180 - \\$12,000 - \\$51,180 = \\$63,180 - \\$63,180 = \\$0\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\$1,620\n\nB. \\$12,000\n\nC. \\$51,180\n\nD. \\$0\n\nSo, the missing value for Company 2 is \\$0, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at Company 3 as well, although it's not part of the question.\n\nCompany 3:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$0\n\nNet Income: \\$0\n\nNet Loss: ?\n\nInvestments: \\$150,000\n\nDistributions: \\$0\n\nEnding Balance: \\$101,400\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$0 + \\$0 - ? + \\$150,000 - \\$0 = \\$101,400\n\nSo, \\$0 - ? + \\$150,000 = \\$101,400\n\nRearranging:\n\n? = \\$150,000 - \\$101,400 = \\$48,600\n\nSo, Net Loss for Company 3 is \\$48,600.\n\nBut since the question only asks for Company 2, and I've determined that the missing value is \\$0, which is option D, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options, option D is \\$0, which matches the ending balance for Company 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\$0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
