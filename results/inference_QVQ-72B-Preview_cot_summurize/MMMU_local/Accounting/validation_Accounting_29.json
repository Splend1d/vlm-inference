                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about comparing two call options, A and B, with different prices. Both have the same time to maturity of 0.5 years, the same strike price of $50, and the same current stock price of $55. The price of option A is $10, and option B is $12. I need to figure out which one has the higher volatility, assuming a risk-free interest rate of 6% and that the stocks don't pay dividends.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the Black-Scholes model, the price of a call option is determined by several factors: the current stock price (S), the strike price (X), the time to maturity (T), the risk-free interest rate (r), and the volatility of the stock price (\u03c3). The formula for the call option price is:\n\n\\[C = S N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2)\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S}{X}\\right) + \\left(r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right) T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}\\]\n\n\\[d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T}\\]\n\nAnd \\(N(\\cdot)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nGiven that S, X, T, and r are the same for both options, the only difference should be due to \u03c3.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm given the option prices, but I need to find out which option corresponds to the higher volatility. Essentially, I need to back out \u03c3 from the option price.\n\nThis seems tricky because solving for \u03c3 directly from the Black-Scholes formula isn't straightforward. It's an implicit equation, and usually, people use numerical methods like Newton-Raphson to find \u03c3 given the option price, S, X, T, and r.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to think about this since I don't need to find the exact \u03c3, just determine which one is higher.\n\nLet me consider the relationship between volatility and option price. In general, for call options, higher volatility leads to higher option prices, all else being equal. This is because higher volatility increases the probability of the stock price rising above the strike price by expiration.\n\nBut in this case, option B has a higher price ($12 vs. $10), so intuition suggests that it should have higher volatility. But wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nPerhaps I should calculate the implied volatility for each option to confirm.\n\nLet me try to calculate the implied volatility for both options.\n\nFirst, for option A:\n\nGiven:\n\nS = 55\n\nX = 50\n\nT = 0.5\n\nr = 6% = 0.06\n\nC = 10\n\nI need to find \u03c3 such that the Black-Scholes formula gives C = 10.\n\nSimilarly for option B, with C = 12.\n\nBut calculating implied volatility requires an iterative process, and I don't have the tools right now to do that. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Black-Scholes formula is monotonic in \u03c3, meaning that for fixed S, X, T, and r, the call price increases with \u03c3.\n\nGiven that, if two options have the same S, X, T, r, and different prices, the one with the higher price must have the higher \u03c3.\n\nTherefore, since option B has a higher price ($12 vs. $10), it must have the higher volatility.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something else at play here. Maybe the volatility isn't the only factor affecting the option price.\n\nHowever, given the assumptions provided (no dividends, same S, X, T, r), the only variable left is \u03c3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose both options have the same \u03c3. Then, according to the Black-Scholes model, they should have the same price, given the same S, X, T, and r.\n\nBut in this problem, they have different prices, so they must have different \u03c3.\n\nThe one with the higher price should have the higher \u03c3.\n\nHence, option B has higher volatility.\n\nI think that's the conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
