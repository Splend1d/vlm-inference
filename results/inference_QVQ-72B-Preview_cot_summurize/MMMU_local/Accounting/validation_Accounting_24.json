                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. We have two stocks, A and B, and their respective index model regression estimates, R-squares, residual standard deviations, and standard deviations of excess returns. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the market's average return is 14%. We need to calculate the information ratio for each stock.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the information ratio is. I know that the information ratio is a measure of a portfolio's excess returns per unit of deviation from a benchmark. It's calculated as the active return divided by the tracking error. In this context, since we're dealing with excess returns, I think the active return would be the difference between the stock's excess return and the market's excess return.\n\nBut let's make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem mentions \"performance is measured using an index model regression on excess returns.\" So, likely, the index model is being used to decompose the stock's excess returns into a systematic component and a residual component.\n\nGiven the regression equations:\n\nFor Stock A: 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)\n\nFor Stock B: 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f)\n\nWhere r_M is the market return and r_f is the risk-free rate.\n\nThe excess return for each stock can be expressed as:\n\nr_A - r_f = 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)\n\nr_B - r_f = 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f)\n\nI need to find the information ratio for each stock.\n\nLooking up the definition, the information ratio is defined as:\n\nIR = (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error\n\nIn this case, the benchmark is likely the market return.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The problem mentions excess returns, so perhaps the benchmark is the risk-free rate.\n\nWait, the regression is on excess returns, so r_A - r_f and r_B - r_f are being modeled.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of alpha, which is the active return.\n\nAlpha is the intercept in the regression, which represents the excess return not explained by the market.\n\nFor Stock A: alpha_A = 1%\n\nFor Stock B: alpha_B = 2%\n\nThe tracking error is the standard deviation of the residual, which is the residual standard deviation provided.\n\nFor Stock A: \u03c3(e) = 10.3%\n\nFor Stock B: \u03c3(e) = 19.1%\n\nSo, the information ratio would be alpha divided by the tracking error.\n\nIR_A = alpha_A / \u03c3(e_A) = 1% / 10.3% \u2248 0.0971\n\nIR_B = alpha_B / \u03c3(e_B) = 2% / 19.1% \u2248 0.1047\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Option A has 0.0971 for Stock A, which matches my calculation, but 0.01047 for Stock B, which is different from my calculation of 0.1047.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for the information ratio.\n\nYes, in portfolio management, the information ratio is indeed alpha divided by the tracking error, where alpha is the active return, and tracking error is the standard deviation of the active returns.\n\nIn the context of the index model, the active return is the residual, which is the difference between the actual excess return and the expected excess return based on the market.\n\nSo, alpha is the expected active return, and the tracking error is the standard deviation of the active returns, which is \u03c3(e).\n\nHence, IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nGiven that, my calculations seem correct:\n\nIR_A = 1% / 10.3% = approximately 0.0971\n\nIR_B = 2% / 19.1% = approximately 0.1047\n\nBut option A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B, which doesn't match my calculation for Stock B.\n\nOption B has 0.1134 for Stock A and 0.01722 for Stock B.\n\nOption C has 0.1149 for Stock A and 0.01322 for Stock B.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the information ratio is being calculated differently.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the R-square or the standard deviation of excess returns.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe information ratio is alpha divided by tracking error.\n\nAlpha is the expected excess return above the benchmark.\n\nTracking error is the standard deviation of the active returns.\n\nIn the index model, the residual standard deviation \u03c3(e) is indeed the tracking error.\n\nSo, IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nFor Stock A: 1% / 10.3% = 0.0971\n\nFor Stock B: 2% / 19.1% = 0.1047\n\nBut none of the options match for Stock B.\n\nPerhaps there's a miscalculation in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use a different formula.\n\nWait, maybe the information ratio is calculated using the standard deviation of excess returns minus the benchmark.\n\nLet me check the standard deviation of excess returns given:\n\nStock A: 21.6%\n\nStock B: 24.9%\n\nBut I'm not sure how to incorporate this into the information ratio calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is calculated as (Portfolio IR - Market IR) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps the information ratio is calculated as (Portfolio IR - Benchmark IR) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (Portfolio IR - Risk-free rate) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me stick to the basic definition: IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nFor Stock A: 1% / 10.3% = approximately 0.0971\n\nFor Stock B: 2% / 19.1% = approximately 0.1047\n\nBut the options don't have 0.1047 for Stock B.\n\nOption A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B.\n\nOption B has 0.1134 for Stock A and 0.01722 for Stock B.\n\nOption C has 0.1149 for Stock A and 0.01322 for Stock B.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nMaybe they want to calculate the information ratio based on the standard deviation of excess returns.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf IR = (Portfolio IR - Benchmark IR) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut I don't have the benchmark IR.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps IR = (Portfolio IR - Risk-free rate) / \u03c3(e)\n\nGiven that, for Stock A:\n\nIR_A = (14% - 6%) / 21.6% = 8% / 21.6% \u2248 0.3704\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe IR is calculated as (Alpha / \u03c3(e))\n\nWhere alpha is the intercept from the regression.\n\nYes, that seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps alpha is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps alpha is calculated as the difference between the stock's return and the risk-free rate minus the beta times the market risk premium.\n\nSo, alpha = [r_stock - r_f] - [beta * (r_market - r_f)]\n\nFor Stock A:\n\nalpha_A = [1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)] - [1.2(r_M - r_f)] = 1%\n\nSimilarly for Stock B:\n\nalpha_B = [2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f)] - [0.8(r_M - r_f)] = 2%\n\nSo, alpha is indeed 1% for A and 2% for B.\n\nThen, IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nWhich matches my initial calculation.\n\nPerhaps the options are misprinted or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the standard deviation of excess returns instead of the residual standard deviation.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf IR = alpha / \u03c3(excess returns)\n\nThen for Stock A: 1% / 21.6% = approximately 0.0463\n\nFor Stock B: 2% / 24.9% = approximately 0.0804\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe IR = (alpha / \u03c3(e)) * sqrt(R-square)\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nI think the correct approach is IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nWhich gives IR_A \u2248 0.0971 and IR_B \u2248 0.1047\n\nBut since option A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B, which doesn't match my calculation for Stock B, perhaps there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the standard deviation of excess returns in a different way.\n\nLet me consider the standard deviation of excess returns.\n\nFor Stock A: 21.6%\n\nFor Stock B: 24.9%\n\nPerhaps the information ratio is calculated as alpha / (\u03c3(excess returns) * sqrt(1 - R-square))\n\nFor Stock A:\n\nIR_A = 1% / (21.6% * sqrt(1 - 0.576)) = 1% / (21.6% * sqrt(0.424)) \u2248 1% / (21.6% * 0.6511) \u2248 1% / 14.04% \u2248 0.0712\n\nFor Stock B:\n\nIR_B = 2% / (24.9% * sqrt(1 - 0.436)) = 2% / (24.9% * sqrt(0.564)) \u2248 2% / (24.9% * 0.751) \u2248 2% / 18.73% \u2248 0.1068\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the information ratio is calculated as alpha / (\u03c3(excess returns) * sqrt(R-square))\n\nFor Stock A:\n\nIR_A = 1% / (21.6% * sqrt(0.576)) = 1% / (21.6% * 0.76) \u2248 1% / 16.42% \u2248 0.0609\n\nFor Stock B:\n\nIR_B = 2% / (24.9% * sqrt(0.436)) = 2% / (24.9% * 0.66) \u2248 2% / 16.44% \u2248 0.1217\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI'm starting to think there might be a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is calculated differently in the context of the index model.\n\nLet me consider the definition again.\n\nThe information ratio measures the active return per unit of tracking error.\n\nIn the context of the index model, the tracking error is the standard deviation of the residual, which is \u03c3(e).\n\nHence, IR = alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nWhich aligns with my initial calculation.\n\nPerhaps the options have a typo, and option A should have 0.1047 for Stock B instead of 0.01047.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the standard deviation of excess returns as the denominator instead of \u03c3(e).\n\nIf that's the case, then for Stock A:\n\nIR_A = 1% / 21.6% = approximately 0.0463\n\nFor Stock B:\n\nIR_B = 2% / 24.9% = approximately 0.0804\n\nBut again, none of the options match this.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the information ratio is calculated as (Portfolio IR - Benchmark IR) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut I don't have the benchmark IR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (Portfolio IR - Risk-free rate) / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the Sharpe ratio instead of the information ratio.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio is calculated as (Portfolio IR - Risk-free rate) / \u03c3(portfolio)\n\nBut that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the Treynor ratio, which is (Portfolio IR - Risk-free rate) / Beta\n\nBut again, that's not the information ratio.\n\nI think I need to stick with the standard definition of the information ratio as alpha / \u03c3(e)\n\nGiven that, my calculations are:\n\nIR_A = 1% / 10.3% \u2248 0.0971\n\nIR_B = 2% / 19.1% \u2248 0.1047\n\nBut the options don't match for Stock B.\n\nPerhaps there's a miscalculation in the options, and option A should have 0.1047 for Stock B instead of 0.01047.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use a different formula, but I can't see what that would be.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with option A for Stock A and none of the options for Stock B, but since I have to choose among the given options, I'll select option A, assuming there's a typo in Stock B's value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
