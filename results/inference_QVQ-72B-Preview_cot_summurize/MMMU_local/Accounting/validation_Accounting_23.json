                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about put options, and I need to figure out which one is written on the stock with the lower price. The options are A and B, and they have the same parameters except for their prices: A is $10 and B is $12. The risk-free interest rate is 6%, and the stocks don't pay dividends. The time to maturity is 0.5 years, the strike price is 50, and the volatility is 0.2 for both.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the price of a put option is determined. I know that the Black-Scholes model is commonly used for pricing options, and it takes into account the stock price, the strike price, the time to maturity, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility.\n\nThe formula for the put option price is:\n\n\\[P = Ke^{-rT}N(-d_2) - S_0N(-d_1)\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(S_0\\) is the current stock price\n\n- \\(K\\) is the strike price\n\n- \\(r\\) is the risk-free interest rate\n\n- \\(T\\) is the time to maturity\n\n- \\(N(\\cdot)\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n\n- \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are given by:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K}\\right) + \\left(r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T}\n\\]\n\nGiven that both options have the same \\(T\\), \\(K\\), \\(r\\), and \\(\\sigma\\), the only variable that differs is the stock price \\(S_0\\). Since the put option gives the right to sell the stock at the strike price, a lower stock price should make the put option more valuable, all else being equal.\n\nWait a minute, but in the table, both options have the same parameters except for the option price: A is $10 and B is $12. But the question is asking which put option must be written on the stock with the lower price. It seems like there might be some confusion here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the stock prices are not directly provided, but perhaps I can infer them based on the option prices.\n\nI know that for a put option, the price is inversely related to the stock price. So, if one put option is more expensive, it should correspond to a lower stock price.\n\nGiven that both options have the same time to maturity, strike price, volatility, and interest rate, the only difference should be the stock price.\n\nOption A is priced at $10, and option B at $12. So, option B is more expensive, which suggests that it corresponds to a lower stock price.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"which put option must be written on the stock with the lower price?\" So, if the stock price is lower, the put option should be more valuable, meaning higher price.\n\nTherefore, option B, which is priced higher at $12, must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nLet me check this with an example. Suppose stock price for option A is $55, and for option B is $45.\n\nUsing the Black-Scholes formula:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\):\n\nFor option A:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{55}{50}\\right) + \\left(0.06 + \\frac{0.2^2}{2}\\right) \\times 0.5}{0.2 \\times \\sqrt{0.5}} \\\\\n= \\frac{\\ln(1.1) + (0.06 + 0.02) \\times 0.5}{0.2 \\times 0.7071} \\\\\n= \\frac{0.0953 + 0.04 \\times 0.5}{0.1414} \\\\\n= \\frac{0.0953 + 0.02}{0.1414} \\\\\n= \\frac{0.1153}{0.1414} \\\\\n\\approx 0.8157\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = 0.8157 - 0.2 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.8157 - 0.1414 \\approx 0.6743\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nP_A = 50e^{-0.06 \\times 0.5}N(-0.6743) - 55N(-0.8157)\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(e^{-0.06 \\times 0.5} \\approx e^{-0.03} \\approx 0.9704\\)\n\nThen, \\(N(-0.6743) \\approx 1 - N(0.6743) \\approx 1 - 0.7495 \\approx 0.2505\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(N(-0.8157) \\approx 1 - N(0.8157) \\approx 1 - 0.7910 \\approx 0.2090\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP_A = 50 \\times 0.9704 \\times 0.2505 - 55 \\times 0.2090 \\approx 50 \\times 0.9704 \\times 0.2505 - 55 \\times 0.2090 \\\\\n\\approx 12.13 - 11.5 \\approx 0.63\n\\]\n\nWait, but in the table, option A is $10, not $0.63. Maybe my assumption about the stock prices is incorrect.\n\nLet me try with different stock prices to see which ones give option prices of $10 and $12 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock prices are not directly used in the Black-Scholes formula in this context, or maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach: since both options have the same time to maturity, strike price, volatility, and interest rate, the only difference is the stock price. Given that, and knowing that put option prices decrease as the stock price increases (all else equal), the option with the higher price must correspond to the lower stock price.\n\nTherefore, option B, being priced at $12, must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which put option must be written on the stock with the lower price?\" and the options are labeled A and B. So, if B is more expensive, it must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nHence, the answer is B.\n\nBut the options given are:\n\nA. A\n\nB. B\n\nC. Not enough information\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, the answer should be B.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing something, perhaps I should consider other factors.\n\nFor example, maybe the strike price is different, but no, the strike price is the same for both options.\n\nOr maybe the time to maturity is different, but no, it's 0.5 years for both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interest rate differs, but no, it's 6% for both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volatility is different, but no, it's 0.2 for both.\n\nTherefore, the only variable that can cause the difference in option prices is the stock price.\n\nGiven that, and given that put option prices are inversely related to the stock price, the option with the higher price must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nHence, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
