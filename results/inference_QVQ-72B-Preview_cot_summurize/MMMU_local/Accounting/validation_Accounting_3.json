                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about mutually exclusive projects for Maxwell Software, Inc. There are two projects, A and B, and I need to decide which one to choose based on the NPV rule. The discount rate is 15%, and I've got cash flow data for each project over three years. Project A has an initial outlay of $20,000 and then cash inflows of $13,200 in year 1, $8,300 in year 2, and $3,200 in year 3. Project B has an initial outlay of $24,000 and cash inflows of $14,100 in year 1, $9,800 in year 2, and $7,600 in year 3.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the NPV for each project. NPV stands for Net Present Value, and it's a way to evaluate the profitability of an investment by considering the time value of money. The formula for NPV is the sum of the present values of the cash flows, discounted back to the present at the appropriate discount rate, minus the initial investment.\n\nSo, for Project A:\n\nNPV_A = -Initial outlay + (Cash flow year 1 / (1 + r)^1) + (Cash flow year 2 / (1 + r)^2) + (Cash flow year 3 / (1 + r)^3)\n\nWhere r is the discount rate, which is 15% or 0.15.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNPV_A = -$20,000 + $13,200 / (1 + 0.15)^1 + $8,300 / (1 + 0.15)^2 + $3,200 / (1 + 0.15)^3\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.15)^1 = 1.15\n\nSo, $13,200 / 1.15 = $11,478.26\n\nNext, (1 + 0.15)^2 = 1.3225\n\nSo, $8,300 / 1.3225 = $6,278.26\n\nThen, (1 + 0.15)^3 = 1.520875\n\nSo, $3,200 / 1.520875 = $2,097.48\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n$11,478.26 + $6,278.26 + $2,097.48 = $19,854\n\nThen, subtract the initial outlay:\n\nNPV_A = $19,854 - $20,000 = -$146\n\nHmm, that's negative. So, Project A has a negative NPV at a 15% discount rate.\n\nNow, let's do the same for Project B.\n\nNPV_B = -Initial outlay + (Cash flow year 1 / (1 + r)^1) + (Cash flow year 2 / (1 + r)^2) + (Cash flow year 3 / (1 + r)^3)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNPV_B = -$24,000 + $14,100 / 1.15 + $9,800 / 1.3225 + $7,600 / 1.520875\n\nFirst, $14,100 / 1.15 = $12,260.87\n\nNext, $9,800 / 1.3225 = $7,411.76\n\nThen, $7,600 / 1.520875 = $5,000.00\n\nSum these up:\n\n$12,260.87 + $7,411.76 + $5,000.00 = $24,672.63\n\nSubtract the initial outlay:\n\nNPV_B = $24,672.63 - $24,000 = $672.63\n\nSo, Project B has a positive NPV of $672.63.\n\nSince Project A has a negative NPV and Project B has a positive NPV, according to the NPV rule, the company should choose Project B.\n\nWait a minute, the question says these are mutually exclusive projects. That means you can't choose both, right? So, you have to pick the one with the higher NPV, which in this case is Project B, even though its NPV is only slightly positive.\n\nBut, just to double-check, maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nFor Project A:\n\nYear 0: -20,000\n\nYear 1: 13,200 / 1.15 = 11,478.26\n\nYear 2: 8,300 / 1.3225 = 6,278.26\n\nYear 3: 3,200 / 1.520875 = 2,097.48\n\nTotal PV of inflows: 11,478.26 + 6,278.26 + 2,097.48 = 19,854\n\nNPV_A = 19,854 - 20,000 = -146\n\nFor Project B:\n\nYear 0: -24,000\n\nYear 1: 14,100 / 1.15 = 12,260.87\n\nYear 2: 9,800 / 1.3225 = 7,411.76\n\nYear 3: 7,600 / 1.520875 = 5,000.00\n\nTotal PV of inflows: 12,260.87 + 7,411.76 + 5,000.00 = 24,672.63\n\nNPV_B = 24,672.63 - 24,000 = 672.63\n\nSeems correct. Therefore, the answer should be Project B.\n\nBut the question is phrased to ask which project should be chosen if the company uses the NPV rule, and the discount rate is 15%. So, based on the calculations, Project B is the better choice.\n\nI think that's it. Maybe I should check if there's any other factor to consider, like the scale of the projects or something, but since they're mutually exclusive, and NPV accounts for the time value of money and the risk via the discount rate, I think choosing Project B is the right decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
