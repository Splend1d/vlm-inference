                    "text": "So I've got this question here about imperialist cartoons from around 1890. It mentions a specific cartoon from 1882 called \"The Devilfish in Egyptian Waters,\" which seems to depict England as an octopus with tentacles reaching out to various parts of the world, like Egypt, India, Canada, Jamaica, Australia, Malta, Gibraltar, and Borneland. The title suggests it's about British involvement in Egyptian waters, probably criticizing their imperial ambitions.\n\nThe question is asking which country among the Netherlands, France, Belgium, or Germany wouldn't have a similar cartoon made about its imperialist activities before 1890. So, I need to think about which of these countries wasn't actively expanding its empire or didn't have significant colonial holdings during that time.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Netherlands. I know that the Dutch had a vast empire, especially in Southeast Asia, like in Indonesia, which was then known as the Dutch East Indies. They also had colonies in South Africa and the Caribbean. So, they were definitely an imperial power with significant territories overseas. Maybe there were cartoons criticizing their actions, but I'm not sure if they were as prominent as the British ones.\n\nNext, France. France was one of the major colonial powers, with colonies in North Africa, Southeast Asia, and various other parts of the world. They had a significant presence in places like Algeria, Indochina, and West Africa. Given their extensive empire, it's likely that there were cartoons depicting France's imperial ambitions in a similar satirical manner.\n\nThen, there's Belgium. Belgium is interesting because it's often associated with King Leopold II and his\u6b8b\u9177 exploitation of the Congo Free State, which was effectively his personal colony. This was more in the late 19th century, and while it might not have been widely criticized at the time, especially since the Congo Free State was technically independent until 1908 when it became the Belgian Congo, it's possible that there were some criticisms of Belgian imperialist activities.\n\nFinally, Germany. Germany is the one that stands out here. Germany was a latecomer to the imperialist game. While it did acquire some colonies in Africa and the Pacific in the late 19th century, its imperial ambitions were relatively modest compared to Britain, France, or even Belgium before 1890. In fact, Germany only began acquiring overseas territories in the 1880s, and its empire was much smaller in scope.\n\nGiven this context, it's plausible that, prior to 1890, Germany didn't have as significant an imperial presence to warrant a cartoon like \"The Devilfish in Egyptian Waters.\" The other countries\u2014Netherlands, France, and Belgium\u2014all had substantial colonial empires and were more actively expanding their territories during that period.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would say that Germany is the exception among the options provided. Therefore, the answer is D. Germany.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
