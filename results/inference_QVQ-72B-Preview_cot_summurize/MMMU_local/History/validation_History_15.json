                    "text": "So I've got these two images here, and I need to figure out which context they both fit into. Let's see.\n\nThe first image is of Leonard Parkinson, a Maroon resistance fighter in Jamaica around 1796. The Maroons were groups of African descendants who had escaped from slavery and formed independent communities in various Caribbean islands, including Jamaica. They were known for their resistance against colonial powers and slaveholders. So, this seems to be about a society that was formed by people who had fled slavery, right?\n\nNow, the second image is a map showing the major Cossack hosts of the former Russian Empire. Cossacks were traditionally free men who lived in the borderlands of the Russian Empire, especially in areas like the Don, Kuban, and Ukraine. They were known for their military skills and often served as border guards or military units. They had a unique culture and governance structure, somewhat autonomous from the central government.\n\nSo, the question is, what do these two groups have in common in the contexts provided: the Maroons in Jamaica and the Cossacks in the Russian Empire?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Societies consisting of refugees from slave status.\n\nWell, the Maroons were certainly refugees from slavery. But were the Cossacks refugees from slavery? I don't think so. The Cossacks were mostly free peasants, frontiersmen, and sometimes runaway serfs, but not slaves in the same sense as the Maroons. So, this doesn't seem to fit both.\n\nB. Societies practicing a schismatic religion.\n\nSchismatic usually refers to a split or separation from a main religious body, often seen in Christianity. The Maroons in Jamaica had their own spiritual practices, which were a mix of African and Christian influences, but I don't know if that qualifies as schismatic in the same way. As for the Cossacks, they were primarily Orthodox Christians, but I don't recall any specific schismatic movements associated with them. So, probably not.\n\nC. Societies governed by warrior elites.\n\nThe Maroons were known for their resistance and fighting skills, as were the Cossacks. But were both governed by warrior elites? The Maroons had leaders who were likely chosen for their ability to lead resistance efforts, but I'm not sure if their society was strictly governed by a warrior class. The Cossacks had their own democratic assemblies, called circles, where decisions were made collectively, although they did have atamans who led them in battle. So, maybe somewhat, but it doesn't seem like a perfect fit for both.\n\nD. Societies existing on the periphery of large states.\n\nNow, this seems promising. The Maroons were living in the interior of Jamaica, away from the coastal plantations and the direct control of the British colonial authorities. They were effectively outside the main centers of power and governance.\n\nSimilarly, the Cossacks lived on the frontiers of the Russian Empire, in areas that were distant from the central government in Moscow or St. Petersburg. They were known for their autonomy and were often left to manage their own affairs as long as they provided military service to the tsar.\n\nSo, both groups existed on the margins of larger political entities and maintained a degree of independence or autonomy.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the best fit for both images.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any other way these two images could be connected?\n\nMaybe through their roles in resistance or warfare? Both were known for their fighting abilities and resistance against central authority, but that might be too specific and not capturing the broader context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both were known for their unique cultural practices and identities that set them apart from the mainstream societies of their times.\n\nBut that might not be the primary context here.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is D: societies existing on the periphery of large states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
