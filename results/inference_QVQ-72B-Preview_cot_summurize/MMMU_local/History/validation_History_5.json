                    "text": "So I've got this table here that shows when different countries joined the European Union. The question is asking why countries from Eastern Europe were admitted later than other EU members. Let me see, the options are:\n\nA. Support of these countries' agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies\n\nB. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War\n\nC. Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries\n\nD. The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars\n\nFirst, I need to think about which countries in Eastern Europe joined the EU later. Looking at the table, countries like Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are all in Eastern Europe. From the table, it seems like they joined in 2004, 2007, and 2013. Compared to countries in Western Europe like France, Germany, Italy, which joined in 1957, or even Spain and Portugal in 1986, Eastern European countries are indeed later entrants.\n\nOption A talks about support from agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies. Hmm, I know that some Eastern European countries have strong agricultural sectors, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason they joined later. Maybe protectionist policies could have affected their ability to join earlier, but I think there are bigger historical factors at play here.\n\nOption B mentions control by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War. That rings a bell. I remember that during the Cold War, Eastern European countries were under Soviet influence or direct control as part of the Eastern Bloc. This period lasted from the end of World War II until the early 1990s when the Soviet Union dissolved. So, during that time, these countries weren't free to make their own decisions about joining organizations like the EU, which was largely seen as a Western initiative.\n\nOption C says resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries. Well, fascism was mostly associated with countries like Germany and Italy in the 1930s and 1940s, not with Eastern European countries after World War II. Some of these countries had authoritarian regimes, but they were more communist dictatorships imposed by the Soviet Union rather than fascist governments.\n\nOption D refers to the greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars. The Great Depression was a global event that affected many countries, including those in Western Europe and North America. As for the world wars, Eastern European countries were certainly impacted, particularly by World War II, which was fought on their soil to a large extent. However, Western European countries were also heavily affected by the wars. So, while these events had a significant impact on Eastern Europe, I don't think they're the primary reason for their later admission into the EU.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most plausible. The control of Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War prevented them from joining the EU earlier. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, these countries gained independence and were able to pursue membership in the EU, which many of them did in the early 2000s and later.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look back at the table. For example, Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic all joined in 2004. Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. These timelines align with the political changes that occurred after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
