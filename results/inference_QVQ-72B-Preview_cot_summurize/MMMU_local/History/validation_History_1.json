                    "text": "So I've got this cartoon here from The Saturday Globe dated July 9, 1892, titled \"Forty-Millionaire Carnegie in his Great Double Role.\" It's a black and white illustration that seems to be critiquing Andrew Carnegie, a famous industrialist and philanthropist from the late 19th century. The cartoon shows Carnegie in two different poses: on the left, he's holding a notice that says \"Wages Reduced 20 per cent,\" and on the right, he's holding a check for \\$5,000 and a model of a library, with people cheering below him. The caption reads, \"As the ti get-fisted employer he reduces wages that he may play philanthropist and give away libraries, etc.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what the cartoon is trying to convey. It seems like the artist is highlighting a contrast in Carnegie's behavior: on one hand, he's cutting wages for his employees, which is portrayed negatively with the term \"ti get-fisted,\" meaning tight-fisted or stingy. On the other hand, he's giving large sums of money to charity, specifically for libraries, which is being celebrated by the public.\n\nSo, the cartoon is critiquing Carnegie for being stingy with his employees while being generous with public donations. It suggests that he reduces wages to have more money to give away to charity, perhaps to improve his public image.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the given options was another common criticism of Andrew Carnegie. Given the context of the cartoon, it's likely that the criticism would relate to his treatment of workers or his philanthropic practices.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. As an immigrant, Carnegie had no right to own controlling interests in major American industries.\n\nWell, Carnegie was indeed an immigrant from Scotland, but I don't recall any significant criticism based on his nationality regarding his business interests. In fact, he was celebrated for his rags-to-riches story, rising from humble beginnings as an immigrant to become one of the wealthiest men in America.\n\nB. Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\n\nThis seems plausible. I remember that there was a significant strike at Carnegie's steel mills in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892, which turned violent. Carnegie was not present during the strike, but his manager, Henry Clay Frick, hired private security forces that clashed with the strikers, resulting in several deaths. Carnegie was criticized for his absence and for not intervening to prevent the violence.\n\nC. Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he was not even the richest man in America.\n\nWhile it's true that Carnegie was one of the wealthiest men in America, he was not the richest. John D. Rockefeller, for example, had a larger fortune. However, Carnegie was widely recognized for his philanthropy and his ideology of giving back, which he outlined in his essay \"The Gospel of Wealth.\" But I don't think that being less rich than Rockefeller was a significant criticism of Carnegie.\n\nD. Too much of Carnegie's philanthropic efforts were concentrated on his homeland of Scotland, denying Americans the benefits of his charity.\n\nThis is also a possible criticism. Carnegie did support various causes in Scotland, including the establishment of libraries and educational institutions. Some people might have argued that his philanthropy should have been more focused on the United States, where he built his fortune.\n\nGiven these options, I think that option B is the most accurate representation of another common criticism of Andrew Carnegie. The Homestead Strike was a major event that tarnished his image, as it showed a dark side to his business practices and his treatment of workers.\n\nBut let me think again. The cartoon specifically criticizes Carnegie for reducing wages while giving to charity. Option B talks about his inaction during a strike involving violence, which is a separate issue, although still related to his treatment of workers.\n\nOption D is also relevant because it touches on the distribution of his philanthropic efforts, suggesting that he favored his homeland over the United States.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the cartoon, which focuses on his treatment of employees versus his public philanthropy, option B might be the closest in theme. The wage reduction mentioned in the cartoon could be seen as a precursor to the tensions that led to the Homestead Strike.\n\nBut perhaps option D is also a valid criticism, as it questions the geographical focus of his charity.\n\nI need to decide which one was more commonly criticized about Carnegie at that time.\n\nI recall that the Homestead Strike was a significant event that damaged Carnegie's reputation, especially since he was seen as absent and uncaring during the crisis. His philanthropy, while extensive, didn't entirely erase the memory of the strike and the violence that occurred.\n\nOn the other hand, criticisms about his philanthropic focus on Scotland might have been present, but perhaps not as prominent as the criticisms related to his labor practices.\n\nTherefore, I think that option B is the most accurate answer here, as it directly relates to Carnegie's treatment of workers and the consequences of that treatment.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
