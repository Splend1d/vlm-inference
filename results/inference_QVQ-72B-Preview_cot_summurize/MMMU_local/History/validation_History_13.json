                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this map of Europe, and it shows Germany divided into East and West Germany. There are other countries around too, like the Soviet Union to the east, Poland to the north, Czechoslovakia to the south, and so on. The question is asking which statement is NOT true regarding the divided Germany shown on the map.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the historical context. I know that after World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones: American, British, French, and Soviet. Over time, these zones coalesced into two separate states: West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) and East Germany (German Democratic Republic). The capital of West Germany was Bonn, which is marked on the map, and East Germany's capital was Berlin.\n\nOption A says that the capital of West Germany was located in East Germany. That doesn't sound right. Bonn was in West Germany, not in East Germany. So, this seems like it might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption B says that West Germany experienced a postwar economic miracle. I recall that West Germany did indeed experience a significant economic boom after World War II, often referred to as the \"German economic miracle.\" So, this seems true.\n\nOption C says that both East Germany and West Germany were allowed to rearm. I know that West Germany was allowed to rearm as part of its integration into NATO, while East Germany was part of the Warsaw Pact. So, both did rearm, but under different alliances. This seems true as well.\n\nOption D says that France had occupied West Germany. France was one of the occupying powers in West Germany after World War II, so this is also true.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option A is the incorrect statement because the capital of West Germany, Bonn, was not located in East Germany; it was in West Germany.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. The map shows Bonn located in West Germany, and Berlin in East Germany. So, yes, Bonn is clearly in West Germany. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it claims that the capital of West Germany was located in East Germany, which is not the case.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm the other statements:\n\n- B: West Germany did experience an economic miracle after the war, so that's correct.\n\n- C: Both East and West Germany were allowed to rearm, though under different political blocs, so that's also correct.\n\n- D: France was one of the occupying powers in West Germany after WWII, so this is correct as well.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is A: The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
