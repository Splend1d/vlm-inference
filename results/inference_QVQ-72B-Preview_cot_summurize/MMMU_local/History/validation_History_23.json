                    "text": "So I've got this political cartoon from 1933, and it's about strike-breaking. It's a bit gritty, but I think I can figure out what it's trying to say. Let's see...\n\nFirst, there are two main figures here. One is labeled \"Strike-Breaking,\" and the other is labeled \"Union-Busting.\" They seem to be intertwined in a violent struggle. The \"Strike-Breaking\" figure is holding a rope or whip, and both are exchanging blows. It looks intense, and there are shoes and hats flying around, which might symbolize chaos or the breakdown of order.\n\nBelow them, there's another figure who appears to be a detective or an investigator, holding a magnifying glass and a newspaper labeled \"Investigating.\" This person is crouched down, maybe trying to get a better look at what's happening or perhaps searching for clues.\n\nThe title of the cartoon is \"Strike-Breaking,\" which suggests that the focus is on the practices used to prevent or end strikes, possibly in an unfair or illegal manner.\n\nNow, the question is asking what point the cartoon makes. The options are:\n\nA. Infighting within and among unions prevented their rise to economic power.\n\nB. Government inspectors turned their backs to illegal repression of labor unions.\n\nC. Attacks on unions were so well concealed that the government did not know where to begin its investigations.\n\nD. From their beginnings, labor unions were controlled by organized crime.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nOption A suggests that unions were their own worst enemies, with internal conflicts hindering their growth and influence. But the cartoon seems to depict external forces fighting against unions, not internal disagreements.\n\nOption B proposes that government inspectors were aware of illegal activities against unions but chose to ignore them. The detective figure in the cartoon is actively investigating, but maybe he's not doing enough, or perhaps he's overwhelmed by the violence above him.\n\nOption C indicates that the attacks on unions were hidden, making it difficult for the government to investigate. However, the cartoon shows the violence plain as day, so it doesn't seem like the attacks are well-concealed.\n\nOption D claims that unions were controlled by organized crime from the start. There's no direct indication of that in the cartoon. It's more about the conflict between strike-breaking and union-busting forces.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most fitting. The detective is investigating, but the violence continues unabated, suggesting that perhaps the government inspectors are not effectively addressing the illegal repression of labor unions.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I look at the detective figure, he's focused on investigating, but the battle above him rages on. Maybe he's ineffective or perhaps even complicit in turning a blind eye. That could reinforce the idea that government inspectors are not taking action against union-busting practices.\n\nOption C doesn't align because the violence is clearly depicted, not hidden. Option D isn't supported by the imagery, and option A contradicts the visual message of external forces fighting unions.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: government inspectors turned their backs to illegal repression of labor unions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
