The title is \"The English Succession to 1603,\" and it's divided into Tudors and Stuarts. There are connections to Spanish and French royalty as well. Okay, deep breath.\n\nStarting with the Tudors:\n\n- Henry VII (1485-1509) is married to Elizabeth of York.\n\nFrom this union:\n\n- Henry VIII (1509-1547) is born.\n\nHenry VIII had several wives:\n\n1. Catherine of Aragon\n\n2. Anne Boleyn\n\n3. Jane Seymour\n\nFrom Henry VIII and Jane Seymour:\n\n- Edward VI (1547-1553) is born.\n\nAfter Edward VI, Elizabeth I (1558-1603) comes to power.\n\nNow, shifting to the Stuarts:\n\n- Margaret, a sibling of Henry VIII, marries James IV of Scotland.\n\nFrom this marriage:\n\n- James V of Scotland is born.\n\nJames V marries Mary of Guise, and they have:\n\n- Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nMary Queen of Scots marries:\n\n1. Francis II of France\n\n2. Lord Darnley\n\nFrom her second marriage to Lord Darnley:\n\n- James VI of Scotland and I of England (1603-1625) is born.\n\nOn the left side, there's a connection to the Spanish monarchy:\n\n- Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile are married.\n\nFrom them:\n\n- Joanne and Catherine of Aragon.\n\nCatherine of Aragon marries Henry VIII, as mentioned earlier.\n\nJoanne marries Archduke Philip, and their son is:\n\n- Emperor Charles V, who is also King of Spain.\n\nCharles V's son is:\n\n- Philip II of Spain, who marries Mary I of England (1553-1558).\n\nSo, Mary I is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.\n\nNow, let's look at the options to see which two monarchs were related by both blood and marriage.\n\nOption A: Phillip II and Mary I\n\n- Philip II of Spain married Mary I of England.\n\n- Mary I is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.\n\n- Philip II is the son of Charles V and Isabella of Portugal.\n\n- So, Philip II and Mary I are related by marriage directly, and also related by blood through their ancestors.\n\nOption B: Francis II and Mary Queen of Scots\n\n- Francis II of France married Mary Queen of Scots.\n\n- Mary Queen of Scots is the daughter of James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise.\n\n- Francis II is the son of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici.\n\n- They are related by marriage, but are they related by blood? Maybe distantly, but not directly.\n\nOption C: Elizabeth I and Edward VI\n\n- Elizabeth I and Edward VI are both children of Henry VIII.\n\n- Elizabeth I is Henry VIII's daughter with Anne Boleyn.\n\n- Edward VI is Henry VIII's son with Jane Seymour.\n\n- They are siblings, so definitely related by blood, but were they related by marriage? No, they were never married to each other or to anyone who was related by blood.\n\nOption D: Catherine of Aragon and Henry II\n\n- Catherine of Aragon was married to Henry VIII.\n\n- Henry II could be referring to Henry II of France or Henry II of England.\n\n- If it's Henry II of France, he was married to Catherine de' Medici.\n\n- If it's Henry II of England, he was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\n- Catherine of Aragon was married to Henry VIII of England, not Henry II.\n\n- So, this option doesn't make sense as presented.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most straightforward answer is Option A: Philip II and Mary I, as they were married and related by blood through their ancestors.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there are any other potential connections.\n\nFor example, Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I are both related by blood through Henry VII, but they were not married to each other or to anyone who was directly related by blood to the other.\n\nSimilarly, Francis II and Mary Queen of Scots were married, but their relationship by blood isn't as direct as that between Philip II and Mary I.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option A: Philip II and Mary I.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
