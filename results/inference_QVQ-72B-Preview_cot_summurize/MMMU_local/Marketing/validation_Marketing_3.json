                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this table from a multiple regression analysis, and I need to calculate a confidence interval for b2. The table shows the coefficients (bi) and their standard errors (Sbi) for i from 0 to 3. So, b0 is 8 with Sb0 = 1.6, b1 is 2.2 with Sb1 = 0.24, b2 is -0.72 with Sb2 = 0.32, and b3 is 0.005 with Sb3 = 0.002.\n\nThe question is asking for the confidence interval for b2, and it's given in the form of b2 \u00b1 (t-value) * (standard error). So, I need to identify the correct b2 value and the corresponding standard error, and then find the appropriate t-value for the confidence level.\n\nFirst, from the table, b2 is -0.72, not -0.62 or -0.72 with different decimals. So, options A and B have -0.62, which doesn't match. Option C has -0.72 and 0.22, and option D has -0.72 and 0.32.\n\nWait, but the standard error for b2 is 0.32, so the \u00b1 value should be t * 0.32. But in option C, it's 0.22, which doesn't match the standard error. Option D has 0.32, which matches the standard error for b2.\n\nBut wait, the standard error is Sb2 = 0.32, so the confidence interval should be b2 \u00b1 (t-value) * 0.32. So, the \u00b1 value should be t * 0.32.\n\nBut in option C, it's -0.72 \u00b1 0.22, which suggests that the t-value is 0.22 / 0.32, which is approximately 0.6875, but that doesn't make sense because t-values for confidence intervals are usually around 1.96 for 95% confidence in large samples.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the t-value based on the degrees of freedom. But the degrees of freedom aren't provided here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u00b1 value is already the margin of error, which includes the t-value multiplied by the standard error.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the \u00b1 value is t * Sb2, and I need to see which option correctly reflects that.\n\nLooking back, option C has -0.72 \u00b1 0.22, and option D has -0.72 \u00b1 0.32.\n\nIf Sb2 is 0.32, and assuming a 95% confidence level, the margin of error would be approximately t * 0.32.\n\nBut without knowing the degrees of freedom, it's hard to know the exact t-value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the margin of error is already provided as the standard error times the t-value, and I need to match it with the standard error given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u00b1 value is the standard error itself, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the \u00b1 value is the standard error, meaning that the confidence interval is b2 \u00b1 Sb2, but that's not correct; it should be b2 \u00b1 t * Sb2.\n\nBut in the options, option C has \u00b10.22, and option D has \u00b10.32.\n\nGiven that Sb2 is 0.32, it's likely that the \u00b1 value should be 0.32, assuming t = 1, but that's not usually the case for confidence intervals.\n\nWait, maybe the t-value is approximately 1 for large degrees of freedom, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking to choose the correct b2 and its standard error, without calculating the actual confidence interval.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u00b1 value is the standard error times some t-value, and I need to determine which one matches.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is D: -0.72 \u00b1 0.32, assuming that the t-value is 1, but that doesn't make sense for a confidence interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the t-value is approximately 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval, so \u00b11.96*0.32 \u2248 \u00b10.6272, which isn't matching any option.\n\nWait, maybe it's a 68% confidence interval, where t is approximately 1, so \u00b10.32 would correspond to a 68% confidence interval.\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply providing the confidence interval in the form b2 \u00b1 margin of error, where margin of error is t * Sb2, and expecting me to identify that.\n\nGiven that, option D has -0.72 \u00b1 0.32, which would be from -1.04 to -0.40, assuming t * Sb2 = 0.32.\n\nBut without knowing t, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the margin of error is already calculated for a specific confidence level, and I need to choose the correct values.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the question is incomplete or missing some context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u00b1 value is the standard error, which is 0.32, so option D is correct.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \u00b1 value is the standard error times the t-value, and in the options, they've provided b2 \u00b1 (t * Sb2), with t being approximately 1 in option C and approximately 1 in option D, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options, and option C should have \u00b10.32 instead of \u00b10.22.\n\nBut I can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \u00b1 value is the standard error divided by something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is D: -0.72 \u00b1 0.32, assuming that the margin of error is t * Sb2, and t is approximately 1 for a certain confidence level.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing understanding of the confidence interval formula, and expecting the answer to be b2 \u00b1 Sb2, which would be -0.72 \u00b1 0.32, but that's not correct because it should be t * Sb2.\n\nGiven that, and without more information, I'll go with option D: -0.72 \u00b1 0.32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
