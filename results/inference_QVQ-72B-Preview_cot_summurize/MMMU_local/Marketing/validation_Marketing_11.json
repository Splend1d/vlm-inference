There's a probability distribution given, and I need to find the probability that a new hire will stay exactly 4 years. The table provided shows values for x from 0 to 6 and their corresponding probabilities, but there's a blank for x = 4. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a probability distribution is. It's a way to show the probabilities of different outcomes in a situation. Here, x represents the number of years a new hire stays with the company, and P(x) is the probability of that happening.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nx | P(x)\n\n0 | 0.12\n\n1 | 0.18\n\n2 | 0.30\n\n3 | 0.15\n\n4 | ?\n\n5 | 0.10\n\n6 | 0.05\n\nI need to find P(x = 4).\n\nI recall that in any probability distribution, the sum of all probabilities must equal 1. That is, \u03a3 P(x) = 1 for all possible x.\n\nSo, if I add up all the known probabilities and subtract that from 1, I should get P(x = 4).\n\nLet's do that:\n\nSum of known probabilities = 0.12 + 0.18 + 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.05\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.12 + 0.18 = 0.30\n\n0.30 + 0.30 = 0.60\n\n0.60 + 0.15 = 0.75\n\n0.75 + 0.10 = 0.85\n\n0.85 + 0.05 = 0.90\n\nSo, the sum of the known probabilities is 0.90.\n\nTherefore, P(x = 4) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nIs there any other information given in the problem that I might have missed? Let's see.\n\nThe problem says: \"Let X = the number of years a new hire will stay with the company. Let P(x) = the probability that a new hire will stay with the company x years. P(x = 4) = _______\"\n\nSo, it's directly asking for the probability of staying exactly 4 years, given the distribution.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, like considering continuous variables or anything like that. It seems like a discrete probability distribution.\n\nJust to be sure, I'll check if the probabilities add up to 1.\n\nSum of P(x) for x = 0 to 6:\n\n0.12 + 0.18 + 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.90\n\nPlus P(x = 4) = 0.10\n\nTotal sum = 0.90 + 0.10 = 1.00\n\nThat checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if P(x = 4) was not 0.10, the total would not be 1, which wouldn't make sense for a probability distribution.\n\nTherefore, P(x = 4) must be 0.10.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.10.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking to fill in the blank for P(x = 4), and it's probably expecting the answer in decimal form, which is 0.10.\n\nBut sometimes, they might want it in fraction form, but since the other probabilities are in decimals, I think 0.10 is acceptable.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this?\n\nWell, maybe I should consider if the distribution is properly defined.\n\nFor a probability distribution, each P(x) must be between 0 and 1, and the sum must be 1.\n\nFrom what I've calculated, that holds true.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a formula or another approach, but given the straightforward nature of the problem, I think the method I used is correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that P(x = 4) = 0.10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.10} \\]"
