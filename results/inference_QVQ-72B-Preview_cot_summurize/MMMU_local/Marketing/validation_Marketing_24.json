                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this table that shows the relative frequency of different salary ranges for adult Americans. The table is labeled \"Table 2.71\" and it has two columns: Salary ($) and Relative frequency. The salary ranges are from less than $20,000 up to $100,000 and above. There are eight categories in total.\n\nThe question is asking about a telephone poll where six hundred adult Americans were asked what they think constitutes a middle-class income. But looking at the table, it seems to be about salary ranges and their relative frequencies, not directly about the middle-class income definition. Maybe the table is related to the distribution of salaries, and the poll is separate from that.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is showing the distribution of salaries, and the poll is asking people which salary range they consider middle-class. But the options at the end are about \"not sure,\" so maybe some people didn't know or didn't answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table is representing. It shows salary ranges and their corresponding relative frequencies. For example, less than $20,000 has a relative frequency of 0.02, which means 2% of the respondents fall into that category. Similarly, $20,000\u201325,000 is 0.09, and so on, up to $100,000+ being 0.01.\n\nIf I add up all these relative frequencies, they should sum to 1, right? Let me check that.\n\n0.02 + 0.09 = 0.11\n\n0.11 + 0.19 = 0.30\n\n0.30 + 0.26 = 0.56\n\n0.56 + 0.18 = 0.74\n\n0.74 + 0.17 = 0.91\n\n0.91 + 0.02 = 0.93\n\n0.93 + 0.01 = 0.94\n\nHmm, that adds up to 0.94, which means that 94% of the respondents are accounted for in these salary ranges. But 100% - 94% = 6%, which suggests that 6% of the respondents didn't fit into these categories or perhaps didn't answer.\n\nBut the question is about people who answered \"not sure\" to the poll about what constitutes a middle-class income. So, maybe some people didn't know or didn't provide an answer.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says: \"Six hundred adult Americans were asked by telephone poll, 'What do you think constitutes a middle-class income?' The results are in Table 2.71. Also, include left endpoint, but not the right endpoint. <image 1> What percentage of the survey answered 'not sure'?\n\nA. 0.04\nB. 0.05\nC. 0.06\nD. 0.07\"\n\nWait, there's a reference to <image 1>, but since I can't see the image, I need to rely on the information provided in the table and the question.\n\nThe table shows salary ranges and their relative frequencies, but the question is about a poll asking what constitutes a middle-class income. It seems like there might be a connection between the salary ranges and the perceptions of middle-class income, but the question is specifically about the percentage who answered \"not sure.\"\n\nPerhaps the \"not sure\" responses are not included in the table, and I need to find out what percentage of the 600 respondents fell into that category.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is showing the salary ranges that people considered as middle-class, and the \"not sure\" category is separate.\n\nBut without more context or the actual data from the poll, it's hard to connect the table directly to the question.\n\nWait, maybe the table is showing the salary ranges that people consider as middle-class, and the relative frequencies are the proportions of people who chose each range.\n\nIf that's the case, then the sum of the relative frequencies should be close to 1, but in my earlier calculation, it added up to 0.94, meaning that 6% didn't fit into these categories, possibly answering \"not sure.\"\n\nLooking back, the salary ranges in the table are:\n\n- < 20,000\n\n- 20,000\u201325,000\n\n- 25,000\u201330,000\n\n- 30,000\u201340,000\n\n- 40,000\u201350,000\n\n- 50,000\u201375,000\n\n- 75,000\u201399,999\n\n- 100,000+\n\nAnd the relative frequencies are:\n\n- 0.02\n\n- 0.09\n\n- 0.19\n\n- 0.26\n\n- 0.18\n\n- 0.17\n\n- 0.02\n\n- 0.01\n\nAdding them up gives 0.94, as I did before.\n\nSo, if 94% of the respondents chose one of these salary ranges as their definition of middle-class income, then the remaining 6% must have answered \"not sure\" or didn't provide an answer.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.04 (4%)\n\nB. 0.05 (5%)\n\nC. 0.06 (6%)\n\nD. 0.07 (7%)\n\nBased on my calculation, the answer should be 0.06, which is 6%.\n\nBut I should double-check if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nMaybe the table only includes people who provided specific salary ranges, and the \"not sure\" responses are excluded from the table. In that case, the percentage of \"not sure\" responses would be the remaining percentage after accounting for the responses in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"not sure\" category is included in one of the salary ranges, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility is that the \"not sure\" responses are part of the \"100,000+\" category, but that also doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"not sure\" responses are not included in the table at all, and the table only shows the responses of people who provided specific salary ranges.\n\nIn that case, the percentage of \"not sure\" responses would be the difference between 100% and the sum of the relative frequencies provided in the table.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 1 - 0.94 = 0.06, or 6%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 0.06.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nPerhaps the table is showing the distribution of actual salaries, and the poll is asking about perceived middle-class income ranges.\n\nIn that case, maybe the \"not sure\" responses are separate from the table, and the table is just providing context.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions that the results are in Table 2.71, so I assume that the table is directly related to the poll's responses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table shows the frequency of salary ranges that people consider middle-class, and the \"not sure\" responses are not included in the table.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, the sum of the relative frequencies is 0.94, so the remaining 0.06 must be the \"not sure\" responses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.06.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
