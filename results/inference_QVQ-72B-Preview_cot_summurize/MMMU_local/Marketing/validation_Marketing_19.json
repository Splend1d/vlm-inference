                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a table that shows the number of young online entrepreneurs, aged 17 to 30, with a net worth of at least one million dollars. The table is divided into age groups and net worth value ranges, and we're supposed to test whether age and net worth are independent using a chi-square test. The options for the chi-square test statistic are 1.56, 1.76, 1.96, or 2.06.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for age and net worth to be independent in this context. If they're independent, then knowing someone's age shouldn't give me any information about their net worth, and vice versa. But intuitively, I might think that older entrepreneurs have had more time to build their net worth, so maybe there is a relationship. But that's just a hunch; I need to use statistics to test this hypothesis.\n\nSo, to perform a chi-square test of independence, I need to calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the table under the assumption that age and net worth are independent. Then, I'll compare these expected frequencies with the observed frequencies from the table. The chi-square statistic is calculated by summing the squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequencies.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the chi-square test statistic:\n\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}\n\\]\n\nwhere O is the observed frequency and E is the expected frequency for each cell.\n\nLooking at the table, we have two age groups (17-25 and 26-30) and three net worth value groups (1-5 million, 6-24 million, and \u226525 million). The total number of entrepreneurs is 40.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the expected frequency for each cell. The expected frequency is calculated as the product of the row total and the column total divided by the grand total.\n\nLet's list out the cells and calculate their expected frequencies one by one.\n\nStarting with the top-left cell: age 17-25 and net worth 1-5 million. The row total for age 17-25 is 20, and the column total for net worth 1-5 million is 14. The grand total is 40.\n\nSo, the expected frequency for this cell is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 14}{40} = \\frac{280}{40} = 7\n\\]\n\nNext, age 17-25 and net worth 6-24 million: row total 20, column total 12.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 12}{40} = \\frac{240}{40} = 6\n\\]\n\nThen, age 17-25 and net worth \u226525 million: row total 20, column total 14.\n\nWait a minute, the column totals are 14, 12, and 14, which add up to 40, same as the grand total. That checks out.\n\nNow, moving to age 26-30 and net worth 1-5 million: row total 20, column total 14.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 14}{40} = 7\n\\]\n\nAge 26-30 and net worth 6-24 million: row total 20, column total 12.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 12}{40} = 6\n\\]\n\nAnd finally, age 26-30 and net worth \u226525 million: row total 20, column total 14.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{20 \\times 14}{40} = 7\n\\]\n\nNow, I have all the expected frequencies:\n\n- Age 17-25, 1-5M: 7\n\n- Age 17-25, 6-24M: 6\n\n- Age 17-25, \u226525M: 7\n\n- Age 26-30, 1-5M: 7\n\n- Age 26-30, 6-24M: 6\n\n- Age 26-30, \u226525M: 7\n\nNext, I need to collect the observed frequencies from the table. Let's look back at the table:\n\n- Age 17-25, 1-5M: 8\n\n- Age 17-25, 6-24M: 7\n\n- Age 17-25, \u226525M: 5\n\n- Age 26-30, 1-5M: 6\n\n- Age 26-30, 6-24M: 5\n\n- Age 26-30, \u226525M: 9\n\nNow, for each cell, I'll calculate (O - E)^2 / E.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nFirst cell: O = 8, E = 7\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(8 - 7)^2}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.1429\n\\]\n\nSecond cell: O = 7, E = 6\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(7 - 6)^2}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\nThird cell: O = 5, E = 7\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(5 - 7)^2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714\n\\]\n\nFourth cell: O = 6, E = 7\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(6 - 7)^2}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.1429\n\\]\n\nFifth cell: O = 5, E = 6\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(5 - 6)^2}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\nSixth cell: O = 9, E = 7\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(9 - 7)^2}{7} = \\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714\n\\]\n\nNow, sum all these up to get the chi-square statistic:\n\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = 0.1429 + 0.1667 + 0.5714 + 0.1429 + 0.1667 + 0.5714 = 1.7624\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 1.76.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.56\n\nB. 1.76\n\nC. 1.96\n\nD. 2.06\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 1.76.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst cell: (8 - 7)^2 / 7 = 1/7 \u2248 0.1429 \u2014 correct.\n\nSecond cell: (7 - 6)^2 / 6 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667 \u2014 correct.\n\nThird cell: (5 - 7)^2 / 7 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714 \u2014 correct.\n\nFourth cell: (6 - 7)^2 / 7 = 1/7 \u2248 0.1429 \u2014 correct.\n\nFifth cell: (5 - 6)^2 / 6 = 1/6 \u2248 0.1667 \u2014 correct.\n\nSixth cell: (9 - 7)^2 / 7 = 4/7 \u2248 0.5714 \u2014 correct.\n\nSum: 0.1429 + 0.1667 + 0.5714 + 0.1429 + 0.1667 + 0.5714 = 1.7624 \u2014 yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the chi-square test statistic is approximately 1.76.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the answer is B. 1.76.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 1.76} \\]"
