                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about testing the mean weights of men from three different groups. There's a table with weights for each group, and I need to find the Mean Square Factor. The options are A. 2,309.6, B. 2,325.5, C. 2,328.1, and D. 2,469.6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a Mean Square Factor is. From what I recall in statistics, particularly in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), the Mean Square Factor is the same as the Mean Square Between Groups. It measures the variability between the group means.\n\nSo, to calculate the Mean Square Factor, I need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each group.\n\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB) groups.\n\n4. Calculate the Degrees of Freedom Between (DFB) groups.\n\n5. Finally, calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB), which is SSB divided by DFB.\n\nLet's start with Group 1:\n\nThe weights are: 216, 198, 240, 187, 176\n\nThe mean of Group 1 is (216 + 198 + 240 + 187 + 176) / 5\n\nLet me add those up: 216 + 198 = 414, plus 240 is 654, plus 187 is 841, plus 176 is 1017.\n\nSo, mean of Group 1 = 1017 / 5 = 203.4\n\nNext, Group 2:\n\nWeights: 202, 213, 284, 228, 210\n\nMean of Group 2 = (202 + 213 + 284 + 228 + 210) / 5\n\nAdding up: 202 + 213 = 415, plus 284 = 699, plus 228 = 927, plus 210 = 1137\n\nMean of Group 2 = 1137 / 5 = 227.4\n\nGroup 3:\n\nWeights: 170, 165, 182, 197, 201\n\nMean of Group 3 = (170 + 165 + 182 + 197 + 201) / 5\n\nAdding up: 170 + 165 = 335, plus 182 = 517, plus 197 = 714, plus 201 = 915\n\nMean of Group 3 = 915 / 5 = 183\n\nNow, I need the overall mean.\n\nFirst, total all the weights:\n\nGroup 1 total: 1017\n\nGroup 2 total: 1137\n\nGroup 3 total: 915\n\nTotal sum = 1017 + 1137 + 915\n\nAdding 1017 + 1137 = 2154, plus 915 = 3069\n\nTotal number of observations = 5 in each group, so total n = 15\n\nOverall mean = 3069 / 15 = 204.6\n\nNow, Sum of Squares Between (SSB) groups is calculated as:\n\nSSB = n * [(mean1 - overall mean)^2 + (mean2 - overall mean)^2 + (mean3 - overall mean)^2]\n\nWhere n is the number of observations in each group.\n\nSo, SSB = 5 * [(203.4 - 204.6)^2 + (227.4 - 204.6)^2 + (183 - 204.6)^2]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(203.4 - 204.6) = -1.2\n\n(-1.2)^2 = 1.44\n\n(227.4 - 204.6) = 22.8\n\n22.8^2 = 519.84\n\n(183 - 204.6) = -21.6\n\n(-21.6)^2 = 466.56\n\nNow, sum these up: 1.44 + 519.84 = 521.28, plus 466.56 = 987.84\n\nSo, SSB = 5 * 987.84 = 4939.2\n\nNext, Degrees of Freedom Between (DFB) groups is the number of groups minus 1.\n\nDFB = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nFinally, Mean Square Between (MSB) = SSB / DFB = 4939.2 / 2 = 2469.6\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 2,469.6 matches this result.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, confirm the means:\n\nGroup 1: 1017 / 5 = 203.4 \u2192 correct\n\nGroup 2: 1137 / 5 = 227.4 \u2192 correct\n\nGroup 3: 915 / 5 = 183 \u2192 correct\n\nOverall mean: 3069 / 15 = 204.6 \u2192 correct\n\nSSB calculation:\n\n(203.4-204.6)^2 = 1.44\n\n(227.4-204.6)^2 = 519.84\n\n(183-204.6)^2 = 466.56\n\nSum = 1.44 + 519.84 + 466.56 = 987.84\n\nSSB = 5 * 987.84 = 4939.2\n\nDFB = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nMSB = 4939.2 / 2 = 2469.6\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's another way to calculate this or if I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for MSB directly, which is indeed SSB divided by DFB, and I've done that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should verify the total sum of squares or other components, but since the question only asks for MS Factor, which is MSB, and I've calculated it correctly as 2469.6, I think that's the answer.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 2,469.6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
