                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got data for ten people who went on a low-fat diet for 12 weeks to lower their cholesterol. We have their starting and ending cholesterol levels, and we need to figure out, at a 5% significance level, whether their cholesterol levels were significantly lowered after 12 weeks.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. We're dealing with paired data because we're looking at the same individuals' cholesterol levels before and after a 12-week low-fat diet. So, it's a paired t-test scenario. I need to test whether the mean difference in cholesterol levels is significantly different from zero.\n\nAlright, step one is to set up my hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H0) should be that there's no significant change in cholesterol levels, meaning the mean difference is zero. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant decrease in cholesterol levels, meaning the mean difference is less than zero.\n\nSo, H0: \u03bcd = 0\n\nH1: \u03bcd < 0\n\nNow, since it's a one-tailed test (we're only interested in a decrease), I'll be looking at the left tail of the t-distribution.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the differences in cholesterol levels for each individual. I'll subtract the ending level from the starting level to find the difference. Remember, if the diet was effective, the ending level should be lower, so the difference should be positive (starting - ending > 0).\n\nWait a minute, actually, I need to be careful here. If I subtract ending from starting, a decrease in cholesterol would result in a positive difference (starting - ending > 0), but in the hypothesis, I have \u03bcd < 0 for the alternative. So, I need to make sure I define the difference correctly.\n\nLet me define the difference as (ending - starting). That way, if the ending level is lower, the difference will be negative, which aligns with the alternative hypothesis of \u03bcd < 0.\n\nSo, I'll calculate d = ending - starting for each individual.\n\nLet me list out the differences:\n\nGiven:\n\nStarting | Ending | Difference (Ending - Starting)\n\n140 | 140 | 0\n\n220 | 230 | 10\n\n110 | 120 | 10\n\n240 | 220 | -20\n\n200 | 190 | -10\n\n180 | 150 | -30\n\n190 | 200 | 10\n\n360 | 300 | -60\n\n280 | 300 | 20\n\n260 | 240 | -20\n\nWait, but according to my definition, a decrease should be negative. But looking at the data:\n\nSome differences are positive, meaning ending is higher than starting, and some are negative, meaning ending is lower than starting.\n\nSo, I have both increases and decreases.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the mean of these differences.\n\nLet me sum up the differences:\n\n0 + 10 + 10 - 20 - 10 - 30 + 10 - 60 + 20 - 20 = Let's compute that:\n\n0 + 10 = 10\n\n10 + 10 = 20\n\n20 - 20 = 0\n\n0 - 10 = -10\n\n-10 - 30 = -40\n\n-40 + 10 = -30\n\n-30 - 60 = -90\n\n-90 + 20 = -70\n\n-70 - 20 = -90\n\nSo, the sum of differences is -90.\n\nThe mean difference (d\u0304) is sum of differences divided by the number of individuals.\n\nd\u0304 = -90 / 10 = -9\n\nSo, on average, the ending cholesterol level is 9 units lower than the starting level.\n\nNow, I need to test whether this mean difference is significantly less than zero at the 5% significance level.\n\nSince we're dealing with paired data and assuming normality, I can use a paired t-test.\n\nThe test statistic t is calculated as:\n\nt = (d\u0304 - \u03bcd) / (s / \u221an)\n\nWhere:\n\n- d\u0304 is the sample mean difference (-9)\n\n- \u03bcd is the hypothesized mean difference (0)\n\n- s is the sample standard deviation of the differences\n\n- n is the sample size (10)\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sample standard deviation of the differences.\n\nLet me list the differences again:\n\n0, 10, 10, -20, -10, -30, 10, -60, 20, -20\n\nNow, calculate the variance.\n\nVariance (s\u00b2) = [sum of (d - d\u0304)^2] / (n - 1)\n\nd\u0304 = -9\n\nSo, calculate (d - (-9))\u00b2 for each d.\n\nLet's compute each (d + 9)\u00b2:\n\n0 + 9 = 9 \u2192 81\n\n10 + 9 = 19 \u2192 361\n\n10 + 9 = 19 \u2192 361\n\n-20 + 9 = -11 \u2192 121\n\n-10 + 9 = -1 \u2192 1\n\n-30 + 9 = -21 \u2192 441\n\n10 + 9 = 19 \u2192 361\n\n-60 + 9 = -51 \u2192 2601\n\n20 + 9 = 29 \u2192 841\n\n-20 + 9 = -11 \u2192 121\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n81 + 361 = 442\n\n442 + 361 = 803\n\n803 + 121 = 924\n\n924 + 1 = 925\n\n925 + 441 = 1366\n\n1366 + 361 = 1727\n\n1727 + 2601 = 4328\n\n4328 + 841 = 5169\n\n5169 + 121 = 5290\n\nSo, sum of (d - d\u0304)\u00b2 = 5290\n\nNow, variance s\u00b2 = sum of squares / (n - 1) = 5290 / 9 \u2248 587.78\n\nThen, standard deviation s = \u221a587.78 \u2248 24.24\n\nNow, the t-statistic is:\n\nt = (d\u0304 - \u03bcd) / (s / \u221an) = (-9 - 0) / (24.24 / \u221a10) \u2248 -9 / (24.24 / 3.162) \u2248 -9 / (7.66) \u2248 -1.175\n\nSo, t \u2248 -1.175\n\nNow, for a one-tailed t-test with \u03b1 = 0.05 and df = n - 1 = 9, I need to find the critical t-value.\n\nLooking up the t-distribution table for df = 9 and \u03b1 = 0.05, the critical t-value is approximately -1.833.\n\nSince the calculated t-statistic (-1.175) is greater than the critical t-value (-1.833), it does not fall in the rejection region.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the p-value associated with t = -1.175 with df = 9.\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, p-value is approximately 0.14 (since t = -1.175 is between -1 and -1.383 for df=9)\n\nSince p-value (0.14) > \u03b1 = 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, at the 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the cholesterol levels were significantly lowered after 12 weeks on a low-fat diet.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nA. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks\n\nWait, but the options include \"medication,\" but the problem mentions a low-fat diet, not medication. Maybe it's a typo.\n\nAssuming it's a typo and it should refer to the low-fat diet, then option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if \"medication\" is correct, then perhaps there's confusion, but based on the problem statement, it's about a low-fat diet.\n\nIn any case, based on the data and the hypothesis test, there's insufficient evidence to conclude that the cholesterol levels were significantly lowered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
