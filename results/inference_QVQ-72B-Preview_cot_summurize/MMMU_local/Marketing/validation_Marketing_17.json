                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It's about finding the mean weight of a sample of candy bags. There are 8 bags supposed to contain 16 ounces of candy each, but they've been weighed, and the weights are listed in Table 2.57. The question is asking for the mean weight of a bag of candy in this sample.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what mean weight means. The mean is just the average, right? So, I need to add up all the weights of the candy bags and then divide by the number of bags to get the average weight.\n\nLooking at Table 2.57, there are eight weights listed:\n\n15.65 oz\n\n16.09 oz\n\n16.01 oz\n\n15.99 oz\n\n16.02 oz\n\n16.00 oz\n\n15.98 oz\n\n16.08 oz\n\nSo, I need to add these all up and then divide by 8 to get the mean.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nMean = (15.65 + 16.09 + 16.01 + 15.99 + 16.02 + 16.00 + 15.98 + 16.08) / 8\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate the sum of these weights.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with 15.65.\n\nAdd 16.09: 15.65 + 16.09 = 31.74\n\nAdd 16.01: 31.74 + 16.01 = 47.75\n\nAdd 15.99: 47.75 + 15.99 = 63.74\n\nAdd 16.02: 63.74 + 16.02 = 79.76\n\nAdd 16.00: 79.76 + 16.00 = 95.76\n\nAdd 15.98: 95.76 + 15.98 = 111.74\n\nAdd 16.08: 111.74 + 16.08 = 127.82\n\nSo, the total weight is 127.82 ounces.\n\nNow, to find the mean, I divide this total by the number of bags, which is 8.\n\nMean = 127.82 / 8\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n127 divided by 8 is 15.875, and then 0.82 divided by 8 is 0.1025.\n\nSo, 15.875 + 0.1025 = 15.9775 ounces.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 14.00 ounces\n\nB. 15.00 ounces\n\nC. 14.98 ounces\n\nD. 15.98 ounces\n\nThe closest to 15.9775 ounces is option D, 15.98 ounces.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the sum:\n\n15.65 + 16.09 = 31.74\n\n16.01 + 15.99 = 32.00\n\n16.02 + 16.00 = 32.02\n\n15.98 + 16.08 = 32.06\n\nNow, add these up: 31.74 + 32.00 = 63.74\n\n63.74 + 32.02 = 95.76\n\n95.76 + 32.06 = 127.82\n\nYes, same total.\n\nNow, dividing 127.82 by 8:\n\n8 * 15 = 120\n\n127 - 120 = 7.82\n\nSo, 15.9775 ounces, which rounds to 15.98 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 15.98 ounces.\n\nI think that's it. Just needed to find the average of the given weights.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
