There are five games for each team, and I need to test if there's a difference in the mean goals scored among these teams. It looks like an ANOVA problem. The question is asking for the degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator. Options are 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what ANOVA stands for. Analysis of Variance, right? It's a statistical method to determine if the means of three or more groups are different from each other. In this case, we have four teams, so that fits.\n\nNow, in ANOVA, there are two types of degrees of freedom: the numerator df and the denominator df. The numerator df is related to the between-group variability, and the denominator df is related to the within-group variability.\n\nI need to find the numerator df. From what I recall, the numerator df is equal to the number of groups minus one. So, if there are k groups, then df numerator = k - 1.\n\nGiven that there are four teams, k = 4. So, df numerator should be 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, option C is 4, which might be a common mistake. Sometimes, people might think that df is equal to the number of groups, but that's not the case in ANOVA. It's always k - 1 for the numerator.\n\nLet me double-check this concept. I think I'm correct. ANOVA breaks down the total variance into components that can be attributed to differences between groups and differences within groups.\n\nThe between-group df is k - 1, and the within-group df is N - k, where N is the total number of observations.\n\nSo, in this scenario, with four teams and five games each, total observations are 4 teams * 5 games = 20 games.\n\nThus, df numerator = 4 - 1 = 3, and df denominator = 20 - 4 = 16.\n\nSo, the answer should indeed be 3.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look up the formula for ANOVA degrees of freedom to confirm.\n\nYes, upon checking, the degrees of freedom for the numerator (between groups) is indeed k - 1, where k is the number of groups. So, with k = 4, df numerator = 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
