The options are A. 1/38, B. 2/38, C. 3/38, or D. 6/38.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the roulette table layout. From the image, it seems like the numbers are arranged in a grid with rows and columns, and each number is colored either red or black, except for 0 and 00, which are green.\n\nI see that the numbers are not in sequential order; for example, number 1 is red, 2 is black, 3 is red, and so on. Also, there are boxes at the bottom for betting on dozens, even/odd, and high/low numbers.\n\nNow, the question is about betting on two numbers that touch each other on the table. So, I need to identify pairs of numbers that are adjacent to each other, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In the first column, numbers like 1, 4, 7, etc., are adjacent to numbers in the second column, like 2, 5, 8, etc.\n\n- Similarly, numbers in the second column are adjacent to numbers in the third column.\n\n- Also, numbers in the same row are adjacent horizontally.\n\nFor example, 10 is in the second column of the third row, so it's adjacent to 9 and 11 horizontally, and to 7 and 13 vertically.\n\nWait, but in the options, 10-11 is mentioned as an example, and 10-13 is another. So, it's not just numbers that are next to each other horizontally, but also vertically.\n\nSo, in roulette, the way the table is laid out, numbers are arranged in three columns and rows, and each number has neighbors above, below, and beside them.\n\nI think the key here is to understand how many numbers are adjacent to a given number.\n\nLet me pick a number and see how many neighbors it has.\n\nTake number 1: it's in the first column of the first row. It's adjacent to number 2 and number 4.\n\nNumber 2: in the second column of the first row, adjacent to numbers 1, 3, and 5.\n\nNumber 3: in the third column of the first row, adjacent to numbers 2 and 5.\n\nNumber 4: in the first column of the second row, adjacent to numbers 1, 2, and 7.\n\nNumber 5: in the second column of the second row, adjacent to numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNumber 6: in the third column of the second row, adjacent to numbers 3, 5, and 9.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, most numbers have multiple neighbors.\n\nBut the bet is on two specific numbers that touch each other.\n\nWait, but in roulette, when you bet on two numbers that are adjacent, you're placing a bet that covers both of those numbers.\n\nThe ball can land on either one, and you win.\n\nSo, the probability should be the sum of the probabilities of the ball landing on each of those two numbers, assuming they don't overlap.\n\nBut they don't overlap; each number is distinct.\n\nSo, if there are 38 possible outcomes (0, 00, and numbers 1 through 36), and you're betting on two specific numbers, then the probability should be 2/38.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose I bet on numbers 10 and 11, which are adjacent.\n\nThe ball can land on 10 or 11, and I win.\n\nAny other number, I lose.\n\nSo, out of 38 possible outcomes, 2 are favorable.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/38.\n\nThat would correspond to option B.\n\nBut let me see if there's any trick here.\n\nIs the bet covering exactly two numbers, or could it be more?\n\nIn roulette, there are different types of bets:\n\n- Straight up: betting on one number.\n\n- Split: betting on two numbers that are adjacent.\n\n- Street: betting on three numbers in a row.\n\n- Corner: betting on four numbers that form a corner.\n\n- Five-number bet: betting on 0, 00, 1, 2, 3.\n\n- And so on.\n\nSo, if I'm betting on a split, which is two adjacent numbers, then it should cover only those two numbers.\n\nHence, the probability should be 2/38.\n\nAlternatively, if the bet covered more numbers, the probability would be higher.\n\nBut in this case, it's specified as betting on two numbers that touch each other, which is a split bet.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/38.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2/38.\n\nWait, but let's consider if the table layout might have some numbers that are adjacent in a way that covers more than two numbers.\n\nFor example, in the corner bets, you bet on four numbers that form a corner.\n\nBut in this case, the bet is specified as two numbers that touch each other, which should be a split bet, covering two numbers.\n\nHence, the probability is indeed 2/38.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 2/38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
