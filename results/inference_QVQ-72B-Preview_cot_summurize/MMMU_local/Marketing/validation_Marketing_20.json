The options are A. 1/38, B. 2/38, C. 3/38, and D. 6/38. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what roulette is. Roulette is a casino game where there's a wheel with numbers from 0 to 36, and in some versions, there's also a 00, making it 38 possible outcomes. Each number can land independently, and the ball can land on any of these numbers.\n\nIn this particular bet, I'm betting on three numbers that are adjacent on the table layout, like 1-2-3. So, I win if the ball lands on any of these three numbers.\n\nTo calculate the probability of winning, I need to know how many favorable outcomes there are compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 38, since there are numbers from 0 to 36, and including 00.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is 3, because I'm betting on three specific numbers: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, the probability should be 3 out of 38, which is 3/38.\n\nLooking at the options, C. 3/38 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn roulette, each number has an equal chance of being landed on, assuming the wheel is fair. So, each number has a 1/38 probability.\n\nSince I'm betting on three numbers, and these are distinct numbers, I should just add up the probabilities of each individual number.\n\nSo, P(number 1) + P(number 2) + P(number 3) = 1/38 + 1/38 + 1/38 = 3/38.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of combinations. The total number of possible outcomes is 38.\n\nThe number of ways to win is 3.\n\nSo, again, probability is 3/38.\n\nI don't see any reason why it would be any other fraction.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for.\n\nIs there any overlap or any other bets that might affect this?\n\nNo, because I'm only betting on these three specific numbers.\n\nUnlike betting on a dozen, where multiple numbers are involved in a different way.\n\nNo, I think 3/38 is the correct probability.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 3/38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
