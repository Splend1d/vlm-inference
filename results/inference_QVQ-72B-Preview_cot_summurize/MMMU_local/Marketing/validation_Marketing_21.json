Group 2 has 202, 213, 284, 228, and 210. Group 3 has 170, 165, 182, 197, and 201. So, each group has five men, and there are three groups in total.\n\nThe question is asking for the degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in some test, probably an ANOVA test since we're comparing means from different groups. The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, or D. 4.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall what the degrees of freedom for the numerator are in an ANOVA test. I think in ANOVA, there are two types of degrees of freedom: one for between groups (numerator) and one for within groups (denominator).\n\nFor the between groups df, it's usually the number of groups minus one. So, if there are three groups, then df numerator should be 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nLooking at the options, B. 2 seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something tricky here.\n\nI remember that in a one-way ANOVA, the df for the numerator is k - 1, where k is the number of groups. So, with three groups, it should indeed be 2.\n\nWait, but just to be sure, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors or if the groups have different sample sizes. But no, in this case, all groups have the same sample size of five, so it shouldn't affect the df calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to calculate the df for something else, but the question specifies it's for the numerator in this context.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 2.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look it up quickly in my statistics notes.\n\nYeah, for a one-way ANOVA, df between = number of groups - 1, which is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nDF within would be total number of observations minus number of groups, which is 15 - 3 = 12, but the question is only asking for the numerator.\n\nSo, I'm confident that B. 2 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
