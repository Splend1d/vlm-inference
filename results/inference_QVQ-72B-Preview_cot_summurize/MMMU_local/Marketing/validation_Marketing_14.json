                    "text": "So I'm at this fair, and there's this game where I have to throw a dart at a color wheel. The wheel is divided into eight equal sections, each of different colors. The colors are red, blue, green, yellow, and some others, but I think it's mainly red, blue, green, and yellow based on the question. Each section is equal in area, which means each color has the same chance of being hit.\n\nThe events are defined as:\n\n- B = landing on blue\n\n- R = landing on red\n\n- G = landing on green\n\n- Y = landing on yellow\n\nAnd if I land on Y, which is yellow, I get the biggest prize. The question is asking for P(Y), which is the probability of landing on yellow.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.125\n\nB. 0.25\n\nC. 0.5\n\nD. 0.625\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the wheel is divided. From the figure reference, Figure 3.16, it seems like the wheel is divided into eight equal parts, each presumably a different color.\n\nCounting the colors from the image:\n\n- Red: there are three red sections\n\n- Blue: two blue sections\n\n- Green: one green section\n\n- Yellow: one yellow section\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it mentions four colors: red, blue, green, and yellow, with yellow being one section. But according to my count from the image, there are eight sections in total.\n\nSo, if there are eight sections in total and yellow is one of them, then the probability of landing on yellow should be 1 out of 8, which is 0.125.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there are more yellow sections that I'm not seeing. From the image, I see:\n\n- Starting from the top:\n\n- Red\n\n- Blue\n\n- Green\n\n- Red\n\n- Blue\n\n- Red\n\n- Yellow\n\n- Red\n\nYes, only one yellow section.\n\nSo, P(Y) = 1/8 = 0.125.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 0.125.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the yellow section is larger or something. But the problem states that each section is equal in area, so each section has the same probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dart isn't equally likely to hit each section due to some bias, but the problem doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, P(Y) should indeed be 1/8 = 0.125.\n\nBut let me consider if there could be any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the wheel has eight equal sections, and yellow is one of them, then yes, P(Y) = 1/8.\n\nAlternatively, if the wheel has more than one yellow section, then P(Y) would be higher.\n\nBut according to the image and the description, there is only one yellow section.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 0.125.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by making me think that yellow is less likely because it's only one section, but in reality, it's more likely due to some other factor.\n\nBut no, the problem clearly states that each section is equal in area, implying equal probability.\n\nHence, P(Y) = 1/8 = 0.125.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 0.125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.125} \\]"
