                    "text": "Let's tackle this statistics problem. So, I have this table of data that shows the time in minutes that customers wait in line at Lucky's checkout. The data is ordered from smallest to largest, which is helpful. The question is asking for the cumulative relative frequency for waiting less than 6.1 minutes. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what cumulative relative frequency means.\n\nI remember that frequency is how often a particular value occurs in a data set. Relative frequency is the frequency of that value divided by the total number of observations. Cumulative relative frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies for all values up to a certain point. In this case, it's for all waiting times less than 6.1 minutes.\n\nSo, to find this, I need to:\n\n1. Count how many customers waited less than 6.1 minutes.\n\n2. Find the total number of customers surveyed.\n\n3. Calculate the relative frequency for each waiting time up to 6.1 minutes and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table and identify the waiting times:\n\nLooking at the table, the times are:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.25, 2.50, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75,\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.50, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5.00, 5.00,\n\n5.25, 5.25, 5.50, 5.50, 5.75, 5.75, 6.00, 6.00, 6.25, 6.25,\n\n6.25, 6.50, 6.50, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75, 7.25, 7.25, 7.25, 7.75,\n\n8.00, 8.25, 9.50, 9.50, 9.75, 10.75\n\nWait, the user provided a table, but in the text format, it's a bit messy. Let me try to organize it better.\n\nLooking back, the user might have intended to present a table with multiple columns, but it's a bit unclear. Let me assume that the data is listed in columns from left to right, top to bottom.\n\nBut to make sure, I'll list out all the values provided:\n\n0.50, 4.25, 5, 6, 7.25,\n\n1.75, 4.25, 5.25, 6, 7.25,\n\n2, 4.25, 5.25, 6.25, 7.25,\n\n2.25, 4.25, 5.5, 6.25, 7.75,\n\n2.25, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8,\n\n2.5, 4.75, 5.5, 6.5, 8.25,\n\n2.75, 4.75, 5.75, 6.5, 9.5,\n\n3.25, 4.75, 5.75, 6.75, 9.5,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 9.75,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 10.75\n\nSo, total, there are 50 data points.\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these are less than 6.1 minutes.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75,\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5, 5,\n\n5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6, 6.25, 6.25,\n\n6.25, 6.5, 6.5, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75, 7.25, 7.25, 7.25, 7.75,\n\n8, 8.25, 9.5, 9.5, 9.75, 10.75\n\nNow, counting all values less than 6.1:\n\nUp to 6.0 minutes:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75,\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5, 5,\n\n5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6\n\nThat's up to 6.0 minutes. Now, since 6.1 is exclusive, we include all times up to but not including 6.1 minutes. So, 6.0 is included, but 6.1 is not present, and 6.25 is excluded.\n\nSo, counting these:\n\nFrom the list above, up to 6.0:\n\n0.50 to 6.0 inclusive.\n\nLet me count them one by one:\n\n0.50 (1), 1.75 (2), 2 (3), 2.25 (4 and 5), 2.5 (6), 2.75 (7), 3.25 (8), 3.75 (9 and 10),\n\n4.25 (11 to 14), 4.5 (15), 4.75 (16 to 18), 5 (19 and 20),\n\n5.25 (21 and 22), 5.5 (23 and 24), 5.75 (25 and 26), 6 (27 and 28)\n\nSo, total counts up to 6.0 minutes: 28 customers.\n\nNow, the total number of customers is 50.\n\nSo, the cumulative frequency for less than 6.1 minutes is 28.\n\nTo find the cumulative relative frequency, I divide this by the total number of observations, which is 50.\n\nSo, cumulative relative frequency = 28 / 50 = 0.56\n\nWait a minute, but none of the options match 0.56. The options are 0.62, 0.63, 0.64, 0.65.\n\nHmm, maybe I miscounted the number of customers less than 6.1 minutes.\n\nLet me double-check the counting.\n\nList up to 6.0:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75,\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5, 5,\n\n5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6\n\nThat's 28, as I counted before.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking back, 6.0 is included, and 6.1 is not present, but 6.25 is excluded.\n\nSo, 6.0 is included, which is 6.0, and there are two 6.0s.\n\nBut wait, in the list, there are two 6.0s.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nFrom the data:\n\n6.0 appears twice.\n\nSo, total up to 6.0 is 28.\n\nWait, perhaps the data has more.\n\nWait, in the list I have 28 up to 6.0.\n\nBut maybe I need to confirm if there are any 6.0s that are actually 6.00 and should be included.\n\nLooking back at the original data:\n\n0.50, 4.25, 5, 6, 7.25,\n\n1.75, 4.25, 5.25, 6, 7.25,\n\n2, 4.25, 5.25, 6.25, 7.25,\n\n2.25, 4.25, 5.5, 6.25, 7.75,\n\n2.25, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8,\n\n2.5, 4.75, 5.5, 6.5, 8.25,\n\n2.75, 4.75, 5.75, 6.5, 9.5,\n\n3.25, 4.75, 5.75, 6.75, 9.5,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 9.75,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 10.75\n\nSo, arranging them in order:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75,\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5, 5,\n\n5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6, 6.25, 6.25,\n\n6.25, 6.5, 6.5, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75, 7.25, 7.25, 7.25, 7.75,\n\n8, 8.25, 9.5, 9.5, 9.75, 10.75\n\nSo, up to 6.0:\n\n0.50 to 6.0 inclusive.\n\nCounting:\n\n0.50 (1), 1.75 (2), 2 (3), 2.25 (4 and 5), 2.5 (6), 2.75 (7), 3.25 (8), 3.75 (9 and 10),\n\n4.25 (11 to 14), 4.5 (15), 4.75 (16 to 18), 5 (19 and 20),\n\n5.25 (21 and 22), 5.5 (23 and 24), 5.75 (25 and 26), 6 (27 and 28)\n\nSo, total 28.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that 6.0 is included and 6.1 is not present, but 6.25 is excluded.\n\nSo, up to but not including 6.1, which means 6.0 is included, and 6.25 is excluded.\n\nSo, 6.0 is included, which is two times.\n\nWait, in my count, I have two 6.0s.\n\nWait, but in the list, looking back:\n\nFrom the data:\n\n0.50, 4.25, 5, 6, 7.25,\n\n1.75, 4.25, 5.25, 6, 7.25,\n\n2, 4.25, 5.25, 6.25, 7.25,\n\n2.25, 4.25, 5.5, 6.25, 7.75,\n\n2.25, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8,\n\n2.5, 4.75, 5.5, 6.5, 8.25,\n\n2.75, 4.75, 5.75, 6.5, 9.5,\n\n3.25, 4.75, 5.75, 6.75, 9.5,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 9.75,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 10.75\n\nSo, 6.0 appears twice.\n\nSo, total up to 6.0 is 28.\n\nTotal observations are 50.\n\nSo, cumulative relative frequency should be 28 / 50 = 0.56.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the data has more than 50 observations.\n\nWait, counting the rows:\n\nEach row has 5 entries, and there are 10 rows, so 50 data points.\n\nBut maybe I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data includes some repeated values that I didn't account for.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFrom the data:\n\n0.50, 4.25, 5, 6, 7.25,\n\n1.75, 4.25, 5.25, 6, 7.25,\n\n2, 4.25, 5.25, 6.25, 7.25,\n\n2.25, 4.25, 5.5, 6.25, 7.75,\n\n2.25, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8,\n\n2.5, 4.75, 5.5, 6.5, 8.25,\n\n2.75, 4.75, 5.75, 6.5, 9.5,\n\n3.25, 4.75, 5.75, 6.75, 9.5,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 9.75,\n\n3.75, 5, 6, 6.75, 10.75\n\nSo, total unique values are:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75,\n\n4.25 (appears 4 times), 4.5, 4.75 (3 times), 5 (3 times),\n\n5.25 (2 times), 5.5 (3 times), 5.75 (2 times), 6 (2 times),\n\n6.25 (3 times), 6.5 (3 times), 6.75 (3 times), 7.25 (3 times),\n\n7.75, 8, 8.25, 9.5 (2 times), 9.75, 10.75\n\nSo, total counts add up to 50.\n\nNow, up to 6.0:\n\n0.50 (1), 1.75 (1), 2 (1), 2.25 (2), 2.5 (1), 2.75 (1), 3.25 (1), 3.75 (2),\n\n4.25 (4), 4.5 (1), 4.75 (3), 5 (3), 5.25 (2), 5.5 (3), 5.75 (2), 6 (2)\n\nTotal: 1 +1 +1 +2 +1 +1 +1 +2 +4 +1 +3 +3 +2 +3 +2 +2 = 28\n\nYes, 28.\n\nSo, 28 / 50 = 0.56\n\nBut the options are higher, around 0.62 to 0.65.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, perhaps \"less than 6.1 minutes\" includes 6.0, but excludes 6.1.\n\nBut in my count, I included 6.0, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the data has more than 50 observations.\n\nWait, no, it's 50 observations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative relative frequency is calculated differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that \"less than 6.1\" includes all up to 6.0, which is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the total number of observations.\n\nWait, let me count the total number of observations again.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nRow 1: 0.50, 4.25, 5, 6, 7.25 \u2192 5\n\nRow 2: 1.75, 4.25, 5.25, 6, 7.25 \u2192 5\n\nRow 3: 2, "
