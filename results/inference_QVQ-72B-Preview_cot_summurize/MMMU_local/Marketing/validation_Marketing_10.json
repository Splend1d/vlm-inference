                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this probability distribution table for DVD rentals at Video To Go. The table shows the number of DVDs a customer rents, from 0 to 5, and their corresponding probabilities. The question is asking for the probability that a customer rents exactly three DVDs.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to look at the table to find the probability for x = 3. Let me check the table:\n\nx | P(x)\n\n0 | 0.03\n\n1 | 0.50\n\n2 | 0.24\n\n3 | 0.07\n\n4 | 0.07\n\n5 | 0.04\n\nAlright, so for x = 3, P(x) is 0.07. But wait, the options given are:\n\nA. 0.11\n\nB. 0.12\n\nC. 0.55\n\nD. 0.77\n\nHmm, 0.07 isn't among the options. Maybe there's a mistake or perhaps I need to calculate something differently. Let me think.\n\nIs there a possibility that the question is asking for something else? It clearly says \"the probability that a customer rents three DVDs,\" which should be P(x=3), which is 0.07. But that's not an option.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a typo in the table or the options. Alternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or mislabeled. But based on the information given, P(x=3) is 0.07.\n\nLet me double-check the table to make sure I'm not missing anything. The table lists probabilities for x from 0 to 5, and P(3) is indeed 0.07. Maybe the question is testing whether I can identify that none of the provided options are correct, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to ask for the probability of renting three DVDs given some other condition, but it doesn't seem like it. It's pretty straightforward: just the probability of renting three DVDs.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's a cumulative probability, like the probability of renting three or fewer DVDs. But that would be P(x \u2264 3), which is P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) = 0.03 + 0.50 + 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.84. But that's not among the options either.\n\nOr maybe the probability of renting at least three DVDs, which would be P(x \u2265 3) = P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 0.07 + 0.07 + 0.04 = 0.18. Still, that's not matching any of the options.\n\nHmm. I'm starting to think there might be an error in the question or the options provided. Maybe the options are for a different question or something.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret \"a customer rents three DVDs.\" Perhaps it's referring to the probability of renting exactly three DVDs, which, as I said, is 0.07, or P(3) = 0.07.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the five-video limit mentioned in the problem. It says there's a five-video limit per customer, so nobody ever rents more than five DVDs. But since the table already lists probabilities up to five DVDs, that shouldn't affect the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probabilities are not properly normalized, but checking the sum of the probabilities: 0.03 + 0.50 + 0.24 + 0.07 + 0.07 + 0.04 = 1.00. They sum to 1, so they are properly normalized.\n\nI'm really at a loss here. The straightforward answer is 0.07, but that's not an option. Maybe I need to express it as a fraction? 0.07 is 7/100, but that doesn't match any of the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the options. For example, if I mistakenly added P(2) and P(3), that would be 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31, which isn't an option. Or P(1) + P(2) = 0.50 + 0.24 = 0.74, still not matching.\n\nMaybe the options are supposed to represent cumulative probabilities, but as I calculated earlier, that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is about the expected value or something else, but no, it's directly asking for the probability of renting three DVDs.\n\nI think the most reasonable conclusion is that there's an error in the options provided, and the correct answer should be 0.07, which isn't listed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.07} \\]"
