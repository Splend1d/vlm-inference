                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got this table here that shows the sales of different types of fries\u2014skinny, curly, and steak\u2014in four different regions of the country: Northeast, South, Central, and West. The food manufacturer is worried about decreasing sales of skinny fries and wants to know if the type of fries sold is independent of the region. We need to do a test of independence, and at a 5% significance level, decide whether there's a relationship between the type of fries and the location.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a test of independence is. From what I remember in statistics, a test of independence uses the chi-square distribution to see if two categorical variables are related or independent of each other. In this case, the two variables are the type of fries and the region where they're sold.\n\nSo, the null hypothesis (H0) would be that the type of fries and the region are independent, meaning that the type of fries sold doesn't depend on the region. The alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that they are dependent, meaning there is a relationship between the type of fries and the region.\n\nGiven that, I need to calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the table under the assumption that the variables are independent. Then, I'll compare these expected frequencies with the observed frequencies provided in the table. The chi-square test statistic is calculated by summing the squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequencies.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the expected frequency for each cell:\n\n\\[ E_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{row total}_i \\times \\text{column total}_j}{\\text{grand total}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E_{ij} \\) is the expected frequency for the cell in the \\( i \\)-th row and \\( j \\)-th column.\n\n- \\( \\text{row total}_i \\) is the total for the \\( i \\)-th row.\n\n- \\( \\text{column total}_j \\) is the total for the \\( j \\)-th column.\n\n- \\( \\text{grand total} \\) is the total of all observations.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the row totals and column totals from the table.\n\nLet's list out the observed frequencies (O):\n\n- Skinny fries:\n\n- Northeast: 70\n\n- South: 50\n\n- Central: 20\n\n- West: 25\n\n- Curly fries:\n\n- Northeast: 100\n\n- South: 60\n\n- Central: 15\n\n- West: 30\n\n- Steak fries:\n\n- Northeast: 20\n\n- South: 40\n\n- Central: 10\n\n- West: 10\n\nNow, calculate the row totals:\n\n- Skinny fries total: 70 + 50 + 20 + 25 = 165\n\n- Curly fries total: 100 + 60 + 15 + 30 = 205\n\n- Steak fries total: 20 + 40 + 10 + 10 = 80\n\nAnd the column totals:\n\n- Northeast: 70 + 100 + 20 = 190\n\n- South: 50 + 60 + 40 = 150\n\n- Central: 20 + 15 + 10 = 45\n\n- West: 25 + 30 + 10 = 65\n\nThe grand total is: 165 + 205 + 80 = 450\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected frequencies for each cell.\n\nStarting with Skinny fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ E_{11} = \\frac{165 \\times 190}{450} = \\frac{31,350}{450} = 70 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ E_{21} = \\frac{205 \\times 190}{450} = \\frac{38,950}{450} \\approx 86.56 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ E_{31} = \\frac{80 \\times 190}{450} = \\frac{15,200}{450} \\approx 33.78 \\]\n\nNow, Skinny fries in the South:\n\n\\[ E_{12} = \\frac{165 \\times 150}{450} = \\frac{24,750}{450} = 55 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the South:\n\n\\[ E_{22} = \\frac{205 \\times 150}{450} = \\frac{30,750}{450} \\approx 68.33 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the South:\n\n\\[ E_{32} = \\frac{80 \\times 150}{450} = \\frac{12,000}{450} \\approx 26.67 \\]\n\nNext, Skinny fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ E_{13} = \\frac{165 \\times 45}{450} = \\frac{7,425}{450} = 16.5 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ E_{23} = \\frac{205 \\times 45}{450} = \\frac{9,225}{450} \\approx 20.5 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ E_{33} = \\frac{80 \\times 45}{450} = \\frac{3,600}{450} = 8 \\]\n\nFinally, Skinny fries in the West:\n\n\\[ E_{14} = \\frac{165 \\times 65}{450} = \\frac{10,725}{450} \\approx 23.83 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the West:\n\n\\[ E_{24} = \\frac{205 \\times 65}{450} = \\frac{13,325}{450} \\approx 29.61 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the West:\n\n\\[ E_{34} = \\frac{80 \\times 65}{450} = \\frac{5,200}{450} \\approx 11.56 \\]\n\nNow that I have all the expected frequencies, I can calculate the chi-square test statistic using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \\]\n\nWhere O is the observed frequency and E is the expected frequency.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFor Skinny fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(70 - 70)^2}{70} = 0 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(100 - 86.56)^2}{86.56} \\approx \\frac{(13.44)^2}{86.56} \\approx 2.03 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the Northeast:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(20 - 33.78)^2}{33.78} \\approx \\frac{(13.78)^2}{33.78} \\approx 5.24 \\]\n\nSkinny fries in the South:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(50 - 55)^2}{55} \\approx \\frac{(-5)^2}{55} \\approx 0.45 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the South:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(60 - 68.33)^2}{68.33} \\approx \\frac{(-8.33)^2}{68.33} \\approx 0.99 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the South:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(40 - 26.67)^2}{26.67} \\approx \\frac{(13.33)^2}{26.67} \\approx 6.56 \\]\n\nSkinny fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(20 - 16.5)^2}{16.5} \\approx \\frac{(3.5)^2}{16.5} \\approx 0.73 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(15 - 20.5)^2}{20.5} \\approx \\frac{(-5.5)^2}{20.5} \\approx 1.49 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the Central:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(10 - 8)^2}{8} = \\frac{(2)^2}{8} = 0.5 \\]\n\nSkinny fries in the West:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(25 - 23.83)^2}{23.83} \\approx \\frac{(1.17)^2}{23.83} \\approx 0.05 \\]\n\nCurly fries in the West:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(30 - 29.61)^2}{29.61} \\approx \\frac{(0.39)^2}{29.61} \\approx 0.005 \\]\n\nSteak fries in the West:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(10 - 11.56)^2}{11.56} \\approx \\frac{(-1.56)^2}{11.56} \\approx 0.21 \\]\n\nNow, summing all these up:\n\n0 + 2.03 + 5.24 + 0.45 + 0.99 + 6.56 + 0.73 + 1.49 + 0.5 + 0.05 + 0.005 + 0.21 \u2248 17.225\n\nSo, the chi-square test statistic is approximately 17.225.\n\nNext, I need to determine the degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution. For a test of independence, the degrees of freedom are calculated as:\n\n\\[ df = (r - 1)(c - 1) \\]\n\nWhere r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.\n\nIn this table, there are 3 rows (types of fries) and 4 columns (regions), so:\n\n\\[ df = (3 - 1)(4 - 1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, I need to find the critical value for the chi-square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom at a 5% significance level. I think the critical value for df=6 and \u03b1=0.05 is approximately 12.59.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a p-value approach. If the calculated chi-square value is greater than the critical value, or if the p-value is less than 0.05, I should reject the null hypothesis.\n\nGiven that our calculated chi-square is approximately 17.225, which is greater than 12.59, it suggests that we should reject the null hypothesis.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's find the p-value associated with this chi-square value with 6 degrees of freedom.\n\nLooking up a chi-square table or using a calculator, a chi-square value of 17.225 with 6 degrees of freedom corresponds to a p-value that is less than 0.01.\n\nSince the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the type of fries and the region are dependent variables.\n\nSo, the answer is B. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\n\nB. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\n\nC. Not certain.\n\nGiven that our calculation leads us to reject the null hypothesis, the correct choice is B.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's make sure we didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLooking back at the expected frequencies:\n\n- Skinny fries:\n\n- Northeast: 70\n\n- South: 55\n\n- Central: 16.5\n\n- West: 23.83\n\n- Curly fries:\n\n- Northeast: 86.56\n\n- South: 68.33\n\n- Central: 20.5\n\n- West: 29.61\n\n- Steak fries:\n\n- Northeast: 33.78\n\n- South: 26.67\n\n- Central: 8\n\n- West: 11.56\n\nAnd the observed frequencies:\n\n- Skinny fries:\n\n- Northeast: 70\n\n- South: 50\n\n- Central: 20\n\n- West: 25\n\n- Curly fries:\n\n- Northeast: 100\n\n- South: 60\n\n- Central: 15\n\n- West: 30\n\n- Steak fries:\n\n- Northeast: 20\n\n- South: 40\n\n- Central: 10\n\n- West: 10\n\nLooking at these, it seems that there are discrepancies between observed and expected frequencies, particularly in the Northeast for curly fries and steak fries, and in the South for steak fries.\n\nGiven that the chi-square test statistic is significant (p < 0.05), we can conclude that there is a relationship between the type of fries and the region.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
