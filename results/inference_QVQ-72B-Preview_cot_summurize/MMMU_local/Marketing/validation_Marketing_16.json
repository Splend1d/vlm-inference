                    "text": "Let's tackle this statistics problem. So, I've got a table that shows the flossing frequency for adults with gum disease. There are four columns: \"# flossing per week,\" \"frequency,\" \"relative frequency,\" and \"cumulative relative frequency.\" But some of the cells are missing. My task is to find out what percent of these adults flossed at most three times per week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given and what's missing. Let's look at the table:\n\n- # flossing per week: 0, frequency: 27, relative frequency: 0.4500\n\n- # flossing per week: 1, frequency: 18\n\n- # flossing per week: 3, frequency: ?, cumulative relative frequency: 0.9333\n\n- # flossing per week: 6, frequency: 3, relative frequency: 0.0500\n\n- # flossing per week: 7, frequency: 1, relative frequency: 0.0167\n\nTotal number of adults is 60, since it's mentioned that sixty adults were surveyed.\n\nI need to find the percentage of adults who flossed at most three times per week. That means I need to consider the frequencies for # flossing per week equal to 0, 1, and 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the frequency for # flossing per week equal to 3. Since the cumulative relative frequency up to 3 times per week is given as 0.9333, and I know that the relative frequency is just the frequency divided by the total number of observations, I can use this information to find the missing frequency.\n\nBut before that, let's confirm the total frequency. The frequencies given are:\n\n- 0: 27\n\n- 1: 18\n\n- 6: 3\n\n- 7: 1\n\nTotal frequency so far: 27 + 18 + 3 + 1 = 49\n\nTotal number of adults is 60, so the frequency for # flossing per week equal to 3 should be 60 - 49 = 11.\n\nWait, but the cumulative relative frequency for 3 times per week is 0.9333, which suggests that the cumulative frequency up to 3 times is 0.9333 * 60.\n\nLet me calculate that: 0.9333 * 60 = 56.\n\nSo, the cumulative frequency up to 3 times per week is 56.\n\nNow, let's check the frequencies again:\n\n- 0: 27\n\n- 1: 18\n\n- 3: ?\n\n- 6: 3\n\n- 7: 1\n\nTotal frequency should be 60, and cumulative up to 3 should be 56, so frequency for 3 should be 56 - (27 + 18) = 56 - 45 = 11.\n\nWait, hold on. If frequency for 3 is 11, then total frequency is 27 + 18 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 59, which is one less than 60. Maybe there's an error in the table or my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cumulative relative frequency is not including all categories up to 3.\n\nWait, the cumulative relative frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies up to that point. So, up to 3 times per week, it's 0.9333.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the total relative frequency should be 1, the remaining 0.0667 should correspond to the relative frequency of 6 and 7 combined.\n\nGiven that frequency for 6 is 3 and for 7 is 1, total frequency for 6 and 7 is 4, so relative frequency is 4/60 = 0.0667, which matches.\n\nSo, frequency for 3 is indeed 11.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of adults who flossed at most three times per week. That would be the sum of frequencies for 0, 1, and 3, which is 27 + 18 + 11 = 56.\n\nTo find the percentage, divide this by the total number of adults and multiply by 100: (56 / 60) * 100 = 93.333...\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 90.25%\n\nB. 94.21%\n\nC. 93.33%\n\nD. 95.50%\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nTotal frequency: 27 + 18 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 60, which matches the total number of adults.\n\nCumulative relative frequency up to 3 times: 0.9333, which is 56 out of 60, confirming that 56 adults flossed at most three times per week.\n\nTherefore, the percentage is indeed 93.33%.\n\nI think the answer is C. 93.33%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
