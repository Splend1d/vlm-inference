                    "text": "Let's tackle this statistics problem. So, I have a table that shows the frequency of different numbers of colors on national flags. There are 39 flags in total, and the number of colors ranges from 1 to 5. I need to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of colors on national flags.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sample mean and the sample standard deviation from the data provided. Then, I'll use these values to find the confidence interval.\n\nLet me start by finding the sample mean. I'll use the formula for the mean:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum (x \\times \\text{freq.})}{n}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the number of colors, and \\(n\\) is the total number of flags.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- \\(x = 1\\), freq. = 1\n\n- \\(x = 2\\), freq. = 7\n\n- \\(x = 3\\), freq. = 18\n\n- \\(x = 4\\), freq. = 7\n\n- \\(x = 5\\), freq. = 6\n\nSo, the total number of flags, \\(n = 1 + 7 + 18 + 7 + 6 = 39\\).\n\nNow, calculate the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum (x \\times \\text{freq.}) = (1 \\times 1) + (2 \\times 7) + (3 \\times 18) + (4 \\times 7) + (5 \\times 6) = 1 + 14 + 54 + 28 + 30 = 127\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sample mean is:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{127}{39} \\approx 3.2564\n\\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\). The formula is:\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x - \\bar{x})^2 \\times \\text{freq.}}{n - 1}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll calculate \\((x - \\bar{x})^2\\) for each value of \\(x\\):\n\n- For \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n1 - 3.2564 \\approx -2.2564 \\rightarrow (-2.2564)^2 \\approx 5.091\n\\]\n\n- For \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2 - 3.2564 \\approx -1.2564 \\rightarrow (-1.2564)^2 \\approx 1.578\n\\]\n\n- For \\(x = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n3 - 3.2564 \\approx -0.2564 \\rightarrow (-0.2564)^2 \\approx 0.0657\n\\]\n\n- For \\(x = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n4 - 3.2564 \\approx 0.7436 \\rightarrow (0.7436)^2 \\approx 0.553\n\\]\n\n- For \\(x = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n5 - 3.2564 \\approx 1.7436 \\rightarrow (1.7436)^2 \\approx 3.040\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply each by their frequency:\n\n- \\(5.091 \\times 1 = 5.091\\)\n\n- \\(1.578 \\times 7 \\approx 11.046\\)\n\n- \\(0.0657 \\times 18 \\approx 1.1826\\)\n\n- \\(0.553 \\times 7 \\approx 3.871\\)\n\n- \\(3.040 \\times 6 \\approx 18.24\\)\n\nSum these up:\n\n\\[\n5.091 + 11.046 + 1.1826 + 3.871 + 18.24 \\approx 39.4296\n\\]\n\nThen, divide by \\(n - 1 = 38\\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{39.4296}{38}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0376} \\approx 1.0186\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the 95% confidence interval for the mean, I'll use the t-distribution since the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (n=39). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, n-1} \\left( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\n- \\(t_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, n-1}\\) is the t-score with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\) and confidence level \\(1 - \\alpha\\)\n\n- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), so \\(t_{0.025, 38}\\).\n\nLooking up the t-table, for df = 38, the t-score is approximately 2.024.\n\nNow, calculate the standard error:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{1.0186}{\\sqrt{39}} \\approx \\frac{1.0186}{6.245} \\approx 0.1631\n\\]\n\nThen, the margin of error is:\n\n\\[\n2.024 \\times 0.1631 \\approx 0.330\n\\]\n\nFinally, the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\n3.2564 \\pm 0.330\n\\]\n\nSo, the lower limit is \\(3.2564 - 0.330 \\approx 2.9264\\) and the upper limit is \\(3.2564 + 0.330 \\approx 3.5864\\).\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the confidence interval is approximately (2.93, 3.59).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (2.92, 3.60)\n\nB. (2.93, 3.60)\n\nC. (2.92, 3.59)\n\nD. (2.93, 3.59)\n\nMy calculation gives me (2.93, 3.59), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the sample mean:\n\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1 + (2 \\times 7) + (3 \\times 18) + (4 \\times 7) + (5 \\times 6)}{39} = \\frac{1 + 14 + 54 + 28 + 30}{39} = \\frac{127}{39} \\approx 3.2564\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, the standard deviation:\n\nCalculate \\((x - \\bar{x})^2\\) for each value:\n\n- \\(1 - 3.2564 = -2.2564; (-2.2564)^2 \\approx 5.091\\)\n\n- \\(2 - 3.2564 = -1.2564; (-1.2564)^2 \\approx 1.578\\)\n\n- \\(3 - 3.2564 = -0.2564; (-0.2564)^2 \\approx 0.0657\\)\n\n- \\(4 - 3.2564 = 0.7436; (0.7436)^2 \\approx 0.553\\)\n\n- \\(5 - 3.2564 = 1.7436; (1.7436)^2 \\approx 3.040\\)\n\nMultiply by frequency:\n\n- \\(5.091 \\times 1 = 5.091\\)\n\n- \\(1.578 \\times 7 \\approx 11.046\\)\n\n- \\(0.0657 \\times 18 \\approx 1.1826\\)\n\n- \\(0.553 \\times 7 \\approx 3.871\\)\n\n- \\(3.040 \\times 6 \\approx 18.24\\)\n\nSum: \\(5.091 + 11.046 + 1.1826 + 3.871 + 18.24 \\approx 39.4296\\)\n\nThen, \\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{39.4296}{38}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0376} \\approx 1.0186\\)\n\nThat looks right.\n\nNow, for the t-score, df=38, 95% confidence:\n\nUsing a t-table, t \u2248 2.024\n\nStandard error: \\(s / \\sqrt{n} = 1.0186 / \\sqrt{39} \\approx 0.1631\\)\n\nMargin of error: \\(2.024 \\times 0.1631 \\approx 0.330\\)\n\nSo, confidence interval: \\(3.2564 \\pm 0.330\\), which is approximately \\(2.9264\\) to \\(3.5864\\), or \\(2.93\\) to \\(3.59\\) when rounded to two decimals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. (2.93, 3.59)\n\nBut let me check if there's any possibility of a different approach or if I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider using the z-distribution instead of the t-distribution. However, since the sample size is 39, which is relatively small, and the population standard deviation is unknown, it's more appropriate to use the t-distribution.\n\nAnother way is to use the normal approximation, but that might not be as accurate.\n\nAlso, perhaps I should verify the calculations using a calculator or software, but since I don't have access to that right now, I'll stick with my manual calculations.\n\nIn summary, based on my calculations, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of colors on national flags is approximately (2.93, 3.59), which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
