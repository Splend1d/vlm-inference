                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this table of baseball hits for four famous players: Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron. The table shows how many singles, doubles, triples, and home runs each of them hit in their careers. There's also a total hits column for each player and a total at the bottom for all players combined. The question is, if I randomly select one hit from the entire table, what's the probability that it was made by Babe Ruth?\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what probability means. Probability is basically a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In this case, the event is selecting a hit that was made by Babe Ruth.\n\nSo, to find this probability, I need to divide the number of hits by Babe Ruth by the total number of hits in the table.\n\nLet me look at the table again. For Babe Ruth, his total hits are given as 2,873. That means he has 2,873 hits in total.\n\nThen, the total hits for all players combined are 12,351. So, if I have 12,351 hits in total and I pick one at random, the probability that it's a hit by Babe Ruth should be his total hits divided by the overall total hits.\n\nSo, that would be 2,873 divided by 12,351.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question says \"suppose that one hit from the table is randomly selected. Find P(hit was made by Babe Ruth).\"\n\nSo, yes, it's just the number of hits by Babe Ruth divided by the total number of hits.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1518/2873\n\nB. 2873/12351\n\nC. 583/12351\n\nD. 4189/12351\n\nHmm, option B seems to match what I just thought: 2873/12351.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm not seeing.\n\nIs there any chance that the total hits might not include all types of hits? Let me check the table again.\n\nThe table has columns for singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, and then a total hits column for each player. At the bottom, there are totals for each type of hit and the overall total hits.\n\nSo, the total hits for Babe Ruth are 2,873, and the grand total is 12,351.\n\nTherefore, the probability should indeed be 2873/12351.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider only certain types of hits or something. Let's see.\n\nThe question says: \"one hit from the table is randomly selected. Find P(hit was made by Babe Ruth).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the type of hit, just any hit from the table.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nOption B seems to be the right answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe they want me to calculate it based on a specific type of hit, but the question clearly says \"one hit from the table,\" without specifying the type.\n\nSo, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want me to consider the probability based on the number of at-bats or something, but no, the table only provides hits, not at-bats.\n\nSo, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me look at the other options.\n\nOption A is 1518/2873.\n\nLooking at the table, 1518 is the total hits for Jackie Robinson, and 2873 is Babe Ruth's total hits.\n\nSo, that would be the probability of selecting a hit by Jackie Robinson given that it's a hit by Babe Ruth, or something like that, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nOption C is 583/12351.\n\n583 is the total triples for all players, which doesn't relate directly to Babe Ruth's hits.\n\nOption D is 4189/12351.\n\n4189 is Ty Cobb's total hits, which again doesn't relate to Babe Ruth.\n\nTherefore, the only logical answer is option B: 2873/12351.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
