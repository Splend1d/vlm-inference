                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got this table with scores from wives and husbands on how pleased they are with the division of childcare responsibilities. The scores range from 1 to 5, where 1 means they strongly agree that they're pleased, and 5 means they strongly disagree. We're supposed to conduct a hypothesis test to see if the husband's satisfaction level is higher than the wife's, on average, within these dual-career couples.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked. We have paired data here\u2014each wife's score is paired with her husband's score. So, it's a paired t-test scenario. The null hypothesis should be that the mean difference between the husband's and wife's scores is zero, meaning no difference in satisfaction levels on average. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean difference is negative, meaning husbands are, on average, more satisfied than their wives.\n\nSo, in notation:\n\n- Null hypothesis (H0): \u03bcd = 0\n\n- Alternative hypothesis (Ha): \u03bcd < 0\n\nWhere \u03bcd is the mean difference between the husband's and wife's scores.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the differences for each pair. Since higher scores indicate less agreement, a negative difference would mean the husband has a lower score (higher agreement/pleasure) than the wife, which aligns with the alternative hypothesis.\n\nLet me list out the differences:\n\nGiven the table:\n\n| Wife's score | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |\n\n| Husband's score | 2 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |\n\nDifference (Husband - Wife): d = H - W\n\nSo, calculating each difference:\n\n2 - 2 = 0\n\n2 - 2 = 0\n\n1 - 3 = -2\n\n3 - 3 = 0\n\n2 - 4 = -2\n\n1 - 2 = -1\n\n1 - 1 = 0\n\n1 - 1 = 0\n\n2 - 2 = 0\n\n4 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, the differences are: 0, 0, -2, 0, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nNow, I need to calculate the mean of these differences:\n\nMean difference, d\u0304 = sum of differences / number of pairs\n\nSum of differences: 0 + 0 + (-2) + 0 + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -5\n\nNumber of pairs: 10\n\nSo, d\u0304 = -5 / 10 = -0.5\n\nThis suggests that, on average, husbands have a lower score (higher agreement) than their wives by 0.5 points.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the standard deviation of the differences, sd.\n\nThe formula for sd is:\n\nsd = sqrt[sum(d - d\u0304)^2 / (n - 1)]\n\nFirst, calculate each (d - d\u0304)^2:\n\nd\u0304 = -0.5\n\nDifferences: 0, 0, -2, 0, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nCalculate each difference minus d\u0304:\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n-2 - (-0.5) = -1.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n-2 - (-0.5) = -1.5\n\n-1 - (-0.5) = -0.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\n0 - (-0.5) = 0.5\n\nNow, square each of these:\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n(-0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nSum of these squares: 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = Let's add them up step by step:\n\n0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50\n\n0.50 + 2.25 = 2.75\n\n2.75 + 0.25 = 3.00\n\n3.00 + 2.25 = 5.25\n\n5.25 + 0.25 = 5.50\n\n5.50 + 0.25 = 5.75\n\n5.75 + 0.25 = 6.00\n\n6.00 + 0.25 = 6.25\n\n6.25 + 0.25 = 6.50\n\n6.50 + 0.25 = 6.75\n\nSo, sum of squares = 6.75\n\nNow, sd = sqrt(6.75 / 9) because n-1 = 9\n\nsd = sqrt(0.75)\n\nWait, 6.75 / 9 = 0.75, yes.\n\nsqrt(0.75) \u2248 0.866\n\nSo, sd \u2248 0.866\n\nNow, the t-score is calculated as:\n\nt = (d\u0304 - \u03bcd) / (sd / sqrt(n))\n\nUnder H0, \u03bcd = 0\n\nSo, t = (-0.5 - 0) / (0.866 / sqrt(10))\n\nFirst, calculate sqrt(10) \u2248 3.162\n\nThen, sd / sqrt(10) \u2248 0.866 / 3.162 \u2248 0.274\n\nSo, t = -0.5 / 0.274 \u2248 -1.825\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -1.96\n\nB. -1.86\n\nC. -1.26\n\nD. -0.96\n\nMy calculation gives approximately -1.825, which is closest to option B. -1.86\n\nBut I should check if there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me verify the sum of differences:\n\n0 + 0 + (-2) + 0 + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -5\n\nMean difference: -0.5\n\nSum of squares:\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n(-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n(-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n(-0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25\n\nSum: 0.25*6 + 2.25*2 = 1.5 + 4.5 = 6.0\n\nYes, sum of squares is 6.0\n\nsd = sqrt(6.0 / 9) = sqrt(0.666...) \u2248 0.8165\n\nWait, earlier I thought sd was 0.866, but actually, sqrt(6/9) = sqrt(2/3) \u2248 0.8165\n\nSo, sd \u2248 0.8165\n\nThen, t = -0.5 / (0.8165 / sqrt(10)) = -0.5 / (0.8165 / 3.162) \u2248 -0.5 / 0.258 \u2248 -1.945\n\nHmm, now it's closer to -1.95, which isn't matching my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum of squares.\n\nLet me recalculate sum of (d - d\u0304)^2\n\nd\u0304 = -0.5\n\nDifferences: 0, 0, -2, 0, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nSo:\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(-2 - (-0.5))^2 = (-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(-2 - (-0.5))^2 = 2.25\n\n(-1 - (-0.5))^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\nNow, sum these up: 0.25 * 6 + 2.25 * 2 = 1.5 + 4.5 = 6.0\n\nYes, sum of squares is 6.0\n\nThen, sd = sqrt(6.0 / 9) = sqrt(0.666...) \u2248 0.8165\n\nThen, t = -0.5 / (0.8165 / sqrt(10)) = -0.5 / (0.8165 / 3.162) \u2248 -0.5 / 0.258 \u2248 -1.945\n\nSo, the t-value is approximately -1.95\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -1.96\n\nB. -1.86\n\nC. -1.26\n\nD. -0.96\n\nThe closest is option A. -1.96\n\nBut the problem is to calculate the t-value, and it seems like my calculation gives -1.945, which is closer to -1.96.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a more precise calculation.\n\nLet me use more decimal places.\n\nFirst, sum of differences: -5\n\nMean difference: -0.5\n\nSum of squares: 6.0\n\nsd = sqrt(6.0 / 9) = sqrt(0.666666...) \u2248 0.8164966\n\nThen, t = -0.5 / (0.8164966 / sqrt(10))\n\nsqrt(10) \u2248 3.1622777\n\nSo, t = -0.5 / (0.8164966 / 3.1622777) = -0.5 / 0.258169 \u2248 -1.936\n\nSo, approximately -1.936\n\nWhich is closest to option A. -1.96\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was -1.825, but with more precise calculations, it's -1.936.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is A. -1.96, considering rounding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum of squares.\n\nLet me double-check the sum of squares.\n\nDifferences: 0, 0, -2, 0, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nd\u0304 = -0.5\n\nSo:\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(-2 - (-0.5))^2 = (-1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(-2 - (-0.5))^2 = 2.25\n\n(-1 - (-0.5))^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\n(0 - (-0.5))^2 = 0.25\n\nSum: 0.25*6 + 2.25*2 = 1.5 + 4.5 = 6.0\n\nYes, sum of squares is 6.0\n\nThen, sd = sqrt(6.0 / 9) = sqrt(0.666666...) \u2248 0.8164966\n\nt = -0.5 / (0.8164966 / sqrt(10))\n\nsqrt(10) \u2248 3.1622777\n\nSo, t = -0.5 / (0.8164966 / 3.1622777) = -0.5 / 0.258169 \u2248 -1.936\n\nSo, -1.936 is closest to option A. -1.96\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. -1.96\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
