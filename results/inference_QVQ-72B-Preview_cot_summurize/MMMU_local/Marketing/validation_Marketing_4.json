                    "text": "So I've got this histogram here, and I need to describe its shape. The options are skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric. Let me look at it carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means:\n\n- Skewed left: This means that the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer, and the majority of the data is shifted to the right.\n\n- Skewed right: This means that the tail on the right side is longer, and most of the data is shifted to the left.\n\n- Symmetric: Here, the distribution is balanced on both sides, often resembling a normal distribution where the mean and median are approximately equal.\n\nNow, looking at the histogram:\n\n- The x-axis has values ranging from 3 to 7 , and the y-axis shows the frequency, which goes up to 7.\n\n- There are bars for each integer value from 3 to 7 .\n\n- The height of each bar represents the frequency of occurrences for that value.\n\nLet me list out the frequencies:\n\n- 3: approximately 1\n\n- 4: slightly above 1\n\n- 5: around 2\n\n- 6: about 4\n\n- 7: roughly 7\n\nSo, the frequencies increase as the values increase from 3 to 7 .\n\nLooking at this pattern, it seems that the frequencies are increasing as the values increase, which suggests that the higher values are more frequent than the lower ones.\n\nNow, to determine the skewness:\n\n- If the distribution is skewed left, the left tail (lower values) would be longer, and the right tail would be shorter.\n\n- If it's skewed right, the right tail (higher values) would be longer, and the left tail would be shorter.\n\n- If it's symmetric, both tails would be mirror images.\n\nIn this case, since the frequencies increase as the values increase, it seems like the distribution is skewed to the right because the higher values are more frequent, and the lower values have lower frequencies.\n\nWait a minute, let me think again. In a skewed right distribution, the majority of the data points are concentrated on the lower side, and the tail is longer on the higher side. But in this histogram, the higher values have higher frequencies, which might suggest that the tail is on the higher side, making it skewed right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that in a skewed left distribution, the peak is on the higher side, and the tail is on the lower side, which doesn't seem to match here because the frequencies are increasing as values increase.\n\nLet me consider the direction of the tail. In a skewed right distribution, the tail is longer on the right side, and the majority of the data is piled up on the left side. In this histogram, the data seems to be piling up towards the higher values, so the tail would be on the lower side, which would make it skewed left.\n\nWait, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe I need to visualize it.\n\nLet me imagine plotting this data:\n\n- At value 3, frequency 1\n\n- 4, frequency slightly above 1\n\n- 5, frequency around 2\n\n- 6, frequency about 4\n\n- 7, frequency roughly 7\n\nSo, it's clear that as the values increase, the frequencies increase. This means that higher values are more common, which suggests that the distribution is skewed to the right because the longer tail is on the higher side.\n\nBut according to the definition, in a skewed right distribution, the majority of the data is on the left, and the tail is on the right. However, in this case, the higher frequencies are on the higher values, which might suggest that the tail is on the lower side, making it skewed left.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the definition again.\n\nUpon reviewing, in a skewed right (or positively skewed) distribution, the tail is longer on the right side, and the bulk of the data is concentrated on the left. Conversely, in a skewed left (or negatively skewed) distribution, the tail is longer on the left side, and the bulk of the data is on the right.\n\nGiven that, in this histogram, the higher frequencies are on the higher values, it means that the majority of the data is on the higher side, and the lower values have lower frequencies, which would make the tail shorter on the lower side.\n\nWait, but in a skewed right distribution, the tail is on the right side, and the bulk is on the left. But in this histogram, the bulk is on the right (higher values), so it might be skewed left.\n\nI think I need to plot this mentally.\n\nImagine the histogram:\n\n- Starting from 3 to 4, frequency around 1 to slightly above 1\n\n- 4 to 5, frequency around 2\n\n- 5 to 6, frequency around 4\n\n- 6 to 7, frequency around 7\n\nSo, it's increasing as we go to the right.\n\nIn a skewed right distribution, the frequency should decrease as you go to the right, with the tail on the right.\n\nIn a skewed left distribution, the frequency should decrease as you go to the left, with the tail on the left.\n\nGiven that, this distribution seems to be skewed left because the frequency decreases as you go to the left.\n\nBut let's think about the mean and median. In a skewed right distribution, the mean is greater than the median because the tail pulls the mean to the right. In a skewed left distribution, the mean is less than the median because the tail is on the left.\n\nHowever, in this distribution, since higher values have higher frequencies, the median would be towards the higher side, and the mean would also be pulled towards the higher side, so they might be close.\n\nWait, perhaps this distribution is somewhat symmetric, but not perfectly.\n\nBut looking back at the options, it's between skewed left and skewed right, as symmetric seems unlikely given the increasing frequencies.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is skewed right, considering the higher frequencies on the higher values, indicating that the tail is on the lower side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neither perfectly skewed left nor right, but since I have to choose among the given options, I'll go with skewed right.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. The distribution is skewed right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
