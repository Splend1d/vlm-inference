                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It's about probability, specifically conditional probability, I think. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have data on the square footage of 28 homes, measured in thousands of square feet. The sample mean is 2.50, and the sample standard deviation is 0.8302. But importantly, it says the distribution can be written as X ~ U(1.5, 4.5). So, X is uniformly distributed between 1.5 and 4.5 thousand square feet.\n\nThe question is: what is P(x < 3.5 | x < 4)? And there are four options: A. 0.5, B. 0.625, C. 0.8, D. 0.875.\n\nAlright, so this is a conditional probability problem. I need to find the probability that a home has less than 3.5 thousand square feet, given that it has less than 4 thousand square feet.\n\nI remember that for continuous random variables, conditional probabilities can be found using the formula:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nBut since it's a uniform distribution, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a uniform distribution, the probability of any interval is proportional to the length of that interval.\n\nSo, the total interval is from 1.5 to 4.5, which has a length of 3 units (4.5 - 1.5 = 3).\n\nThe event x < 3.5 means from 1.5 to 3.5, which is a length of 2 units (3.5 - 1.5 = 2).\n\nThe event x < 4 means from 1.5 to 4, which is a length of 2.5 units (4 - 1.5 = 2.5).\n\nSo, P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) should be the probability that x is less than 3.5 given that it's less than 4.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think of it as the probability that x is less than 3.5 within the range from 1.5 to 4.\n\nSo, within the interval [1.5, 4], what's the probability that x < 3.5.\n\nWell, that would be the length from 1.5 to 3.5 divided by the length from 1.5 to 4.\n\nSo, that's 2 divided by 2.5, which is 0.8.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer would be C. 0.8.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of conditional probability formula.\n\nP(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = P(x < 3.5 and x < 4) / P(x < 4)\n\nBut P(x < 3.5 and x < 4) is just P(x < 3.5), since if x < 3.5, it's automatically less than 4.\n\nSo, P(x < 3.5) / P(x < 4) = (3.5 - 1.5)/ (4 - 1.5) = 2/2.5 = 0.8.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there any reason to think that the distribution might not be uniform? The problem says it's uniformly distributed, so I don't think I need to consider anything else.\n\nAlso, the sample mean and standard deviation are given, but since we're dealing with a uniform distribution, maybe they're just providing extra information.\n\nBut no, I think the answer is indeed 0.8.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the conditional distribution of x given that x < 4.\n\nSince the original distribution is uniform over [1.5, 4.5], conditioning on x < 4 would mean that x is uniform over [1.5, 4].\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, no. If x is uniform over [1.5, 4.5], then conditioning on x < 4 means it's uniform over [1.5, 4].\n\nBut wait, no. In continuous uniform distributions, conditioning on a range changes the distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me recall that for a uniform distribution over [a, b], the probability density function is 1/(b - a).\n\nSo, in this case, X ~ U(1.5, 4.5), so f(x) = 1/(4.5 - 1.5) = 1/3 for x between 1.5 and 4.5, and 0 otherwise.\n\nNow, I need to find P(x < 3.5 | x < 4).\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n\nP(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = P(x < 3.5 and x < 4) / P(x < 4)\n\nBut P(x < 3.5 and x < 4) is just P(x < 3.5), because x < 3.5 implies x < 4.\n\nSo, P(x < 3.5) / P(x < 4).\n\nNow, P(x < a) for a uniform distribution U(c, d) is (a - c)/(d - c) if a is between c and d, else 0 or 1 accordingly.\n\nSo, P(x < 3.5) = (3.5 - 1.5)/(4.5 - 1.5) = 2/3 \u2248 0.666...\n\nAnd P(x < 4) = (4 - 1.5)/(4.5 - 1.5) = 2.5/3 \u2248 0.833...\n\nSo, 0.666... divided by 0.833... is indeed 0.8.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the conditional distribution.\n\nThe conditional distribution of x given x < 4 is uniform over [1.5, 4], because in the original distribution, x is uniform over [1.5, 4.5], and conditioning on x < 4 makes it uniform over [1.5, 4].\n\nSo, within [1.5, 4], the probability that x < 3.5 is the length from 1.5 to 3.5 divided by the length from 1.5 to 4, which is 2/2.5 = 0.8.\n\nAgain, this gives me the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
