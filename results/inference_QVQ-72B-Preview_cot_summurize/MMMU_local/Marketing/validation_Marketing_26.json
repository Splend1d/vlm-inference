                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this table that shows how musicians learned to play their instruments, broken down by gender. There are three ways they could have learned: self-taught, studied in school, or private instruction. The table has numbers for females and males in each category, and there are totals at the end of each row and column. The question is asking for the probability that a musician is female, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this table is telling me. Let's look at the female row:\n\n- Self-taught: 12\n\n- Studied in school: 38\n\n- Private instruction: 22\n\n- Total: 72\n\nAnd for males:\n\n- Self-taught: 19\n\n- Studied in school: 24\n\n- Private instruction: 15\n\n- Total: 58\n\nThen, the totals for each learning method across both genders:\n\n- Self-taught: 31\n\n- Studied in school: 62\n\n- Private instruction: 37\n\n- Grand total: 130\n\nSo, there are 130 musicians in total in this sample.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that a musician is female. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nHere, the favorable outcome is a musician being female, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of musicians.\n\nSo, P(musician is female) = number of female musicians / total number of musicians.\n\nFrom the table, the total number of female musicians is 72, and the total number of musicians is 130.\n\nTherefore, P(musician is female) = 72 / 130.\n\nNow, I need to simplify this fraction or convert it to a decimal to compare it with the given options.\n\nLet me see, 72 divided by 130.\n\nWell, 72 divided by 130 is the same as 72/130.\n\nTo simplify this fraction, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n72 \u00f7 2 = 36\n\n130 \u00f7 2 = 65\n\nSo, 72/130 = 36/65.\n\nNow, to get a decimal approximation, I can divide 36 by 65.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n36 divided by 65.\n\n65 goes into 36 zero times, so 0.\n\nAdd a decimal point and a zero, so 360 divided by 65.\n\n65 times 5 is 325, subtracted from 360 is 35.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 350.\n\n65 times 5 is 325, subtracted from 350 is 25.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 250.\n\n65 times 3 is 195, subtracted from 250 is 55.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 550.\n\n65 times 8 is 520, subtracted from 550 is 30.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 300.\n\n65 times 4 is 260, subtracted from 300 is 40.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 400.\n\n65 times 6 is 390, subtracted from 400 is 10.\n\nBring down a zero to make it 100.\n\n65 times 1 is 65, subtracted from 100 is 35.\n\nAnd we're back to where we were before, with 35 remaining.\n\nSo, 36 \u00f7 65 is approximately 0.5538...\n\nTherefore, P(musician is female) \u2248 0.5538.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.55\n\nB. 0.45\n\nC. 0.30\n\nD. 0.70\n\nThe closest option to 0.5538 is A. 0.55.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, confirming the total number of female musicians: 12 + 38 + 22 = 72. That's correct.\n\nTotal musicians: 130. That's correct.\n\nSo, 72/130 is indeed the probability.\n\nNow, dividing 72 by 130:\n\n72 \u00f7 130.\n\nLet me try a different approach for accuracy.\n\nI know that 130 \u00f7 2 = 65, and 72 \u00f7 2 = 36, so 72/130 = 36/65.\n\nNow, 36 \u00f7 65.\n\nI can approximate this.\n\n36 \u00f7 65 is roughly 0.5538, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, yes, approximately 0.55.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 0.55.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider, like the learning method?\n\nThe question is specifically asking for the probability that a musician is female, regardless of how they learned.\n\nSo, it's simply the total number of female musicians divided by the total number of musicians.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 0.55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.55} \\]"
