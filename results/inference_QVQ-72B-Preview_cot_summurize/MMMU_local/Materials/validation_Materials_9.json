                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a bell crank mechanism with a vertical force of \\( P=1500 \\) N applied to it. I need to find the average shear stress in the 6-mm diameter pin at point B, and it's subjected to double shear. The options are A. 60.5 MPa, B. 62.2 MPa, C. 40.5 MPa, and D. 40.2 MPa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the mechanism. There's a bell crank lever with points A, B, C, and D. There's a pin at point B, and it's being subjected to double shear. Shear stress is generally force per unit area, and in double shear, the force is distributed over two sections of the pin.\n\nSo, I need to find the force acting on the pin at B and then divide it by the shear area to find the shear stress.\n\nFirst, let's find the force acting on the pin at B. Since it's a bell crank, the force at A is transmitted through the lever to B. But I need to consider the geometry to find the exact force at B.\n\nLooking at the diagram, there are distances given: 300 mm from the support to point C and 450 mm from point C to point A. Also, there's a 45\u00b0 angle indicated.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the diagram shows a horizontal line from D to C, then from C to B at a 45\u00b0 angle, and from B to A horizontally. The force P is applied vertically downward at point A.\n\nI need to find the force at pin B. Since it's a bell crank, the force at B should be equal to P multiplied by the ratio of the lengths.\n\nLet me consider the geometry. From point C to B, it's at a 45\u00b0 angle, and from B to A is 450 mm horizontally.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the moments about point C to find the force at B.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Point D is fixed, connected to C, then from C to B at 45\u00b0, and from B to A horizontally, with a force P applied downward at A.\n\nI think if I take moments about point C, I can find the force at B.\n\nThe force P is at point A, which is 450 mm horizontally from B, and B is connected to C at a 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nWait, actually, from the diagram, point C is connected to D horizontally for 300 mm, then from C to B at 45\u00b0, and from B to A horizontally.\n\nSo, the distance from C to B is... wait, the horizontal distance from C to B is 300 mm, and the vertical distance is also 300 mm because it's at 45\u00b0.\n\nWait, no. If from C to B is at 45\u00b0, then the horizontal and vertical components are equal. So, if the horizontal distance from C to B is 300 mm, then the vertical distance is also 300 mm.\n\nWait, no. The horizontal distance from D to C is 300 mm, and from C to B is at 45\u00b0, so the horizontal and vertical components of C to B are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the length of CB.\n\nGiven that from C to B is at 45\u00b0, and the horizontal distance from D to C is 300 mm, but I'm not sure about the actual length of CB.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look back at the diagram again.\n\nLooking back, the diagram shows a horizontal line from D to C of 300 mm, then from C to B at 45\u00b0, and from B to A horizontally with a force P applied downward at A, which is 450 mm from B.\n\nSo, the horizontal distance from C to B is equal to the vertical distance because it's at 45\u00b0.\n\nLet me denote the length from C to B as L. Then, the horizontal component is \\( L \\cos(45^{\\circ}) \\) and the vertical component is \\( L \\sin(45^{\\circ}) \\).\n\nGiven that the horizontal distance from D to C is 300 mm, and from C to B is L cos(45\u00b0), so the total horizontal distance from D to B is 300 mm + L cos(45\u00b0).\n\nFrom B to A is horizontally 450 mm, so the total horizontal distance from D to A is 300 mm + L cos(45\u00b0) + 450 mm.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary.\n\nMaybe I should consider taking moments about point C to find the force at B.\n\nThe force P is applied downward at A, which is 450 mm horizontally from B.\n\nWait, but B is connected to C at 45\u00b0, so there is a force at B that is resolved into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the free-body diagram of the bell crank.\n\nLet me try to draw a free-body diagram.\n\nPoint D is fixed, connected to C horizontally with 300 mm.\n\nFrom C to B at 45\u00b0, so the distance from C to B is such that the horizontal and vertical components are equal.\n\nWait, if the angle is 45\u00b0, then horizontal and vertical components are equal.\n\nLet me denote the force at B as F_B, which has horizontal and vertical components.\n\nThe force P is applied downward at A.\n\nI need to find the relationship between P and F_B.\n\nMaybe I can take moments about point C.\n\nTaking moments about point C:\n\nThe moment due to P is P times the perpendicular distance from C to A.\n\nThe horizontal distance from C to A is 300 mm + 450 mm = 750 mm.\n\nBut the perpendicular distance from C to the line of action of P is the vertical distance from C to A.\n\nWait, from C to B is at 45\u00b0, so the vertical distance from C to B is 300 mm, and from B to A is horizontally 450 mm.\n\nSo, the total vertical distance from C to A is 300 mm.\n\nWait, no. If from C to B is at 45\u00b0, and the horizontal distance is 300 mm, then the vertical distance is also 300 mm.\n\nFrom B to A is horizontally 450 mm, so the total vertical distance from C to A is 300 mm.\n\nTherefore, the moment due to P about C is P times 300 mm.\n\nThe moment due to F_B about C is F_B times the perpendicular distance from C to B.\n\nSince F_B has both horizontal and vertical components, I need to consider their contributions separately.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to resolve F_B into its components.\n\nLet me denote F_Bx as the horizontal component of F_B and F_By as the vertical component of F_B.\n\nThen, taking moments about C:\n\nSum of moments about C:\n\n\\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} - F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0 \\)\n\nWait, why is that?\n\nBecause the horizontal component F_Bx times the perpendicular distance from C to B is zero, since it's horizontal and the moment arm is vertical.\n\nSo, only the vertical component F_By times the vertical distance from C to B (which is 300 mm) contributes to the moment.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} - F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( F_{B y} = P \\)\n\nSo, the vertical component of F_B is equal to P.\n\nGiven that P = 1500 N, then F_By = 1500 N.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal component F_Bx can be found by considering the horizontal equilibrium.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the entire mechanism.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nSince it's a bell crank, and the force is applied vertically at A, and the mechanism is designed such that the force at B is transmitted through the pin, perhaps the force at B is equal to P.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nGiven that, perhaps F_B = P = 1500 N.\n\nNow, the pin at B is in double shear, meaning that the pin is sheared across two planes.\n\nIn double shear, the shear stress is calculated as the force divided by twice the shear area.\n\nThe shear area for a circular pin is the cross-sectional area, which is \\( \\pi d^{2} / 4 \\), where d is the diameter.\n\nGiven that the pin diameter is 6 mm, first convert it to meters: 6 mm = 0.006 m.\n\nThen, the cross-sectional area is \\( \\pi \\times (0.006)^{2} / 4 \\) = \\( \\pi \\times 0.000036 / 4 \\) = \\( \\pi \\times 0.000009 \\) m\u00b2 \u2248 0.00002827 m\u00b2.\n\nSince it's double shear, the effective area is twice the cross-sectional area: 2 \u00d7 0.00002827 m\u00b2 \u2248 0.00005654 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, the shear stress is force divided by this effective area: 1500 N / 0.00005654 m\u00b2 \u2248 26535468.75 Pa.\n\nBut stress is usually expressed in MPa (megaPascals), so divide by 1,000,000: 26535468.75 / 1,000,000 \u2248 26.535 MPa.\n\nWait, but none of the options match this. The closest is 26.5 MPa, but that's not among the choices.\n\nSo, perhaps my assumption that F_B = P is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the geometry more carefully.\n\nLet me go back to the moment equation.\n\nTaking moments about point C:\n\n\\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} - F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( F_{B y} = P = 1500 \\mathrm{~N} \\)\n\nNow, considering horizontal equilibrium:\n\nThe horizontal forces must balance.\n\nThe horizontal force at B is F_Bx, and there is no other horizontal force applied.\n\nWait, actually, from A to B is horizontal, so the force P is applied downward at A, which is purely vertical.\n\nTherefore, the horizontal force at B should be equal to the horizontal component of F_B.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire bell crank as two parts: one part from D to C to B, and another from B to A.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look for similar problems or recall that in a bell crank lever, the force is transmitted with some mechanical advantage based on the lengths.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the force at B is not equal to P, but rather related through the lever arms.\n\nLet me consider the lever arms.\n\nFrom C to B is at 45\u00b0, and from B to A is horizontal.\n\nThe horizontal distance from C to A is 300 mm + 450 mm = 750 mm.\n\nBut the force P is applied at A, which is 450 mm from B horizontally.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the moment arms more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the principle of virtual work or consider the mechanical advantage, but that might be overkill.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the triangle formed by points C, B, and A.\n\nFrom C to B is at 45\u00b0, so the horizontal and vertical distances are equal, say 300 mm each.\n\nFrom B to A is horizontal, 450 mm.\n\nSo, the total horizontal distance from C to A is 300 mm (from C to B) + 450 mm (from B to A) = 750 mm.\n\nThe vertical distance from C to A is 300 mm (from C to B).\n\nTherefore, the distance from C to A is \\( \\sqrt{750^{2} + 300^{2}} = \\sqrt{562500 + 90000} = \\sqrt{652500} \\approx 807.78 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the angles.\n\nThe angle at B between CB and BA.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the mechanical advantage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the force at B is related to P by the ratio of the lever arms.\n\nBut I need to find that ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the velocities or use the concept of similar triangles.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider that in a bell crank lever, the force is transmitted with some mechanical advantage based on the lengths.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the force at B is equal to P multiplied by the ratio of the lengths.\n\nBut I need to find that ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the force at B is equal to P divided by some factor.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the force at B is equal to P times the ratio of the horizontal distance from C to A over the horizontal distance from C to B.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I should look for similar problems or seek help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the force at B is equal to P times the sine or cosine of some angle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the sine of 45\u00b0.\n\nGiven that from C to B is at 45\u00b0, sin(45\u00b0) = cos(45\u00b0) = \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.7071 \\)\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the force components.\n\nLet me try to find the force at B by resolving forces.\n\nThe force P is applied downward at A.\n\nAt point B, there is a force F_B, which has horizontal and vertical components.\n\nAt point C, there is a force F_C, which also has horizontal and vertical components.\n\nConsidering equilibrium in the horizontal direction:\n\nSum of horizontal forces = 0\n\n\\( F_{B x} + F_{C x} = 0 \\)\n\nConsidering equilibrium in the vertical direction:\n\nSum of vertical forces = 0\n\n\\( F_{B y} + F_{C y} - P = 0 \\)\n\nNow, from the moment equation about C:\n\n\\( P \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} - F_{B y} \\times 300 \\mathrm{~mm} = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( F_{B y} = P = 1500 \\mathrm{~N} \\)\n\nThen, from the vertical equilibrium equation:\n\n\\( 1500 \\mathrm{~N} + F_{C y} - 1500 \\mathrm{~N} = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( F_{C y} = 0 \\)\n\nFrom the horizontal equilibrium equation:\n\n\\( F_{B x} + F_{C x} = 0 \\)\n\nBut I don't have enough information to find F_Bx.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the force in the link from C to B.\n\nGiven that from C to B is at 45\u00b0, the force in that link should be resolved into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet me denote the force in CB as F_CB.\n\nThen, \\( F_{C x} = F_{C B} \\cos(45^{\\circ}) \\)\n\n\\( F_{C y} = F_{C B} \\sin(45^{\\circ}) \\)\n\nBut since \\( F_{C y} = 0 \\), then \\( F_{C B} \\sin(45^{\\circ}) = 0 \\), which implies that \\( F_{C B} = 0 \\), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the force at B is only in the vertical direction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps F_B is only vertical, and F_CB is only horizontal.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the 45\u00b0 angle.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that the force at B is equal to P times the mechanical advantage, which is the ratio of the lever arms.\n\nThe lever arm from C to A is 750 mm horizontally, and the lever arm from C to B is 300 mm horizontally.\n\nWait, no. The lever arm for the force at B is the perpendicular distance from C to the line of action of F_B.\n\nGiven that F_B is vertical, the perpendicular distance from C to F_B is the horizontal distance from C to B, which is 300 mm.\n\nSimilarly, the force P is applied at A, which is 750 mm horizontally from C.\n\nWait, no. From C to B is 300 mm horizontally, and from B to A is 450 mm horizontally, so total horizontal distance from C to A is 750 mm.\n\nBut the vertical distance from C to A is 300 mm.\n\nTherefore, the moment arm for P is the vertical distance from C to A, which is 300 mm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the concept of similar triangles or consider the actual lengths.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in a bell crank lever, the force is transmitted with some mechanical advantage based on the angles and lengths.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the force at B is equal to P multiplied by the ratio of the lever arms.\n\nBut I need to find that ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the force at B is equal to P divided by the cosine of some angle.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the law of sines in the triangle formed by points C, B, and A.\n\nThe horizontal distance from C to B is 300 mm, from B to A is 450 mm, and from C to A is 750 mm.\n\nWait, no. From C to B is at 45\u00b0, so the horizontal and vertical components are both 300 mm.\n\nFrom B"
