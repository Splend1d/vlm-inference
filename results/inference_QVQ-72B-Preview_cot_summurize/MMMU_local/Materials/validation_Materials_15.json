                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have this table of data from Charpy impact tests on a ductile cast iron, showing impact energy in joules at different temperatures in degrees Celsius. There's also a graph that plots these values, which should help me visualize what's going on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is. From what I recall, materials can exhibit different behaviors depending on the temperature. At higher temperatures, they tend to be more ductile, meaning they can deform without breaking. At lower temperatures, they become more brittle and can shatter under impact. So, there's a transition point where the material shifts from ductile to brittle behavior.\n\nThe problem asks me to determine this transition temperature by finding the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies. Okay, so I need to identify the highest and lowest impact energy values from the data provided and then take their average to find the transition temperature.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- At -25\u00b0C, impact energy is 124 J\n\n- -50\u00b0C, 123 J\n\n- -75\u00b0C, 115 J\n\n- -85\u00b0C, 100 J\n\n- -100\u00b0C, 73 J\n\n- -110\u00b0C, 52 J\n\n- -125\u00b0C, 26 J\n\n- -150\u00b0C, 9 J\n\n- -175\u00b0C, 6 J\n\nFrom these data, the highest impact energy is 124 J at -25\u00b0C, and the lowest is 6 J at -175\u00b0C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Looking at the graph, it seems that impact energy decreases as temperature decreases, which makes sense because the material becomes more brittle at lower temperatures.\n\nSo, maximum impact energy is 124 J, and minimum is 6 J.\n\nNow, the problem says to find the average of these maximum and minimum impact energies. So, average = (maximum + minimum) / 2 = (124 + 6) / 2 = 130 / 2 = 65 J.\n\nAlright, so the transition temperature corresponds to an impact energy of 65 J.\n\nNow, I need to find out at what temperature the impact energy is 65 J from the data provided.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- At -85\u00b0C, impact energy is 100 J\n\n- At -100\u00b0C, it's 73 J\n\n- At -110\u00b0C, it's 52 J\n\n- At -125\u00b0C, it's 26 J\n\nHmm, 65 J is between 73 J at -100\u00b0C and 52 J at -110\u00b0C.\n\nSo, the transition temperature should be somewhere between -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C.\n\nBut the problem provides options, and among them are -100\u00b0C, -110\u00b0C, -105\u00b0C, and -125\u00b0C.\n\nSince 65 J is closer to 73 J at -100\u00b0C than to 52 J at -110\u00b0C, maybe the transition temperature is -100\u00b0C.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a way to interpolate between these points to get a more accurate estimate.\n\nWe have:\n\n- At -100\u00b0C: 73 J\n\n- At -110\u00b0C: 52 J\n\nThe difference in temperature is 10\u00b0C, and the difference in impact energy is 73 - 52 = 21 J.\n\nSo, for every degree decrease in temperature, impact energy decreases by 21 / 10 = 2.1 J per degree Celsius.\n\nSo, from -100\u00b0C to -110\u00b0C, impact energy decreases by 21 J.\n\nNow, I need to find the temperature where impact energy is 65 J, which is between 73 J and 52 J.\n\nStarting from -100\u00b0C, 73 J, and wanting to reach 65 J.\n\nDifference in impact energy: 73 - 65 = 8 J\n\nIf impact energy decreases by 2.1 J per degree Celsius, then the temperature decrease would be 8 / 2.1 \u2248 3.8\u00b0C\n\nSo, from -100\u00b0C, decreasing by 3.8\u00b0C would bring me to -103.8\u00b0C\n\nBut among the options, the closest is -105\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the relationship isn't perfectly linear, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps linear interpolation is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the graph, it seems that the curve is steeper around -100\u00b0C to -110\u00b0C.\n\nLooking at the graph, the point where impact energy is 65 J seems to be around -105\u00b0C.\n\nYes, that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, considering that at -100\u00b0C, energy is 73 J, and at -110\u00b0C, it's 52 J, and 65 J is roughly midway between 73 J and 52 J, which would be (73 + 52)/2 = 62.5 J, which is close to 65 J.\n\nSo, -105\u00b0C would be a reasonable estimate.\n\nBut wait, let's check the other options.\n\nOption A is -100\u00b0C, which corresponds to 73 J, which is higher than 65 J.\n\nOption B is -110\u00b0C, which corresponds to 52 J, which is lower than 65 J.\n\nOption C is -105\u00b0C, which is between -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C.\n\nOption D is -125\u00b0C, which corresponds to 26 J, which is much lower than 65 J.\n\nSo, -125\u00b0C is definitely not the right choice.\n\nBetween -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C, -105\u00b0C seems the most logical choice based on the interpolation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the average of -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C, that would be -105\u00b0C.\n\nWait, that might be another way to look at it.\n\nBut earlier, I was calculating the average of the maximum and minimum energies, which was 65 J, and then finding the temperature corresponding to that energy.\n\nSo, perhaps both approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is -105\u00b0C, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-105^{\\circ} \\text{C}} \\]"
