                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a piece of plastic that's originally rectangular, and it's been deformed in such a way that the corners have moved by certain amounts. I need to find the average normal strain along the diagonal AC. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial and final positions of the points A, B, C, and D. From the diagram, it seems like:\n\n- Point A is at (400 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- Point B is at (400 mm + 3 mm, 4 mm)\n\n- Point C is at (0 mm + 2 mm, 300 mm + 2 mm)\n\n- Point D is at (0 mm, 300 mm - 5 mm + 2 mm = 297 mm)\n\nWait, but the diagram shows some dashed lines indicating the displaced positions. Let me make sure I have the correct coordinates.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n- A: (400 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- B: (400 mm, 300 mm)\n\n- C: (0 mm, 300 mm)\n\n- D: (0 mm, 0 mm)\n\nDisplaced positions:\n\n- A': (400 mm, 0 mm) + 2 mm in x-direction? Wait, the diagram shows A moving 2 mm in x-direction?\n\nActually, looking back, the diagram shows point A moving 2 mm in the x-direction, point B moving 4 mm in the y-direction and 5 mm in the x-direction, point C moving 2 mm in the y-direction and 2 mm in the x-direction, and point D moving 2 mm in the y-direction and 3 mm in the x-direction.\n\nWait, no, the diagram seems to indicate that point A is moving 2 mm in the x-direction, point B is moving 4 mm in the y-direction and 5 mm in the x-direction, point C is moving 2 mm in the y-direction and 2 mm in the x-direction, and point D is moving 2 mm in the y-direction and 3 mm in the x-direction.\n\nSo, displaced positions:\n\n- A': (400 mm + 2 mm, 0 mm) = (402 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- B': (400 mm + 5 mm, 300 mm + 4 mm) = (405 mm, 304 mm)\n\n- C': (0 mm + 2 mm, 300 mm + 2 mm) = (2 mm, 302 mm)\n\n- D': (0 mm + 3 mm, 300 mm - 5 mm + 2 mm) Wait, the diagram shows point D moving 3 mm in the x-direction and 2 mm in the y-direction, but the y-displacement is given as 4 mm for point B, and 2 mm for point C and D.\n\nActually, I think there might be some confusion in interpreting the diagram. Let me look again.\n\nThe diagram shows:\n\n- Point A at (400 mm, 0 mm), moving to (400 mm + 2 mm, 0 mm + 0 mm) = (402 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- Point B at (400 mm, 300 mm), moving to (400 mm + 5 mm, 300 mm + 4 mm) = (405 mm, 304 mm)\n\n- Point C at (0 mm, 300 mm), moving to (0 mm + 2 mm, 300 mm + 2 mm) = (2 mm, 302 mm)\n\n- Point D at (0 mm, 0 mm), moving to (0 mm + 3 mm, 0 mm + 2 mm) = (3 mm, 2 mm)\n\nOkay, that makes sense now.\n\nNow, I need to find the average normal strain along the diagonal AC.\n\nFirst, find the original length of AC.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nA: (400 mm, 0 mm)\n\nC: (0 mm, 300 mm)\n\nOriginal length of AC:\n\nl_ac_original = sqrt((400 - 0)^2 + (0 - 300)^2) = sqrt(160000 + 90000) = sqrt(250000) = 500 mm\n\nNow, find the displaced positions:\n\nA': (402 mm, 0 mm)\n\nC': (2 mm, 302 mm)\n\nDisplaced length of AC:\n\nl_ac_displaced = sqrt((402 - 2)^2 + (0 - 302)^2) = sqrt(400^2 + (-302)^2) = sqrt(160000 + 91204) = sqrt(251204) = 501.2 mm\n\nNow, the change in length is:\n\n\u0394l_ac = l_ac_displaced - l_ac_original = 501.2 mm - 500 mm = 1.2 mm\n\nThe average normal strain along AC is:\n\n\u03b5_ac = \u0394l_ac / l_ac_original = 1.2 mm / 500 mm = 0.0024 mm/mm\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and I suspect there's more to it because the answer options are in the form of x * 10^(-3) mm/mm.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I need to consider the deformation of the entire plate and calculate the strain more accurately, considering the deformation tensor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the concept of engineering strain, which is \u0394l / l, but I already did that and got 0.0024, which is 2.4 * 10^(-3) mm/mm, but that's not matching any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the deformation along the diagonal considering the displacements at points A and C only, but I think that's too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the displacement vector along the diagonal and find the strain based on that.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nFirst, find the displacement vectors for points A and C.\n\nDisplacement of A:\n\nu_A = (2 mm, 0 mm)\n\nDisplacement of C:\n\nu_C = (2 mm, 2 mm)\n\nNow, the original diagonal AC is from A to C, which is along the diagonal of the rectangle.\n\nThe displacement along the diagonal can be found by interpolating between u_A and u_C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for average strain along a direction.\n\nIn continuum mechanics, the normal strain in a direction can be found using the displacement gradients.\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated for the level of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\n\u03b5_n = (\u03b4l) / l\n\nWhere \u03b4l is the change in length along the direction of interest, and l is the original length along that direction.\n\nI already calculated \u03b4l_ac as 1.2 mm and l_ac as 500 mm, giving \u03b5_ac = 0.0024 mm/mm.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the average strain along the diagonal considering the displacements at points A and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in calculating the displaced length of AC.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nOriginal coordinates:\n\nA: (400, 0)\n\nC: (0, 300)\n\nDisplaced coordinates:\n\nA': (402, 0)\n\nC': (2, 302)\n\nDifference in x: 402 - 2 = 400 mm\n\nDifference in y: 0 - 302 = -302 mm\n\nLength: sqrt(400^2 + (-302)^2) = sqrt(160000 + 91204) = sqrt(251204) = 501.2 mm\n\nOriginal length: sqrt(400^2 + 300^2) = sqrt(160000 + 90000) = sqrt(250000) = 500 mm\n\nStrain: (501.2 - 500) / 500 = 1.2 / 500 = 0.0024 mm/mm\n\nStill getting the same result.\n\nMaybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the deformation of the entire plate and calculate the strain tensor, then find the strain along the diagonal.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the displacement field.\n\nFrom the displacements at points A, B, C, D:\n\nA: (400,0) -> (402,0)\n\nB: (400,300) -> (405,304)\n\nC: (0,300) -> (2,302)\n\nD: (0,0) -> (3,2)\n\nAssuming the displacement field is linear, I can find the displacement components u(x,y) and v(x,y).\n\nLet me assume u(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c\n\nv(x,y) = d*x + e*y + f\n\nNow, plug in the known displacements.\n\nAt A (400,0):\n\nu = 2 mm, v = 0 mm\n\nSo, 2 = a*400 + b*0 + c => 400a + c = 2\n\n0 = d*400 + e*0 + f => 400d + f = 0\n\nAt B (400,300):\n\nu = 5 mm, v = 4 mm\n\nSo, 5 = a*400 + b*300 + c\n\n4 = d*400 + e*300 + f\n\nAt C (0,300):\n\nu = 2 mm, v = 2 mm\n\nSo, 2 = a*0 + b*300 + c => c + 300b = 2\n\n2 = d*0 + e*300 + f => f + 300e = 2\n\nAt D (0,0):\n\nu = 3 mm, v = 2 mm\n\nSo, 3 = a*0 + b*0 + c => c = 3\n\n2 = d*0 + e*0 + f => f = 2\n\nWait, there's inconsistency here.\n\nFrom point A: 400a + c = 2\n\nFrom point C: c + 300b = 2\n\nFrom point D: c = 3\n\nSo, c = 3\n\nThen from point A: 400a + 3 = 2 => 400a = -1 => a = -0.0025 mm^-1\n\nFrom point C: 3 + 300b = 2 => 300b = -1 => b = -0.00333 mm^-1\n\nSimilarly, from point D: f = 2\n\nFrom point A: 400d + f = 0 => 400d + 2 = 0 => 400d = -2 => d = -0.005 mm^-1\n\nFrom point B: 400d + 300e + f = 4 => 400*(-0.005) + 300e + 2 = 4 => -2 + 300e + 2 = 4 => 300e = 4 => e = 4/300 = 0.01333 mm^-1\n\nNow, the displacement field is:\n\nu(x,y) = -0.0025x - 0.00333y + 3\n\nv(x,y) = -0.005x + 0.01333y + 2\n\nNow, to find the strain components, I need to compute the strain tensor.\n\nThe strain tensor components are:\n\n\u03b5_x = \u2202u/\u2202x = -0.0025 mm/mm\n\n\u03b5_y = \u2202v/\u2202y = 0.01333 mm/mm\n\n\u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y + \u2202v/\u2202x = -0.00333 + (-0.005) = -0.00833 mm/mm\n\nNow, to find the normal strain along the diagonal AC, which is at 45 degrees to the x and y axes.\n\nThe original diagonal AC is along the line from (400,0) to (0,300), which is at an angle \u03b8 = arctan(300/400) = arctan(0.75) \u2248 36.87 degrees.\n\nBut since it's a rectangle, the diagonal makes equal angles with both axes, so it's at 45 degrees.\n\nWait, actually, for a rectangle, the diagonals make angles based on the aspect ratio.\n\nIn this case, the sides are 400 mm and 300 mm, so the angle \u03b8 = arctan(opposite/adjacent) = arctan(300/400) = arctan(0.75) \u2248 36.87 degrees.\n\nSo, the diagonal is at approximately 36.87 degrees from the x-axis.\n\nNow, the normal strain along this direction can be found using the transformation equations for strain.\n\nThe normal strain in the direction making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis is:\n\n\u03b5_\u03b8 = (\u03b5_x + \u03b5_y)/2 + (\u03b5_x - \u03b5_y)/2 * cos(2\u03b8) + \u03b3_xy / 2 * sin(2\u03b8)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03b5_x = -0.0025 mm/mm\n\n\u03b5_y = 0.01333 mm/mm\n\n\u03b3_xy = -0.00833 mm/mm\n\n\u03b8 = 36.87 degrees\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b5_x + \u03b5_y = -0.0025 + 0.01333 = 0.01083 mm/mm\n\n\u03b5_x - \u03b5_y = -0.0025 - 0.01333 = -0.01583 mm/mm\n\nsin(2\u03b8) = sin(73.74 degrees) \u2248 0.992\n\ncos(2\u03b8) = cos(73.74 degrees) \u2248 0.121\n\nNow, plug these into the equation:\n\n\u03b5_\u03b8 = (0.01083)/2 + (-0.01583)/2 * 0.121 + (-0.00833)/2 * 0.992\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(0.01083)/2 = 0.005415 mm/mm\n\n(-0.01583)/2 * 0.121 \u2248 -0.00095 mm/mm\n\n(-0.00833)/2 * 0.992 \u2248 -0.00415 mm/mm\n\nSum: 0.005415 - 0.00095 - 0.00415 = 0.000315 mm/mm\n\nWhich is approximately 0.000315 mm/mm or 3.15 * 10^(-4) mm/mm\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the average strain along the diagonal based on the displacements at points A and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the change in length of the diagonal directly, considering the displacements at A and C.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nOriginal length of AC: sqrt(400^2 + 300^2) = 500 mm\n\nDisplaced positions:\n\nA': (402, 0)\n\nC': (2, 302)\n\nDifference: (402 - 2, 0 - 302) = (400, -302)\n\nLength: sqrt(400^2 + (-302)^2) = sqrt(160000 + 91204) = sqrt(251204) = 501.2 mm\n\nStrain: (501.2 - 500)/500 = 1.2/500 = 0.0024 mm/mm\n\nStill getting 0.0024 mm/mm, which is 2.4 * 10^(-3) mm/mm.\n\nNone of the options match this value.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the strain along the diagonal considering the displacements at both ends and taking the average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the fact that the plate is deforming in such a way that the strains are not uniform, and I need to integrate the strain along the diagonal.\n\nBut that seems too complicated for this level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the strain components in the x and y directions and combine them appropriately for the diagonal direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for strain in a general direction.\n\nThe normal strain in a direction making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis is:\n\n\u03b5_\u03b8 = \u03b5_x cos^2(\u03b8) + \u03b5_y sin^2(\u03b8) + \u03b3_xy sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\nGiven \u03b5_x, \u03b5_y, and \u03b3_xy, which I already have.\n\nUsing \u03b8 = 36.87 degrees:\n\ncos\u03b8 \u2248 0.793\n\nsin\u03b8 \u2248 0.609\n\nThen:\n\n\u03b5_\u03b8 = (-0.0025)(0.793)^2 + (0.01333)(0.609)^2 + (-0.00833)(0.609)(0.793)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(-0.0025)(0.6289) \u2248 -0.00157 mm/mm\n\n(0.01333)(0.371) \u2248 0.00495 mm/mm\n\n(-0.00833)(0.609)(0.793) \u2248 -0.0042 mm/mm\n\nSum: -0.00157 + 0.00495 -
