                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a piece of plastic that's originally rectangular, and it's distorting into this shape shown with dashed lines. The question is asking for the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) at the corner B. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what shear strain is. Shear strain is a measure of how much a material has been deformed in shear. In other words, it's how much the material has been distorted parallel to a given plane. The formula for shear strain is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{L}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta x\\) is the change in length parallel to the x-axis and \\(L\\) is the original length perpendicular to the direction of the change.\n\nLooking at the diagram, we have a rectangle with dimensions 400 mm in the x-direction and 300 mm in the y-direction. The corners are labeled A, B, C, and D. After deformation, the positions of these corners have changed slightly, as indicated by the dashed lines.\n\nSpecifically, at corner B:\n\n- It has moved horizontally by 5 mm.\n\n- It has moved vertically by 4 mm.\n\nAt corner C:\n\n- It has moved horizontally by 2 mm.\n\n- It has moved vertically by 2 mm.\n\nAt corner A:\n\n- It has moved horizontally by 3 mm.\n\n- It has moved vertically by 0 mm.\n\nAt corner D:\n\n- It's at the origin, so no movement.\n\nI need to find the shear strain at corner B, which is essentially how much the material has sheared around that point.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the displacement of the points around corner B. The shear strain is related to the rate of change of the angle between the original and deformed shapes.\n\nMaybe I can think about the displacement gradients. In continuum mechanics, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) is related to the displacements \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in the x and y directions, respectively, by:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\nSo, if I can find the displacements \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) as functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I can compute the partial derivatives and evaluate them at point B.\n\nLet me try to determine the displacement field based on the given information.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- At point A (0, 0), displacement in x is 3 mm, displacement in y is 0 mm.\n\n- At point B (400 mm, 300 mm), displacement in x is 5 mm, displacement in y is 4 mm.\n\n- At point C (0, 300 mm), displacement in x is 2 mm, displacement in y is 2 mm.\n\n- At point D (0, 0), displacement in x is 0 mm, displacement in y is 0 mm.\n\nWait, but point D is at the origin, and it's moving to some position, but in the diagram, it seems like point D has a displacement, but according to the coordinates, it's at (0,0). Maybe I need to look back at the diagram to confirm.\n\nActually, looking back at the user's message, it says:\n\n\"the plastic distorts as shown by the dashed lines.\"\n\nAnd there's a reference to \"image 1\", but since I can't see the image, I need to rely on the description.\n\nIt mentions:\n\n- Corner A moves to a new position with x increased by 3 mm.\n\n- Corner B moves to a new position with x increased by 5 mm and y increased by 4 mm.\n\n- Corner C moves to a new position with x increased by 2 mm and y increased by 2 mm.\n\n- Corner D remains at its original position.\n\nWait, in the user's message, it doesn't explicitly say that, but it shows a diagram with these dimensions. I need to be careful here.\n\nLooking back, the user provided a diagram with labels A, B, C, D, and their positions, as well as the original and deformed positions.\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Original rectangle with corners at (0,0), (400,0), (400,300), and (0,300).\n\n- After deformation:\n\n- A (0,0) moves to (3 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- B (400,0) moves to (400 + 5 mm, 0 + 4 mm) = (405 mm, 4 mm)\n\n- C (0,300) moves to (0 + 2 mm, 300 + 2 mm) = (2 mm, 302 mm)\n\n- D (0,0) remains at (0,0)\n\nWait, but D is at (0,0), and it's moving to (0,0), so no displacement.\n\nSo, displacements are:\n\n- A: (3 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- B: (5 mm, 4 mm)\n\n- C: (2 mm, 2 mm)\n\n- D: (0 mm, 0 mm)\n\nNow, to find the displacement field, I can assume that the displacement is a linear function of x and y, since it's a small deformation problem.\n\nLet me assume that the displacement vector \\( \\mathbf{u} = u(x,y) \\mathbf{i} + v(x,y) \\mathbf{j} \\), where \\( u \\) is the displacement in the x-direction and \\( v \\) is the displacement in the y-direction.\n\nGiven four points, I can set up equations to solve for the coefficients of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\nAssume that the displacement field is of the form:\n\n\\[\nu = a x + b y + c\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = d x + e y + f\n\\]\n\nNow, plug in the known displacement values at points A, B, C, and D.\n\nPoint D (0,0):\n\n\\[\nu = c = 0 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = f = 0 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( f = 0 \\).\n\nPoint A (0,0):\n\n\\[\nu = c = 3 \\, \\text{mm} \\quad \\text{(but from above, } c = 0 \\text{, so inconsistency here)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = f = 0 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\nWait, there's an inconsistency here. According to the earlier assumption, \\( c = 0 \\), but according to the displacement at A, \\( u = 3 \\) mm. So, perhaps my assumption that the displacement field is linear is incorrect, or maybe I misinterpreted the displacements.\n\nLet me double-check the displacements.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- Point D (0,0) remains at (0,0), so displacement is (0,0).\n\n- Point A (0,0) moves to (3 mm, 0 mm), so displacement is (3 mm, 0 mm).\n\n- Point B (400 mm, 0 mm) moves to (405 mm, 4 mm), so displacement is (5 mm, 4 mm).\n\n- Point C (0 mm, 300 mm) moves to (2 mm, 302 mm), so displacement is (2 mm, 2 mm).\n\nWait a minute, point A is at (0,0) and moves to (3 mm, 0 mm), which suggests a displacement of (3 mm, 0 mm). But point D is also at (0,0) and remains there, so displacement is (0 mm, 0 mm). But these are the same points; perhaps point A is not at (0,0)?\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the coordinates.\n\nPerhaps point D is at (0,0), point A is at (400 mm, 0 mm), point B is at (400 mm, 300 mm), and point C is at (0 mm, 300 mm).\n\nGiven that, let's assign coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me set up the coordinate system:\n\n- D: (0, 0)\n\n- A: (400 mm, 0)\n\n- B: (400 mm, 300 mm)\n\n- C: (0 mm, 300 mm)\n\nNow, their displacements:\n\n- D: (0 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- A: (3 mm, 0 mm)\n\n- B: (5 mm, 4 mm)\n\n- C: (2 mm, 2 mm)\n\nNow, assuming a linear displacement field:\n\n\\[\nu = a x + b y\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = c x + d y\n\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known displacements:\n\nFor D (0,0):\n\n\\[\nu = 0 = a(0) + b(0) \\implies 0 = 0\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = 0 = c(0) + d(0) \\implies 0 = 0\n\n\\]\n\nThese are trivial equations.\n\nFor A (400,0):\n\n\\[\nu = 3 \\, \\text{mm} = a(400) + b(0) \\implies 400 a = 3 \\implies a = \\frac{3}{400} \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = 0 \\, \\text{mm} = c(400) + d(0) \\implies 400 c = 0 \\implies c = 0\n\n\\]\n\nFor B (400,300):\n\n\\[\nu = 5 \\, \\text{mm} = a(400) + b(300) \\implies 400 a + 300 b = 5\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = 4 \\, \\text{mm} = c(400) + d(300) \\implies 400 c + 300 d = 4\n\n\\]\n\nBut from earlier, \\( a = \\frac{3}{400} \\) and \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nPlugging \\( a \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n400 \\left( \\frac{3}{400} \\right) + 300 b = 5 \\implies 3 + 300 b = 5 \\implies 300 b = 2 \\implies b = \\frac{2}{300} = \\frac{1}{150} \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\n\\]\n\nPlugging \\( c = 0 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n0 + 300 d = 4 \\implies d = \\frac{4}{300} = \\frac{2}{150} \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\n\\]\n\nNow, for point C (0,300):\n\n\\[\nu = 2 \\, \\text{mm} = a(0) + b(300) = 0 + \\frac{1}{150}(300) = 2 \\, \\text{mm}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = 2 \\, \\text{mm} = c(0) + d(300) = 0 + \\frac{2}{150}(300) = 4 \\, \\text{mm}\n\n\\]\n\nWait, but according to the displacement, point C moves to (2 mm, 302 mm), so its displacement should be (2 mm, 2 mm). But according to the displacement field I just calculated, it's (2 mm, 4 mm). There's a discrepancy in the v-displacement.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption of a linear displacement field is incorrect because it doesn't satisfy all the given displacements simultaneously.\n\nPerhaps the displacement field is quadratic or has higher-order terms. However, for simplicity, maybe I should proceed with this linear displacement field and see if it gives a reasonable answer for shear strain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the shear strain based on the change in angles.\n\nRecall that shear strain is defined as the change in angle between two originally perpendicular lines.\n\nSo, if I consider two originally perpendicular lines at point B, their angle after deformation will have changed by \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\).\n\nIn small deformation theory, \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) can be approximated by the engineering shear strain:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\Delta s}{L}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta s\\) is the change in length of a line element and \\(L\\) is the original length.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of strains, it's:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven that the displacement field is:\n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{3}{400} x + \\frac{1}{150} y\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{2}{150} y\n\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{150} \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\n\\]\n\nSo, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{1}{150} \\, \\text{mm/mm} \\approx 0.006667 \\, \\text{rad}\n\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options. The closest is option B: 1.6*10^(-3) rad, which is 0.0016 rad, quite different from 0.006667 rad.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption of a linear displacement field is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider a more general displacement field, possibly including quadratic terms.\n\nLet me assume that the displacement field is quadratic in x and y.\n\nSo, let's assume:\n\n\\[\nu = a x + b y + c x y\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = d x + e y + f x y\n\n\\]\n\nNow, with four points, I might not have enough equations to solve for all the coefficients, since there are more unknowns than equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the displacement field in terms of strain components.\n\nRecall that for plane strain, the displacement components are related to the strain components by:\n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_{xy} y + \\text{other terms}\n\n\\]\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the strain-displacement relations.\n\nIn 2D, the strain components are:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\n\\]\n\nGiven that, and assuming small strains, I can compute the strain components at point B based on the displacement gradients there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the change in angles to determine the shear strain.\n\nLet me consider two originally perpendicular lines at point B and see how their angle changes after deformation.\n\nInitially, at point B (400 mm, 300 mm), the lines are along the x and y axes.\n\nAfter deformation, these lines will be deformed based on the displacements at point B.\n\nThe displacement at point B is (5 mm, 4 mm).\n\nSo, the original line along the x-axis at point B will be deformed by the displacement gradient.\n\nSimilarly, the original line along the y-axis at point B will be deformed.\n\nThe change in angle between these two lines will give me the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for shear strain in terms of the displacement gradients.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can estimate the displacement gradients around point B.\n\nLet me consider a small square around point B and see how it deforms.\n\nFrom the displacements at points A, B, and C, I can estimate the displacement gradients.\n\nGiven that point A is at (400,0) with displacement (3 mm, 0 mm),\n\nPoint B is at (400,300) with displacement (5 mm, 4 mm),\n\nPoint C is at (0,300) with displacement (2 mm, 2 mm),\n\nAnd point D is at (0,0) with displacement (0 mm, 0 mm).\n\nI can estimate the displacement gradients at point B by taking differences.\n\nFor example, the change in u with respect to y at point B can be approximated by the difference in u between point B and point C, divided by the change in y.\n\nSimilarly, the change in v with respect to x at point B can be approximated by the difference in v between point B and point A, divided by the change in x.\n\nSo, let's compute these differences.\n\nFirst, the change in u with respect to y at point B:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\approx \\frac{u_B - u_C}{y_B - y_C} = \\frac{5 \\, \\text{mm} - 2 \\, \\text{mm}}{300 \\, \\text{mm}} = \\frac{3 \\, \\text{mm}}{300 \\, \\text{mm}} = 0.01 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nNext, the change in v with respect to x at point B:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{v_B - v_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{mm} - 0 \\, \\text{mm}}{400 \\, \\text{mm}} = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{mm}}{400 \\, \\text{mm}} = 0.01 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) at point B is:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nBut this result is 0.02, which is 2*10^(-2) rad, which doesn't match any of the options directly. The closest option is C: 11.6*10^(-2) rad, which is 0.116 rad, quite different from 0.02 rad.\n\nThis suggests that my method of estimating the displacement gradients"
