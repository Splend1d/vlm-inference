                    "text": "So I have this problem here about determining the shape factor for the cross-section of an H-beam. The image shows an H-beam with specific dimensions: the flanges are 200 mm wide and 20 mm thick, and the web is also 20 mm thick. There's a notation for M_p, which I believe refers to the plastic moment capacity of the beam. But the focus here is on the shape factor. The options provided are 1.17, 1.57, and 0.87.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the shape factor is. I know that the shape factor is a measure of how efficient a cross-section is in resisting bending stress. It's defined as the ratio of the plastic section modulus to the elastic section modulus. So, shape factor = Z_p / Z_e, where Z_p is the plastic section modulus and Z_e is the elastic section modulus.\n\nMy goal is to calculate both Z_p and Z_e for this H-beam cross-section and then find their ratio.\n\nLet's start with the elastic section modulus (Z_e). For symmetric sections like an H-beam, the elastic section modulus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nZ_e = I / c\n\nWhere:\n\n- I is the moment of inertia about the neutral axis,\n\n- c is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber.\n\nFirst, I need to find I and c for this cross-section.\n\nGiven the dimensions:\n\n- Flange width (b) = 200 mm\n\n- Flange thickness (t_f) = 20 mm\n\n- Web thickness (t_w) = 20 mm\n\nAssuming the overall height (h) of the beam is equal to the web height plus twice the flange thickness, but since the exact height isn't provided, I might need to make an assumption here. Wait, looking back at the image, it seems like the web height is 200 mm, and the flanges are 20 mm thick, so the overall height h = 200 mm + 2*(20 mm) = 240 mm. But actually, no, the flanges are 200 mm wide and 20 mm thick, and the web is 20 mm thick and 200 mm high. So the overall height is 200 mm, and the flanges are attached to the top and bottom of the web.\n\nSo, h = 200 mm, and the flanges are at the top and bottom, each 200 mm wide and 20 mm thick.\n\nNow, to find the moment of inertia (I) about the neutral axis, which is horizontal for this cross-section.\n\nThe moment of inertia of the entire cross-section can be found by summing the moments of inertia of its parts.\n\nFirst, find the moment of inertia of one flange and the web.\n\nThe moment of inertia of one flange about its own centroid is:\n\nI_flange = (1/12) * b * t_f^3 = (1/12) * 200 mm * (20 mm)^3 = (1/12) * 200 * 8000 = (1/12)*1,600,000 mm^4 = 133,333.333 mm^4\n\nBut since the flange is offset from the neutral axis of the entire beam, I need to apply the parallel axis theorem.\n\nThe distance from the centroid of the flange to the neutral axis of the entire cross-section is:\n\nLet's find the centroid (y-bar) of the entire cross-section first.\n\nThe cross-section consists of two flanges and one web.\n\nArea of one flange: A_flange = 200 mm * 20 mm = 4,000 mm\u00b2\n\nArea of the web: A_web = 200 mm (height) * 20 mm (thickness) = 4,000 mm\u00b2\n\nTotal area: A_total = 2*A_flange + A_web = 2*4,000 + 4,000 = 12,000 mm\u00b2\n\nNow, to find the centroid:\n\nSum of (area * y_i):\n\nFor each flange:\n\ny1 = (h - t_f)/2 = (200 mm - 20 mm)/2 = 90 mm\n\ny2 = - (h - t_f)/2 = -90 mm\n\nSo, sum (A*y) = 2*(4,000 mm\u00b2 * 90 mm) + 4,000 mm\u00b2 * 0 = 2*360,000 + 0 = 720,000 mm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, y-bar = sum (A*y) / A_total = 720,000 mm\u00b3 / 12,000 mm\u00b2 = 60 mm\n\nSo, the neutral axis is located 60 mm from the bottom of the cross-section.\n\nNow, the distance from the centroid of the top flange to the neutral axis is:\n\nd_top = 90 mm - 60 mm = 30 mm\n\nSimilarly, the distance from the centroid of the bottom flange to the neutral axis is:\n\nd_bottom = 60 mm - (-90 mm) = 150 mm\n\nNow, the moment of inertia of the top flange about the neutral axis is:\n\nI_top = I_flange + A_flange * (d_top)^2 = 133,333.333 mm\u2074 + 4,000 mm\u00b2 * (30 mm)^2 = 133,333.333 + 4,000 * 900 = 133,333.333 + 3,600,000 = 3,733,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nSimilarly, for the bottom flange:\n\nI_bottom = I_flange + A_flange * (d_bottom)^2 = 133,333.333 mm\u2074 + 4,000 mm\u00b2 * (150 mm)^2 = 133,333.333 + 4,000 * 22,500 = 133,333.333 + 90,000,000 = 90,133,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nFor the web:\n\nThe moment of inertia of the web about its own centroid is:\n\nI_web = (1/12) * b * h^3 = (1/12) * 20 mm * (200 mm)^3 = (1/12) * 20 * 8,000,000 = (20/12)*8,000,000 = (5/3)*8,000,000 = 13,333,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nNow, the distance from the centroid of the web to the neutral axis is:\n\nd_web = 0 mm (since it's at the neutral axis)\n\nTherefore, the moment of inertia of the web about the neutral axis is:\n\nI_web = 13,333,333.333 mm\u2074 + 4,000 mm\u00b2 * 0^2 = 13,333,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nNow, the total moment of inertia of the entire cross-section about the neutral axis is:\n\nI_total = I_top + I_bottom + I_web = 3,733,333.333 + 90,133,333.333 + 13,333,333.333 = 107,200,000 mm\u2074\n\nNow, the elastic section modulus (Z_e) is I / c, where c is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber.\n\nThe extreme fiber is at the bottom of the bottom flange or the top of the top flange, which is 150 mm from the neutral axis.\n\nWait, let's double-check that.\n\nThe neutral axis is at 60 mm from the bottom. So, to the top of the top flange, it's 60 mm + 20 mm / 2 = 60 + 10 = 70 mm.\n\nTo the bottom of the bottom flange, it's 60 mm - 20 mm / 2 = 60 - 10 = 50 mm.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If the bottom flange is 20 mm thick and the neutral axis is at 60 mm from the bottom, then the bottom surface of the bottom flange is at 60 mm + 10 mm = 70 mm from the top, but wait, no.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe bottom flange is 20 mm thick, and the neutral axis is at 60 mm from the bottom of the cross-section.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the neutral axis to the bottom surface of the bottom flange is 60 mm - 10 mm = 50 mm.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from the neutral axis to the top surface of the top flange is 60 mm + 10 mm = 70 mm.\n\nSo, the extreme fibers are at 50 mm and 70 mm from the neutral axis.\n\nBut for calculating c in Z_e = I / c, we should use the distance to the farthest fiber, which is 70 mm.\n\nWait, but in bending, the extreme fiber is usually considered to be at the outermost point where the stress is maximum.\n\nIn this case, the bottom fiber is at 50 mm from the neutral axis, and the top fiber is at 70 mm from the neutral axis.\n\nBut actually, the bottom fiber is closer to the neutral axis, so the maximum distance is to the top fiber, which is 70 mm.\n\nTherefore, c = 70 mm.\n\nNow, Z_e = I / c = 107,200,000 mm\u2074 / 70 mm = 1,531,428.571 mm\u00b3\n\nNext, I need to find the plastic section modulus (Z_p).\n\nThe plastic section modulus for an H-section can be calculated using the formula:\n\nZ_p = A * y_bar\n\nWhere:\n\n- A is the total area of the cross-section,\n\n- y_bar is the distance from the neutral axis to the centroid of the area on one side of the neutral axis.\n\nBut actually, more accurately, Z_p is equal to the total area multiplied by the distance from the neutral axis to the centroid of the area on one side of the neutral axis.\n\nFirst, find the centroid of the area on one side of the neutral axis.\n\nLet's consider the area above the neutral axis.\n\nThis includes the top flange and the top part of the web.\n\nThe top flange has an area of 4,000 mm\u00b2, and the top part of the web is from y = 0 to y = 60 mm.\n\nWait, no. The web is from y = -60 mm to y = 60 mm, with thickness 20 mm, but that doesn't make sense because the web is 200 mm high and 20 mm thick.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me consider the cross-section again.\n\nThe bottom flange is at y = -90 mm to y = -70 mm.\n\nThe web is from y = -90 mm to y = 90 mm, with thickness 20 mm.\n\nThe top flange is from y = 90 mm to y = 110 mm.\n\nBut the neutral axis is at y = 60 mm.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated y-bar = 60 mm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating y-bar.\n\nLet me recalculate y-bar.\n\nTotal area A_total = 2*A_flange + A_web = 2*(200*20) + (200*20) = 2*4,000 + 4,000 = 12,000 mm\u00b2\n\nSum of (A*y):\n\nFor top flange: A_top = 4,000 mm\u00b2, y_top = 90 mm\n\nFor bottom flange: A_bottom = 4,000 mm\u00b2, y_bottom = -90 mm\n\nFor web: A_web = 4,000 mm\u00b2, y_web = 0 mm\n\nSum (A*y) = 4,000*90 + 4,000*(-90) + 4,000*0 = 360,000 - 360,000 + 0 = 0 mm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, y-bar = 0 / 12,000 = 0 mm\n\nWait, that can't be right. The neutral axis should be at y = 0 mm, which is the center of the cross-section.\n\nBut earlier, I thought y-bar was 60 mm, which seems incorrect based on this calculation.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining y1 and y2.\n\nLet me redefine the coordinate system.\n\nLet\u2019s set the origin at the bottom of the cross-section.\n\nThen, the bottom flange is from y = 0 to y = 20 mm (since it's 20 mm thick).\n\nThe web is from y = 20 mm to y = 220 mm (since the web is 200 mm high, added to the 20 mm flange).\n\nThe top flange is from y = 220 mm to y = 240 mm.\n\nNow, the total height is 240 mm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the centroid (y-bar) correctly.\n\nArea of bottom flange: A_bottom = 200 mm * 20 mm = 4,000 mm\u00b2, y_bottom = 10 mm (centroid of flange)\n\nArea of web: A_web = 200 mm * 200 mm = 40,000 mm\u00b2, y_web = 20 mm + 100 mm = 120 mm\n\nArea of top flange: A_top = 200 mm * 20 mm = 4,000 mm\u00b2, y_top = 220 mm + 10 mm = 230 mm\n\nTotal area A_total = 4,000 + 40,000 + 4,000 = 48,000 mm\u00b2\n\nSum of (A*y):\n\n4,000*10 + 40,000*120 + 4,000*230 = 40,000 + 4,800,000 + 920,000 = 5,760,000 mm\u00b3\n\nTherefore, y-bar = sum (A*y) / A_total = 5,760,000 mm\u00b3 / 48,000 mm\u00b2 = 120 mm\n\nSo, the neutral axis is at y = 120 mm from the bottom.\n\nNow, this seems more accurate.\n\nTherefore, c is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber, which is to the top of the top flange at y = 230 mm - 120 mm = 110 mm, or to the bottom of the bottom flange at y = 120 mm - 20 mm = 100 mm.\n\nSo, the maximum c is 110 mm.\n\nTherefore, Z_e = I / c = I / 110 mm\n\nNow, I need to recalculate I_total based on this new y-bar.\n\nFirst, find the moment of inertia of each part about its own centroid and then apply the parallel axis theorem.\n\nBottom flange:\n\nI_bottom = (1/12)*b*t_f^3 = (1/12)*200*(20)^3 = (1/12)*200*8,000 = 133,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nDistance from bottom flange centroid to neutral axis: d_bottom = 120 mm - 10 mm = 110 mm\n\nTherefore, I_bottom_total = 133,333.333 + 4,000*(110)^2 = 133,333.333 + 4,000*12,100 = 133,333.333 + 48,400,000 = 48,533,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nWeb:\n\nI_web = (1/12)*b*h^3 = (1/12)*20*200^3 = (1/12)*20*8,000,000 = (20/12)*8,000,000 = 13,333,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nDistance from web centroid to neutral axis: d_web = 120 mm - 100 mm = 20 mm\n\nTherefore, I_web_total = 13,333,333.333 + 40,000*(20)^2 = 13,333,333.333 + 40,000*400 = 13,333,333.333 + 16,000,000 = 29,333,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nTop flange:\n\nI_top = (1/12)*b*t_f^3 = 133,333.333 mm\u2074\n\nDistance from top flange centroid to neutral axis: d_top = 230 mm - 120 mm = 110 mm\n\nTherefore, I_top_total = 133,333.333 + 4,000*(110)^2 = 133,333.333 + 4,000*12,100 = 133,333.333 + 48,400,000 = 48,533,33"
