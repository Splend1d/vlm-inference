                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a concrete column with some loads applied, and I need to find the magnitude of P1. Let me try to understand the setup first.\n\nThere's a concrete column that's 20 feet tall, divided into two sections: from A to B and from B to C, each 10 feet long. There are loads P1 and P2 applied at the ends of horizontal beams attached to the column at points A and B. The column has different cross-sections at different points: at section a-a, it's 6 inches by 6 inches, and at section b-b, it's 10 inches by 10 inches. The column is fixed at the base, point C.\n\nThe problem also mentions vertical displacements: end A moves 0.08 inches relative to B, and B moves 0.1 inches relative to C. I need to use these to find P1.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider the deformation of the column due to the loads P1 and P2. Since it's a concrete column, it will deform under load, and the displacements will depend on the stiffness of the column, which is related to its modulus of elasticity and its cross-sectional area.\n\nI need to recall the formula for the deflection of a column under axial load. The axial stiffness of a column is given by EA, where E is the modulus of elasticity and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nFor concrete, the modulus of elasticity is typically around 29,000 ksi (29,000,000 psi), but I should check if a specific value is provided for high-strength concrete. Maybe I'll need to look that up.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"high-strength precast concrete column,\" but doesn't specify the exact E value. Let me see if I can find a typical value for high-strength concrete. I recall that high-strength concrete can have an E value around 4,000,000 to 6,000,000 psi. I'll assume E = 5,000,000 psi for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to find the axial stiffness for each section.\n\nFrom A to B, the cross-section is 6 in x 6 in, so area A1 = 6 * 6 = 36 in\u00b2.\n\nFrom B to C, the cross-section is 10 in x 10 in, so area A2 = 10 * 10 = 100 in\u00b2.\n\nThe stiffness for A-B is EA1 = 5,000,000 * 36 = 180,000,000 lb-in or 180,000 kip-in.\n\nWait, units should be consistent. Since length is in feet, I should convert areas to feet as well.\n\n1 foot = 12 inches, so 1 in\u00b2 = (1/12)\u00b2 ft\u00b2 \u2248 0.006944 ft\u00b2.\n\nSo, A1 = 36 in\u00b2 \u2248 36 * 0.006944 \u2248 0.25 ft\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, A2 = 100 in\u00b2 \u2248 100 * 0.006944 \u2248 0.6944 ft\u00b2.\n\nE = 5,000,000 psi = 5,000,000 lb/in\u00b2.\n\nBut for consistency, I should use E in terms of lb/ft\u00b2.\n\nSince 1 ft\u00b2 = 144 in\u00b2, then E = 5,000,000 lb/in\u00b2 = 5,000,000 * 144 lb/ft\u00b2 = 720,000,000 lb/ft\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep everything in inches and then convert to kips and feet at the end.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, stiffness for A-B: EA1 = 5,000,000 psi * 36 in\u00b2 = 180,000,000 lb-in or 180,000 kip-in.\n\nSimilarly, for B-C: EA2 = 5,000,000 * 100 = 500,000,000 lb-in or 500,000 kip-in.\n\nNow, the column is subjected to loads P1 and P2 at points A and B, respectively.\n\nThe displacements are given as:\n\n\u0394A/B = 0.08 inches (displacement of A relative to B)\n\n\u0394B/C = 0.1 inches (displacement of B relative to C)\n\nI need to relate these displacements to the loads P1 and P2.\n\nLet me consider the column as two separate segments: A-B and B-C.\n\nFor segment A-B:\n\nThe load at A is P1, and at B is P2.\n\nThe displacement of A relative to B is \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches.\n\nThe stiffness of A-B is EA1 = 180,000 kip-in.\n\nThe displacement due to P1 and P2 can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394A/B = (P1 * L1)/EA1 - (P2 * L1)/EA1\n\nWhere L1 is the length from A to B, which is 10 feet = 120 inches.\n\nSo, \u0394A/B = (P1 * 120)/180,000 - (P2 * 120)/180,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u0394A/B = (P1 - P2) * (120)/180,000 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00066667 inches/kip\n\nGiven that \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches, so:\n\n0.08 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00066667\n\nSolve for (P1 - P2):\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.08 / 0.00066667 \u2248 120 kips\n\nSo, P1 - P2 = 120 kips ...(1)\n\nNow, consider segment B-C:\n\nLoad at B is P2, and at C is 0 (since it's fixed).\n\nDisplacement of B relative to C is \u0394B/C = 0.1 inches.\n\nStiffness of B-C is EA2 = 500,000 kip-in.\n\nLength L2 = 10 feet = 120 inches.\n\nDisplacement at B:\n\n\u0394B/C = (P2 * L2)/EA2 = (P2 * 120)/500,000 = P2 * 0.00024 inches/kip\n\nGiven \u0394B/C = 0.1 inches, so:\n\n0.1 = P2 * 0.00024\n\nSolve for P2:\n\nP2 = 0.1 / 0.00024 = 416.666... kips\n\nSo, P2 \u2248 416.67 kips ...(2)\n\nNow, from equation (1), P1 - P2 = 120 kips\n\nPlug in P2 from equation (2):\n\nP1 - 416.67 = 120\n\nP1 = 120 + 416.67 = 536.67 kips\n\nBut none of the options have 536.67 kips. The closest is option B: 125 kips, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the stiffness or the displacements.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the stiffness calculations:\n\nEA1 = 5,000,000 psi * 36 in\u00b2 = 180,000,000 lb-in = 180,000 kip-in\n\nEA2 = 5,000,000 * 100 = 500,000,000 lb-in = 500,000 kip-in\n\nDisplacement formulas:\n\n\u0394A/B = (P1 * L1)/EA1 - (P2 * L1)/EA1 = (P1 - P2) * L1 / EA1\n\nSimilarly, \u0394B/C = (P2 * L2)/EA2\n\nGiven \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches and \u0394B/C = 0.1 inches\n\nFrom \u0394A/B:\n\n0.08 = (P1 - P2) * 120 / 180,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.08 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00066667\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.08 / 0.00066667 \u2248 120 kips ...(1)\n\nFrom \u0394B/C:\n\n0.1 = P2 * 120 / 500,000\n\n0.1 = P2 * 0.00024\n\nP2 = 0.1 / 0.00024 \u2248 416.67 kips ...(2)\n\nThen, P1 = 120 + 416.67 = 536.67 kips\n\nBut this doesn't match any options. Maybe the modulus of elasticity is different for high-strength concrete.\n\nLet me check the E value. For high-strength concrete, E can be higher, maybe up to 6,000,000 psi.\n\nLet me try E = 6,000,000 psi.\n\nThen, EA1 = 6,000,000 * 36 = 216,000,000 lb-in = 216,000 kip-in\n\nEA2 = 6,000,000 * 100 = 600,000,000 lb-in = 600,000 kip-in\n\nRecalculate displacements:\n\n\u0394A/B = (P1 - P2) * 120 / 216,000 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00055556\n\n0.08 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00055556\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.08 / 0.00055556 \u2248 144 kips ...(1)\n\n\u0394B/C = P2 * 120 / 600,000 = P2 * 0.0002\n\n0.1 = P2 * 0.0002\n\nP2 = 0.1 / 0.0002 = 500 kips ...(2)\n\nThen, P1 = 144 + 500 = 644 kips\n\nStill doesn't match any options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the units more carefully.\n\nLet me try keeping everything in feet instead of inches.\n\nFirst, convert areas to ft\u00b2:\n\nA1 = 36 in\u00b2 = 36 * (1/12)^2 = 0.25 ft\u00b2\n\nA2 = 100 in\u00b2 = 100 * (1/12)^2 \u2248 0.6944 ft\u00b2\n\nE = 5,000,000 psi = 5,000,000 lb/in\u00b2 = 5,000,000 * 144 = 720,000,000 lb/ft\u00b2\n\nThen, EA1 = 720,000,000 * 0.25 = 180,000,000 lb-ft = 180,000 kip-ft\n\nEA2 = 720,000,000 * 0.6944 \u2248 500,000,000 lb-ft = 500,000 kip-ft\n\nNow, displacements:\n\n\u0394A/B = (P1 * 10)/180,000 - (P2 * 10)/180,000 = (P1 - P2) * 10 / 180,000 = (P1 - P2) * 0.000055556 ft/kip\n\nGiven \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches = 0.08 / 12 = 0.0066667 ft\n\nSo:\n\n0.0066667 = (P1 - P2) * 0.000055556\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.0066667 / 0.000055556 \u2248 120 kips ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, \u0394B/C = (P2 * 10)/500,000 = P2 * 0.00002 ft/kip\n\nGiven \u0394B/C = 0.1 inches = 0.1 / 12 \u2248 0.0083333 ft\n\nSo:\n\n0.0083333 = P2 * 0.00002\n\nP2 = 0.0083333 / 0.00002 = 416.666... kips ...(2)\n\nThen, P1 = 120 + 416.666... = 536.666... kips\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the fact that the column is continuous and the displacements are relative.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the deformations using the principle of superposition or using compatibility equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the concept of stiffness matrix for the column segments.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire column as a single element with varying cross-section.\n\nThe total displacement from A to C would be the sum of the displacements from A to B and B to C.\n\nBut I only have relative displacements between A and B, and B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up equilibrium equations considering the forces and displacements.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nConsider point A:\n\nSum of forces in the vertical direction: P1 - P2 = \u0394A/B * EA1 / L1\n\nSimilarly, at point B:\n\nP2 = \u0394B/C * EA2 / L2\n\nGiven \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches and \u0394B/C = 0.1 inches\n\nFrom point B:\n\nP2 = 0.1 * 500,000 / 10 = 0.1 * 50,000 = 5,000 kips\n\nWait, that can't be right. 5,000 kips is way too high.\n\nWait, \u0394B/C is in inches, but L2 is in feet.\n\nWait, I need to be consistent with units.\n\n\u0394B/C = 0.1 inches = 0.1 / 12 = 0.0083333 feet\n\nEA2 = 500,000 kip-ft\n\nL2 = 10 ft\n\nSo, P2 = 0.0083333 * 500,000 / 10 = 0.0083333 * 50,000 = 416.666... kips\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen, from point A:\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.08 * 180,000 / 10 = 0.08 * 18,000 = 1,440 kips\n\nWait, \u0394A/B = 0.08 inches = 0.08 / 12 = 0.0066667 feet\n\nEA1 = 180,000 kip-ft\n\nL1 = 10 ft\n\nSo, P1 - P2 = 0.0066667 * 180,000 / 10 = 0.0066667 * 18,000 = 120 kips\n\nThen, P1 = 120 + P2 = 120 + 416.666... = 536.666... kips\n\nStill the same result.\n\nMaybe the problem is with the E value I'm using. Perhaps the modulus of elasticity for high-strength concrete is different.\n\nLet me look up the E value for high-strength concrete.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that high-strength concrete can have E values ranging from 4,000,000 to 7,000,000 psi.\n\nLet me try E = 4,000,000 psi.\n\nThen, EA1 = 4,000,000 * 36 = 144,000,000 lb-in = 144,000 kip-in\n\nEA2 = 4,000,000 * 100 = 400,000,000 lb-in = 400,000 kip-in\n\nNow, \u0394A/B = (P1 - P2) * 120 / 144,000 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00083333\n\n0.08 = (P1 - P2) * 0.00083333\n\nP1 - P2 = 0.08 / 0.00083333 \u2248 96 kips ...(1)\n\n\u0394B/C = P2 * 120 / 400,000 = P2 * 0.0003\n\n0.1 = P2 * 0.0003\n\nP2 = 0.1 / 0.0003 = 333.333"
