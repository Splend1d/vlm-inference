                    "text": "So I have this problem here about a piece of rubber that's originally rectangular, and it's subjected to some deformation shown by dashed lines. I need to determine the average normal strain along the side AD. The options are given, but I want to understand how to calculate it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what average normal strain is. Strain is a measure of deformation representing the relative displacement between particles in the material. Normal strain specifically measures elongation or contraction in a particular direction. The formula for average normal strain is:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta L}{L}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\delta L\\) is the change in length and \\(L\\) is the original length.\n\nIn this problem, the original rectangle has dimensions of 300 mm in the x-direction and 400 mm in the y-direction. The points are labeled A, B, C, and D, with D being one of the top corners.\n\nLooking at the diagram, point D has moved upwards by 3 mm, and point B has moved to the right by 2 mm. The side AD is the left vertical side of the rectangle, originally 400 mm long.\n\nThe deformation is shown by dashed lines, indicating that the rectangle has been deformed into a parallelogram or some other shape.\n\nTo find the average normal strain along AD, I need to find the change in length of AD after deformation and divide it by the original length.\n\nFirst, let's identify the original and deformed positions of points A and D.\n\n- Point A is at the bottom left corner, and it seems to be fixed or not moving, based on the diagram.\n\n- Point D is at the top left corner, and it has moved upwards by 3 mm.\n\nSo, the original length of AD is 400 mm, and after deformation, the position of D has changed.\n\nWait, but in the diagram, point D is shown with a displacement of 3 mm in the y-direction, but point B has a displacement of 2 mm in the x-direction.\n\nI need to figure out how this deformation affects the length of AD.\n\nIs the deformation uniform? It doesn't seem so, because different points have different displacements.\n\nMaybe I should consider the deformation of the entire rectangle.\n\nLet me try to visualize the deformed shape.\n\nOriginal rectangle: A at (0,0), B at (300,0), C at (300,400), D at (0,400).\n\nAfter deformation:\n\n- A remains at (0,0)\n\n- B moves to (300 + 2 mm, 0) = (302 mm, 0)\n\n- C moves to (300, 400 + 3 mm) = (300, 403 mm)\n\n- D moves to (0, 400 + 3 mm) = (0, 403 mm)\n\nWait, according to the diagram, point D has moved up by 3 mm, and point B has moved right by 2 mm.\n\nBut point A is at (0,0), fixed.\n\nPoint C is at (300 mm, 400 mm), and it seems to have moved to (302 mm, 403 mm), based on the dashed lines.\n\nWait, no: point B is at (300 mm, 0), and it has moved to (302 mm, 0).\n\nPoint D is at (0, 400 mm), and it has moved to (0, 403 mm).\n\nPoint C is at (300 mm, 400 mm), and it should move accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the deformation is such that each point moves horizontally and vertically based on its coordinates.\n\nBut this is getting confusing. Maybe I should use the concept of strain tensors to find the normal strain in the AD direction.\n\nIn small deformations, the normal strain in a particular direction can be found using the strain components in the coordinate directions.\n\nGiven that the deformations are small (2 mm and 3 mm compared to 300 mm and 400 mm), I can assume small strain theory applies.\n\nThe normal strain in the AD direction (which is the y-direction) can be approximated by the change in length divided by the original length.\n\nSo, \\(\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\delta y}{y}\\), where \\(\\delta y\\) is the change in length in the y-direction.\n\nBut in this case, only point D has moved up by 3 mm, but point C has also moved up by 3 mm, assuming the deformation is linear.\n\nWait, no: point D is at (0,400), moves to (0,403); point C is at (300,400), and it's not clear how much it moves.\n\nBut perhaps the deformation is such that the movement in the y-direction is uniform along the x-axis.\n\nWait, but point B is at (300,0), and it moves to (302,0), only in the x-direction.\n\nPoint A is at (0,0), no movement.\n\nPoint D is at (0,400), moves to (0,403).\n\nPoint C is at (300,400), and it's not clear from the diagram how much it moves.\n\nWait, perhaps the deformation is a combination of a shear and a vertical translation.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the strain components.\n\nIn small strain, the normal strain in the y-direction can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(u_y\\) is the displacement in the y-direction.\n\nBut I need to find an expression for \\(u_y\\) in terms of y.\n\nFrom the diagram, point D at y=400 mm has moved up by 3 mm.\n\nPoint A at y=0 has no movement.\n\nSo, the displacement in the y-direction \\(u_y\\) varies linearly with y.\n\nThus, \\(u_y = \\frac{3 \\, \\text{mm}}{400 \\, \\text{mm}} \\times y = 0.0075 \\times y\\)\n\nThen, the normal strain in the y-direction is:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nSo, the average normal strain along AD would be 0.0075 mm/mm.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match this value directly.\n\nOption A is 0.00680 mm/mm, and option B is -0.00680 mm/mm.\n\nOption C is -0.0281*10^(-3) mm/mm, which is -0.0000281 mm/mm.\n\nOption D is 0.0281*10^(-3) mm/mm, which is 0.0000281 mm/mm.\n\nMy calculation gives 0.0075 mm/mm, which doesn't match any of these options.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check the displacement of point D.\n\nThe diagram shows point D moving up by 3 mm, from y=400 mm to y=403 mm.\n\nSo, the change in length of AD is from 400 mm to 403 mm.\n\nThus, the normal strain is:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{403 - 400}{400} = \\frac{3}{400} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nStill getting 0.0075 mm/mm, which isn't matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the deformation of the entire body, not just the change in length of AD.\n\nPerhaps there's lateral contraction or something else happening.\n\nLet me think about Poisson's ratio, which relates the normal strains in perpendicular directions.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any information about the material properties, like Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio, so maybe I shouldn't consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deformation isn't just a simple extension in the y-direction.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, point B has moved to the right by 2 mm, while point D has moved up by 3 mm.\n\nSo, the deformation isn't uniform; it's a combination of translations and possibly rotations or shears.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the strain components in both x and y directions and find the strain in the AD direction.\n\nLet me try to find the strain tensor components.\n\nIn small deformations, the strain tensor components are:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}, \\quad \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\) are the displacements in the x and y directions, respectively.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- Point B at (300,0) moves to (302,0), so \\(u_x = 2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) at y=0.\n\n- Point D at (0,400) moves to (0,403), so \\(u_y = 3 \\, \\text{mm}\\) at y=400 mm.\n\nAssuming linear variation:\n\nFor \\(u_x\\):\n\nAt y=0, \\(u_x = 2 \\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\nAt y=400 mm, \\(u_x = 0\\)\n\nSo, \\(u_x = 2 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{400}\\right)\\) mm\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{2}{400} = -0.005 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\\)\n\nFor \\(u_y\\):\n\nAt y=0, \\(u_y = 0\\)\n\nAt y=400 mm, \\(u_y = 3 \\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\nSo, \\(u_y = \\frac{3}{400} \\times y = 0.0075 \\times y\\) mm\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\\)\n\nAlso, \\(\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = 0\\), since \\(u_y\\) doesn't depend on x.\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = 0\\), since \\(u_x\\) depends only on y.\n\nTherefore, the strain components are:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = -0.005 + 0 = -0.005 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the normal strain in the AD direction, which is the y-direction, it should be \\(\\epsilon_{yy}\\), which is 0.0075 mm/mm.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the provided options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the strain in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average normal strain is calculated based on the change in length of AD considering the deformation of the entire rectangle.\n\nLet me try to find the new position of points A and D after deformation and calculate the new distance between them.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- D: (0,400)\n\nAfter deformation:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- D: (0,403)\n\nSo, point D has moved up by 3 mm, but its x-coordinate remains 0.\n\nTherefore, the new distance between A and D is still 403 mm.\n\nThus, the normal strain is:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{403 - 400}{400} = \\frac{3}{400} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nStill getting 0.0075 mm/mm, which isn't matching the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the deformation of point C.\n\nPoint C is at (300,400), and according to the dashed lines, it moves to (302,403).\n\nSo, point C moves up by 3 mm as well.\n\nWait, if both points D and C move up by 3 mm, then the entire top edge moves up by 3 mm.\n\nIn that case, the new position of D is (0,403), and C is (302,403).\n\nBut point B moves to (302,0), and A remains at (0,0).\n\nSo, the deformed shape is a parallelogram with vertices at:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- B: (302,0)\n\n- C: (302,403)\n\n- D: (0,403)\n\nNow, the original rectangle has become a parallelogram, but the vertical sides have increased in length from 400 mm to 403 mm.\n\nTherefore, the normal strain in the y-direction is indeed \\(\\epsilon_y = \\frac{403 - 400}{400} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\\).\n\nBut since this doesn't match any of the provided options, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me consider the average normal strain over the entire side AD.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the strain at different points along AD and take the average.\n\nBut in this case, since the deformation is uniform along AD (both D and C move up by 3 mm), the strain should be the same throughout.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a shear component that affects the strain in the y-direction.\n\nWait, the shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy} = -0.005 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\\), as calculated earlier.\n\nMaybe I need to use the strain transformation equations to find the normal strain in the AD direction, considering both \\(\\epsilon_{yy}\\) and \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\).\n\nIn plane strain, the normal strain in an arbitrary direction can be found using:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta = \\epsilon_{xx} \\cos^2 \\theta + \\epsilon_{yy} \\sin^2 \\theta + \\gamma_{xy} \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\nBut since \\(\\epsilon_{xx} = 0\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta = \\epsilon_{yy} \\sin^2 \\theta + \\gamma_{xy} \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, AD is along the y-direction, so \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{90^\\circ} = \\epsilon_{yy} \\sin^2 90^\\circ + \\gamma_{xy} \\sin 90^\\circ \\cos 90^\\circ = \\epsilon_{yy} (1) + \\gamma_{xy} (1)(0) = \\epsilon_{yy} = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nStill getting the same result.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the provided options have a typo or are incorrectly listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the strain in terms of engineering strain or true strain, but the problem specifies average normal strain, which is typically the engineering strain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strain is being calculated per unit length, and I need to express it in terms of percentage or per thousand.\n\nBut the options are given in mm/mm, so that shouldn't be the issue.\n\nWait, maybe the deformation isn't just a simple translation; perhaps there's a rotation involved.\n\nLet me check the positions again.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- B: (300,0)\n\n- C: (300,400)\n\n- D: (0,400)\n\nDeformed positions:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- B: (302,0)\n\n- C: (302,403)\n\n- D: (0,403)\n\nSo, the deformed shape is a parallelogram with base increased by 2 mm and height increased by 3 mm.\n\nThe distance between A and D is still along the y-axis, from (0,0) to (0,403), which is 403 mm.\n\nOriginal length was 400 mm, so strain is (403 - 400)/400 = 3/400 = 0.0075 mm/mm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the strain in the material coordinates, taking into account the deformation gradient.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things for small deformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the strain is being calculated based on the change in area or some other aspect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the strain in the x-direction as well, since there's a displacement in the x-direction at point B.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the normal strain along AD, which is in the y-direction, and there's no displacement in the x-direction for points along AD, maybe it's not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strain is being calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta L}{L}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\delta L\\) is the change in length and \\(L\\) is the original length.\n\nIn this case, \\(\\delta L = 3 \\, \\text{mm}\\) and \\(L = 400 \\, \\text{mm}\\), so \\(\\epsilon = 3/400 = 0.0075 \\, \\text{mm/mm}\\).\n\nBut since this doesn't match any of the provided options, perhaps there's a different approach I should consider.\n\nLet me try to think about the deformation in terms of strain components.\n\nGiven that point B moves 2 mm in the x-direction and point D moves 3 mm in the y-direction, perhaps I can model this as a combination of a shear strain and a normal strain.\n\nAssuming small deformations, the strain components can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}, \\quad \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\n\\[\nu_x = 2 \\left(1"
