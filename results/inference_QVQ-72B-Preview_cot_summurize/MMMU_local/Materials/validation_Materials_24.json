                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to match a unit cell plane with the given image. The image shows a two-dimensional arrangement of green circles, which I assume represent atoms or spheres in a crystal structure. There are labels for distances between the spheres: one is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and the other is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\). These distances are likely key to figuring out which type of unit cell this represents.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the different types of unit cells and their characteristics. There are three main types mentioned in the options:\n\n1. Simple Cubic (SC)\n\n2. Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)\n\n3. Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)\n\nEach of these has different planes, denoted by Miller indices like \\(\\{100\\},\\{110\\},\\{111\\}\\), etc.\n\nLet me start by understanding the basic properties of each unit cell type.\n\n\\section*{Simple Cubic (SC)}\n\nIn an SC unit cell, there is one atom at each corner. The lattice parameters are all equal, and the angles are 90 degrees. The coordination number is 6, which is lower compared to BCC and FCC.\n\n\\section*{Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)}\n\nIn a BCC unit cell, there are atoms at each corner and one atom at the body center. This arrangement allows for closer packing than SC but not as close as FCC. The coordination number is 8.\n\n\\section*{Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)}\n\nIn an FCC unit cell, there are atoms at each corner and one atom at the center of each face. This provides the closest packing possible, with a coordination number of 12.\n\nNow, I need to look at the distances between atoms in the image. There are two distances provided: \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nLet's consider what these distances represent in each type of unit cell.\n\n\\section*{Analyzing the Distances}\n\nIn an SC unit cell:\n\n- The distance between nearest neighbors along the face diagonal would be \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\), where \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter.\n\n- The distance between next-nearest neighbors along the body diagonal would be \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nIn a BCC unit cell:\n\n- The distance between nearest neighbors is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n- The distance between next-nearest neighbors along the body diagonal is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nIn an FCC unit cell:\n\n- The distance between nearest neighbors is \\(a\\sqrt{2} / 2\\).\n\n- The distance between next-nearest neighbors along the face diagonal is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- The distance between third-nearest neighbors along the body diagonal is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nWait a minute, I need to be careful here. Let's double-check these distances.\n\nFor SC:\n\n- Nearest neighbor distance: along the edge, which is \\(a\\).\n\n- Next nearest neighbor: face diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- Third nearest neighbor: body diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nFor BCC:\n\n- Nearest neighbor distance: \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n- Next nearest neighbor: face diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- Third nearest neighbor: body diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nFor FCC:\n\n- Nearest neighbor distance: \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n- Next nearest neighbor: face diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- Third nearest neighbor: body diagonal, which is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nHmm, I think I might have misremembered some of these distances. Let's correct that.\n\nIn SC:\n\n- Edge length: \\(a\\)\n\n- Face diagonal: \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n- Body diagonal: \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nIn BCC:\n\n- The body-centered atom is at \\(\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\), so the nearest neighbor distance is the distance from \\((0,0,0)\\) to \\(\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\), which is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n- The next nearest neighbors are at the face centers, which are at distance \\(a\\).\n\n- The third nearest neighbors are at the corners of the cube diagonally opposite to the body center, at distance \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. In BCC, the nearest neighbors are actually the body-centered atom and the corner atoms it is closest to.\n\nLet me look up the nearest neighbor distances for BCC.\n\nUpon checking, in BCC, each atom has 8 nearest neighbors, and the nearest neighbor distance is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nIn FCC, each atom has 12 nearest neighbors, and the nearest neighbor distance is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nIn SC, nearest neighbor distance is \\(a\\), next nearest is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\), and so on.\n\nNow, looking back at the image, it shows a two-dimensional arrangement with distances \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nSince it's a 2D representation, it might be projecting a 3D unit cell onto a plane, and the distances are along certain directions in that plane.\n\nI need to identify which plane of the unit cell this represents.\n\nThe options provide different Miller indices for each unit cell type: \\(\\{100\\},\\{110\\},\\{111\\}\\).\n\nMiller indices refer to the reciprocal lattice vectors and represent specific crystallographic planes.\n\nLet's recall what these planes look like in each unit cell type.\n\n\\section*{SC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn SC, the \\(\\{100\\}\\) plane is simply a square lattice with atoms at each corner, and the distance between nearest neighbors is \\(a\\).\n\n\\section*{SC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{110\\}\\) plane in SC would have atoms arranged in a rectangular lattice with distances \\(a\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\\section*{SC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{111\\}\\) plane in SC is a triangular lattice with distances between atoms being \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\\section*{BCC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn BCC, the \\(\\{100\\}\\) plane is similar to SC's \\(\\{100\\}\\), with atoms at each corner and the body center projecting onto the center of the plane.\n\n\\section*{BCC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{110\\}\\) plane in BCC shows a rectangular arrangement with atoms at positions that reflect the body-centered nature.\n\n\\section*{BCC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{111\\}\\) plane in BCC has a hexagonal close-packed structure.\n\n\\section*{FCC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn FCC, the \\(\\{100\\}\\) plane is a square lattice with atoms at each corner and the face center.\n\n\\section*{FCC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{110\\}\\) plane in FCC shows a rectangular arrangement with atoms positioned in a specific pattern.\n\n\\section*{FCC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nThe \\(\\{111\\}\\) plane in FCC is a close-packed triangular lattice.\n\nGiven the image shows distances \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), I need to find which of these planes would have such distances between atoms.\n\nLet's consider the possible options one by one.\n\n\\section*{Option A: SC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn SC \\(\\{100\\}\\), the nearest neighbor distance is \\(a\\), and the next nearest is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\). However, the image shows \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), so this doesn't match.\n\n\\section*{Option B: BCC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn BCC \\(\\{100\\}\\), the nearest neighbor distance is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), and the next nearest is \\(a\\). This doesn't match the distances in the image.\n\n\\section*{Option C: FCC \\(\\{100\\}\\)}\n\nIn FCC \\(\\{100\\}\\), the nearest neighbor distance is \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), and the next nearest is \\(a\\). Again, this doesn't match the image's distances.\n\n\\section*{Option D: SC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nIn SC \\(\\{110\\}\\), the distances are \\(a\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\). But the image shows \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), so this doesn't fit.\n\n\\section*{Option E: BCC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nIn BCC \\(\\{110\\}\\), the arrangement shows atoms with distances that include \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and \\(a\\), which again doesn't match the image's \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n\\section*{Option F: FCC \\(\\{110\\}\\)}\n\nIn FCC \\(\\{110\\}\\), the distances between atoms are \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and \\(a\\), which don't match the image's distances.\n\n\\section*{Option G: SC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nIn SC \\(\\{111\\}\\), the distances are \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) between nearest neighbors, and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\) between next nearest neighbors. This seems to match the image's labels.\n\n\\section*{Option H: BCC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nIn BCC \\(\\{111\\}\\), the arrangement is hexagonal close-packed, with distances that include \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), which don't directly match the image's labels.\n\n\\section*{Option I: FCC \\(\\{111\\}\\)}\n\nIn FCC \\(\\{111\\}\\), the distances are \\(a\\sqrt{2}/2\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), which again don't match the image's labels.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that matches the distances shown in the image is SC \\(\\{111\\}\\), where the distances between atoms are \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nHowever, I should double-check this conclusion to ensure I haven't missed something.\n\nLet me verify the distances in SC \\(\\{111\\}\\):\n\n- In SC, the \\(\\{111\\}\\) plane has atoms arranged in a triangular lattice.\n\n- The nearest neighbor distance in this plane can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Consider the unit cell with corners at \\((0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a)\\), etc.\n\n- The \\(\\{111\\}\\) plane passes through atoms at \\((0,0,0), (a, a, 0), (a, 0, a), (0, a, a)\\), etc.\n\n- The distance between nearest neighbors in this plane is the distance between, say, \\((0,0,0)\\) and \\((a, a, 0)\\), which is \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- The next nearest neighbor would be, for example, from \\((0,0,0)\\) to \\((a, a, a)\\), which is \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThis matches the distances in the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is G: SC \\(\\{111\\}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{G} \\]"
