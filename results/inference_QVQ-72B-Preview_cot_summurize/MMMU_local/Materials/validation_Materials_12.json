                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a polymer block being compressed, and I need to find the shear modulus. Let me see... The block is fixed at the top and bottom, and there's a horizontal force applied to the top plate, causing it to displace 2 mm. The force is 2 kN, and the width of the block is 100 mm. The dimensions are 400 mm in length and 200 mm in height. Okay, so it's a rectangular block.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what shear modulus is. Shear modulus, or G, is a measure of a material's resistance to shear deformation. It's related to the shear stress and shear strain in the material. The formula is G = \u03c4 / \u03b3, where \u03c4 is the shear stress and \u03b3 is the shear strain.\n\nIn this case, since there's a horizontal force applied to the top plate, it's likely causing a shear deformation in the block. So, if I can find the shear stress and the shear strain, I can find the shear modulus.\n\nFirst, let's find the shear stress, \u03c4. Shear stress is defined as the force per unit area. The force is 2 kN, and the area over which it's applied would be the area of the top plate that's in contact with the block. Assuming the force is applied uniformly, the area would be the width times the length, which is 100 mm * 400 mm.\n\nWait, but the block is fixed at the bottom, and the top plate is displacing horizontally by 2 mm. So, the shear deformation is happening throughout the height of the block, which is 200 mm. So, the area over which the force is applied should be the area of the top plate in contact with the block, which is indeed 100 mm * 400 mm.\n\nLet me convert these units to consistent units. 100 mm is 0.1 m, 400 mm is 0.4 m, and 200 mm is 0.2 m.\n\nSo, the area A = 0.1 m * 0.4 m = 0.04 m\u00b2.\n\nThe force F = 2 kN = 2000 N.\n\nTherefore, the shear stress \u03c4 = F / A = 2000 N / 0.04 m\u00b2 = 50,000 N/m\u00b2 = 50 kPa.\n\nWait, but 50 kPa seems very low for a shear modulus. Let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the area over which the shear force is applied differently. Is the force applied to the top plate, which is then transferring the shear to the block?\n\nMaybe I should consider the side area where the shear is being transferred. The side area would be the height times the width, which is 200 mm * 100 mm = 0.2 m * 0.1 m = 0.02 m\u00b2.\n\nIf I use that area, then \u03c4 = F / A = 2000 N / 0.02 m\u00b2 = 100,000 N/m\u00b2 = 100 kPa.\n\nHmm, now I have two different values for \u03c4. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The force is applied to the top plate, which is fixed to the block at its top surface. So, the shear stress should be distributed over the area where the top plate is bonded to the block, which is the top surface area of the block.\n\nGiven that the block is 400 mm in length and 100 mm in width, the top surface area is 400 mm * 100 mm = 0.4 m * 0.1 m = 0.04 m\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the side area, which is not correct because the force is applied horizontally to the top plate, not to the sides.\n\nSo, \u03c4 = F / A = 2000 N / 0.04 m\u00b2 = 50,000 N/m\u00b2 = 50 kPa.\n\nBut this seems too low for a shear modulus. Maybe the units are different, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the shear strain differently. The shear strain \u03b3 is defined as the tangent of the angle of shear, which in small angle approximation can be approximated as the displacement divided by the height.\n\nGiven that the top plate displaces by 2 mm horizontally, and the height of the block is 200 mm, then \u03b3 \u2248 \u0394x / h = 0.002 m / 0.2 m = 0.01.\n\nTherefore, G = \u03c4 / \u03b3 = 50,000 N/m\u00b2 / 0.01 = 5,000,000 N/m\u00b2 = 5 MPa.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, the shear modulus is 5 MPa.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the multiple-choice options:\n\nA. 15 MPa\n\nB. 5 MPa\n\nC. 20 MPa\n\nD. 2 MPa\n\nSo, option B is 5 MPa, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut earlier, I was thinking that 50 kPa seemed too low, but actually, shear moduli can vary widely depending on the material. For example, steel has a shear modulus of around 80 GPa, while some polymers can have much lower shear moduli.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions an acetal polymer, which is a type of plastic, its shear modulus should be in the range of a few MPa to tens of MPa. So, 5 MPa seems plausible.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should consider another approach to confirm this result.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the relationship between shear modulus and shear stiffness.\n\nThe shear stiffness k = G * A / h, where A is the area over which the shear force is applied, and h is the height over which the shear deformation occurs.\n\nIn this case, the shear stiffness k = F / \u0394x.\n\nSo, k = 2000 N / 0.002 m = 1,000,000 N/m.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: 1,000,000 = G * 0.04 m\u00b2 / 0.2 m.\n\nSolving for G: G = 1,000,000 * 0.2 / 0.04 = 5,000,000 N/m\u00b2 = 5 MPa.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 5 MPa.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 5 MPa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 5\\ \\text{MPa}} \\]"
