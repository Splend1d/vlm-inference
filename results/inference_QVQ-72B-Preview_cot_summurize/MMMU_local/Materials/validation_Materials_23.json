                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a concrete pipe being suspended by two cables, AB and AC. The pipe weighs 2 Mg, which I believe is 2 metric tons, and its center of mass is at point G. The angles between the cables are given as 30 degrees for cable AB and 45 degrees for cable AC. I need to find the diameter of cable AB such that the average normal stress in it is the same as in cable AC, which has a diameter of 10 mm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces acting on the pipe. Since it's suspended, the sum of the forces in the vertical direction should be equal to the weight of the pipe. The tensions in cables AB and AC will have vertical components that add up to balance the weight.\n\nLet's denote the tension in cable AB as T_AB and in cable AC as T_AC. The vertical components of these tensions are T_AB * sin(30\u00b0) and T_AC * sin(45\u00b0), respectively. The weight of the pipe is 2 Mg, which is equivalent to 2000 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 19620 N.\n\nSo, the equation for equilibrium in the vertical direction is:\n\nT_AB * sin(30\u00b0) + T_AC * sin(45\u00b0) = 19620 N\n\nSimilarly, in the horizontal direction, the sum of forces should be zero. The horizontal components of the tensions are T_AB * cos(30\u00b0) and T_AC * cos(45\u00b0), and since there are no other horizontal forces, their magnitudes should be equal.\n\nSo, T_AB * cos(30\u00b0) = T_AC * cos(45\u00b0)\n\nNow, I have two equations with two unknowns, T_AB and T_AC. I can solve these equations to find the tensions in the cables.\n\nFirst, from the horizontal equilibrium:\n\nT_AB * cos(30\u00b0) = T_AC * cos(45\u00b0)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT_AB * (\u221a3/2) = T_AC * (\u221a2/2)\n\nSo, T_AB = T_AC * (\u221a2/2) / (\u221a3/2) = T_AC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)\n\nNow, plug this into the vertical equilibrium equation:\n\n(T_AC * \u221a2/\u221a3) * sin(30\u00b0) + T_AC * sin(45\u00b0) = 19620 N\n\nSin(30\u00b0) is 0.5 and sin(45\u00b0) is \u221a2/2, so:\n\n(T_AC * \u221a2/\u221a3 * 0.5) + T_AC * (\u221a2/2) = 19620 N\n\nSimplify:\n\nT_AC * (\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/2) = 19620 N\n\nFind a common denominator for the terms in the parentheses:\n\n\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/2 = (\u221a2/(2\u221a3)) + (\u221a2 * \u221a3)/(2 * \u221a3) ) = (\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a6/(2\u221a3)) = (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3)\n\nSo, T_AC * (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3) ) = 19620 N\n\nNow, solve for T_AC:\n\nT_AC = 19620 N * (2\u221a3)/(\u221a2 + \u221a6)\n\nTo simplify this, I can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (\u221a2 - \u221a6):\n\nT_AC = 19620 N * (2\u221a3)/(\u221a2 + \u221a6) * (\u221a2 - \u221a6)/(\u221a2 - \u221a6)\n\nCalculate the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2\u221a3 * (\u221a2 - \u221a6) = 2\u221a6 - 2\u221a18\n\nDenominator: (\u221a2 + \u221a6)(\u221a2 - \u221a6) = (\u221a2)^2 - (\u221a6)^2 = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nSo, T_AC = (2\u221a6 - 2\u221a18)/(-4) * 19620 N\n\nSimplify \u221a18: \u221a18 = \u221a(9*2) = 3\u221a2\n\nSo, T_AC = (2\u221a6 - 6\u221a2)/(-4) * 19620 N\n\nFactor out 2 in the numerator: 2(\u221a6 - 3\u221a2)/(-4) = -2(\u221a6 - 3\u221a2)/2 = -(\u221a6 - 3\u221a2) = 3\u221a2 - \u221a6\n\nSo, T_AC = (3\u221a2 - \u221a6) * 19620 / 4 N\n\nCalculate this value:\n\nFirst, calculate 3\u221a2 - \u221a6:\n\n\u221a2 \u2248 1.414, \u221a6 \u2248 2.449\n\nSo, 3*1.414 = 4.242, minus 2.449 = 1.793\n\nThen, T_AC = 1.793 * 19620 / 4 \u2248 1.793 * 4905 = let's calculate that.\n\n1.793 * 4905:\n\nFirst, 1.793 * 4900 = 1.793 * 49 = 88.857, then *100 = 8885.7 N\n\nThen, 1.793 * 5 = 8.965 N\n\nTotal T_AC \u2248 8885.7 + 8.965 \u2248 8894.665 N\n\nNow, earlier I had T_AB = T_AC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)\n\nSo, T_AB \u2248 8894.665 * (\u221a2/\u221a3) \u2248 8894.665 * (1.414/1.732) \u2248 8894.665 * 0.8165 \u2248 7242.3 N\n\nNow, the problem mentions that the average normal stress in cable AB should be the same as in cable AC. Stress is force per unit area, so \u03c3 = F / A.\n\nFirst, find the cross-sectional area of cable AC, which has a diameter of 10 mm.\n\nArea AC = \u03c0*(diameter/2)^2 = \u03c0*(10/2)^2 = \u03c0*25 \u2248 78.54 mm\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, let's denote the diameter of cable AB as d AB, and its area as A AB = \u03c0*(d AB/2)^2\n\nNow, the stress in cable AC is \u03c3 AC = T AC / A AC\n\nThe stress in cable AB should be \u03c3 AB = T AB / A AB = \u03c3 AC\n\nSo, T AB / (\u03c0*(d AB/2)^2) = T AC / (\u03c0*(10/2)^2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nT AB / (\u03c0 d AB\u00b2 / 4) = T AC / (\u03c0*25)\n\nCancel \u03c0:\n\nT AB / (d AB\u00b2 / 4) = T AC / 25\n\nSo, T AB * 25 = T AC * (d AB\u00b2 / 4)\n\nSolve for d AB:\n\nd AB\u00b2 = (T AB * 25 * 4) / T AC = (4 * T AB * 25) / T AC = (100 * T AB) / T AC\n\nSo, d AB = sqrt(100 * T AB / T AC)\n\nPlug in the values we calculated earlier:\n\nT AB \u2248 7242.3 N\n\nT AC \u2248 8894.665 N\n\nSo, d AB = sqrt(100 * 7242.3 / 8894.665)\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n100 * 7242.3 = 724230\n\nDivide by 8894.665: 724230 / 8894.665 \u2248 81.41\n\nThen, sqrt(81.41) \u2248 9.02 mm\n\nSo, the diameter of cable AB should be approximately 9.02 mm.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, none of them are exactly 9.02 mm. The closest is option C, 11.1 mm, but that's significantly higher than my calculation.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, the weight of the pipe:\n\n2 Mg = 2 * 1000 kg = 2000 kg\n\nWeight = 2000 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 19620 N. That seems correct.\n\nThe equilibrium equations:\n\nHorizontal:\n\nT_AB * cos(30\u00b0) = T_AC * cos(45\u00b0)\n\nVertical:\n\nT_AB * sin(30\u00b0) + T_AC * sin(45\u00b0) = 19620 N\n\nFrom horizontal:\n\nT_AB = T_AC * (cos(45\u00b0)/cos(30\u00b0)) = T_AC * (\u221a2/2) / (\u221a3/2) = T_AC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)\n\nPlug into vertical:\n\n(T_AC * \u221a2/\u221a3) * sin(30\u00b0) + T_AC * sin(45\u00b0) = 19620 N\n\nSin(30\u00b0) = 0.5, sin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2\n\nSo:\n\n(T_AC * \u221a2/\u221a3 * 0.5) + T_AC * (\u221a2/2) = 19620 N\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nT_AC * (\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/2) = 19620 N\n\nCommon denominator:\n\n(\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/(2)) = (\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a6/(2\u221a3)) = (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3)\n\nSo, T_AC = 19620 N * (2\u221a3)/(\u221a2 + \u221a6)\n\nTo simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a2 - \u221a6):\n\nT_AC = 19620 * 2\u221a3 * (\u221a2 - \u221a6)/(2 - 6) = 19620 * 2\u221a3 * (\u221a2 - \u221a6)/(-4)\n\nSimplify:\n\n19620 * \u221a3 * (\u221a2 - \u221a6)/(-2)\n\nNow, calculate this:\n\nFirst, \u221a3 \u2248 1.732, \u221a2 \u2248 1.414, \u221a6 \u2248 2.449\n\nSo, \u221a2 - \u221a6 \u2248 1.414 - 2.449 = -1.035\n\nThen, T_AC \u2248 19620 * 1.732 * (-1.035)/(-2)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n19620 * 1.732 \u2248 33999.84 N\n\n33999.84 * (-1.035) \u2248 -35142.9 N\n\nDivide by -2: \u2248 17571.45 N\n\nSo, T_AC \u2248 17571.45 N\n\nThen, T_AB = T_AC * (\u221a2/\u221a3) \u2248 17571.45 * (\u221a2/\u221a3) \u2248 17571.45 * (1.414/1.732) \u2248 17571.45 * 0.8165 \u2248 14342.9 N\n\nNow, for the stress equality:\n\n\u03c3_AB = \u03c3_AC\n\nWhich is T_AB / (\u03c0*(d_AB/2)^2) = T_AC / (\u03c0*(10/2)^2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nT_AB / (\u03c0 d_AB\u00b2 / 4) = T_AC / (\u03c0*25)\n\nCancel \u03c0:\n\nT_AB / (d_AB\u00b2 / 4) = T_AC / 25\n\nSo, T_AB * 25 = T_AC * (d_AB\u00b2 / 4)\n\nThus, d_AB\u00b2 = (T_AB * 25 * 4) / T_AC = (100 * T_AB) / T_AC\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nd_AB\u00b2 = (100 * 14342.9) / 17571.45 \u2248 (1434290) / 17571.45 \u2248 81.6\n\nThen, d_AB = sqrt(81.6) \u2248 9.03 mm\n\nStill, this is close to my previous calculation but doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places or check the unit conversions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to ensure that units are consistent. The diameter is in millimeters, and the force is in Newtons. Stress is in N/mm\u00b2, but since we're equating stresses, the units should cancel out.\n\nLooking back at the options, perhaps I need to round differently or consider significant figures.\n\nOption A: 10.9 mm\n\nOption B: 11.1 mm\n\nOption C: 19.9 mm\n\nOption D: 11.9 mm\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 9.03 mm, which is closest to option A: 10.9 mm, but not exactly the same. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the stress relationship.\n\nLet me re-examine the stress equation.\n\nStress \u03c3 = Force / Area\n\nGiven that, for cable AC:\n\n\u03c3_AC = T_AC / (\u03c0*(d_AC/2)^2) = T_AC / (\u03c0*(10/2)^2) = T_AC / (\u03c0*25)\n\nFor cable AB:\n\n\u03c3_AB = T_AB / (\u03c0*(d_AB/2)^2) = T_AB / (\u03c0*(d_AB/2)^2)\n\nSet \u03c3_AB = \u03c3_AC:\n\nT_AB / (\u03c0*(d_AB/2)^2) = T_AC / (\u03c0*25)\n\nSimplify:\n\nT_AB / (\u03c0 d_AB\u00b2 / 4) = T_AC / (\u03c0*25)\n\nCancel \u03c0:\n\nT_AB / (d_AB\u00b2 / 4) = T_AC / 25\n\nSo, T_AB * 25 = T_AC * (d_AB\u00b2 / 4)\n\nThus, d_AB\u00b2 = (T_AB * 25 * 4) / T_AC = (100 * T_AB) / T_AC\n\nPlugging in T_AB \u2248 14342.9 N and T_AC \u2248 17571.45 N:\n\nd_AB\u00b2 = (100 * 14342.9) / 17571.45 \u2248 1434290 / 17571.45 \u2248 81.6\n\nThen, d_AB \u2248 sqrt(81.6) \u2248 9.03 mm\n\nStill getting the same result. Maybe the options are misprinted or perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stress is meant to be the same in terms of cross-sectional area, considering the material properties, but without more information, I'll assume that equating stresses is sufficient.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with the closest option, which is A: 10.9 mm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
