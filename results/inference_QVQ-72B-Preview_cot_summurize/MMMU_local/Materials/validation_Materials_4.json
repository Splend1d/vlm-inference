                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the bending stress at point B of the cross-section at section a-a when P is 3 kilonewtons. The figure shows some dimensions and there's a chain with a force P hanging down. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on with the structure. There's a horizontal part on the left with a chain attached at point E, and the force P is acting downward through the chain. Then there's a curved part in the middle and a vertical part going up to point D. Section a-a is located at the base of the curve, right where it connects to the horizontal part, I think. Point B is on the inner side of the curve, and point C is on the outer side. But the question is specifically about point B.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the figure, section a-a is just to the right of point A, and points B and C are marked on that section. Point B is closer to the inner side of the curve, and point C is on the outer side. The dimensions are given: 50 mm width, 25 mm height for the horizontal part, and then there's a 20 mm by 25 mm vertical part connected with a curve.\n\nFirst, I need to find the bending stress at point B due to the force P. Since it's a bent rod, there might be both bending and direct stresses, but the problem mentions bending stress specifically.\n\nI should start by determining the internal bending moment at section a-a. To do that, I need to consider the forces acting on the structure up to that section.\n\nLet me consider the free-body diagram of the part of the structure to the left of section a-a. There's the horizontal part with the chain attached at E, applying a force P downward. There's also a support at point D, which is fixed, so there might be reactions there.\n\nWait, point D is fixed, as indicated by the support symbol. So, if I take the part from D down to section a-a, I can calculate the bending moment at section a-a due to the force P.\n\nFirst, let's find the reaction at D. Since the structure is in equilibrium, the sum of forces and moments must be zero.\n\nThere's only one force, P, acting downward at point E, which is 600 mm to the left of point A, and point A is 300 mm below point D.\n\nWait, actually, the horizontal distance from D to A is 300 mm, and from A to E is 600 mm, so total horizontal distance from D to E is 300 + 600 = 900 mm.\n\nThe vertical distance from D to E is the sum of the vertical distances from D to A (300 mm) and from A to E (assuming it's horizontal, so zero vertical distance). So, the vertical distance is 300 mm.\n\nTherefore, the position of E relative to D is 900 mm horizontally and 300 mm vertically.\n\nNow, to find the reaction at D, let's consider the moment about D.\n\nSum of moments about D:\n\n\\( \\Sigma M_{D} = 0 \\)\n\nThe force P at E has a moment arm of 900 mm horizontally and 300 mm vertically. But since it's a vertical force, its moment about D is P times the horizontal distance, which is 900 mm.\n\nWait, no. The moment due to P about D is P times the perpendicular distance from D to the line of action of P.\n\nThe position vectors are:\n\nPosition of E relative to D: \\( \\vec{r}_{E/D} = (900 \\mathrm{~mm}) \\hat{i} + (300 \\mathrm{~mm}) \\hat{j} \\)\n\nForce P: \\( \\vec{P} = -P \\hat{j} \\)\n\nSo, moment \\( \\vec{M} = \\vec{r}_{E/D} \\times \\vec{P} = (900 \\hat{i} + 300 \\hat{j}) \\times (-P \\hat{j}) \\)\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\n\\( \\hat{i} \\times \\hat{j} = -\\hat{k} \\)\n\n\\( \\hat{j} \\times \\hat{j} = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\vec{M} = (900)(-P)(-\\hat{k}) + (300)(0) = 900 P \\hat{k} \\)\n\nTherefore, the moment about D due to P is 900 P mm\u00b7N clockwise (assuming the right-hand rule with \\(\\hat{k}\\) pointing out of the page).\n\nSince the structure is in equilibrium, the sum of moments about D must be zero:\n\n\\( \\Sigma M_{D} = 900 P - M_{D} = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, the reaction moment at D is \\( M_{D} = 900 P \\) mm\u00b7N counterclockwise.\n\nWait, but I need the internal bending moment at section a-a, which is between A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the free-body diagram from section a-a to E.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nConsider the part of the structure from section a-a to E.\n\nThere's a horizontal member from section a-a to E, with a chain attached at E applying a force P downward.\n\nAssuming the member is horizontal, the vertical force P at E will cause a bending moment at section a-a.\n\nWait, but the member from section a-a to E is not strictly horizontal; there's a curve in between.\n\nBut for simplicity, maybe I can consider the horizontal projection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire structure and use the principle of superposition.\n\nBut that might be too complicated.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nI know that the internal bending moment at a section is equal to the sum of moments of all external forces and couples acting on either side of the section.\n\nIn this case, if I consider the part from D down to section a-a, the external forces are P at E and the reaction at D.\n\nI already calculated the reaction moment at D as \\( M_{D} = 900 P \\) mm\u00b7N clockwise.\n\nNow, to find the internal bending moment at section a-a, I need to consider the moments acting on that section.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the free-body diagram of the part from section a-a to E.\n\nThere's a horizontal member from section a-a to E, with a chain applying a downward force P at E.\n\nThe distance from section a-a to E is 600 mm horizontally.\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at section a-a due to P is P times the perpendicular distance, which is 600 mm.\n\nWait, but the member is horizontal, and P is vertical, so the moment arm is indeed 600 mm.\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at section a-a is \\( M = P \\times 600 \\) mm\u00b7N clockwise.\n\nBut wait, earlier I calculated the reaction moment at D as \\( M_{D} = 900 P \\) mm\u00b7N, but that was considering the entire structure.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing things.\n\nLet me try to set up the free-body diagram properly.\n\nFirst, consider the entire structure from D down to E.\n\nThere's a vertical member from D down to A (300 mm), then a horizontal member from A to E (600 mm), with a chain applying a downward force P at E.\n\nAssuming the structure is rigid, the reactions at D can be determined by considering equilibrium equations.\n\nLet me denote the reaction at D as \\( R_{D} \\), which will have both horizontal and vertical components, and possibly a moment.\n\nBut since the structure is fixed at D, there will be a reaction force and a reaction moment.\n\nNow, sum of forces in the horizontal direction: \\( \\Sigma F_{x} = R_{Dx} = 0 \\) (since there are no horizontal forces)\n\nTherefore, \\( R_{Dx} = 0 \\)\n\nSum of forces in the vertical direction: \\( \\Sigma F_{y} = R_{Dy} - P = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( R_{Dy} = P \\)\n\nSum of moments about D: \\( \\Sigma M_{D} = -P \\times 900 \\mathrm{~mm} + M_{D} = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( M_{D} = P \\times 900 \\) mm\u00b7N clockwise\n\nNow, to find the internal bending moment at section a-a, I can consider the free-body diagram of the part from D to section a-a.\n\nThe external forces acting on this part are:\n\n- The reaction at D: \\( R_{Dx} = 0 \\), \\( R_{Dy} = P \\) upward\n\n- The internal force at section a-a, which we need to find\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the part from section a-a to E.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nConsider the horizontal member from section a-a to E, with a chain applying a downward force P at E.\n\nThe distance from section a-a to E is 600 mm horizontally.\n\nLet me denote the internal force at section a-a as \\( V \\) (shear force) and \\( M \\) (bending moment).\n\nTaking moments about section a-a:\n\n\\( \\Sigma M_{a-a} = -P \\times 600 \\mathrm{~mm} = -600 P \\) mm\u00b7N clockwise\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at section a-a is \\( M = 600 P \\) mm\u00b7N clockwise.\n\nNow, to find the bending stress at point B, I need to use the formula:\n\n\\( \\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I} \\)\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the stress\n\n- \\( M \\) is the bending moment\n\n- \\( y \\) is the distance from the neutral axis to the point where the stress is being calculated\n\n- \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section about the neutral axis\n\nFirst, I need to find the moment of inertia \\( I \\) of the cross-section at section a-a.\n\nLooking at section a-a, it's a combination of two rectangular sections: one horizontal (50 mm wide by 25 mm high) and one vertical (20 mm wide by 25 mm high), connected by a curve.\n\nAssuming the curve is part of the horizontal section, extending to the vertical section.\n\nTo find the moment of inertia, I need to consider the entire cross-section.\n\nLet me try to calculate the moment of inertia about the neutral axis.\n\nFirst, find the area and the neutral axis position.\n\nArea of the horizontal section:\n\n\\( A_{h} = 50 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times 25 \\mathrm{~mm} = 1250 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\)\n\nArea of the vertical section:\n\n\\( A_{v} = 20 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times 25 \\mathrm{~mm} = 500 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\)\n\nTotal area:\n\n\\( A = A_{h} + A_{v} = 1250 + 500 = 1750 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\)\n\nNow, to find the neutral axis (centroid), I need to find the position where the sum of moments of areas is zero.\n\nLet me assume the horizontal section is placed such that its bottom is at a certain height from the reference.\n\nWait, I need to define a reference axis.\n\nLet me define the neutral axis as the horizontal line passing through the centroid of the entire cross-section.\n\nTo find its position, I can use the formula:\n\n\\( y_{c} = \\frac{\\sum A_{i} y_{i}}{\\sum A_{i}} \\)\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( y_{i} \\) is the distance from the reference axis to the centroid of each component area\n\n- \\( A_{i} \\) is the area of each component\n\nLet me assume the horizontal section is placed with its bottom at y = 0.\n\nThen, the centroid of the horizontal section is at \\( y_{h} = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThe vertical section is placed adjacent to the horizontal section, so its centroid is at \\( y_{v} = 25 \\mathrm{~mm} + \\frac{25}{2} = 36.5 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nTherefore, the centroid of the entire cross-section is:\n\n\\( y_{c} = \\frac{A_{h} y_{h} + A_{v} y_{v}}{A_{h} + A_{v}} = \\frac{(1250)(12.5) + (500)(36.5)}{1750} \\)\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\( y_{c} = \\frac{15625 + 18250}{1750} = \\frac{33875}{1750} = 19.357 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the moment of inertia \\( I \\) about this neutral axis.\n\nFirst, find the moment of inertia of each component about its own centroid, then apply the parallel axis theorem to transfer it to the overall centroid.\n\nFor the horizontal section:\n\n\\( I_{h} = \\frac{b h^{3}}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 25^{3}}{12} = \\frac{50 \\times 15625}{12} = \\frac{781250}{12} = 65104.167 \\mathrm{~mm}^{4} \\)\n\nThen, using the parallel axis theorem:\n\n\\( I_{h}^{\\prime} = I_{h} + A_{h} (y_{h} - y_{c})^{2} = 65104.167 + 1250 \\times (12.5 - 19.357)^{2} \\)\n\nCalculate \\( y_{h} - y_{c} = 12.5 - 19.357 = -6.857 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( I_{h}^{\\prime} = 65104.167 + 1250 \\times (6.857)^{2} = 65104.167 + 1250 \\times 47.004 \\)\n\n\\( I_{h}^{\\prime} = 65104.167 + 58755 = 123859.167 \\mathrm{~mm}^{4} \\)\n\nFor the vertical section:\n\n\\( I_{v} = \\frac{b h^{3}}{12} = \\frac{20 \\times 25^{3}}{12} = \\frac{20 \\times 15625}{12} = \\frac{312500}{12} = 26041.667 \\mathrm{~mm}^{4} \\)\n\nUsing the parallel axis theorem:\n\n\\( I_{v}^{\\prime} = I_{v} + A_{v} (y_{v} - y_{c})^{2} = 26041.667 + 500 \\times (36.5 - 19.357)^{2} \\)\n\nCalculate \\( y_{v} - y_{c} = 36.5 - 19.357 = 17.143 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThen,\n\n\\( I_{v}^{\\prime} = 26041.667 + 500 \\times (17.143)^{2} = 26041.667 + 500 \\times 293.87 \\)\n\n\\( I_{v}^{\\prime} = 26041.667 + 146935 = 172976.667 \\mathrm{~mm}^{4} \\)\n\nTherefore, the total moment of inertia \\( I = I_{h}^{\\prime} + I_{v}^{\\prime} = 123859.167 + 172976.667 = 296835.834 \\mathrm{~mm}^{4} \\)\n\nNow, to find the bending stress at point B, I need to know the distance \\( y \\) from the neutral axis to point B.\n\nLooking at the cross-section, point B is on the inner side of the curve, close to the horizontal section.\n\nFrom the figure, the horizontal section is 50 mm wide and 25 mm high, and the vertical section is 20 mm wide and 25 mm high, placed adjacent to the horizontal section.\n\nAssuming the neutral axis is at y = 19.357 mm, then:\n\n- The top fiber of the horizontal section is at y = 25 mm\n\n- The bottom fiber of the horizontal section is at y = 0 mm\n\n- The top fiber of the vertical section is at y = 25 mm + 25 mm = 50 mm\n\n- The bottom fiber of the vertical section is at y = 25 mm\n\nTherefore, the distance from the neutral axis to the top fiber of the horizontal section is \\( y_{\\text{top,h}} = 25 - 19.357 = 5.643 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThe distance from the neutral axis to the bottom fiber of the horizontal section is \\( y_{\\text{bottom,h}} = 0 - 19.357 = -19.357 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThe distance from the neutral axis to the top fiber of the vertical section is \\( y_{\\text{top,v}} = 50 - 19.357 = 30.643 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nThe distance from the neutral axis to the bottom fiber of the vertical section is \\( y_{\\text{bottom,v}} = 25 - 19.357 = 5.643 \\mathrm{~mm} \\)\n\nNow, point B is located on the inner side of the curve, close to the bottom of the horizontal section.\n\nAssuming point B is at a distance of, say, 5 mm from the bottom, then its distance from the neutral axis would be \\( y_{B} = 5 \\mathrm{~mm} - 19.357 \\mathrm{~mm} = -14.3"
