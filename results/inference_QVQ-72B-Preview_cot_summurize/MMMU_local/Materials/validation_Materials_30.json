                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a triangular plate that's fixed at its base and then displaced at its apex. I need to find the average normal strain along the x-axis. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, the plate is triangular with a base that's fixed, and the apex is displaced horizontally by 5 mm. The sides of the triangle are 800 mm, and there are 45-degree angles involved, which might be important for figuring out the geometry.\n\nI think I should start by understanding the deformation of the plate. Since the base is fixed and the apex is displaced horizontally, the plate is probably deforming in some way, maybe bending or stretching, or both.\n\nThe question mentions \"average normal strain\" along the x-axis. Strain is generally a measure of deformation, specifically the change in length per unit length. So, if something is stretched by a certain amount, the strain is that amount of stretch divided by the original length.\n\nIn this case, the x-axis is horizontal, and the apex is being displaced horizontally by 5 mm. So, perhaps the strain along the x-axis is simply the displacement divided by the original length in the x-direction.\n\nBut wait, the plate is triangular, and the base is fixed. So, the base isn't moving, but the apex is moving horizontally. I need to consider how this displacement affects the horizontal length of the plate.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The plate is a triangle with a base fixed vertically (assuming the base is vertical based on the coordinates given). The apex is at point A, and when displaced, it moves to A'. The displacement is horizontal, 5 mm to the right, let's say.\n\nSo, the original position has the base fixed, and the apex moves horizontally. This would cause the plate to deform, possibly bending about the base.\n\nTo find the strain along the x-axis, I need to consider the change in length in the x-direction over the original length in the x-direction.\n\nBut first, I need to figure out what the original and final lengths are along the x-axis.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the apex is displaced horizontally by 5 mm, and the base is fixed, the top of the plate is moving horizontally, while the base remains in place.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the plate as being stretched horizontally by that 5 mm displacement.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The plate has a certain width in the x-direction, and the displacement is applied at the apex.\n\nLet me look back at the diagram. It shows a triangular plate with a base fixed along the y-axis, and the apex is at point A, which is displaced to A' horizontally by 5 mm.\n\nThe sides of the triangle are 800 mm, and there are 45-degree angles indicated.\n\nWait, the base is fixed along the y-axis, and the apex is displaced horizontally along the x'-axis, which is probably parallel to the x-axis.\n\nThe dimensions are given as 800 mm for the equal sides, and the base is along the y-axis.\n\nI need to find the average normal strain along the x-axis.\n\nMaybe I should consider the displacement of the apex and how it affects the x-dimension of the plate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the definition of strain, which is \u03b5x = \u03b4x / Lx, where \u03b4x is the change in length along x, and Lx is the original length along x.\n\nBut I don't know \u03b4x or Lx yet.\n\nLet me think about the geometry. The plate is an isosceles triangle with two sides of 800 mm and a base along the y-axis.\n\nThe apex is at point A, and it's displaced horizontally by 5 mm to point A'.\n\nSince the base is fixed, the displacement of the apex will cause the plate to deform.\n\nI can try to find the original x-dimension of the plate.\n\nIn the original position, the base is along the y-axis, and the apex is at some point along the x-axis.\n\nGiven that the sides are 800 mm and the angles are 45 degrees, I can find the coordinates of point A.\n\nLet me denote the base as fixed from (0,0) to (0, some height), but since it's along the y-axis, maybe it's from (0,0) to (0, h).\n\nThe apex is at point A, which is at some (x,0), and the sides are 800 mm with 45-degree angles.\n\nWait, if the base is along the y-axis, and the sides make 45-degree angles, then the apex should be directly to the right of the base midpoint.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates. Let's assume the base is fixed along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,h). The apex is at point A, which is at (a,0), and it's displaced to A' at (a+5,0).\n\nThe sides of the triangle are 800 mm, and the angles at the base are 45 degrees.\n\nWait, if the base angles are 45 degrees, then the apex angle would be 90 degrees, making it a right-angled isosceles triangle.\n\nSo, the base is along the y-axis, from (0,0) to (0,h), and the apex is at (a,0).\n\nSince the sides are equal and the base angles are 45 degrees, the apex is directly to the right of the base midpoint.\n\nSo, the base midpoint is at (0,h/2). The distance from the base midpoint to the apex is equal to the side length times cos(45 degrees), which is 800 * (sqrt(2)/2) = 400*sqrt(2) mm.\n\nTherefore, the x-coordinate of the apex is a = 400*sqrt(2) mm.\n\nNow, the apex is displaced horizontally by 5 mm to A', so its new position is (a + 5, 0).\n\nNow, I need to find the average normal strain along the x-axis.\n\nThe strain \u03b5x is defined as the change in length along x divided by the original length along x.\n\nSo, \u03b5x = \u03b4x / Lx.\n\nHere, \u03b4x is the change in length, and Lx is the original length.\n\nIn this case, the original length along x is from the base to the apex, which is a = 400*sqrt(2) mm.\n\nThe displacement is 5 mm, which is the change in position of the apex along x.\n\nBut wait, the base is fixed, so the change in length along x is not just the displacement of the apex.\n\nI think I need to consider how the entire length along x changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the deformation of the plate in the x-direction.\n\nLet me think about the deformation of the plate. Since the apex is displaced horizontally by 5 mm and the base is fixed, the plate is being stretched horizontally.\n\nThe strain along the x-axis would be the change in length divided by the original length.\n\nBut I need to find the average strain along the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the strain at different points along the x-axis and find the average.\n\nBut that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the displacement of the apex and relate it to the strain in the x-direction.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of engineering strain.\n\nEngineering strain is defined as the change in length over the original length, \u03b5 = \u03b4L / L.\n\nIn this case, the original length L is the distance from the base to the apex along the x-axis, which is a = 400*sqrt(2) mm.\n\nThe change in length \u03b4L is the displacement of the apex along x, which is 5 mm.\n\nTherefore, \u03b5x = 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) mm/mm.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 400*sqrt(2) is approximately 400 * 1.4142 \u2248 565.685 mm.\n\nSo, \u03b5x \u2248 5 / 565.685 \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm.\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches option D: 0.00884 mm/mm.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? I need to make sure.\n\nI think I might be missing something here. If the base is fixed and the apex is displaced by 5 mm, the entire plate is being stretched horizontally, but not uniformly, because it's fixed at the base.\n\nSo, the strain isn't constant along the length; it's zero at the base and maximum at the apex.\n\nTherefore, the average strain might not be simply the displacement of the apex divided by the original length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this case, since the displacement is applied only at the apex, and the base is fixed, the strain along the x-axis is indeed the displacement of the apex divided by the original length.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the deformation of the plate in terms of beam theory or some other mechanical property.\n\nBut the problem mentions strain, so maybe I'm on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the definition of strain in terms of displacement gradients.\n\nIn continuum mechanics, strain is related to the gradient of displacement.\n\nThe normal strain \u03b5x is given by \u2202u/\u2202x, where u is the displacement in the x-direction.\n\nIn this case, the displacement u varies from 0 at the base to 5 mm at the apex.\n\nSo, if I can find the gradient \u2202u/\u2202x, that would give me the strain at any point.\n\nTo find the average strain, I would integrate the strain over the length and divide by the length.\n\nAlternatively, since the displacement varies linearly from 0 to 5 mm over the length a = 400*sqrt(2) mm, the strain would also vary linearly from 0 to \u03b5x.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would be the average of 0 and \u03b5x, which is \u03b5x / 2.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strain is not varying linearly.\n\nWait, in beam bending, the strain varies linearly with distance from the neutral axis.\n\nBut in this case, the plate is being stretched horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the plate as being subjected to a uniform strain along the x-axis equal to the displacement of the apex divided by the original length.\n\nIn that case, \u03b5x = 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm, which matches option D.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because the strain might not be uniform.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the deformation of the plate in terms of similar triangles.\n\nIf the apex is displaced by 5 mm, and the base is fixed, the entire plate deforms such that the new position is similar to the original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the displacement field and integrate to find the average strain.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the plate as being under uniaxial tension along the x-axis, with the strain being uniform and equal to the displacement of the apex divided by the original length.\n\nIn that case, \u03b5x = 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm, which again points to option D.\n\nBut I'm still having doubts about whether the strain is uniform or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the definition of strain in terms of engineering strain, which is applicable for small deformations.\n\nIn that case, \u03b5x = \u03b4x / Lx, where \u03b4x is the change in length and Lx is the original length.\n\nBut in this problem, the displacement is applied at the apex, causing the plate to deform, but the base is fixed, so the change in length along x is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the deformation of the plate in terms of its lateral contraction or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the plate as being stretched horizontally by the displacement of the apex.\n\nThe base is fixed, so the horizontal displacement at the base is zero.\n\nThe apex is displaced by 5 mm.\n\nTherefore, the horizontal displacement varies from 0 at the base to 5 mm at the apex.\n\nAssuming this variation is linear, the average displacement along the x-axis would be the average of 0 and 5 mm, which is 2.5 mm.\n\nThen, the average strain would be the average displacement divided by the original length, which is 2.5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00442 mm/mm, which matches option A.\n\nWait, this is different from my previous calculation.\n\nSo now I have two different approaches leading to different results.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the strain at the apex and assumed it represents the average strain, leading to \u03b5x \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm.\n\nIn the second approach, I considered the average displacement and divided by the original length, leading to \u03b5x \u2248 0.00442 mm/mm.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the average strain over the entire length along the x-axis.\n\nGiven that the displacement varies linearly from 0 to 5 mm, the strain also varies linearly from 0 to \u03b5x.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would be the average of 0 and \u03b5x, which is \u03b5x / 2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b5x_avg = (5 / (400*sqrt(2))) / 2 = 5 / (800*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00442 mm/mm, which matches option A.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire plate and calculate the total strain energy or something, but that seems unnecessary for finding the average strain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the plate as being under pure shear, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the plate as being under uniaxial tension, with the strain being uniform, in which case the average strain would be equal to the strain at the apex, which is 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm, matching option D.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the average strain should be half of that, which would be approximately 0.00442 mm/mm, matching option A.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of strain distribution.\n\nIf the displacement at the apex is 5 mm and the base is fixed, the strain along the x-axis varies linearly from 0 at the base to \u03b5x at the apex.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would indeed be the average of 0 and \u03b5x, which is \u03b5x / 2.\n\nTherefore, \u03b5x_avg = (5 / (400*sqrt(2))) / 2 = 5 / (800*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00442 mm/mm, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire plate being stretched uniformly, the average strain would be equal to the displacement of the apex divided by the original length, which is approximately 0.00884 mm/mm, matching option D.\n\nBut since the base is fixed and the apex is displaced, the strain isn't uniform; it's zero at the base and maximum at the apex.\n\nTherefore, the average strain should be less than the strain at the apex.\n\nTherefore, option A seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the strain in terms of the change in length of the base.\n\nBut the base is fixed, so its length doesn't change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the change in the x-coordinate of the apex.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of small displacements and consider the strain as the derivative of the displacement field.\n\nIn that case, if the displacement u(x) varies linearly from 0 at x=0 to 5 mm at x=a, then u(x) = (5/a) * x.\n\nTherefore, the strain \u03b5x = du/dx = 5/a.\n\nThe average strain would be the integral of \u03b5x over x from 0 to a, divided by a.\n\nIntegral of \u03b5x dx from 0 to a is integral of (5/a) dx from 0 to a, which is [5x/a] from 0 to a = 5 mm.\n\nTherefore, the average strain \u03b5x_avg = (5 mm) / a = 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm, which matches option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the average strain should be half of that.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI think I'm confusing myself here.\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nIf the strain varies linearly from 0 to \u03b5x, then the average strain is indeed \u03b5x / 2.\n\nIn this case, \u03b5x at the apex is 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would be approximately 0.00442 mm/mm, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire plate being stretched uniformly, the average strain would be equal to the strain at the apex, which is approximately 0.00884 mm/mm, matching option D.\n\nBut since the strain isn't uniform, with zero strain at the base and maximum strain at the apex, the average should be less than the apex strain.\n\nTherefore, option A seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the definition of average strain in terms of the change in length of the plate.\n\nBut I'm not sure what the change in length of the plate would be in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the deformation of the plate and calculate the strain based on the deformation.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for my current level of understanding.\n\nMaybe I should look for a similar problem or consult a textbook on mechanics of materials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the plate as a cantilever beam subjected to a horizontal displacement at the free end.\n\nIn that case, the strain would vary linearly along the length, with zero strain at the fixed end and maximum strain at the free end.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would be half of the maximum strain.\n\nIn this problem, the base is fixed, and the apex is displaced horizontally.\n\nTherefore, the strain at the apex would be \u03b4 / L, where \u03b4 is the displacement and L is the original length.\n\nTherefore, \u03b5x at the apex is 5 / (400*sqrt(2)) \u2248 0.00884 mm/mm.\n\nTherefore, the average strain would be \u03b5x_avg = \u03b5x / 2 \u2248 0.00442 mm/mm, which matches option A.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
