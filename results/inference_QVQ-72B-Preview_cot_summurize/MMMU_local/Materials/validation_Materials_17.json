                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the stresses in a ligament in the arm when holding a 5-pound stone. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's a diagram showing the arm with the humerus (H), radius (C), ulna (A), and a ligament (B). There are forces labeled F_A and F_C acting on the ulna and radius, respectively, and F_B in the ligament. The stone is being held in the hand, and it's 14 inches from the elbow joint. The ligament has a smallest cross-sectional area of 0.30 square inches, and I need to find the greatest average tensile stress in it.\n\nOkay, so stress is force per unit area, right? So, stress = force / area. Given that, I need to find the force in the ligament, F_B, and then divide it by the area of 0.30 in\u00b2.\n\nBut first, I need to figure out what F_B is. The arm is holding a 5-lb stone, so there must be forces acting on the system due to the weight of the stone and the reactions at the elbow joint.\n\nLet me see the diagram again. There's a force F_A acting downward on the ulna, 0.8 inches from the elbow joint, and F_C acting horizontally on the radius, also at the elbow joint. Then there's F_B, which is along the ligament at a 75-degree angle.\n\nI think this is a static equilibrium problem. The arm is holding the stone without moving, so the sum of forces and the sum of moments must be zero.\n\nSo, \u03a3F_x = 0, \u03a3F_y = 0, and \u03a3M = 0 about any point.\n\nLet me consider the forces acting on the system:\n\n- The weight of the stone, which is 5 lb, acting downward at the hand, 14 inches from the elbow.\n\n- F_A, acting downward at the ulna, 0.8 inches from the elbow.\n\n- F_C, acting horizontally at the radius, at the elbow.\n\n- F_B, acting along the ligament at 75 degrees.\n\nI need to find F_B.\n\nMaybe I should take moments about the elbow to eliminate F_C and F_A.\n\nTaking moments about the elbow:\n\n\u03a3M_elbow = 0\n\nThe moment due to the stone's weight is 5 lb times 14 inches.\n\nWait, need to be careful with units. Actually, in mechanics, we usually work in consistent units. Here, force is in pounds and length in inches, so moment will be in pound-inches.\n\nSo, moment due to stone: 5 lb * 14 in = 70 lb-in, clockwise.\n\nNow, what about the other forces?\n\nF_C is at the elbow, so its moment arm is zero.\n\nF_A is 0.8 inches from the elbow, and it's downward, so its moment is F_A * 0.8 in, clockwise.\n\nF_B is at an angle of 75 degrees, so I need to find its moment arm.\n\nWait, actually, F_B is acting at the elbow, so its moment arm is zero, assuming it's applied at the elbow joint.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram, F_B is applied at the elbow joint, so its moment arm should be zero.\n\nIs that correct? If F_B is applied at the elbow, then its moment arm is zero, and it doesn't contribute to the moment about the elbow.\n\nSo, the equation for moments about the elbow is:\n\n0 = - (5 lb * 14 in) - (F_A * 0.8 in)\n\nWait, but F_A is downward, and its moment is clockwise, same as the stone's weight.\n\nSo, \u03a3M_elbow = - (5 * 14) - (F_A * 0.8) = 0\n\nSo, 70 + 0.8 F_A = 0\n\nThen, 0.8 F_A = -70\n\nSo, F_A = -70 / 0.8 = -87.5 lb\n\nNegative sign means it's upward, but I thought it was downward. Wait, maybe I got the sign wrong.\n\nLet me double-check. If F_A is downward, its moment should be clockwise, same as the stone's weight. So both should be positive moments about the elbow.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the direction of moments. If both F_A and the stone's weight cause clockwise moments, then their moments should be added positively.\n\nSo, \u03a3M_elbow = (5 * 14) + (F_A * 0.8) = 0\n\nThen, 70 + 0.8 F_A = 0\n\n0.8 F_A = -70\n\nF_A = -70 / 0.8 = -87.5 lb\n\nBut negative sign would mean F_A is upward, which contradicts the assumption that it's downward. Maybe I messed up the sign convention.\n\nLet me try again. Suppose F_A is upward, then its moment would be counterclockwise, so negative.\n\nSo, \u03a3M_elbow = (5 * 14) - (F_A * 0.8) = 0\n\nThen, 70 - 0.8 F_A = 0\n\n0.8 F_A = 70\n\nF_A = 70 / 0.8 = 87.5 lb upward.\n\nThat makes more sense. So F_A is 87.5 lb upward.\n\nNow, considering horizontal forces, \u03a3F_x = F_C - F_B cos(75\u00b0) = 0\n\nAnd vertical forces, \u03a3F_y = F_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 lb = 0\n\nWe already have F_A = 87.5 lb upward.\n\nSo, from \u03a3F_y: 87.5 - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 = 0\n\nSo, F_B sin(75\u00b0) = 82.5 lb\n\nF_B = 82.5 / sin(75\u00b0)\n\nSin(75\u00b0) is approximately 0.9659\n\nSo, F_B = 82.5 / 0.9659 \u2248 85.4 lb\n\nNow, stress \u03c3 = F_B / area = 85.4 lb / 0.30 in\u00b2\n\nBut wait, stress is usually expressed in pounds per square inch (psi).\n\nSo, \u03c3 = 85.4 / 0.30 = 284.67 psi\n\nBut none of the options match this. The closest is 221 psi.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the moment arm for F_B.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, F_B is applied at the elbow joint, so its moment arm should indeed be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the direction of F_B more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider resolving F_B into its components first.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s resolve F_B into x and y components.\n\nF_Bx = F_B cos(75\u00b0)\n\nF_By = F_B sin(75\u00b0)\n\nNow, sum of horizontal forces: \u03a3F_x = F_C - F_Bx = 0\n\nSo, F_C = F_B cos(75\u00b0)\n\nSum of vertical forces: \u03a3F_y = F_A - F_By - 5 lb = 0\n\nSo, F_A = F_By + 5 lb = F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 5 lb\n\nWe already have F_A = 87.5 lb from the moment equation.\n\nSo, F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 5 = 87.5\n\nF_B sin(75\u00b0) = 82.5 lb\n\nF_B = 82.5 / sin(75\u00b0) \u2248 85.4 lb\n\nBut earlier, using moments, I got F_A = 87.5 lb, and now from vertical forces, F_B = 82.5 / sin(75\u00b0) \u2248 85.4 lb\n\nNow, stress \u03c3 = F_B / area = 85.4 / 0.30 \u2248 284.67 psi\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. The options are around 120-220 psi.\n\nMaybe I misread the diagram. Perhaps F_B is not at the elbow, but somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram description: F_B is a force in the ligament at a 75-degree angle.\n\nMaybe the 75 degrees is not with respect to the horizontal, but with respect to some other axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ligament is not attached exactly at the elbow joint, so its moment arm isn't zero.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I should consider the entire system and take moments about the elbow, including F_B.\n\nIf F_B is not at the elbow, then its moment arm would be non-zero, and it would contribute to the moment equation.\n\nAssuming F_B is some distance from the elbow, say d inches, then its moment would be F_B * d * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between F_B and the moment arm.\n\nBut I don't know d, so this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ligament is under tension, and its force is transmitted to the bones, affecting the internal forces.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the free-body diagram of the forearm and hand, including the weight of the stone and the reactions at the elbow.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nConsider the forearm and hand as one segment, pivoted at the elbow.\n\nThere is a weight of 5 lb at the hand, 14 inches from the elbow.\n\nThere is a horizontal force F_C at the elbow, and a vertical force F_A at the elbow.\n\nThere is also the force in the ligament, F_B, at some point along the forearm.\n\nIf I take moments about the elbow, the moment due to F_B depends on its position.\n\nIf F_B is applied at a distance a from the elbow, then its moment is F_B * a * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between F_B and the moment arm.\n\nBut I don't know a, so this is still unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that F_B is applied at a specific point along the forearm, say, at a distance of 2 inches from the elbow, based on the diagram.\n\nLooking back, the diagram shows F_B applied near the elbow, possibly at the same point as F_C.\n\nIf F_B and F_C are both applied at the elbow, then their moment arms are zero, and only the stone's weight contributes to the moment.\n\nBut that leads me back to the earlier calculation, where F_B comes out to be around 85 lb, which gives a stress of about 285 psi, which doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ligament is not at the elbow but somewhere along the forearm.\n\nLooking back at the diagram description: \"the ligament at B is at a 75-degree angle.\"\n\nPerhaps B is located some distance along the forearm.\n\nIf that's the case, then F_B would have a moment arm relative to the elbow.\n\nLet's assume that B is located 2 inches from the elbow, as per the diagram.\n\nThen, the moment due to F_B about the elbow would be F_B * 2 in * sin(75\u00b0).\n\nSo, the moment equation would be:\n\n\u03a3M_elbow = (5 lb * 14 in) + (F_B * 2 in * sin(75\u00b0)) + (F_A * 0.8 in) = 0\n\nAssuming clockwise moments are positive.\n\nThe weight of the stone causes a clockwise moment of 5 * 14 = 70 lb-in.\n\nF_B causes a counterclockwise moment of F_B * 2 * sin(75\u00b0), since it's at 75 degrees to the horizontal.\n\nF_A causes a clockwise moment of F_A * 0.8 in.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n70 - F_B * 2 * sin(75\u00b0) + F_A * 0.8 = 0\n\nNow, from vertical forces:\n\n\u03a3F_y = F_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 lb = 0\n\nSo, F_A = F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 5 lb\n\nPlugging this into the moment equation:\n\n70 - F_B * 2 * sin(75\u00b0) + (F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 5) * 0.8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n70 - 2 F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 0.8 F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 4 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n74 - 1.2 F_B sin(75\u00b0) = 0\n\nSo, 1.2 F_B sin(75\u00b0) = 74\n\nF_B sin(75\u00b0) = 74 / 1.2 \u2248 61.67 lb\n\nBut from the vertical forces equation:\n\nF_A = F_B sin(75\u00b0) + 5 lb = 61.67 + 5 = 66.67 lb\n\nBut earlier, from the moment equation without considering F_B's moment, I got F_A = 87.5 lb, which doesn't match.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumption about F_B's position is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the ligament is attached at the elbow, and its moment arm is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2-inch distance is from another point.\n\nLooking back at the diagram description: \"A\" is 0.8 inches from the elbow, and \"C\" is at the elbow.\n\nThe ligament \"B\" is shown near the elbow, possibly at the same point as \"C\".\n\nIf that's the case, then F_B's moment arm is zero, and its moment contribution is zero.\n\nSo, going back to the moment equation:\n\n\u03a3M_elbow = (5 lb * 14 in) + (F_A * 0.8 in) = 0\n\nSo, 70 + 0.8 F_A = 0\n\nThen, 0.8 F_A = -70\n\nF_A = -70 / 0.8 = -87.5 lb\n\nNegative sign means F_A is upward.\n\nNow, from vertical forces:\n\n\u03a3F_y = F_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 lb = 0\n\nSo, -87.5 - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 = 0\n\nF_B sin(75\u00b0) = -87.5 - 5 = -92.5 lb\n\nBut sin(75\u00b0) is positive, so F_B would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that my sign convention is inconsistent.\n\nLet me try assuming that F_A is downward, so positive.\n\nThen, \u03a3F_y = F_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 lb = 0\n\nIf F_A is downward, positive, then:\n\nF_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 = 0\n\nFrom moment equation:\n\n\u03a3M_elbow = (5 lb * 14 in) + (F_A * 0.8 in) = 0\n\nSo, 70 + 0.8 F_A = 0\n\nThen, 0.8 F_A = -70\n\nF_A = -70 / 0.8 = -87.5 lb\n\nBut negative F_A means upward, which contradicts the assumption that F_A is downward.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my understanding of the system is incomplete.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the directions of the forces more carefully.\n\nLet me try to visualize the system again.\n\nThe arm is holding a 5-lb stone, which is causing a downward force at the hand, 14 inches from the elbow.\n\nAt the elbow, there are forces F_A downward on the ulna and F_C horizontally on the radius.\n\nAdditionally, there is F_B in the ligament, which is likely under tension, pulling in the direction of the ligament.\n\nGiven that, perhaps F_B is pulling upward and outward, countering the downward force of the stone.\n\nBut I'm still getting stuck with the signs.\n\nMaybe I should set up a coordinate system where positive is upward and to the right.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Positive x-axis: to the right (horizontal)\n\n- Positive y-axis: upward (vertical)\n\nThen:\n\n- F_C: horizontal force at the elbow, likely to the left (negative x)\n\n- F_A: vertical force at the elbow, likely downward (negative y)\n\n- F_B: force in the ligament at 75 degrees from the horizontal\n\n- Weight of the stone: downward at the hand, 14 inches from the elbow\n\nNow, sum of moments about the elbow:\n\n\u03a3M_elbow = (5 lb * 14 in) + (F_A * 0.8 in) = 0\n\nAssuming clockwise moments are negative:\n\n- (5 * 14) - (F_A * 0.8) = 0\n\nSo, -70 - 0.8 F_A = 0\n\nThen, -0.8 F_A = 70\n\nF_A = -70 / -0.8 = 87.5 lb downward\n\nNow, sum of horizontal forces:\n\n\u03a3F_x = F_C - F_B cos(75\u00b0) = 0\n\nSum of vertical forces:\n\n\u03a3F_y = F_A - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 lb = 0\n\nWe have F_A = 87.5 lb downward.\n\nSo, 87.5 - F_B sin(75\u00b0) - 5 = 0\n\nThen, F_B sin(75\u00b0) = 82.5 lb\n\nF_B = 82.5 / sin(75\u00b0) \u2248 85.4 lb\n\nStress \u03c3 = F_B / area = 85.4 / 0.30 \u2248 284.67 psi\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. The closest is 221 psi.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the ligament is not the only structure supporting the load, and there might be other forces or stresses involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the tension in the ligament due to the stone's weight, without including the reactions at the elbow.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because the ligament is part of the system and its tension affects the reactions.\n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I should look at the answer choices and see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A: 122 psi\n\nOption B: 221 psi\n\nOption C: 121 psi\n\nOption D: 112 psi\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 285 psi, which is closest to option B: 221 psi.\n\n"
