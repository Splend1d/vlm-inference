                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a square rubber block that's being deformed due to some shear strain. The block is 300 mm by 400 mm, and it's subjected to a shear strain that's given by \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y, where x and y are in millimeters. The deformation is such that lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after the deformation, and I need to find the normal strain along edge BC.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The rubber block is being deformed by shear forces, and this deformation is described by a shear strain that varies linearly with position. The fact that lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical suggests that there's no rotation of these lines; they just move horizontally due to the shear.\n\nI recall that shear strain is related to how much one part of the material is sliding horizontally past another part. In this case, \u03b3_xy represents the shear strain in the x-y plane, indicating deformation in the x-direction as a function of both x and y.\n\nThe problem is asking for the normal strain along edge BC. Normal strain is the relative extension or compression of a material in a particular direction. So, along BC, which is originally horizontal, I need to find how much it has stretched or compressed due to the deformation.\n\nGiven that the block is 300 mm wide along the x-axis and 400 mm tall along the y-axis, point A is at (0,0), B at (300,0), C at (300,400), and D at (0,400).\n\nSince the deformation keeps lines parallel to the y-axis vertical, I can assume that the deformation is such that there's no rotation of these lines, only horizontal displacement.\n\nTo find the normal strain along BC, I need to find the change in length of BC after deformation and divide it by the original length.\n\nFirst, let's find the original length of BC, which is simply the height of the block, 400 mm.\n\nNow, after deformation, the position of point B will have changed due to the shear strain. Similarly, point C will have moved as well.\n\nBut since lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical, the x-coordinate of points along these lines will change due to the shear, but their y-coordinates will remain the same.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful here. If lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after deformation, that means that the vertical position doesn't change, but the horizontal position does.\n\nSo, for any point along BC, which is at x = 300 mm, the y-coordinate varies from 0 to 400 mm.\n\nGiven the shear strain expression \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y, I need to relate this to the displacement components.\n\nI recall that in small strain theory, shear strain \u03b3_xy is related to the displacement components u and v by:\n\n\u03b3_xy = (\u2202u/\u2202y) + (\u2202v/\u2202x)\n\nWhere u is the displacement in the x-direction and v is the displacement in the y-direction.\n\nHowever, since the lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical, it suggests that there's no rotation around the x-axis or z-axis, meaning that the vertical lines don't tilt horizontally.\n\nThis might imply that v = 0, meaning no displacement in the y-direction.\n\nWait, but if v = 0, then \u2202v/\u2202x = 0, and \u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y.\n\nBut according to the problem, \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y.\n\nSo, if \u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y, then \u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y.\n\nTherefore, I can integrate this to find u:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nIntegrating with respect to y:\n\nu = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2 + f(x)\n\nWhere f(x) is an arbitrary function of x.\n\nNow, since v = 0, and \u2202v/\u2202x = 0, then \u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y.\n\nBut according to the given strain, \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y.\n\nSo, u = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2 + f(x)\n\nBut since \u03b3_xy is only dependent on x and y, and v = 0, perhaps f(x) is constant or zero.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the boundary conditions to determine f(x).\n\nLooking back at the problem, I need to find the normal strain along BC, which is originally horizontal.\n\nTo find the normal strain, I need to find the change in length of BC after deformation.\n\nOriginally, BC goes from B(300,0) to C(300,400).\n\nAfter deformation, the position of B will be (u_B, 0), and the position of C will be (u_C, 400).\n\nWait, but since v = 0, the y-displacement is zero, so the y-coordinates remain the same.\n\nTherefore, after deformation, B remains at y = 0, and C remains at y = 400 mm.\n\nBut their x-coordinates change due to u.\n\nFrom earlier, u = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2 + f(x)\n\nBut I need to determine f(x).\n\nPerhaps f(x) is zero, or maybe it's constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that at y = 0, u = 0, which would make f(x) = -40*10^-6 x * 0 - 10*10^-6 * 0^2 = 0.\n\nSo, perhaps u = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf u = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\nThen \u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y, which matches the given \u03b3_xy.\n\nSo, u = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\nNow, along BC, x = 300 mm, and y varies from 0 to 400 mm.\n\nSo, the displacement u along BC is:\n\nu = 40*10^-6 * 300 * y + 10*10^-6 * y^2\n\n= 12000*10^-6 y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\n= 0.012 y + 0.00001 y^2\n\nTherefore, the new position of a point along BC is (original x + u, original y)\n\nBut original x is 300 mm, so new x = 300 + u = 300 + 0.012 y + 0.00001 y^2\n\nNow, to find the new length of BC after deformation, I need to integrate the differential length along BC.\n\nAlternatively, since BC was originally straight, and now it's deformed into a curve, I can find the displacement of points B and C and then find the new distance between them.\n\nFirst, find the position of B and C after deformation.\n\nPoint B is at (300,0):\n\nu_B = 0.012*0 + 0.00001*0^2 = 0\n\nSo, new position of B is (300, 0)\n\nPoint C is at (300,400):\n\nu_C = 0.012*400 + 0.00001*400^2 = 0.012*400 + 0.00001*160000 = 4.8 + 1.6 = 6.4 mm\n\nSo, new position of C is (300 + 6.4, 400) = (306.4, 400)\n\nNow, originally, BC was from (300,0) to (300,400), length = 400 mm\n\nAfter deformation, BC is from (300,0) to (306.4,400)\n\nThe new length is the distance between these two points:\n\n\u0394x = 306.4 - 300 = 6.4 mm\n\n\u0394y = 400 - 0 = 400 mm\n\nNew length = sqrt(\u0394x^2 + \u0394y^2) = sqrt(6.4^2 + 400^2) = sqrt(40.96 + 160000) = sqrt(160040.96) \u2248 400.05 mm\n\nOriginal length = 400 mm\n\nTherefore, normal strain \u03b5 = (new length - original length)/original length = (400.05 - 400)/400 \u2248 0.05/400 = 0.000125 mm/mm\n\nBut this is not matching any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the new position of C.\n\nLet me double-check u_C:\n\nu = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\nAt point C (300,400):\n\nu_C = 40*10^-6 * 300 * 400 + 10*10^-6 * 400^2\n\n= 40*10^-6 * 300 * 400 + 10*10^-6 * 160000\n\n= (40*300*400)*10^-6 + (10*160000)*10^-6\n\n= (48000000)*10^-6 + (1600000)*10^-6\n\n= 48 mm + 1.6 mm = 49.6 mm\n\nSo, new position of C is (300 + 49.6, 400) = (349.6, 400)\n\nThen, new length of BC = sqrt((349.6 - 300)^2 + (400 - 0)^2) = sqrt(49.6^2 + 400^2) = sqrt(2460.16 + 160000) = sqrt(162460.16) \u2248 403.06 mm\n\nOriginal length = 400 mm\n\nNormal strain \u03b5 = (403.06 - 400)/400 = 3.06/400 \u2248 0.00765 mm/mm\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the strain in the direction of BC, not just the change in length divided by original length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for normal strain in terms of displacements.\n\nI recall that normal strain \u03b5_x = \u2202u/\u2202x\n\nBut in this case, BC is along the y-direction, so perhaps \u03b5_y = \u2202v/\u2202y\n\nBut v = 0, so \u03b5_y = 0\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the block is deforming.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the strain components in the y-direction due to the shear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the compatibility equations to find the normal strain components.\n\nI know that for plane strain, the compatibility equation relates the normal strains and shear strains.\n\nIn plane strain, the normal strain \u03b5_z is zero, and we have:\n\n\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202y\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2v/\u2202x\u2202y = 0\n\n\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u2202y + \u2202\u00b2v/\u2202x\u00b2 = 0\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated for this problem.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the deformation gradient.\n\nThe deformation gradient F has components:\n\nF_x = \u2202x'/\u2202x = 1 + \u2202u/\u2202x\n\nF_y = \u2202y'/\u2202y = 1 + \u2202v/\u2202y\n\nF_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y\n\nF_yx = \u2202v/\u2202x\n\nGiven that v = 0, then \u2202v/\u2202y = 0 and \u2202v/\u2202x = 0\n\nFrom \u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y + \u2202v/\u2202x = \u2202u/\u2202y + 0 = \u2202u/\u2202y\n\nGiven \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nTherefore, \u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nIntegrating with respect to y:\n\nu = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2 + f(x)\n\nNow, since v = 0, and \u2202v/\u2202x = 0, then \u2202u/\u2202x = \u03b5_x\n\nBut I need \u03b5_y along BC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the Green-Lagrange strain tensor components.\n\nThe Green-Lagrange strain tensor E has components:\n\nE_x = 0.5*(\u2202u/\u2202x)^2 + \u2202u/\u2202x \u2202v/\u2202y\n\nE_y = 0.5*(\u2202v/\u2202y)^2 + \u2202v/\u2202x \u2202u/\u2202y\n\nE_xy = 0.5*(\u2202u/\u2202y + \u2202v/\u2202x)\n\nBut since v = 0, \u2202v/\u2202y = 0 and \u2202v/\u2202x = 0\n\nSo, E_x = 0.5*(\u2202u/\u2202x)^2\n\nE_y = 0\n\nE_xy = 0.5*\u2202u/\u2202y\n\nBut I need the normal strain along BC, which is along the y-direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the infinitesimal strain tensor, which is more common for small deformations.\n\nIn that case, the normal strains are:\n\n\u03b5_x = \u2202u/\u2202x\n\n\u03b5_y = \u2202v/\u2202y = 0\n\n\u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y + \u2202v/\u2202x = \u2202u/\u2202y\n\nGiven \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nSo, \u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nNow, to find \u03b5_y along BC, which is along the y-direction, but since v = 0, \u03b5_y = 0\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the block is deforming.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the change in length of BC due to the shear deformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to find the normal strain in the direction of BC, which is not necessarily aligned with the y-axis.\n\nWait, BC is originally along the y-axis, but after deformation, it's no longer straight; it's deformed into a curve.\n\nPerhaps I need to find the strain in the direction tangent to BC after deformation.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider the strain components in the deformed configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the normal strain along BC can be found by integrating the shear strain along BC.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe normal strain along BC can be found by integrating the shear strain component that causes deformation in the direction of BC.\n\nBut I need to find the correct component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the compatibility equation to relate the normal strain to the shear strain.\n\nI recall that in plane strain, the compatibility equation is:\n\n\u2202\u00b2\u03b5_x/\u2202y\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2\u03b5_y/\u2202x\u2202y + \u2202\u00b2\u03b3_xy/\u2202x\u2202y = 0\n\nBut since \u03b5_y = 0, this simplifies to:\n\n\u2202\u00b2\u03b5_x/\u2202y\u00b2 + \u2202\u00b2\u03b3_xy/\u2202x\u2202y = 0\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is helpful.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the deformation of the block.\n\nThe block is being sheared such that lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical, meaning that there's no rotation of these lines; they just move horizontally.\n\nSo, for any point (x,y), its displacement is only in the x-direction, given by u(x,y).\n\nGiven that \u03b3_xy = \u2202u/\u2202y + \u2202v/\u2202x = \u2202u/\u2202y (since v = 0)\n\nGiven \u03b3_xy = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nTherefore, \u2202u/\u2202y = 40*10^-6 x + 20*10^-6 y\n\nIntegrating with respect to y:\n\nu = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2 + f(x)\n\nNow, to find f(x), perhaps I can consider the boundary conditions.\n\nFor example, at y = 0, u = 0, because the bottom of the block is fixed.\n\nSo, u(x,0) = 0 + f(x) = 0 \u21d2 f(x) = 0\n\nTherefore, u(x,y) = 40*10^-6 x y + 10*10^-6 y^2\n\nNow, along BC, which is at x = 300 mm, y varies from 0 to 400 mm.\n\nSo, u(300,y) = 40*10^-6 * 300 * y + 10*10^-6 * y^2 = 12000*10^-6 y + 10*10^-6 y^2 = 0.012 y + 0.00001 y^2\n\nTherefore, the displacement of point C is:\n\nu_C = 0.012*400 + 0.00001*400^2 = 4."
