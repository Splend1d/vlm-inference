                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a chandelier being suspended from the wall and ceiling using two rods, AB and BC. The diameters of these rods are 3 mm and 4 mm, respectively, and the average normal stress in both rods shouldn't exceed 150 MPa. I need to find the largest mass of the chandelier that can be supported, and the angle theta is 45 degrees.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a chandelier hanging from a point B, which is connected to point A on the wall and point C on the ceiling via rods AB and BC. Rod AB makes a 30-degree angle with the horizontal, and rod BC makes an angle theta with the horizontal, which is given as 45 degrees.\n\nSince the chandelier is in equilibrium, the sum of forces in all directions should be zero. That means the horizontal and vertical components of the forces in rods AB and BC should balance each other out.\n\nLet's denote the tension in rod AB as T_AB and in rod BC as T_BC.\n\nFirst, let's find the components of these tensions.\n\nFor rod AB:\n\n- Horizontal component: T_AB * cos(30\u00b0)\n\n- Vertical component: T_AB * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nFor rod BC:\n\n- Horizontal component: T_BC * cos(45\u00b0)\n\n- Vertical component: T_BC * sin(45\u00b0)\n\nSince the chandelier is stationary, the sum of horizontal forces is zero:\n\nT_AB * cos(30\u00b0) - T_BC * cos(45\u00b0) = 0\n\nSimilarly, the sum of vertical forces is zero:\n\nT_AB * sin(30\u00b0) + T_BC * sin(45\u00b0) - mg = 0\n\nHere, m is the mass of the chandelier, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2).\n\nSo, I have two equations with two unknowns, T_AB and T_BC.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nT_AB * cos(30\u00b0) = T_BC * cos(45\u00b0)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT_AB * (\u221a3/2) = T_BC * (\u221a2/2)\n\nSo, T_AB = T_BC * (\u221a2/2) / (\u221a3/2) = T_BC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n(T_BC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)) * sin(30\u00b0) + T_BC * sin(45\u00b0) - mg = 0\n\nLet's calculate the sine and cosine values:\n\nsin(30\u00b0) = 0.5\n\nsin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.7071\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(T_BC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)) * 0.5 + T_BC * (\u221a2/2) - mg = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nT_BC * (\u221a2/(2\u221a3)) + T_BC * (\u221a2/2) = mg\n\nFactor T_BC:\n\nT_BC * [\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/2] = mg\n\nTo add the terms inside the brackets, find a common denominator, which is 2\u221a3:\n\n\u221a2/(2\u221a3) + \u221a2/2 = \u221a2/(2\u221a3) + (\u221a2 * \u221a3)/(2 * \u221a3) = \u221a2/(2\u221a3) + (\u221a6)/(2\u221a3) = (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3)\n\nSo, T_BC * (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3) = mg\n\nNow, I need to find T_BC. But I also have information about the stress in the rods.\n\nThe average normal stress is given by \u03c3 = F / A, where F is the force (tension) and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nGiven that \u03c3 \u2264 150 MPa, and we have two rods with different diameters.\n\nFirst, find the cross-sectional areas of the rods.\n\nFor rod AB with diameter 3 mm:\n\nA_AB = \u03c0*(d_AB/2)^2 = \u03c0*(3/2)^2 = \u03c0*(1.5)^2 \u2248 7.0686 mm\u00b2 = 7.0686 * 10^-6 m\u00b2\n\nFor rod BC with diameter 4 mm:\n\nA_BC = \u03c0*(d_BC/2)^2 = \u03c0*(4/2)^2 = \u03c0*(2)^2 \u2248 12.5664 mm\u00b2 = 12.5664 * 10^-6 m\u00b2\n\nNow, the maximum tension that each rod can withstand is F_max = \u03c3 * A\n\nFor rod AB:\n\nF_max_AB = 150 MPa * A_AB = 150 * 10^6 N/m\u00b2 * 7.0686 * 10^-6 m\u00b2 = 1060.29 N\n\nFor rod BC:\n\nF_max_BC = 150 MPa * A_BC = 150 * 10^6 N/m\u00b2 * 12.5664 * 10^-6 m\u00b2 = 1884.96 N\n\nSo, T_AB \u2264 1060.29 N and T_BC \u2264 1884.96 N\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\nT_BC * (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3) = mg\n\nBut I also have T_AB = T_BC * (\u221a2/\u221a3)\n\nSince T_AB \u2264 1060.29 N, then T_BC * (\u221a2/\u221a3) \u2264 1060.29 N\n\nCalculate \u221a2/\u221a3 \u2248 0.8165\n\nSo, T_BC * 0.8165 \u2264 1060.29 N\n\nTherefore, T_BC \u2264 1060.29 / 0.8165 \u2248 1299.3 N\n\nBut earlier, we found that T_BC \u2264 1884.96 N based on its own stress limit.\n\nSo, the limiting factor is T_BC \u2264 1299.3 N due to the stress in rod AB.\n\nTherefore, T_BC = 1299.3 N\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for mg:\n\nmg = T_BC * (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3)\n\nCalculate (\u221a2 + \u221a6)/(2\u221a3):\n\n\u221a2 \u2248 1.4142, \u221a6 \u2248 2.4495\n\nSo, (1.4142 + 2.4495)/(2*1.7321) \u2248 (3.8637)/3.4642 \u2248 1.1153\n\nTherefore, mg = 1299.3 * 1.1153 \u2248 1450 N\n\nNow, m = 1450 N / 9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 147.8 kg\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, m \u2248 148 kg\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 48 kg\n\nB. 148 kg\n\nC. 184 kg\n\nD. 248 kg\n\nThe correct answer is B. 148 kg\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
