                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a wooden specimen in a tension test, and it's being pulled with an average normal stress of 2 ksi. We need to find the average shear stress along section a-a. The options are 200 psi, 150 psi, 500 psi, and 250 psi.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a wooden piece glued or fixed between two metal parts, and there are dimensions given: 4 inches, 2 inches, and 1 inch. The force is applied at the top and bottom, as indicated by the arrows labeled P.\n\nSince it's a tension test, the force P is causing the specimen to stretch. The average normal stress is given as 2 ksi, which is 2000 psi. Normal stress is force per unit area, so \u03c3 = P / A.\n\nGiven that, I can find the force P by knowing the cross-sectional area where the stress is applied. But I need to identify which dimension corresponds to the area experiencing the normal stress.\n\nLooking at the diagram, the wooden part seems to be rectangular with a width of 2 inches and a thickness of 1 inch. So, the cross-sectional area where the force is applied would be 2 inches times 1 inch, which is 2 square inches. Therefore, the force P can be calculated as:\n\nP = \u03c3 * A = 2 ksi * 2 in\u00b2 = 4 kip\n\nWait, but ksi is kilopounds per square inch, so 2 ksi is 2000 psi, and multiplying by 2 in\u00b2 gives 4000 lb, which is 4 kip. So, P = 4 kip.\n\nNow, we need to find the average shear stress along section a-a. Shear stress is typically caused by shear forces, but in this case, it seems like the normal force is also inducing some shear stress due to the geometry.\n\nSection a-a is likely the plane where the glue or the interface between the wood and the metal is, and we need to find the shear stress there.\n\nTo find the shear stress, we need to know the shear force and the area over which it's acting.\n\nIn this setup, the force P is being transferred from the top metal part through the wood to the bottom metal part. The wood is glued to the metal parts, so there must be shear stresses developed along the glued surface.\n\nThe shear force would be equal to the force P, which is 4 kip, assuming that the entire force is being transferred through the glued surface.\n\nNow, to find the average shear stress, we need to divide the shear force by the area over which it's acting. So, \u03c4 = V / A, where V is the shear force and A is the shear area.\n\nThe shear area would be the area of the glued surface along section a-a.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, the glued surface seems to be rectangular with a height of 4 inches and a width of 1 inch.\n\nWait, the wooden part is 2 inches wide, but the glued surface might be different.\n\nActually, the glued surface is between the wood and the metal parts. If the wood is 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick, and it's glued to the metal parts on both sides, then the glued surface area would be two times (wood width times glue length).\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Let's look at the diagram again.\n\nThe wooden part is inserted between two metal parts, and it's glued or fixed in place. The dimensions are 4 inches on the sides, 2 inches in the middle, and 1 inch thickness.\n\nI think the glued surface is along the sides of the wood, which are 4 inches in height and 1 inch in thickness, and there are two such surfaces (left and right sides).\n\nSo, the total glued area would be 2 * (4 in * 1 in) = 8 in\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the average shear stress \u03c4 = V / A = 4 kip / 8 in\u00b2 = 0.5 kip/in\u00b2 = 500 psi.\n\nWait, but 4 kip is 4000 lb, and 8 in\u00b2, so 4000 lb / 8 in\u00b2 = 500 psi.\n\nYes, that matches one of the options.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm the glued area: two sides, each 4 inches by 1 inch, so total 8 in\u00b2.\n\nForce P is 4 kip, which is 4000 lb.\n\nShear stress \u03c4 = 4000 lb / 8 in\u00b2 = 500 psi.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider only one glued surface, but that doesn't make sense because both sides are glued.\n\nSo, 500 psi is the average shear stress.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 500 psi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
