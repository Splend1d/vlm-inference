                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a shear spring made from two blocks of rubber, each with height \\( h \\), width \\( b \\), and thickness \\( a \\). These blocks are bonded to three plates, and a vertical load \\( P \\) is applied to plate A, causing it to displace by \\( \\delta \\). We're supposed to find \\( \\delta \\) in terms of \\( P \\), given the shear modulus \\( G \\) of the rubber.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are two rubber blocks, each of thickness \\( a \\), bonded to three plates. The central plate A is being pushed down by a force \\( P \\), and we're to find its displacement \\( \\delta \\).\n\nSince it's a shear spring, I suspect that the deformation is primarily due to shear stresses in the rubber blocks. The force \\( P \\) applied vertically will cause the central plate to move down, but because the rubber is bonded to the plates on either side, it will shear.\n\nI recall that the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\) is related to the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) by the shear modulus \\( G \\) through the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = G \\gamma\n\\]\n\nAlso, in shear springs, the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is related to the shear strain by:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\gamma \\times \\text{some dimension}\n\\]\n\nHere, the thickness \\( a \\) seems relevant because it's the dimension along which shearing occurs.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that \\( \\delta = a \\tan \\gamma \\approx a \\gamma \\), assuming small displacements. That makes sense because for small angles, \\( \\tan \\gamma \\approx \\gamma \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\).\n\nNow, I need to find \\( \\gamma \\) in terms of \\( P \\) and \\( G \\).\n\nI remember that for a shear element, the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) is \\( P / A \\), where \\( A \\) is the area over which the force is applied.\n\nIn this case, the force \\( P \\) is applied to plate A, and the shear area should be the area of the rubber blocks that are sheared.\n\nEach rubber block has a cross-sectional area for shearing of \\( b \\times a \\), and there are two blocks.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in shear, the area is the area perpendicular to the direction of the force.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe rubber blocks are being sheared along their thickness \\( a \\), and the width is \\( b \\), so the shear area for each block is \\( b \\times a \\).\n\nSince there are two blocks, the total shear area is \\( 2 b a \\).\n\nTherefore, the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) is \\( P / (2 b a) \\).\n\nThen, using \\( \\tau = G \\gamma \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = a \\times \\frac{P}{2 b a G} = \\frac{P}{2 b G}\n\\]\n\nHmm, but looking at the options, option A is \\( \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), which is different from what I have.\n\nMaybe I misconsidered the shear area.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe shear area should be the area that's being sheared. Each rubber block has a thickness \\( a \\) and width \\( b \\), so the shear area for one block is \\( b \\times a \\).\n\nSince there are two blocks, the total shear area is \\( 2 b a \\).\n\nBut perhaps the height \\( h \\) is relevant here. Wait, no, the shear is along the thickness \\( a \\), and the width is \\( b \\), so the shear area per block is \\( b \\times a \\), and total shear area is \\( 2 b a \\).\n\nWait, but maybe the height \\( h \\) is the length of the rubber block in the direction of shear deformation.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the formula for shear deformation in a block.\n\nFor a single shear block of thickness \\( t \\), width \\( w \\), and height \\( h \\), the shear deformation \\( \\delta \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{P h}{A G}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( A \\) is the shear area, which is \\( w \\times t \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\delta = \\frac{P h}{w t G} \\).\n\nIn this problem, each rubber block has thickness \\( a \\), width \\( b \\), and height \\( h \\).\n\nSo, for one block, \\( \\delta = \\frac{P h}{b a G} \\).\n\nSince there are two blocks, and they are in parallel, their deformations add up, but wait, no.\n\nIf they're in parallel, the total displacement should be the same for both, and the total force is divided between them.\n\nWait, no. If they're in parallel, the displacement is the same, and the total force is the sum of the forces on each.\n\nBut in this case, both blocks are supporting the same load \\( P \\), assuming the plates are rigid.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the total force \\( P \\) is shared between the two blocks.\n\nSo, each block experiences a force \\( P / 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, for one block:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{(P / 2) h}{b a G} = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nSince both blocks deform by the same amount, the total displacement \\( \\delta \\) is the same as above.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match with the options provided.\n\nOption A is \\( \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), which is different.\n\nOption B is \\( \\frac{P a}{b h G} \\), still different.\n\nOption C is \\( \\frac{P a b}{2 h G} \\), and Option D is \\( \\frac{2 P a}{b h G} \\).\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the shear area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement is proportional to the height \\( h \\), as in the formula I used.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nI recall that in shear springs, the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is related to the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\) by \\( \\delta = \\gamma \\times l \\), where \\( l \\) is the length over which the shear occurs.\n\nIn this case, the length is the height \\( h \\), so \\( \\delta = \\gamma h \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / A}{G} \\).\n\nWhat is the shear area \\( A \\)?\n\nThe shear area is the area perpendicular to the shear force.\n\nIn this setup, the shear force is applied over the area of the rubber blocks in contact with the plates.\n\nEach rubber block has a face of area \\( b \\times a \\) that's being sheared.\n\nSo, total shear area is \\( 2 b a \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{P / (2 b a)}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\gamma h = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nBut this is the same as what I had before, and it still doesn't match the options.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something about how the forces are distributed.\n\nLet me consider the plates being rigid.\n\nIf the central plate A is being pushed down by \\( P \\), and the plates on either side are fixed, then the central plate's displacement will cause shear in the rubber blocks.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the shear strain in terms of the height \\( h \\), as the length over which shear occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for shear deformation in a block:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{\\tau h}{G}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\tau \\) is the shear stress.\n\nBut \\( \\tau = \\frac{P}{A} \\), where \\( A \\) is the shear area.\n\nAgain, \\( A = 2 b a \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nStill the same result.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is related to the shear angle \\( \\gamma \\) by \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), not \\( h \\gamma \\).\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I used \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), and then \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / (2 b a)}{G} \\), leading to \\( \\delta = \\frac{P a}{2 b a G} = \\frac{P}{2 b G} \\), which simplifies to option A, but with \\( h \\) missing.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIf \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), and \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / (2 b a)}{G} \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = a \\times \\frac{P}{2 b a G} = \\frac{P}{2 b G}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't include \\( h \\), which is present in some of the options.\n\nMaybe I'm misapplying the relationship between \\( \\delta \\) and \\( \\gamma \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\) is \\( \\delta / h \\), not \\( \\delta / a \\).\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn a shear block, the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\) is defined as the tangent of the angle of shear, which can be approximated as \\( \\gamma = \\delta / h \\) for small angles.\n\nGiven that, then:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\delta}{h}\n\\]\n\nAnd also,\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / (2 b a)}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{h} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\delta \\):\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nThis matches what I had before.\n\nBut this doesn't correspond to any of the given options directly.\n\nOption A is \\( \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), which is different.\n\nOption B is \\( \\frac{P a}{b h G} \\), still not matching.\n\nOption C is \\( \\frac{P a b}{2 h G} \\), no.\n\nOption D is \\( \\frac{2 P a}{b h G} \\), still not matching.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shear area is different.\n\nWait, maybe the height \\( h \\) is not the length over which shear occurs.\n\nLet me consider the geometry again.\n\nThe rubber blocks are of height \\( h \\), width \\( b \\), and thickness \\( a \\).\n\nThey are bonded to three plates, with the central plate being displaced by \\( \\delta \\).\n\nThe shear deformation occurs along the thickness \\( a \\), and the shear area is \\( b \\times a \\) for each block.\n\nSo, total shear area is \\( 2 b a \\).\n\nTherefore, the shear stress \\( \\tau = \\frac{P}{2 b a} \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G} \\).\n\nAnd \\( \\delta = a \\gamma = a \\times \\frac{P}{2 b a G} = \\frac{P}{2 b G} \\).\n\nBut this still doesn't include \\( h \\), which is present in the options.\n\nMaybe the relationship between \\( \\delta \\) and \\( \\gamma \\) is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is proportional to \\( h \\), not \\( a \\).\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the shear deformation formula for a block:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{\\tau h}{G}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\tau = \\frac{P}{A} \\), and \\( A = 2 b a \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shear area is different.\n\nMaybe the shear area is \\( b \\times h \\), not \\( b \\times a \\).\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the thickness is \\( a \\), and shear occurs along the thickness.\n\nWait, perhaps the shear area is \\( b \\times h \\), and the height \\( h \\) is the dimension along which shear occurs.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf the rubber blocks are being sheared along their height \\( h \\), then the shear area would be \\( b \\times a \\), as I thought before.\n\nI'm getting stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should look at the units to see which option makes sense.\n\nThe units should be consistent.\n\n\\( \\delta \\) is displacement, so units of meters.\n\n\\( P \\) is force, units of N.\n\n\\( a, b, h \\) are lengths, units of m.\n\n\\( G \\) is shear modulus, units of Pa or N/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, option A: \\( \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), units of \\( \\frac{N \\times m}{N/m\u00b2 \\times m \\times m} = \\frac{N m}{N/m\u00b2 \\times m\u00b2} = \\frac{m}{m\u00b2/m\u00b2} = m \\), which is correct units.\n\nOption B: \\( \\frac{P a}{b h G} \\), same units as A.\n\nOption C: \\( \\frac{P a b}{2 h G} \\), units of \\( \\frac{N \\times m \\times m}{N/m\u00b2 \\times m \\times m} = \\frac{N m\u00b2}{N/m\u00b2 \\times m\u00b2} = m \\), correct units.\n\nOption D: \\( \\frac{2 P a}{b h G} \\), same units as A.\n\nSo, all options have correct units, but which one matches the derivation?\n\nMy derivation led to \\( \\delta = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G} \\), which doesn't match any option directly.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is proportional to \\( a \\), not \\( h \\).\n\nWait, maybe the relationship between \\( \\delta \\) and \\( \\gamma \\) is \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), not \\( \\delta = h \\gamma \\).\n\nIf that's the case, then from \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / (2 b a)}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b a G} \\), then \\( \\delta = a \\times \\frac{P}{2 b a G} = \\frac{P}{2 b G} \\).\n\nBut this doesn't include \\( h \\) or \\( a \\), which are present in the options.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the stiffness of the system.\n\nThe stiffness \\( k \\) is \\( \\frac{P}{\\delta} \\), and for a shear element, \\( k = \\frac{G A}{h} \\), where \\( A \\) is the shear area, and \\( h \\) is the length over which shear occurs.\n\nIn this case, if the shear area is \\( 2 b a \\), and the length is \\( h \\), then \\( k = \\frac{G \\times 2 b a}{h} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\delta = \\frac{P}{k} = \\frac{P h}{2 b a G} \\).\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nOption A is \\( \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), which is different.\n\nUnless there's a different approach or a different way to interpret the geometry.\n\nMaybe the displacement \\( \\delta \\) is not simply related to \\( h \\), but to \\( a \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shear area is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the shear area is \\( b \\times h \\), not \\( b \\times a \\).\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the thickness is \\( a \\), and shear occurs along the thickness.\n\nUnless the shear is occurring along the height \\( h \\).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf the shear area is \\( b \\times h \\), then total shear area is \\( 2 b h \\).\n\nThen, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{\\tau}{G} = \\frac{P / (2 b h)}{G} = \\frac{P}{2 b h G} \\).\n\nIf \\( \\delta = a \\gamma \\), then \\( \\delta = a \\times \\frac{P}{2 b h G} = \\frac{P a}{2 b h G} \\), which is option A.\n\nWait, that matches option A.\n\nBut is this correct?
