                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the resultant internal normal and shear forces at section a-a, which passes through point A. There's a 500-pound load applied to the member, and it's applied along the centroidal axis. The diagram shows a rectangular prism with forces of 500 pounds acting horizontally in opposite directions, and there's a section labeled a-a that's inclined at 30 degrees.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The normal force is the force perpendicular to the cross-section, and the shear force is the force parallel to the cross-section. So, at section a-a, which is inclined at 30 degrees, I need to find these components of the internal forces.\n\nSince the 500-pound load is applied along the centroidal axis, I can consider it as a tensile force acting uniformly across the cross-section. But since the section a-a is inclined, I need to resolve this force into components normal and parallel to this inclined plane.\n\nLet me visualize this. The member is being pulled from both ends with 500 pounds each, so the total tensile force is 500 pounds. Now, section a-a is at a 30-degree angle to the horizontal. I need to find the components of the tensile force perpendicular and parallel to this section.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of stress. If the member is in tension with a force of 500 pounds, the normal stress is sigma = force / area. But since the section is inclined, I need to find the normal and shear stresses on this inclined plane.\n\nWait, but the question asks for forces, not stresses. So, I need to find the forces acting on the inclined section.\n\nLet me consider the equilibrium of the member. The external forces are two 500-pound forces in opposite directions, so the member is in tension. Now, cutting through the member at section a-a, which is inclined at 30 degrees, I need to find the resultant normal and shear forces on this cut surface.\n\nI think I can use the concept of resolved forces on an inclined plane. The normal force would be the component of the tensile force perpendicular to the section, and the shear force would be the component parallel to the section.\n\nLet me recall how to resolve a force on an inclined plane. If I have a force F acting along the axis of the member, and I want to find its components on a plane inclined at angle \u03b8, then:\n\n- The normal component is F cos \u03b8\n\n- The shear component is F sin \u03b8\n\nIn this case, \u03b8 is 30 degrees.\n\nSo, normal force Na = 500 lb * cos(30\u00b0)\n\nAnd shear force Va = 500 lb * sin(30\u00b0)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, thinking about it differently, if the member is in tension with 500 pounds, and the section is inclined at 30 degrees, then:\n\n- The normal force should be equal to the tensile force times the cosine of the angle, because the normal direction is perpendicular to the section.\n\n- The shear force would be equal to the tensile force times the sine of the angle, because it's parallel to the section.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, calculating:\n\nNa = 500 * cos(30\u00b0) = 500 * (\u221a3/2) \u2248 500 * 0.866 \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nVa = 500 * sin(30\u00b0) = 500 * 0.5 = 250 pounds\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match this calculation. Option A shows Na=500 lb and Va=250 lb, which matches my shear force calculation but not the normal force.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the entire member and think about the internal forces acting on the inclined section.\n\nImagine slicing the member at section a-a, which is inclined at 30 degrees. The area of this section is larger than the original cross-section because it's diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the area on which the force is acting.\n\nLet me assume the original cross-section is a rectangle with a certain area A. The inclined section at 30 degrees would have an area of A / cos(30\u00b0), because the inclined area is larger.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think about the equilibrium of the member. Since the member is in equilibrium under the action of the external forces, the internal forces must balance these external forces.\n\nThe external forces are two 500-pound forces in opposite directions, so the net external force is zero. Therefore, the internal forces must also balance each other.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps me find the normal and shear forces on the inclined section.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can consider the stresses.\n\nIf the member is in tension with a force of 500 pounds, the normal stress on the original cross-section is \u03c3 = F / A.\n\nOn the inclined section, the normal stress would be \u03c3' = F / (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 cos \u03b8\n\nAnd the shear stress would be \u03c4 = (\u03c3 / 2) sin 2\u03b8\n\nWait, I think this is related to Mohr's circle for stress.\n\nLet me recall Mohr's circle for plane stress. For a uniaxial stress state, where only normal stress is applied in one direction, the stresses on an inclined plane can be determined using trigonometric relationships.\n\nIn this case, the member is under uniaxial tension with \u03c3 = 500 / A.\n\nOn the inclined section at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, the normal stress \u03c3' = \u03c3 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 and the shear stress \u03c4 = \u03c3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nBut again, the question asks for forces, not stresses. So, if I want forces, I need to multiply these stresses by the area.\n\nSo, normal force Na = \u03c3' * A' = \u03c3 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A cos \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, shear force Va = \u03c4 * A' = (\u03c3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8) * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A sin \u03b8\n\nTherefore, Na = \u03c3 A cos \u03b8 = F cos \u03b8\n\nAnd Va = \u03c3 A sin \u03b8 = F sin \u03b8\n\nSo, back to my initial thought.\n\nThus, Na = 500 * cos(30\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nAnd Va = 500 * sin(30\u00b0) = 250 pounds\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nOption A is Na=500 lb, Va=250 lb\n\nOption B is Na=600 lb, Va=0\n\nOption C is Na=500 lb, Va=0\n\nOption D is Na=550 lb, Va=0\n\nNone of these match my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the section a-a is not just inclined, but also has a specific orientation.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, section a-a is inclined at 30 degrees, but I need to confirm the direction of inclination.\n\nIn the diagram, there are labels a and b on the section, and point A is marked. The section seems to be inclined such that it makes a 30-degree angle with the horizontal axis.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the orientation of the section relative to the axis of the member.\n\nLet me assume that the member is aligned horizontally, and section a-a is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal.\n\nIn that case, the normal to the section would make a 30-degree angle with the horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the normal force would be the component of the tensile force in the direction perpendicular to the section.\n\nWait, no. The normal force should be the component of the tensile force perpendicular to the section.\n\nGiven that the tensile force is along the axis of the member, and the section is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal, the normal force should be the tensile force times the cosine of the angle between them.\n\nSo, if the angle between the tensile force and the normal to the section is 30 degrees, then Na = F cos(30\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle.\n\nLet me consider the angle between the tensile force and the normal to the section.\n\nIf the section is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal, and the tensile force is along the horizontal, then the angle between the tensile force and the normal to the section would be 60 degrees.\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me draw this out.\n\nImagine the member is horizontal, and section a-a is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal.\n\nThe normal to the section would be perpendicular to the section, which would make an angle of 90 - 30 = 60 degrees with the horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the tensile force (horizontal) and the normal to the section (60 degrees from horizontal) is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the normal force Na = F cos(60\u00b0) = 500 * 0.5 = 250 pounds\n\nAnd the shear force Va = F sin(60\u00b0) = 500 * (\u221a3/2) \u2248 500 * 0.866 \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nWait, this is different from my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, now Na = 250 pounds and Va \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nBut none of the options have 433.0 pounds; the closest is option A with Va=250 lb.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the resolution of the tensile force into components parallel and perpendicular to the section.\n\nThe normal force is the component perpendicular to the section, and the shear force is the component parallel to the section.\n\nGiven that the section is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal, and the tensile force is horizontal, the angle between the tensile force and the normal to the section is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, Na = F cos(60\u00b0) = 250 pounds\n\nAnd Va = F sin(60\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the orientation of the section more carefully.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the direction of the tensile force relative to the section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the area on which the force is acting.\n\nIf the original cross-section has an area A, then the inclined section has an area A' = A / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the inclination angle.\n\nTherefore, the normal stress on the inclined section would be \u03c3' = F / A' = F cos \u03b8 / A\n\nBut \u03c3 = F / A, so \u03c3' = \u03c3 cos \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, the shear stress \u03c4 = \u03c3 sin \u03b8\n\nTherefore, normal force Na = \u03c3' * A' = \u03c3 cos \u03b8 * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A cos \u03b8 = F cos \u03b8\n\nAnd shear force Va = \u03c4 * A' = \u03c3 sin \u03b8 * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8 = F sin \u03b8\n\nSo, again, Na = F cos \u03b8 and Va = F sin \u03b8\n\nGiven \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, Na = 500 * cos(30\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nAnd Va = 500 * sin(30\u00b0) = 250 pounds\n\nBut this contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought \u03b8 was 60 degrees.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the angle \u03b8.\n\nLet me define \u03b8 as the angle between the normal to the section and the axis of the member.\n\nIn this case, the section is inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal, so the normal to the section makes an angle of 60 degrees with the horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the tensile force (horizontal) and the normal to the section is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, Na = F cos(60\u00b0) = 250 pounds\n\nAnd Va = F sin(60\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nOption A is Na=500 lb, Va=250 lb\n\nOption B is Na=600 lb, Va=0\n\nOption C is Na=500 lb, Va=0\n\nOption D is Na=550 lb, Va=0\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the correct answer is Na=500 lb and Va=250 lb, which is option A.\n\nBut according to my calculations, Na should be approximately 433 pounds, not 500 pounds.\n\nMaybe there's something wrong with my approach.\n\nLet me consider the area on which the force is acting.\n\nIf the original cross-section has area A, then the inclined section has area A' = A / cos \u03b8 = A / cos(30\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, the normal stress on the inclined section is \u03c3' = F / A' = F cos \u03b8 / A\n\nBut \u03c3 = F / A, so \u03c3' = \u03c3 cos \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, the shear stress \u03c4 = \u03c3 sin \u03b8\n\nTherefore, the normal force Na = \u03c3' * A' = \u03c3 cos \u03b8 * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A cos \u03b8 = F cos \u03b8\n\nAnd the shear force Va = \u03c4 * A' = \u03c3 sin \u03b8 * (A / cos \u03b8) = \u03c3 A sin \u03b8 / cos \u03b8 = F sin \u03b8\n\nSo, again, Na = F cos \u03b8 and Va = F sin \u03b8\n\nWith \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, Na = 500 * cos(30\u00b0) \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nAnd Va = 500 * sin(30\u00b0) = 250 pounds\n\nBut option A has Na=500 lb and Va=250 lb, which doesn't match my calculation for Na.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the section a-a is aligned in such a way that the normal force is equal to the tensile force.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the member is being pulled by two 500-pound forces, so the total tensile force is 500 pounds.\n\nBut in reality, if both ends are being pulled with 500 pounds each, the total tensile force would be 500 pounds.\n\nI think I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me consider the free-body diagram of one side of the section.\n\nImagine cutting the member at section a-a, which is inclined at 30 degrees.\n\nOn one side of the cut, there will be internal forces acting on the inclined section to maintain equilibrium.\n\nThese internal forces should balance the external forces.\n\nGiven that the external forces are two 500-pound forces in opposite directions, the net external force is zero, assuming the member is in equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the internal forces on the inclined section must also balance each other.\n\nBut I'm still not sure how to relate this to the normal and shear forces.\n\nPerhaps I should use the concept of stress transformation.\n\nIn plane stress, the normal and shear stresses on an inclined plane can be expressed as:\n\n\u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8) + \u03c4 sin 2\u03b8\n\n\u03c4' = (\u03c3 / 2) sin 2\u03b8 - \u03c4 cos 2\u03b8\n\nBut in this case, only normal stress is present, \u03c4 = 0.\n\nTherefore, \u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8)\n\nAnd \u03c4' = 0\n\nGiven that \u03c3 = F / A = 500 / A\n\nAnd \u03b8 = 30\u00b0\n\nThen \u03c3' = (500 / A) / 2 * (1 + cos 60\u00b0) = (500 / A) / 2 * (1 + 0.5) = (500 / A) / 2 * 1.5 = (500 * 1.5) / (2 A) = (750) / A\n\nTherefore, the normal stress on the inclined section is \u03c3' = 750 / A\n\nAnd the shear stress is \u03c4' = 0\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \u03c4' = 0 only if \u03c4 = 0, which in this case, \u03c4 = 0.\n\nTherefore, \u03c4' = 0\n\nBut \u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8) = (500 / A) / 2 * (1 + cos 60\u00b0) = (500 / A) / 2 * (1 + 0.5) = (500 / A) / 2 * 1.5 = (500 * 1.5) / (2 A) = 750 / (2 A) = 375 / A\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03c3':\n\n\u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8)\n\nGiven \u03c3 = 500 / A\n\n\u03b8 = 30\u00b0, so 2\u03b8 = 60\u00b0, cos 60\u00b0 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, \u03c3' = (500 / A) / 2 * (1 + 0.5) = (500 / A) / 2 * 1.5 = (500 * 1.5) / (2 A) = 750 / (2 A) = 375 / A\n\nWait, but earlier I had \u03c3' = 750 / A, but that was a mistake.\n\nSo, \u03c3' = 375 / A\n\nTherefore, the normal force Na = \u03c3' * A' = (375 / A) * (A / cos 30\u00b0) = 375 / cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 375 / 0.866 \u2248 433.0 pounds\n\nAnd the shear force Va = 0\n\nWait, but according to this, Va should be zero, but earlier I calculated Va = F sin \u03b8 = 250 pounds.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me check the stress transformation formulas again.\n\nFor plane stress, the normal and shear stresses on an inclined plane are:\n\n\u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8) + \u03c4 sin 2\u03b8\n\n\u03c4' = (\u03c3 / 2) sin 2\u03b8 - \u03c4 cos 2\u03b8\n\nIn this case, \u03c4 = 0, since only normal stress is present.\n\nTherefore, \u03c3' = (\u03c3 / 2) (1 + cos 2\u03b8)\n\nAnd \u03c4' = 0\n\nGiven \u03c3 = 500 / A\n\n"
