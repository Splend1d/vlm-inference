                    "text": "So I've got this lab setup here, and I need to determine if the balanced equation for the reaction is correct based on the image and text provided. The equation is: \\((\\mathrm{NH}_{4})_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow \\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening in this experiment. There's a burner heating ammonium carbonate, and the products are being directed through glass and rubber tubing into a test tube containing limewater, which is calcium hydroxide solution \\(\\left(\\mathrm{Ca}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(a q)\\right)\\).\n\nI recall that ammonium carbonate is a salt that can decompose when heated. The equation suggests that when ammonium carbonate is heated, it breaks down into water \\(\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)\\), carbon dioxide \\(\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)\\), and ammonia \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)\\).\n\nLet me verify the decomposition reaction. Ammonium carbonate is \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}\\). The ammonium ion \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\\right)\\)and the carbonate ion \\(\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\\right)\\) are present.\n\nWhen heated, ammonium carbonate decomposes into ammonia, water, and carbon dioxide. The balanced equation should represent this process correctly.\n\nLet me balance the equation step by step to check if it's correct.\n\nStarting with: \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\)\n\nFirst, let's count the atoms on both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n- N: 2\n- H: 8\n- C: 1\n- O: 3\n\nWait, that can't be right because in \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}\\), there are two ammonium ions, each with one nitrogen and four hydrogens, and one carbonate ion with one carbon and three oxygens.\n\nSo, total:\n- N: 2\n- H: 8\n- C: 1\n- O: 3\n\nRight side:\n- \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}: 2 \\mathrm{H}, 1 \\mathrm{O}\\)\n- \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}: 1 \\mathrm{C}, 2 \\mathrm{O}\\)\n- \\(2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}: 2 \\mathrm{~N}, 6 \\mathrm{H}\\)\n\nTotal:\n- N: 2\n- H: 8\n- C: 1\n- O: 3\n\nWait, both sides have the same number of each type of atom, so the equation is balanced.\n\nBut I have a feeling that there might be a mistake because the decomposition of ammonium carbonate typically produces ammonia, water, and carbon dioxide, but I think the coefficients might be different.\n\nLet me try to balance it again.\n\nStarting with: \\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\)\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Carbon: 1 on both sides.\n- Oxygen: 3 on the left, 3 on the right.\n- Nitrogen: 2 on both sides.\n- Hydrogen: 8 on both sides.\n\nIt seems balanced. Maybe I was wrong in thinking it was incorrect.\n\nBut wait, I recall that the decomposition of ammonium carbonate actually produces ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water, and the balanced equation is:\n\n\\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\)\n\nLet me check this:\n\nLeft side:\n- N: 2\n- H: 8\n- C: 1\n- O: 3\n\nRight side:\n- \\(2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}: 2 \\mathrm{~N}, 6 \\mathrm{H}\\)\n- \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}: 1 \\mathrm{C}, 2 \\mathrm{O}\\)\n- \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}: 2 \\mathrm{H}, 1 \\mathrm{O}\\)\n\nTotal:\n- N: 2\n- H: 8\n- C: 1\n- O: 3\n\nYes, this is also balanced. So, both equations are balanced, but they have different product ratios.\n\nIn the original equation, it shows one \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\), one \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\), and two \\(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\), while in my revised equation, it's one \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\), one \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\), and two \\(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\). Wait, they are the same.\n\nSo, perhaps the original equation is correct.\n\nBut I've seen somewhere that the decomposition produces ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water, with the coefficients being 2, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\nLet me search for the standard decomposition equation for ammonium carbonate.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the decomposition of ammonium carbonate is indeed:\n\n\\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\)\n\nAnd this is balanced as I checked earlier.\n\nSo, comparing this with the original equation:\n\n\\(\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\)\n\nThis is essentially the same as the standard equation, just with the products ordered differently.\n\nTherefore, the equation provided is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original equation has \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\) first, then \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\), and \\(2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\), whereas the standard order is \\(2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\), \\(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\). But the coefficients are the same, so the stoichiometry is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. True.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the arrow in the original equation has a \\(\\Delta\\) above it, which indicates that heat is required for the reaction, but in the standard equation, it's often omitted.\n\nBut since the lab setup includes a burner heating the ammonium carbonate, it's appropriate to include the \\(\\Delta\\) symbol to indicate heating.\n\nSo, overall, the equation accurately represents the reaction occurring in the experiment.\n\nTherefore, the content is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text { True}} \\]"
