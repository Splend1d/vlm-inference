                    "text": "Let's tackle this nutrition facts problem step by step. I've got this label for a cereal called \"Corn Crunch,\" and I need to answer a few questions based on the information provided. Here goes.\n\nFirst, question A asks me to use the data for grams of fat and calories from fat to construct a conversion factor in calories per gram. Looking at the label, for a serving size of 3/4 cup (30g), the total fat is 2g, and calories from fat are 15. So, I have 2 grams of fat providing 15 calories. To find the conversion factor, I need to figure out how many calories are in one gram of fat.\n\nLet's set up the ratio: 15 calories / 2 grams = X calories / 1 gram. Solving for X, I get X = (15 / 2) = 7.5 calories per gram. So, the conversion factor is 7.5 calories per gram.\n\nWait a minute, but the options provided are different. Option A says 7.2 Calories/g, and the others are higher. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places. The label says total fat is 2g and calories from fat are 15. Dividing 15 by 2 gives 7.5, but perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLooking back, the label might have some footnotes or additional information that could affect this. Oh, I see. There's a note that says \"Amount in Cereal: A serving of cereal plus skim milk provides 2g fat, less than 5mg cholesterol, 220mg sodium, 270mg potassium, 31g carbohydrate (19g sugars), and 6g protein.\"\n\nWait, but the main table shows values for just the cereal and for cereal with 1/2 cup skim milk. The serving size is 3/4 cup (30g), and without milk, it has 120 calories, and with milk, 160 calories.\n\nBut question A specifically says to use the data given on the label for grams of fat and calories from fat. So, for the cereal alone, it's 2g fat and 15 calories from fat.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the footnote information as well. The footnote says that a serving of cereal plus skim milk provides 2g fat, less than 5mg cholesterol, etc.\n\nHmm, I think I need to clarify what's being asked. The question says \"use the data given on the label for grams of fat and calories from fat to construct a conversion factor that has the units calories per gram.\"\n\nSo, based on the cereal alone, it's 2g fat and 15 calories from fat. So, 15 cal / 2 g = 7.5 cal/g.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have 7.5. Option A has 7.2, option B has 7.2, option C has 7.4, and option D has 7.5. Wait, option D has 7.5 Calories/g.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is option D. But let's make sure.\n\nIs there any other information that might affect this calculation? The footnote mentions that a serving of cereal plus skim milk provides certain nutrients, but the question specifies to use the data for grams of fat and calories from fat, which are given for the cereal alone.\n\nTherefore, the conversion factor is indeed 7.5 calories per gram.\n\nMoving on to question B: Calculate the mass in kilograms for 20 servings of the food.\n\nThe serving size is 3/4 cup (30g). So, one serving is 30g. For 20 servings, it would be 20 * 30g = 600g.\n\nTo convert grams to kilograms, I know that 1 kg = 1000g. So, 600g is 600 / 1000 = 0.6 kg.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 0.3 kg\n\nOption B: 0.4 kg\n\nOption C: 0.5 kg\n\nOption D: 0.6 kg\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D: 0.6 kg.\n\nNext, question C: Calculate the mass of protein in micrograms for one serving of the food.\n\nThe label shows that one serving (30g) has 2g of protein. But the question asks for the mass in micrograms.\n\nFirst, I need to convert grams to micrograms. I know that 1 gram = 1,000,000 micrograms.\n\nSo, 2 grams = 2 * 1,000,000 = 2,000,000 micrograms.\n\nTherefore, the mass of protein in micrograms for one serving is 2,000,000 \u03bcg.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 2 * 10^3 \u03bcg\n\nOption B: 2 * 10^4 \u03bcg\n\nOption C: 2 * 10^5 \u03bcg\n\nOption D: 2 * 10^6 \u03bcg\n\n2,000,000 \u03bcg is equal to 2 * 10^6 \u03bcg.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option D: 2 * 10^6 \u03bcg.\n\nFinally, question D: What is the correct number of significant figures for the answer in item A?\n\nIn item A, we calculated the conversion factor to be 7.5 calories per gram.\n\nLooking back at the label, the total fat is given as 2g, and calories from fat as 15. Both of these numbers have limited precision.\n\nThe fat is given as 2g, which has one significant figure, but calories from fat are 15, which has two significant figures.\n\nWhen dividing 15 by 2 to get 7.5, the result has two significant figures, since 15 has two sig figs and 2 has one, but in division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement.\n\nActually, I need to recall the rules for significant figures in division. The result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.\n\nHere, fat is 2g, which has one significant figure, and calories from fat are 15, which has two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the result should have one significant figure. So, 7.5 should be rounded to 8 Calories/g.\n\nWait, but none of the options reflect that. Option D has 7.5, which has two significant figures.\n\nPerhaps I'm misremembering the significance of the numbers. Let's think again.\n\nThe fat is 2g. Is that exactly 2g, or is it measured to one significant figure?\n\nLooking at the label, it says 2g, which likely means it's measured to the nearest gram, so one significant figure.\n\nCalories from fat are 15, which has two significant figures.\n\nIn multiplication and division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.\n\nSo, even though 15 has two sig figs, the fat has one, so the result should have one sig fig.\n\nThus, 7.5 should be rounded to 8 Calories/g.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D has 7.5, which is two sig figs.\n\nNone of the other options have 8 Calories/g.\n\nWait, perhaps the fat is given as 2g, but maybe it's more precise than that.\n\nLooking again, the label has a footnote that says \"Amount in Cereal: A serving of cereal plus skim milk provides 2g fat, less than 5mg cholesterol, etc.\"\n\nBut in the main table, it shows total fat as 2g for the cereal alone.\n\nMaybe the fat is more precisely 2.0g, which would have two significant figures.\n\nIf that's the case, then dividing 15 by 2.0 would give 7.5 Calories/g, with two significant figures.\n\nBut I need to confirm if the fat is indeed 2.0g or just 2g.\n\nLooking back, the label simply says \"Total Fat 2g,\" without any decimal places, so it's likely one significant figure.\n\nHowever, in nutrition labels, sometimes numbers are rounded to the nearest gram or half gram.\n\nI think for the purpose of this problem, I should assume that fat is 2g with one significant figure, and calories from fat are 15, with two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the result should have one significant figure, meaning 8 Calories/g.\n\nBut since none of the options present 8 Calories/g, and option D has 7.5, which seems to have two significant figures, perhaps the fat is 2.0g.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the label indicates that the fat is exactly 2g, and the calories from fat are 15, so the conversion factor is 7.5 Calories/g with two significant figures.\n\nGiven that, the correct number of significant figures for the answer in item A would be two.\n\nTherefore, the answer to question D is 2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 1\n\nOption B: 1\n\nOption C: 1\n\nOption D: 1\n\nWait, no, the options for question D are:\n\nA. 7.2 Calories/g;0.3 kg;2*10^3\u03bcg;1\n\nB. 7.2 Calories/g;0.4 kg;2*10^4\u03bcg;1\n\nC. 7.4 Calories/g;0.5 kg;2*10^5\u03bcg;1\n\nD. 7.5 Calories/g;0.6 kg;2*10^6\u03bcg;1\n\nSo, for question D, all options have 1, except perhaps if I consider the significance differently.\n\nBut based on my calculations, the correct answers should be:\n\nA: 7.5 Calories/g\n\nB: 0.6 kg\n\nC: 2 * 10^6 \u03bcg\n\nD: 2 (but since options have 1, perhaps it's a mistake).\n\nGiven that, I think the correct choice is option D: 7.5 Calories/g;0.6 kg;2*10^6\u03bcg;1.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about the significant figures because if fat is 2g (one sig fig) and calories from fat are 15 (two sig figs), the result should have one sig fig, which would be 8 Calories/g.\n\nBut since the label specifies 2g fat and 15 calories from fat, perhaps fat is more precisely 2.0g, making it two sig figs.\n\nIn that case, 15 / 2.0 = 7.5 Calories/g, with two sig figs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
