                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have this chemical reaction:\n\nNaBH4(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 4H2(g) + NaBO2(aq)\n\nSolid sodium borohydride is reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas and sodium metaborate. The question is asking which atoms of the reactants are oxidized and which are reduced. The options are:\n\nA. H, O\n\nB. H, Na\n\nC. H, B\n\nD. H, H\n\nFirst, I need to understand what oxidation and reduction mean. Oxidation is when an atom loses electrons, and reduction is when an atom gains electrons. To identify which atoms are being oxidized or reduced, I need to look at the changes in their oxidation states from the reactants to the products.\n\nSo, let's assign oxidation states to each atom in the reactants and products.\n\nStarting with NaBH4:\n\n- Sodium (Na) is +1\n\n- Boron (B) is +3\n\n- Hydrogen (H) is -1 (since it's bonded to a more electronegative element, boron)\n\nWait, is that right? Actually, in most compounds, hydrogen is +1, but in borohydride, it's typically -1 because boron is more electronegative than hydrogen, so hydrogen bears a negative charge.\n\nMoving on to H2O:\n\n- Hydrogen (H) is +1\n\n- Oxygen (O) is -2\n\nAnd in the products:\n\n- H2 is elemental, so each hydrogen has an oxidation state of 0\n\n- NaBO2: Sodium is +1, Boron is +3, Oxygen is -2\n\nNow, let's track the changes:\n\nFor hydrogen in NaBH4:\n\n- From -1 in NaBH4 to 0 in H2: this is an oxidation\n\nFor hydrogen in H2O:\n\n- From +1 in H2O to 0 in H2: this is a reduction\n\nFor sodium:\n\n- Remains +1 in both NaBH4 and NaBO2: no change\n\nFor boron:\n\n- From +3 in NaBH4 to +3 in NaBO2: no change\n\nFor oxygen:\n\n- From -2 in H2O to -2 in NaBO2: no change\n\nSo, based on this, the hydrogen atoms are both being oxidized (from -1 to 0) and being reduced (from +1 to 0). None of the other atoms are changing their oxidation states.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. H, O\n\nB. H, Na\n\nC. H, B\n\nD. H, H\n\nOption D seems to suggest both H atoms are being oxidized, but that's not accurate because one H is being reduced (from H2O).\n\nWait, but option A lists H and O, but oxygen isn't being oxidized or reduced; its oxidation state remains -2.\n\nOption B lists H and Na, but sodium isn't changing its oxidation state.\n\nOption C lists H and B, but boron isn't changing its oxidation state.\n\nOption D lists H, H, implying both are being oxidized, but as I saw, one is being reduced.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options are correctly identifying which atoms are being oxidized and which are being reduced.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in assigning the oxidation states.\n\nLet me double-check the oxidation states in NaBH4.\n\nIn NaBH4, sodium is +1, boron is +3, and hydrogen is -1. That seems correct.\n\nIn H2O, hydrogen is +1, oxygen is -2.\n\nIn H2, hydrogen is 0.\n\nIn NaBO2, sodium is +1, boron is +3, oxygen is -2.\n\nYes, so hydrogen in NaBH4 is being oxidized from -1 to 0, and hydrogen in H2O is being reduced from +1 to 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be that hydrogen from NaBH4 is oxidized and hydrogen from H2O is reduced.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly say that. Option D says H, H, which might imply both are being oxidized, but that's not accurate.\n\nMaybe the question is poorly phrased, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complex, and there's a transfer of electrons between different hydrogen atoms.\n\nLet's try balancing the equation to get a better understanding.\n\nNaBH4(s) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 4H2(g) + NaBO2(aq)\n\nLet's balance it:\n\nOn the left:\n\n- Na: 1\n\n- B: 1\n\n- H: 4 (from NaBH4) + 4 (from 2H2O) = 8\n\n- O: 2 (from 2H2O)\n\nOn the right:\n\n- Na: 1\n\n- B: 1\n\n- H: 4 (from 4H2)\n\n- O: 2 (from NaBO2)\n\nWait, that doesn't balance for hydrogen. On the left, we have 8 hydrogens, and on the right, 4. So, perhaps the equation is not correctly balanced.\n\nLet me try balancing it properly.\n\nLet's try:\n\nNaBH4 + 4H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2 + 2H2O\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively:\n\nNaBH4 + 4H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2 + 2H2O\n\nBut that seems redundant. Maybe the original equation is correct, and I miscounted.\n\nWait, in the original equation:\n\nNaBH4 + 2H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2\n\nLet's count atoms again:\n\nLeft side:\n\n- Na: 1\n\n- B: 1\n\n- H: 4 (from NaBH4) + 4 (from 2H2O) = 8\n\n- O: 2 (from 2H2O)\n\nRight side:\n\n- Na: 1\n\n- B: 1\n\n- H: 4 (from 4H2) + 2 (from NaBO2) = 6\n\n- O: 2 (from NaBO2)\n\nWait, that doesn't balance for hydrogen. Left side has 8 H, right side has 6 H. So, perhaps the equation should be:\n\nNaBH4 + 2H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2\n\nBut that doesn't balance hydrogen. Maybe it's:\n\nNaBH4 + 2H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2\n\nLeft side: Na(1), B(1), H(8), O(2)\n\nRight side: Na(1), B(1), H(8), O(2)\n\nWait, NaBO2 has Na(1), B(1), O(2), and 4H2 have 8 H atoms. So, yes, it balances.\n\nSo, the equation is balanced as:\n\nNaBH4 + 2H2O \u2192 4H2 + NaBO2\n\nNow, tracking oxidation states:\n\nNa: +1 to +1\n\nB: +3 to +3\n\nH in NaBH4: -1 to 0 (oxidized)\n\nH in H2O: +1 to 0 (reduced)\n\nSo, the hydrogen from NaBH4 is oxidized, and hydrogen from H2O is reduced.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. H, O\n\nB. H, Na\n\nC. H, B\n\nD. H, H\n\nNone of these exactly match what's happening. Option D suggests both H are being oxidized, but in reality, one is being oxidized and one is being reduced.\n\nPerhaps the question is misphrased, or there's a misunderstanding in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction involves multiple steps, and some hydrogens are being oxidized while others are being reduced.\n\nLet me consider the half-reactions to better understand.\n\nFirst, identify the half-reactions:\n\n1. Oxidation half-reaction:\n\nH (from NaBH4): -1 \u2192 0\n\nSo, each H loses 1 electron: H(-1) \u2192 H(0) + 1e-\n\nSince there are 4 H in NaBH4, total electrons lost: 4e-\n\n2. Reduction half-reaction:\n\nH (from H2O): +1 \u2192 0\n\nEach H gains 1 electron: H(+1) + 1e- \u2192 H(0)\n\nSince there are 4 H in 2H2O, total electrons gained: 4e-\n\nSo, the overall reaction balances with 4e- lost and 4e- gained.\n\nTherefore, the hydrogens from NaBH4 are being oxidized, and the hydrogens from H2O are being reduced.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this.\n\nOption A: H, O \u2013 but oxygen isn't being oxidized or reduced; its oxidation state remains -2.\n\nOption B: H, Na \u2013 sodium isn't changing its oxidation state.\n\nOption C: H, B \u2013 boron isn't changing its oxidation state.\n\nOption D: H, H \u2013 suggests both are being oxidized, which isn't accurate.\n\nPerhaps the question is expecting the answer C: H, B, but that's incorrect because boron isn't changing its oxidation state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer should be that hydrogen from NaBH4 is being oxidized and hydrogen from H2O is being reduced. However, none of the options reflect this accurately.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, none of them correctly identify which atoms are being oxidized and reduced in this reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
