                    "text": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem about reaction rates and determine the order of the reaction with respect to reactants A and B. The data provided shows different concentrations of A and B and the corresponding reaction rates. My goal is to find out how the rate of the reaction changes as the concentrations of A and B change.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a reaction rate law is. The rate law expresses how the rate of a chemical reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. It usually takes the form:\n\nRate = k [A]^m [B]^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- Rate is the reaction rate (in M/s, as given in the table).\n\n- k is the rate constant.\n\n- [A] and [B] are the concentrations of reactants A and B, respectively (in M).\n\n- m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to A and B, respectively.\n\nMy task is to find the values of m and n.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- When [A] is 0.08 M and [B] is 0.06 M, the rate is 0.012 M/s.\n\n- When [A] is 0.08 M and [B] is 0.03 M, the rate is 0.006 M/s.\n\n- When [A] is 0.04 M and [B] is 0.06 M, the rate is 0.003 M/s.\n\nI can use these data points to set up equations and solve for m and n.\n\nLet's start by finding the order with respect to A.\n\nI'll look at the experiments where [B] is constant and [A] changes.\n\nComparing the first and third experiments:\n\n- [A] changes from 0.08 M to 0.04 M (which is halving [A]).\n\n- [B] remains constant at 0.06 M.\n\n- The rate changes from 0.012 M/s to 0.003 M/s (which is a quarter of the original rate).\n\nSince halving [A] quarters the rate, this suggests that the order with respect to A is 2.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nIf the rate law is Rate = k [A]^2 [B]^n,\n\nThen, for the first and third experiments:\n\n0.012 = k (0.08)^2 (0.06)^n \u2026 (1)\n\n0.003 = k (0.04)^2 (0.06)^n \u2026 (2)\n\nDividing equation (1) by equation (2):\n\n0.012 / 0.003 = (0.08)^2 / (0.04)^2\n\n4 = (2)^2\n\n4 = 4\n\nThis confirms that the order with respect to A is 2.\n\nNow, let's find the order with respect to B.\n\nI'll look at the experiments where [A] is constant and [B] changes.\n\nComparing the first and second experiments:\n\n- [A] remains constant at 0.08 M.\n\n- [B] changes from 0.06 M to 0.03 M (halved).\n\n- The rate changes from 0.012 M/s to 0.006 M/s (halved).\n\nSince halving [B] halves the rate, this suggests that the order with respect to B is 1.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nUsing the rate law: Rate = k [A]^2 [B]^1\n\nFor the first experiment:\n\n0.012 = k (0.08)^2 (0.06)^1\n\n0.012 = k (0.0064) (0.06)\n\n0.012 = k (0.000384)\n\nk = 0.012 / 0.000384 = 31.25 M^{-1}s^{-1}\n\nFor the second experiment:\n\n0.006 = k (0.08)^2 (0.03)^1\n\n0.006 = k (0.0064) (0.03)\n\n0.006 = k (0.000192)\n\nk = 0.006 / 0.000192 = 31.25 M^{-1}s^{-1}\n\nFor the third experiment:\n\n0.003 = k (0.04)^2 (0.06)^1\n\n0.003 = k (0.0016) (0.06)\n\n0.003 = k (0.000096)\n\nk = 0.003 / 0.000096 = 31.25 M^{-1}s^{-1}\n\nThe consistent value of k supports that the orders are m=2 and n=1.\n\nTherefore, the reaction is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2,1\n\nB. 2,2\n\nC. 1,1\n\nD. 1,2\n\nThe correct answer is A. 2,1.\n\nI think that's it. I used the method of initial rates, compared the rates when only one reactant's concentration was changed while keeping the other constant, and determined the orders based on how the rate changed in response to those changes in concentration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
