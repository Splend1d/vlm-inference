                    "text": "Let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, I have this chemical equation:\n\n\\[4\\text{NH}_3(g) + 3\\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow 2\\text{N}_2(g) + 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l)\\]\n\nAnd I'm given that there are 3.0 moles of oxygen gas (\\(\\text{O}_2\\)). I need to find out how many moles of the other reactants and products are present based on this information. The options provided are:\n\nA. 4.0 mol of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), 3.0 mol of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), 6.0 mol of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\)\n\nB. 4.0 mol of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), 1.0 mol of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), 6.0 mol of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\)\n\nC. 4.0 mol of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), 2.0 mol of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), 6.0 mol of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this equation is telling me. It shows that 4 moles of ammonia (\\(\\text{NH}_3\\)) react with 3 moles of oxygen (\\(\\text{O}_2\\)) to produce 2 moles of nitrogen (\\(\\text{N}_2\\)) and 6 moles of water (\\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\)).\n\nSo, the stoichiometry of the reaction is:\n\n- 4 moles \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) : 3 moles \\(\\text{O}_2\\) : 2 moles \\(\\text{N}_2\\) : 6 moles \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\)\n\nI'm given 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), and I need to find the corresponding moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), \\(\\text{N}_2\\), and \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\).\n\nLet's start by finding out how much \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) is required to react with 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\).\n\nFrom the equation, 3 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\) react with 4 moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\). So, if I have 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), I should need 4.0 moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\).\n\nWait a minute, but the options all have 4.0 moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), so that seems consistent.\n\nNext, I need to find out how much \\(\\text{N}_2\\) is produced from 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\).\n\nAgain, from the equation, 3 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\) produce 2 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\). So, with 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), I should get 2.0 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\).\n\nLooking at the options, option C has 2.0 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), which seems correct.\n\nFinally, I need to check the moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) produced.\n\nThe equation shows that 3 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\) produce 6 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\). So, with 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), I should get 6.0 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\).\n\nAll options have 6.0 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\), so that seems fine.\n\nWait, but options A, B, and C all have 6.0 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\), but differ in the moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\). According to my calculation, it should be 2.0 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), which matches option C.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe reaction is balanced as:\n\n\\[4\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{N}_2 + 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\]\n\nSo, for every 3 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), you get 2 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\) and 6 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\).\n\nTherefore, if you have 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), you should indeed get 2.0 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\) and 6.0 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\), provided that there is enough \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) to react with the \\(\\text{O}_2\\).\n\nIn this case, since all options show 4.0 moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), which is exactly what is required for 3.0 moles of \\(\\text{O}_2\\), there is no excess or deficiency of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: 4.0 mol of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), 2.0 mol of \\(\\text{N}_2\\), 6.0 mol of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\).\n\nBut let's confirm if there's any trick here.\n\nThe question says, \"determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products\". Given that, and assuming that the reaction goes to completion, the remaining amounts should be the products formed and any reactants that didn't react.\n\nIn this case, since the amounts of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) and \\(\\text{O}_2\\) are in the exact stoichiometric ratio, the reaction should go to completion, meaning all \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) and \\(\\text{O}_2\\) are consumed to form the products.\n\nTherefore, no reactants are left, and the only remaining substances are the products: 2.0 moles of \\(\\text{N}_2\\) and 6.0 moles of \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\).\n\nWait a second, but option C lists 4.0 moles of \\(\\text{NH}_3\\), which should be completely consumed if the reaction goes to completion. So, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products: 3.0 mol O2\"\n\nHmm, actually, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It seems like it's asking, given 3.0 mol of O2, to determine the moles of all remaining reactants and products, but it's not specifying initial amounts or whether the reaction has partially proceeded.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that we have initial amounts of reactants, including 3.0 mol of O2, and we need to find the moles of all reactants and products after the reaction has proceeded as much as possible.\n\nBut without knowing the initial amounts of the other reactants, it's tricky to determine the final amounts accurately.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's message:\n\n\"Given this chemical equation, as well as the number of moles of the reactant or product indicated below, determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products: 3.0 mol O2\"\n\nIt seems like the only given is 3.0 mol of O2, and we need to determine the moles of all remaining reactants and products based on that.\n\nThis is unclear because we need to know at least one initial amount to determine the others.\n\nMaybe the assumption is that we have excess of all other reactants, meaning that the limiting reagent is O2.\n\nIf that's the case, then with 3.0 mol of O2 reacting completely, we would need 4.0 mol of NH3 (as per the stoichiometry), and produce 2.0 mol of N2 and 6.0 mol of H2O.\n\nBut the question says \"the number of moles of the reactant or product indicated below: 3.0 mol O2\"\n\nIt might be that O2 is one of the reactants or products, and we need to consider its role in the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3.0 mol O2 is the remaining amount after the reaction, meaning that some O2 was consumed.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to rephrase it.\n\nSuppose we have initial amounts of NH3 and O2, and the reaction proceeds to form N2 and H2O.\n\nIf we know the amount of one reactant or product after the reaction, say O2, which is 3.0 mol, we can work backwards to find the initial amounts and then determine the final amounts of all components.\n\nBut without knowing if O2 is a reactant or a product in this context, it's challenging.\n\nGiven that O2 is a reactant in the equation, and it's being consumed, if we have 3.0 mol of O2 remaining, that means some O2 was consumed to form products.\n\nLet's assume that initially, there was a certain amount of O2, some of which was consumed, and 3.0 mol remained.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Initial moles of O2: x\n\n- Moles of O2 consumed: y\n\n- Moles of O2 remaining: x - y = 3.0 mol\n\nSimilarly, for NH3:\n\n- Initial moles of NH3: a\n\n- Moles of NH3 consumed: b\n\n- Moles of NH3 remaining: a - b\n\nAnd for products:\n\n- Moles of N2 produced: c\n\n- Moles of H2O produced: d\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n\\[4\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{N}_2 + 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\]\n\nThe stoichiometric ratios are:\n\n- 4 moles NH3 : 3 moles O2 : 2 moles N2 : 6 moles H2O\n\nTherefore:\n\n- b / 4 = y / 3 = c / 2 = d / 6\n\nLet\u2019s denote this common ratio as k:\n\n\\[b = 4k\\]\\[y = 3k\\]\\[c = 2k\\]\\[d = 6k\\]\n\nGiven that y = 3k and x - y = 3.0 mol, we can write:\n\n\\[x - 3k = 3.0\\]\n\nBut without knowing x, the initial amount of O2, we can't solve for k directly.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem expects us to assume that O2 is a product, but that doesn't make sense given the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3.0 mol O2 is the amount consumed, not the remaining amount.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the reaction is at equilibrium or that there are excess reactants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that we have initial amounts of NH3 and O2, and we're supposed to find the final amounts of all species after the reaction has proceeded based on the stoichiometry.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, it seems that the initial amount of NH3 is 4.0 mol, and O2 is 3.0 mol, leading to the production of 2.0 mol N2 and 6.0 mol H2O, with no remaining reactants.\n\nBut option C lists 4.0 mol NH3, which would imply that all NH3 is consumed, but that contradicts the option stating 4.0 mol NH3 remaining.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are listing the remaining amounts after the reaction.\n\nIf that's the case, and if we start with 4.0 mol NH3 and 3.0 mol O2, then after the reaction, since both are completely consumed (as per the stoichiometry), there should be no remaining reactants, only the products: 2.0 mol N2 and 6.0 mol H2O.\n\nBut option C lists 4.0 mol NH3 remaining, which doesn't make sense if all are consumed.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial amount of NH3 is more than 4.0 mol, and some remains after the reaction.\n\nBut the options all list 4.0 mol NH3, which implies that no NH3 is consumed, which contradicts the reaction.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet's consider that the reaction has proceeded to consume some O2, and 3.0 mol O2 remain.\n\nIf 3.0 mol O2 remain, that means that some O2 was consumed to produce N2 and H2O.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Moles of O2 consumed: y\n\n- Moles of NH3 consumed: b\n\n- Moles of N2 produced: c\n\n- Moles of H2O produced: d\n\nFrom the stoichiometry:\n\n\\[b / 4 = y / 3 = c / 2 = d / 6\\]\n\nLet\u2019s set y = 3k, then b = 4k, c = 2k, d = 6k\n\nGiven that O2 remaining is 3.0 mol, then initial O2 was y + 3.0 mol = 3k + 3.0 mol\n\nBut without knowing the initial amount of O2, we can't solve for k.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem is incomplete or missing information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3.0 mol O2 is the amount consumed, not the remaining amount.\n\nIf that's the case, then y = 3.0 mol, so k = 1.0 mol, and thus:\n\n- b = 4k = 4.0 mol\n\n- c = 2k = 2.0 mol\n\n- d = 6k = 6.0 mol\n\nAnd if initial O2 was y + remaining O2 = 3.0 mol + x mol = ?\n\nBut again, without knowing the initial amount of O2, this doesn't help.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should look at the options and see which one makes sense.\n\nOption C lists 4.0 mol NH3, 2.0 mol N2, and 6.0 mol H2O.\n\nIf we assume that the initial amounts are 4.0 mol NH3 and 3.0 mol O2, and the reaction proceeds completely, then:\n\n- NH3 consumed: 4.0 mol\n\n- O2 consumed: 3.0 mol\n\n- N2 produced: 2.0 mol\n\n- H2O produced: 6.0 mol\n\nTherefore, the remaining amounts would be:\n\n- NH3: 0 mol\n\n- O2: 0 mol\n\n- N2: 2.0 mol\n\n- H2O: 6.0 mol\n\nBut option C lists 4.0 mol NH3, which doesn't match this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, if only part of the O2 reacts, say y mol, then:\n\n- O2 remaining: 3.0 mol - y mol\n\n- NH3 consumed: (4/3)y mol\n\n- N2 produced: (2/3)y mol\n\n- H2O produced: 2y mol\n\nBut without knowing y, I can't proceed further.\n\nThis is too ambiguous. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem.\n\nSuppose we have a reaction where ammonia reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen and water, as per the equation:\n\n\\[4\\text{NH}_3 + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{N}_2 + 6\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\]\n\nWe are given that there are 3.0 moles of oxygen gas (\\(\\text{O}_2\\)), and we need to determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products.\n\nAssuming that the reaction goes to completion, and that there is enough ammonia to react with all the oxygen, then:\n\n- 3.0 mol O2 react with 4.0 mol NH3 to produce 2.0 mol N2 and 6.0 mol H2O.\n\nTherefore, the remaining amounts would be:\n\n- NH3: 0 mol (completely consumed)\n\n- O2: 0 mol (completely consumed)\n\n- N2: 2.0 mol\n\n- H2O: 6.0 mol\n\nBut none of the options show 0 mol for NH3 and O2.\n\nOption C shows 4.0 mol NH3, 2.0 mol N2, and 6.0 mol H2O, implying that no O2 is remaining, but NH3 is still present.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps NH3 is in excess, and only part of it has reacted.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that possibility.\n\nIf NH3 is in excess, then O2 is the limiting reagent.\n\nGiven that, 3.0 mol O2 will react with 4.0 mol NH3 to produce 2.0 mol N2 and 6.0 mol H2O.\n\nBut if NH3 is in excess, meaning there is more than 4.0 mol NH3 initially, then after the reaction, some NH3 will remain.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the initial amount of NH3 as 'a' moles.\n\nThen, moles of NH3 consumed = 4.0 mol\n\nMoles of NH3 remaining = a - 4.0 mol\n\nGiven that a > 4.0 mol, NH3 remains after the reaction.\n\nSimilarly, O2 is completely consumed: 3.0 mol O2 reacted, so 0 mol remaining.\n\nProducts formed: 2.0 mol N2 and 6.0 mol H2O.\n\nBut in option C, it shows 4.0 mol NH3 remaining, which would imply that a = 8.0 mol NH3 initially.\n\nWait:\n\nIf a = 8.0 mol NH3, then consumed = 4.0 mol, remaining = 4.0 mol.\n\nBut the options don't list O2 as remaining, which makes sense since it's completely consumed.\n\nHowever, the question says \"determine the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products\", and lists only NH3, N2, and H2O, implying that O2 is completely consumed.\n\nTherefore, if we have 4.0 mol NH3 remaining,"
