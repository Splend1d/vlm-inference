                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a block weighing 5.0 N that's dropping from a height of 200 mm onto a spring with a stiffness of 90 N/m. I need to find out the maximum shortening of the spring because of this impact. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There's a cylinder with a block inside it, and this block is dropping onto a spring that's fixed at the bottom. The height from which the block is dropping is 200 mm, which is 0.2 meters, and the spring has a stiffness of 90 N/m. The weight of the block is 5.0 N, so from that, I can find its mass. Wait, weight is force, which is mass times acceleration due to gravity, right? So, W = mg. Therefore, m = W/g. Given that g is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2, then m = 5.0 N / 9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 0.51 kg. Okay, that's good to know.\n\nNow, when the block drops from a height of 0.2 meters, it gains potential energy, which will be converted into kinetic energy as it falls, and then into potential energy in the spring when it compresses the spring. So, the total energy before and after the impact should be conserved, assuming no energy is lost to friction or anything like that.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"impact,\" which makes me think that maybe there's some energy loss during the impact. However, if we assume that the impact is perfectly elastic and all the energy is conserved, then we can use conservation of energy to find the maximum compression of the spring.\n\nLet's consider the initial potential energy of the block at height h. That's mgh. Then, when it drops and just before it hits the spring, it has kinetic energy equal to that potential energy. Once it hits the spring, the spring starts compressing, and the kinetic energy gets transferred to potential energy in the spring.\n\nSo, the total energy before dropping is just the potential energy at height h, which is mgh. After dropping, just before hitting the spring, it's all kinetic energy, (1/2)mv\u00b2. Then, as the spring compresses by a distance x, the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kx\u00b2, and the block has potential energy mg(h + x), assuming the spring compresses further by x from the point where the block first touches the spring.\n\nWait a minute, I need to set my reference point clearly. Let's set the reference point for potential energy at the bottom, where the spring is fixed. So, initially, the block is at height h above the bottom, so its potential energy is mgh. When it drops, it gains kinetic energy, and when it hits the spring, it starts compressing the spring.\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy should be conserved:\n\nInitial potential energy = Final potential energy in the spring + Final potential energy of the block + Final kinetic energy\n\nWait, but at the point of maximum compression, the velocity should be zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\nInitial potential energy = Final potential energy in the spring + Final potential energy of the block\n\nSo, mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h + x)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If I set the reference at the bottom, then the final height would be h minus the compression x, right? Let me think again.\n\nActually, when the spring is compressed by x, the block is at a height of h - x above the bottom. So, the potential energy of the block is mg(h - x). And the potential energy in the spring is (1/2)kx\u00b2. So, at maximum compression, the block has no kinetic energy, so:\n\nInitial potential energy = Final potential energy in the spring + Final potential energy of the block\n\nSo, mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nNow, that seems correct. So, let's plug in the values.\n\nFirst, m = 0.51 kg\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nh = 0.2 m\n\nk = 90 N/m\n\nSo, mgh = 0.51 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 0.2 m \u2248 1.0 J\n\nThen, at maximum compression, (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x) = 1.0 J\n\nSo, (1/2)*90*x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x) = 1.0\n\nSimplify:\n\n45x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x) = 1.0\n\nCalculate 0.51*9.81 \u2248 4.9991 N\n\nSo, 45x\u00b2 + 4.9991*(0.2 - x) = 1.0\n\nCalculate 4.9991*0.2 \u2248 0.99982\n\nSo, 45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x + 0.99982 = 1.0\n\nSubtract 1.0 from both sides:\n\n45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x - 0.00018 \u2248 0\n\nHmm, that seems almost like 45x\u00b2 - 5x \u2248 1.0\n\nBut let's solve it properly.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the equation.\n\nWe have mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nPlugging in mgh \u2248 1.0 J\n\nSo, 1.0 = (1/2)*90*x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x)\n\nCalculate (1/2)*90 = 45\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x)\n\n0.51*9.81 \u2248 4.9991\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 4.9991*(0.2 - x)\n\nExpand 4.9991*(0.2 - x) = 0.99982 - 4.9991x\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.99982 - 4.9991x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n45x\u00b2 + (-4.9991)x + (0.99982 - 1.0) = 0\n\nSo, 45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x - 0.00018 \u2248 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0\n\nWith a = 45, b = -4.9991, c = -0.00018\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-4.9991)\u00b2 - 4*45*(-0.00018)\n\nCalculate (-4.9991)\u00b2 \u2248 24.99100081\n\nCalculate 4*45*(-0.00018) = 180*(-0.00018) = -0.0324\n\nSo, D \u2248 24.99100081 - (-0.0324) = 24.99100081 + 0.0324 \u2248 25.02340081\n\nNow, sqrt(D) \u2248 sqrt(25.02340081) \u2248 5.00234\n\nNow, x = [4.9991 \u00b1 5.00234] / (2*45)\n\nFirst, 4.9991 + 5.00234 \u2248 10.00144\n\nThen, 10.00144 / 90 \u2248 0.111127 m \u2248 111.127 mm\n\nSecond, 4.9991 - 5.00234 \u2248 -0.00324\n\n-0.00324 / 90 \u2248 -0.000036 m \u2248 -0.036 mm\n\nObviously, the negative value doesn't make sense in this context, so the maximum compression is approximately 111.127 mm.\n\nBut wait, none of the options are close to this. Option A is 114.64mm, which is close, but not exactly matching.\n\nDid I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, m = W/g = 5.0 N / 9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 0.51 kg \u2192 correct\n\nmgh = 0.51 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 * 0.2 m \u2248 1.0 J \u2192 correct\n\nEnergy equation: mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x) \u2192 correct\n\nPlugging in numbers: 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x) \u2192 correct\n\n0.51*9.81 \u2248 4.9991 N \u2192 correct\n\n1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 4.9991*(0.2 - x) \u2192 correct\n\n4.9991*(0.2 - x) = 0.99982 - 4.9991x \u2192 correct\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.99982 - 4.9991x \u2192 correct\n\nBring all terms to one side: 45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x + (0.99982 - 1.0) = 0 \u2192 correct\n\na = 45, b = -4.9991, c = -0.00018 \u2192 correct\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-4.9991)\u00b2 - 4*45*(-0.00018) \u2192 correct\n\n(-4.9991)\u00b2 \u2248 24.99100081 \u2192 correct\n\n4*45*(-0.00018) = 180*(-0.00018) = -0.0324 \u2192 correct\n\nD \u2248 24.99100081 + 0.0324 \u2248 25.02340081 \u2192 correct\n\nsqrt(D) \u2248 5.00234 \u2192 correct\n\nx = [4.9991 \u00b1 5.00234]/90 \u2192 correct\n\n(4.9991 + 5.00234)/90 \u2248 10.00144/90 \u2248 0.111127 m \u2248 111.127 mm \u2192 correct\n\nBut option A is 114.64mm, which is close but not exact. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nLet me use more precise values.\n\nGiven:\n\nW = 5.0 N\n\nh = 200 mm = 0.2 m\n\nk = 90 N/m\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nm = W/g = 5.0 / 9.81 \u2248 0.51 kg\n\nmgh = 0.51 * 9.81 * 0.2 \u2248 1.0 J\n\nEnergy equation: mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x)\n\nCalculate 0.51*9.81*(0.2 - x) = 0.51*9.81*0.2 - 0.51*9.81*x \u2248 0.99982 - 4.9991x\n\nSo, 1.0 = 45x\u00b2 + 0.99982 - 4.9991x\n\nBring all terms to one side: 45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x + (0.99982 - 1.0) = 0 \u2192 45x\u00b2 - 4.9991x - 0.00018 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\na = 45\n\nb = -4.9991\n\nc = -0.00018\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-4.9991)\u00b2 - 4*45*(-0.00018) = 24.99100081 + 0.0324 = 25.02340081\n\nsqrt(D) \u2248 5.0023399\n\nx = [4.9991 \u00b1 5.0023399]/90\n\nFirst solution: (4.9991 + 5.0023399)/90 \u2248 10.00144/90 \u2248 0.111127 m \u2248 111.127 mm\n\nSecond solution: (4.9991 - 5.0023399)/90 \u2248 (-0.00323)/90 \u2248 -0.000036 m \u2248 -0.036 mm (discard)\n\nSo, x \u2248 111.127 mm\n\nBut this is not matching with option A, which is 114.64mm. Maybe there's something wrong with my approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the velocity just before the block hits the spring and then use the conservation of energy from that point.\n\nInitial potential energy at height h is mgh = 1.0 J\n\nThis converts to kinetic energy just before hitting the spring:\n\n(1/2)mv\u00b2 = 1.0 J\n\nSo, v = sqrt(2*1.0 / m) = sqrt(2*1.0 / 0.51) \u2248 sqrt(4.0 / 0.51) \u2248 sqrt(7.8431) \u2248 2.8 m/s\n\nNow, when the block hits the spring, it compresses the spring. At maximum compression, the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential energy is stored in the spring and the gravitational potential energy.\n\nSo, (1/2)mv\u00b2 + mgh' + (1/2)kx\u00b2 = constant\n\nBut h' is the height from the bottom at maximum compression, which is h - x.\n\nWait, no. The block drops from h, gains kinetic energy, hits the spring, compresses it by x, and at maximum compression, its height is h - x.\n\nSo, at maximum compression:\n\nPotential energy in spring: (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nPotential energy of block: mgh' = mg(h - x)\n\nTotal energy: (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nThis should equal the initial potential energy, mgh.\n\nWait, no. The initial potential energy is mgh, and just before hitting the spring, it's all kinetic energy, (1/2)mv\u00b2.\n\nBut if we consider the entire process from initial position to maximum compression, the initial potential energy should equal the sum of the potential energy in the spring and the potential energy of the block at maximum compression.\n\nSo, mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nWhich is the same equation I had before.\n\nSo, solving for x gives approximately 111.127 mm, which is close to option A but not exactly matching.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the force balance at the point where the spring force equals the weight of the block.\n\nAt equilibrium position, the spring force equals the weight:\n\nkx = mg\n\nx_eq = mg / k = (0.51 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2) / 90 N/m \u2248 0.05 m = 50 mm\n\nBut this is the equilibrium position, not the maximum compression.\n\nThe maximum compression should be greater than this equilibrium extension.\n\nWait, no. Since the spring is being compressed, the maximum compression should be greater than the equilibrium compression.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the spring is being compressed, so the equilibrium position is when the spring force equals the weight.\n\nSo, at equilibrium:\n\nkx = mg\n\nx = mg / k = 0.51*9.81 / 90 \u2248 0.05 m = 50 mm\n\nBut this is only the static compression. The block is dropping and has kinetic energy, which will cause further compression beyond this equilibrium point.\n\nSo, maybe I need to consider the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\nAt equilibrium, the spring is compressed by x = mg/k = 50 mm, and the block has some kinetic energy due to its fall.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the conservation of energy up to the equilibrium point and then find the additional compression beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the conservation of energy directly from the initial position to the maximum compression, considering that at maximum compression, all the initial potential energy is stored in the spring and the gravitational potential energy at that point.\n\nSo, mgh = (1/2)kx\u00b2 + mg(h - x)\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the work-energy principle, where the work done by the spring equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nBut I think the energy conservation approach is correct; perhaps my calculations are off.\n\nLet me try recalculating with more precision.\n\nGiven:\n\nm = 0.51 kg\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\n"
