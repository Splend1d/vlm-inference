                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two steel plates being attached by fillet welds, and I need to figure out the maximum tensile load that can be applied with a certain safety factor. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given information:\n\n- We have two steel plates connected by fillet welds.\n\n- The yield strength (Sy) of the steel is 50 ksi (kilopounds per square inch).\n\n- The welding rods used are E60 series, and they have a diameter (A) of 0.375 inches.\n\n- There are two welds, each 3 inches long.\n\n- The safety factor (SF) is 3.\n\n- The welds are parallel-loaded fillet welds.\n\nMy goal is to find the maximum tensile load that can be applied, considering these welds and the safety factor.\n\nOkay, starting with the basics. I recall that for fillet welds, the strength is typically calculated based on the throat thickness and the length of the weld. The throat thickness for a fillet weld is generally the size of the weld, which in this case is 3/8 inches (since it's mentioned as 3/8-in. fillet welds).\n\nWait, the problem says \"3/8-in. parallel-loaded fillet welds,\" so the weld size is 3/8 inches, which is 0.375 inches. That matches the diameter of the welding rods, so that makes sense.\n\nNow, the effective throat thickness (t) for a fillet weld is usually the sine of 45 degrees times the weld size, because the fillet weld is roughly a right triangle. So, t = 0.707 * A, where A is the weld size.\n\nGiven that, t = 0.707 * 0.375 inches.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.707 * 0.375 = 0.265125 inches.\n\nSo, the throat thickness is approximately 0.265 inches.\n\nNext, I need to find the shear stress allowable for the weld. The shear stress (\u03c4) is generally related to the yield strength of the material. For welding, often the allowable shear stress is based on the yield strength divided by some factor.\n\nI recall that for welding, the allowable shear stress is sometimes taken as 0.6 times the yield strength, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up, but since this is a problem-solving exercise, perhaps I can proceed with some assumptions.\n\nGiven that the welding rods are E60 series, I believe E60 refers to the electrode type, and the number indicates the tensile strength in thousands of psi. So, E60 would have a tensile strength of 60 ksi.\n\nBut in this problem, the plates have a yield strength of 50 ksi, and the welding rods have a tensile strength of 60 ksi. I think the weaker material will govern the design, so probably the plates' yield strength is the limiting factor.\n\nWait, but we're dealing with the welds, which are made of the welding rod material. So, perhaps I need to consider the yield strength of the weld metal, which for E60 rods is typically around 50 ksi to 65 ksi, I think.\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should consider the minimum yield strength of the weld metal, which for E60 rods is 50 ksi.\n\nSo, assuming the weld metal has a yield strength of 50 ksi, similar to the base metal.\n\nNow, the safety factor is given as 3. So, the allowable stress in the weld would be the yield strength divided by the safety factor, which is 50 ksi / 3 = approximately 16.667 ksi.\n\nBut wait, that's in tension. For shear, I think we need to use a different factor. I recall that for welds, the allowable shear stress is often taken as 0.6 times the base metal's tensile strength or the weld metal's tensile strength, depending on the governing criteria.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider the formula for the shear capacity of a fillet weld:\n\nShear capacity (V) = \u03c4 * A_s\n\nWhere \u03c4 is the allowable shear stress, and A_s is the shear area.\n\nThe shear area for a fillet weld is the throat thickness times the length of the weld.\n\nSo, A_s = t * L\n\nGiven that there are two welds, each 3 inches long, the total length is 6 inches.\n\nSo, total shear area is t * 6 inches.\n\nNow, I need to find \u03c4, the allowable shear stress.\n\nFrom the Handbook of Steel Construction, 9th edition, by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), I recall that for fillet welds in shear, the allowable stress is based on the lesser of 0.3 times the specified minimum tensile strength of the base metal or 0.6 times the specified minimum tensile strength of the weld metal.\n\nGiven that, for E60 rods, the specified minimum tensile strength is 60 ksi.\n\nThe base metal has a yield strength of 50 ksi, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nWait, the base metal's yield strength is 50 ksi, but the weld metal's tensile strength is 60 ksi.\n\nSo, the lesser of:\n\n1. 0.3 * base metal's specified minimum tensile strength.\n\nBut I don't know the base metal's specified minimum tensile strength. Maybe I need to assume it's higher than the yield strength.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the weld metal's tensile strength.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the load-carrying capacity of the welds.\n\nThe load-carrying capacity can be calculated as:\n\nLoad = Shear stress * Area\n\nWhere Area = throat thickness * total length of welds.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine the allowable shear stress.\n\nFrom the AISC Handbook, for fillet welds in shear, the allowable shear stress is the lesser of:\n\n- 0.3 * F_u, where F_u is the specified minimum tensile strength of the base metal.\n\n- Or 0.6 * F_w, where F_w is the specified minimum tensile strength of the weld metal.\n\nGiven that, for E60 rods, F_w is 60 ksi.\n\nThe base metal's F_u, I don't know, but since the yield strength is 50 ksi, and typically F_u is higher than F_y, maybe F_u is 50 ksi or higher.\n\nWait, for A36 steel, which is common, F_y is 36 ksi and F_u is 58 ksi.\n\nBut in this problem, the plates have Sy = 50 ksi. Maybe it's a higher grade steel.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base metal's F_u is 60 ksi, same as the weld metal.\n\nI'm making assumptions here, which might not be accurate.\n\nMaybe I should consider the weld metal's properties.\n\nGiven that the weld metal is E60, with a tensile strength of 60 ksi, perhaps I can take the allowable shear stress as 0.6 * 60 ksi = 36 ksi.\n\nThen, the load capacity would be:\n\nLoad = \u03c4 * A_s = 36 ksi * (0.265 in * 6 in) = 36 ksi * 1.59 in\u00b2 = 57.24 kips.\n\nBut that seems too high, and the safety factor is only 3, but I think I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the effective length of the welds.\n\nI recall that for fillet welds in shear, the effective length might be less than the actual length, sometimes reduced by the size of the weld.\n\nBut in this case, since the welds are parallel-loaded, maybe the full length is effective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the weld efficiency or some other factors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the formula for the allowable load based on the weld size, length, and the safety factor.\n\nGiven that the weld size is 0.375 inches, throat thickness is 0.265 inches, and total weld length is 6 inches.\n\nIf I take the allowable shear stress as 36 ksi, then:\n\nLoad = 36 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in = 36 * 1.59 = 57.24 kips.\n\nBut 57.24 kips is 57,240 pounds, which is way higher than any of the options provided.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm doing something wrong.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the yield strength of the base metal or the weld metal in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowable shear stress is based on the yield strength divided by the safety factor.\n\nGiven that the yield strength of the weld metal is 50 ksi (assuming same as base metal), then allowable stress = 50 ksi / 3 \u2248 16.667 ksi.\n\nThen, Load = 16.667 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in \u2248 16.667 * 1.59 \u2248 26.4 kips, which is 26,400 pounds.\n\nStill higher than the options provided.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the welds are in double shear.\n\nWait, are these welds in double shear? From the diagram, it looks like the loads are applied in tension, and the welds are in single shear.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the welds are in shear and tension simultaneously, but the problem specifies parallel-loaded fillet welds, so maybe only shear.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFrom the AISC Handbook, for fillet welds in shear, the allowable shear stress is 0.3 * F_u for the base metal, or 0.6 * F_w for the weld metal, whichever is less.\n\nGiven that, and assuming F_w is 60 ksi, and F_u for the base metal is unknown, but probably higher than the yield strength of 50 ksi.\n\nSo, 0.3 * F_u base metal vs. 0.6 * 60 ksi.\n\nIf F_u base metal is 60 ksi, then 0.3 * 60 = 18 ksi, which is less than 0.6 * 60 = 36 ksi.\n\nSo, the controlling allowable shear stress would be 18 ksi.\n\nThen, Load = 18 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in = 18 * 1.59 = 28.62 kips, which is 28,620 pounds.\n\nStill higher than the options.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nPerhaps the safety factor applies differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the weld's cross-sectional area in shear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowable load is based on the weld's throat area multiplied by the allowable stress.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with what I've been doing.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the efficiency of the weld or some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the allowable stress is different.\n\nLet me check the AISC Handbook again.\n\nAccording to the AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings, the allowable shear stress for fillet welds is the lesser of:\n\n- 0.3 * F_u base metal\n\n- Or 0.6 * F_w weld metal\n\nGiven that, and assuming F_w is 60 ksi, and F_u base metal is 60 ksi (since Sy is 50 ksi, and F_u is typically higher), then 0.3 * 60 = 18 ksi.\n\nSo, allowable shear stress is 18 ksi.\n\nThen, Load = 18 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in = 18 * 1.59 = 28.62 kips = 28,620 pounds.\n\nBut the options are much lower, around 12,000 to 15,000 pounds.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that I'm missing a crucial step.\n\nPerhaps the weld size is not directly the throat thickness, but something else.\n\nWait, the weld size is 0.375 inches, and the throat thickness is 0.265 inches.\n\nBut maybe the effective throat thickness is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weld's cross-sectional area needs to be calculated differently.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for the throat thickness.\n\nFor a fillet weld, the throat thickness is indeed t = (A / sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the included angle of the weld.\n\nAssuming a standard fillet weld with \u03b8 = 45 degrees, then t = A / sin(45) = 0.375 / 0.7071 \u2248 0.265 inches.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weld is not a standard fillet weld, and the throat thickness calculation is different.\n\nBut the problem specifies parallel-loaded fillet welds, so I think the standard throat thickness calculation applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the welds are in double shear, and I need to account for that.\n\nIf the welds are in double shear, then the effective length would be half of the actual length, or something like that.\n\nBut from the diagram, it looks like the welds are in single shear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the load is distributed over both welds, so I need to divide the total load by two.\n\nWait, there are two welds, each 3 inches long, so total weld length is 6 inches.\n\nBut if the load is applied to both plates, perhaps the total load is shared between the two welds.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the load is only carried by one weld, and the other is just for support.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to use the formula for the allowable load based on the weld size and the allowable shear stress.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the allowable shear stress is 18 ksi, as calculated earlier, then:\n\nLoad = allowable stress * throat area = 18 ksi * (0.265 in * 6 in) = 28.62 kips = 28,620 pounds.\n\nBut since this is much higher than the options provided, maybe I need to consider the actual tensile load capacity of the plates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the welds are not the limiting factor, and the plates themselves will yield before the welds fail.\n\nBut the problem asks for the maximum tensile load based on the welds with a safety factor of 3.\n\nSo, I think the welds are the critical component here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the effective area of the welds in tension.\n\nWait, but the welds are in shear, and the plates are in tension.\n\nSo, the welds are resisting the shear force caused by the tension in the plates.\n\nIn that case, the shear force in the welds would be equal to the tension force divided by the number of welds.\n\nGiven that, if there are two welds, each 3 inches long, and the load is shared equally, then each weld would carry half of the total tension force.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total shear force in the welds is equal to the tension force.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the welds are in shear, and the plates are in tension.\n\nThis is really confusing.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the weld's capacity in shear per inch of length, and then multiply by the total length.\n\nGiven that, and considering the safety factor, I can find the allowable load.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard formula for this type of configuration.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates the weld size, length, and allowable stress to the allowable load.\n\nFrom some references, I recall that for fillet welds in shear, the allowable shear load per inch of weld length is given by:\n\nAllowable load per inch = allowable shear stress * throat thickness\n\nThen, total allowable load = allowable load per inch * total weld length\n\nGiven that, with allowable shear stress of 18 ksi, throat thickness of 0.265 inches, and total weld length of 6 inches:\n\nAllowable load = 18 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in = 28.62 kips = 28,620 pounds.\n\nAgain, this is higher than the options provided.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowable shear stress is lower than what I've assumed.\n\nLet me check the AISC Specification again.\n\nAccording to the AISC Specification, for fillet welds in shear, the allowable shear stress is the lesser of:\n\n- 0.3 * specified minimum tensile strength of the base metal (F_u base metal)\n\n- Or 0.6 * specified minimum tensile strength of the weld metal (F_w)\n\nGiven that, and assuming F_w is 60 ksi, and F_u base metal is 60 ksi (since Sy is 50 ksi, and F_u is typically higher), then 0.3 * 60 = 18 ksi.\n\nAlternatively, if F_u base metal is higher than 60 ksi, then 0.3 * F_u would be higher, but since F_w is 60 ksi, 0.6 * 60 = 36 ksi, which is higher than 0.3 * F_u unless F_u is very high.\n\nSo, the controlling allowable shear stress should be 18 ksi.\n\nBut as I calculated earlier, this leads to an allowable load of 28.62 kips, which is higher than the options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the safety factor differently.\n\nWait, the problem states that the safety factor is 3, but I've already used that to determine the allowable stress.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safety factor applies to the ultimate load, not the allowable stress.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to find the ultimate shear load and then divide by the safety factor to get the allowable load.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the allowable stress is based on the yield strength divided by the safety factor.\n\nGiven that, Sy weld metal is 50 ksi, then allowable stress = 50 ksi / 3 \u2248 16.667 ksi.\n\nThen, allowable load = 16.667 ksi * 0.265 in * 6 in \u2248 26.4 kips = 26,400 pounds.\n\nStill higher than the options.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the welds are in double shear.\n\nIf the welds are in double shear, then the effective length would be half of the actual length.\n\nSo, effective length = 6 in / 2 = 3 in.\n\nThen, allowable load = 16.6"
