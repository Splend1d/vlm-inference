                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a quarter-circle gate that's 10 feet wide and hinged at point B. It's keeping water back, and there's a force F applied at point A, which is the top of the gate. We need to find the magnitude of this force F that just prevents the gate from opening. Additionally, the gate itself weighs 3000 lbf.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces acting on the gate. There's the weight of the gate, which is acting downward, and the force F applied downward at point A. There's also the hydrostatic pressure from the water, which increases with depth. Since the gate is a quarter circle with a radius of 8 feet, the depth of the water varies from 0 at the top to 8 feet at the bottom.\n\nI recall that the hydrostatic force on a curved surface can be complex to calculate directly, so maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem using principles of equilibrium, particularly considering moments about the hinge point B.\n\nLet me start by drawing a free-body diagram in my mind. We have the gate hinged at B, with force F at A, the weight of the gate acting at its centroid, and the resultant hydrostatic force due to the water pressure.\n\nThe gate is a quarter circle, so its centroid is located at a distance of 4r/3\u03c0 from the center for both the x and y coordinates. Given r = 8 ft, the centroid is at (4*8)/3\u03c0 \u2248 3.546 ft from the center in both directions.\n\nThe hydrostatic force can be found using the formula:\n\nF_hydro = \u03c1ghA\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03c1 is the density of water (62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 in English units)\n\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity (32.2 ft/s\u00b2, but since we're using lbf directly, we can use \u03c1 directly)\n\n- h is the depth at the centroid\n\n- A is the area of the surface\n\nFirst, let's find the depth at the centroid. The centroid is at approximately 8 - 3.546 = 4.454 ft depth below the water surface (assuming the center of the quarter circle is at the water surface).\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful here. The quarter circle is hinged at B, which is the bottom point, and A is the top point. If the radius is 8 ft, and it's a quarter circle, then the depth from the water surface to the bottom hinge B is 8 ft. The centroid of the quarter circle is at a distance of 4r/3\u03c0 from the center, which is about 3.546 ft. So, the depth of the centroid below the water surface is 8 ft - 3.546 ft = 4.454 ft.\n\nNow, the hydrostatic force is:\n\nF_hydro = \u03c1ghA\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c1 = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3\n\n- g = 32.2 ft/s\u00b2, but since we're using lbf (pound-force), which is already a force unit, we can use \u03c1 directly without multiplying by g.\n\n- h = 4.454 ft\n\n- A = area of the quarter circular gate\n\nFirst, find the area of the quarter circle:\n\nA = (\u03c0r\u00b2)/4 = (\u03c0*(8)^2)/4 = (64\u03c0)/4 = 16\u03c0 ft\u00b2 \u2248 50.265 ft\u00b2\n\nSo, F_hydro = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 4.454 ft * 50.265 ft\u00b2 \u2248 62.4 * 4.454 * 50.265 \u2248 14,000 lbf\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, I think I misremembered the formula for hydrostatic force. The correct formula is:\n\nF_hydro = \u03c1g h_c A\n\nwhere h_c is the depth of the centroid.\n\nBut since we're using lbf, which is already a force unit, we can use:\n\nF_hydro = \u03c1 h_c A\n\nYes, that makes sense because lbf is defined as mass times gravity, but in fluid mechanics, \u03c1 is often given in lbf/ft\u00b3, making the calculation straightforward.\n\nSo, F_hydro = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 4.454 ft * 50.265 ft\u00b2 \u2248 62.4 * 4.454 * 50.265 \u2248 14,000 lbf\n\nBut this seems too large compared to the options provided. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, the hydrostatic force on a curved surface can be found using the horizontal and vertical components, but perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the moment equilibrium about the hinge point B. The forces acting on the gate are:\n\n1. The hydrostatic force F_hydro, which acts through the centroid of the area.\n\n2. The weight of the gate, which is 3000 lbf, acting downward through its centroid.\n\n3. The force F applied at point A, which is the top of the gate.\n\nAll these forces can produce moments about the hinge point B, and for the gate to be in equilibrium, the sum of the moments about B must be zero.\n\nFirst, I need to find the moment arms for each force with respect to B.\n\nLet's consider the geometry. The gate is a quarter circle with radius 8 ft, hinged at B. Point A is the top of the gate, directly above B at a distance of 8 ft.\n\nThe centroid of the quarter circle is at a distance of 4r/3\u03c0 from the center. Since the center of the quarter circle is 8 ft from B along the radius, the centroid is located at:\n\nx = 8 - 4r/3\u03c0 = 8 - (4*8)/(3*\u03c0) \u2248 8 - 3.546 \u2248 4.454 ft from B along the radius.\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate of the centroid is the same, so it's at a point approximately 4.454 ft from B horizontally and vertically.\n\nNow, the hydrostatic force F_hydro acts through this centroid.\n\nThe weight of the gate, 3000 lbf, also acts through this centroid.\n\nThe force F is applied at point A, which is directly above B at the top of the gate.\n\nTo find the moment about B, I need the perpendicular distances from B to the lines of action of these forces.\n\nFor the hydrostatic force, the moment arm is the perpendicular distance from B to the line of action of F_hydro. Since F_hydro acts through the centroid, which is approximately 4.454 ft horizontally from B, the moment arm is 4.454 ft.\n\nSimilarly, the weight of the gate also acts through the centroid, so its moment arm is also 4.454 ft.\n\nThe force F is applied at point A, which is directly above B at a distance of 8 ft along the radius. The perpendicular distance from B to F is 8 ft.\n\nNow, for equilibrium, the sum of the moments about B must be zero. Let's consider clockwise moments as positive.\n\nSo, sum of moments about B:\n\nF * 8 - F_hydro * 4.454 - Weight * 4.454 = 0\n\nWe need to solve for F.\n\nBut first, we need to find F_hydro and Weight.\n\nWe already have the weight as 3000 lbf.\n\nFor F_hydro, let's recalculate it correctly.\n\nThe hydrostatic force on a curved surface can be found using the horizontal and vertical components.\n\nThe horizontal component is equal to the pressure at the centroid multiplied by the area projected on the vertical plane.\n\nThe vertical component is equal to the weight of the fluid above the area.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, since the gate is curved, the horizontal component is the one that causes the moment, while the vertical component is balanced by the hinge reaction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the horizontal projection of the gate, which is a rectangle 8 ft by 10 ft (since it's 10 ft wide into the paper), and calculate the hydrostatic force based on that.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the horizontal projection first.\n\nThe horizontal projection of the quarter-circle gate is a rectangle that is 8 ft (the diameter) by 10 ft (the width into the paper).\n\nSo, the area projected horizontally is 8 ft * 10 ft = 80 ft\u00b2\n\nThe pressure at the centroid would be \u03c1gh_c, where h_c is the depth of the centroid of this horizontal projection.\n\nThe centroid of the horizontal projection is at a depth of 4 ft (since it's a rectangle from 0 to 8 ft depth, the centroid is at the midpoint).\n\nSo, F_horizontal = \u03c1gh_c * area = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 4 ft * 80 ft\u00b2 = 62.4 * 4 * 80 \u2248 19,968 lbf\n\nSimilarly, the vertical component is the weight of the water above the gate.\n\nThe volume of water above the gate is the area of the quarter circle times the width: (\u03c0r\u00b2)/4 * 10 ft = (3.1416*64)/4 *10 \u2248 502.65 ft\u00b3\n\nSo, F_vertical = \u03c1 * volume = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 502.65 ft\u00b3 \u2248 31,380 lbf\n\nTherefore, the total hydrostatic force is the combination of these two components.\n\nBut perhaps for the moment calculation, only the horizontal component matters, since the vertical component would be along the hinge and thus doesn't produce a moment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the line of action of the total hydrostatic force.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider that the hydrostatic force on a curved surface can be found using the formula:\n\nF = \u03c1g h_c A\n\nWhere h_c is the depth of the centroid of the area.\n\nSo, F_hydro = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 4 ft * 50.265 ft\u00b2 \u2248 12,500 lbf\n\nWait, earlier I had 4.454 ft as the depth, but now I'm using 4 ft. Which one is correct?\n\nActually, for the horizontal projection, the centroid is at 4 ft depth, so h_c = 4 ft.\n\nSo, F_hydro = 62.4 * 4 * 50.265 \u2248 12,500 lbf\n\nNow, considering only the horizontal component for moment calculation, since the vertical component is along the hinge and doesn't produce a moment.\n\nSo, sum of moments about B:\n\nF * 8 - F_hydro * 4.454 - Weight * 4.454 = 0\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nF * 8 - 12,500 * 4.454 - 3000 * 4.454 = 0\n\nCalculate the products:\n\nF * 8 - 55,675 - 13,362 = 0\n\nSo, F * 8 = 55,675 + 13,362 = 69,037\n\nTherefore, F = 69,037 / 8 \u2248 8,629 lbf\n\nBut this is not matching any of the options provided: 7490 lbf, 7470 lbf, 7480 lbf.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the hydrostatic force.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of F_hydro.\n\nThe area of the quarter circle is (\u03c0r\u00b2)/4 = (3.1416*64)/4 = 50.265 ft\u00b2\n\nThe depth of the centroid is 4 ft.\n\nSo, F_hydro = 62.4 * 4 * 50.265 \u2248 12,500 lbf\n\nWait, but earlier I thought this was too large, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the width into the paper, which is 10 ft.\n\nWait, the gate is 10 ft wide into the paper, so the area is actually 50.265 ft\u00b2 * 10 ft = 502.65 ft\u00b3\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, the area of the quarter circle is already considering the width into the paper, since it's given as 10 ft wide into the paper.\n\nWait, no. The area of the quarter circle is (\u03c0r\u00b2)/4 = 50.265 ft\u00b2, but since it's 10 ft wide into the paper, the total area is 50.265 ft\u00b2 * 10 ft = 502.65 ft\u00b2\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Area should be in ft\u00b2, not ft\u00b3.\n\nActually, the area of the gate is indeed 50.265 ft\u00b2 * 10 ft = 502.65 ft\u00b2\n\nTherefore, F_hydro = \u03c1g h_c A = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 4 ft * 502.65 ft\u00b2 \u2248 125,000 lbf\n\nWait, that's much larger than before. But if that's the case, then F * 8 = 125,000 * 4.454 + 3000 * 4.454 \u2248 556,750 + 13,362 \u2248 570,112 lbf-ft\n\nThen, F = 570,112 / 8 \u2248 71,264 lbf\n\nThis is way larger than the options provided. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the area should not be multiplied by the width into the paper.\n\nWait, no. The gate is 10 ft wide into the paper, so the area is indeed 50.265 ft\u00b2 * 10 ft = 502.65 ft\u00b2\n\nBut then, the hydrostatic force should be F_hydro = \u03c1g h_c A = 62.4 * 4 * 502.65 \u2248 124,999 lbf\n\nWhich is approximately 125,000 lbf\n\nThen, sum of moments about B:\n\nF * 8 - 125,000 * 4.454 - 3000 * 4.454 = 0\n\nF * 8 = 125,000 * 4.454 + 3000 * 4.454 \u2248 556,750 + 13,362 \u2248 570,112 lbf-ft\n\nF = 570,112 / 8 \u2248 71,264 lbf\n\nThis is still way larger than the options provided. There must be something wrong with my approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the hydrostatic force is acting horizontally, and its line of action is not through the centroid of the area but through the centroid of the vertical projection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the concept of pressure times area, considering the pressure varies with depth.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nThe horizontal component of the hydrostatic force can be found by integrating the pressure over the vertical projection of the area.\n\nThe vertical projection is a rectangle that is 8 ft tall (the depth) by 10 ft wide (into the paper).\n\nSo, the area is 8 ft * 10 ft = 80 ft\u00b2\n\nThe pressure at depth z is \u03c1g z\n\nTherefore, the horizontal hydrostatic force is:\n\nF_horizontal = \u222b (from 0 to 8 ft) \u03c1g z * 10 dz\n\n= 10 * \u03c1g * \u222b z dz from 0 to 8\n\n= 10 * \u03c1g * [z\u00b2/2] from 0 to 8\n\n= 10 * 62.4 * 32.2 * (64/2)\n\nWait, no. Actually, \u03c1 is in lbf/ft\u00b3, so \u03c1g is not needed; \u03c1 already includes the gravitational effect in lbf.\n\nSo, F_horizontal = \u222b \u03c1 z * 10 dz from 0 to 8\n\n= 10 * \u03c1 * [z\u00b2/2] from 0 to 8\n\n= 10 * 62.4 * (64/2)\n\n= 10 * 62.4 * 32\n\n= 10 * 2,000\n\n= 20,000 lbf\n\nSimilarly, the vertical component is the weight of the water above the gate.\n\nThe volume of water above the gate is the area of the quarter circle times the width: (\u03c0r\u00b2)/4 * 10 ft = (3.1416*64)/4 *10 \u2248 502.65 ft\u00b3\n\nSo, F_vertical = \u03c1 * volume = 62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3 * 502.65 ft\u00b3 \u2248 31,380 lbf\n\nTherefore, the total hydrostatic force is the vector sum of F_horizontal and F_vertical.\n\nBut for the moment calculation, perhaps only the horizontal component matters, since the vertical component is along the hinge and doesn't produce a moment.\n\nSo, sum of moments about B:\n\nF * 8 - F_horizontal * 4.454 - Weight * 4.454 = 0\n\nPlugging in:\n\nF * 8 - 20,000 * 4.454 - 3000 * 4.454 = 0\n\nF * 8 - 89,080 - 13,362 = 0\n\nF * 8 = 102,442\n\nF = 102,442 / 8 \u2248 12,805 lbf\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the line of action of the total hydrostatic force.\n\nThe line of action of the hydrostatic force on a curved surface passes through the center of pressure.\n\nThe center"
