                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I've got a control system block diagram here, and I need to find the values of K1 and K2 such that the closed-loop system has a peak time of 1 second and a settling time of 2 seconds for a step response. Okay, sounds challenging, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the system's structure. There are two feedback loops here: one with K1 and another with K2s. The forward path has a transfer function of 50 over s(s+1). So, the overall system is a bit complex due to these multiple loops.\n\nMy goal is to find K1 and K2 such that the closed-loop system responds to a step input with a peak time of 1 second and a settling time of 2 seconds. I recall that peak time (Tp) is the time it takes for the step response to reach its first peak, and settling time (Ts) is the time it takes for the response to settle within a certain percentage (usually 2% or 5%) of the final value.\n\nTo find K1 and K2, I think I need to analyze the closed-loop transfer function of the system and then use the specifications to determine these parameters.\n\nLet me start by finding the overall transfer function of the system.\n\nFirst, let's label the signals at different points in the diagram to make it clearer.\n\nWe have:\n\n- R(s) is the input\n\n- C(s) is the output\n\n- The first summing junction combines R(s) and the feedback from C(s)\n\n- The second summing junction combines the output of K1 and the feedback from K2s\n\nLet me denote the error signal as E(s) = R(s) - C(s)\n\nThen, the input to K1 is E(s), and the output of K1 is K1 * E(s)\n\nNext, the output of the second summing junction is K1*E(s) - K2*s*C(s)\n\nThis signal is fed into the transfer function block, which is 50 / (s(s+1))\n\nSo, the output C(s) is given by:\n\nC(s) = [K1*E(s) - K2*s*C(s)] * [50 / (s(s+1))]\n\nNow, since E(s) = R(s) - C(s), I can substitute E(s) in the above equation.\n\nSo, C(s) = [K1*(R(s) - C(s)) - K2*s*C(s)] * [50 / (s(s+1))]\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange it to solve for C(s)/R(s), which is the closed-loop transfer function.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by (s(s+1))/50 to simplify:\n\nC(s) * (s(s+1))/50 = K1*(R(s) - C(s)) - K2*s*C(s)\n\nNow, let's expand the left side:\n\nC(s) * s(s+1)/50 = K1*R(s) - K1*C(s) - K2*s*C(s)\n\nLet's bring all terms involving C(s) to one side:\n\nC(s) * [s(s+1)/50 + K1 + K2*s] = K1*R(s)\n\nNow, solve for C(s)/R(s):\n\nC(s)/R(s) = K1 / [s(s+1)/50 + K1 + K2*s]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nDenominator = s(s+1)/50 + K1 + K2*s\n\nLet's combine the terms:\n\n= (s^2 + s)/50 + K1 + K2*s\n\nTo combine, let's express everything with a common denominator of 50:\n\n= (s^2 + s + 50*K1 + 50*K2*s)/50\n\nSo, C(s)/R(s) = K1 / [(s^2 + s + 50*K1 + 50*K2*s)/50]\n\nSimplify:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = (50*K1) / (s^2 + s + 50*K1 + 50*K2*s)\n\nCombine like terms in the denominator:\n\nDenominator: s^2 + (1 + 50*K2)*s + 50*K1\n\nSo, C(s)/R(s) = (50*K1) / (s^2 + (1 + 50*K2)*s + 50*K1)\n\nAlright, now I have the closed-loop transfer function in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nNow, I need to find K1 and K2 such that the step response has a peak time Tp = 1 second and settling time Ts = 2 seconds.\n\nI recall that for a second-order system with transfer function:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = \u03c9_n^2 / (s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9_n s + \u03c9_n^2)\n\nThe peak time Tp is given by:\n\nTp = \u03c0 / (\u03c9_d), where \u03c9_d = \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2)\n\nAnd the settling time Ts is approximately:\n\nTs = 4 / (\u03b6 \u03c9_n)\n\nBut my transfer function is not in that standard form. It's:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = (50*K1) / (s^2 + (1 + 50*K2)*s + 50*K1)\n\nTo compare this to the standard second-order form, I can write it as:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = \u03c9_n^2 / (s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9_n s + \u03c9_n^2)\n\nSo, by comparing coefficients:\n\n\u03c9_n^2 = 50*K1\n\n2\u03b6\u03c9_n = 1 + 50*K2\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\u03c9_n = sqrt(50*K1)\n\nPlug this into the second equation:\n\n2\u03b6*sqrt(50*K1) = 1 + 50*K2\n\nNow, I have expressions for \u03c9_n and \u03b6 in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nNow, recall the expressions for peak time and settling time.\n\nGiven:\n\nTp = \u03c0 / \u03c9_d = 1 second\n\nTs = 4 / (\u03b6 \u03c9_n) = 2 seconds\n\nBut \u03c9_d = \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2)\n\nSo, Tp = \u03c0 / (\u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2)) = 1\n\nAnd Ts = 4 / (\u03b6 \u03c9_n) = 2\n\nNow, I have two equations with two unknowns (\u03b6 and \u03c9_n), but actually, I need equations in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express \u03b6 and \u03c9_n in terms of K1 and K2, and then use the specifications to find K1 and K2.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\u03c9_n = sqrt(50*K1)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n2\u03b6\u03c9_n = 1 + 50*K2\n\nSo, \u03b6 = (1 + 50*K2) / (2\u03c9_n) = (1 + 50*K2) / (2*sqrt(50*K1))\n\nNow, plug these expressions into the specifications.\n\nFrom Tp = \u03c0 / \u03c9_d = 1:\n\n\u03c9_d = \u03c0 / 1 = \u03c0\n\nBut \u03c9_d = \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2)\n\nSo, \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2) = \u03c0\n\nSimilarly, from Ts = 4 / (\u03b6 \u03c9_n) = 2:\n\n\u03b6 \u03c9_n = 4 / 2 = 2\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2) = \u03c0\n\nAnd \u03b6 \u03c9_n = 2\n\nLet me denote \u03c9_n = sqrt(50*K1) and \u03b6 = (1 + 50*K2) / (2*sqrt(50*K1))\n\nSo, from \u03b6 \u03c9_n = 2:\n\n[(1 + 50*K2) / (2*sqrt(50*K1))] * sqrt(50*K1) = 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 + 50*K2) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, 1 + 50*K2 = 4\n\nThus, 50*K2 = 3\n\nTherefore, K2 = 3 / 50 = 0.06\n\nAlright, now I have K2 = 0.06\n\nNow, plug this back into the expression for \u03b6.\n\n\u03b6 = (1 + 50*K2) / (2*sqrt(50*K1)) = (1 + 3) / (2*sqrt(50*K1)) = 4 / (2*sqrt(50*K1)) = 2 / sqrt(50*K1)\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9_n = sqrt(50*K1)\n\nNow, from \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2) = \u03c0\n\nPlug in \u03c9_n and \u03b6:\n\nsqrt(50*K1) * sqrt(1 - (2 / sqrt(50*K1))^2) = \u03c0\n\nLet me simplify this.\n\nLet\u2019s set sqrt(50*K1) = a, for simplicity.\n\nThen, a * sqrt(1 - (4 / a^2)) = \u03c0\n\nSo, a * sqrt((a^2 - 4)/a^2) = \u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(a^2 - 4) = \u03c0\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\na^2 - 4 = \u03c0^2\n\nSo, a^2 = \u03c0^2 + 4\n\nThus, a = sqrt(\u03c0^2 + 4)\n\nBut a = sqrt(50*K1), so:\n\nsqrt(50*K1) = sqrt(\u03c0^2 + 4)\n\nTherefore, 50*K1 = \u03c0^2 + 4\n\nSo, K1 = (\u03c0^2 + 4)/50\n\nNow, calculate \u03c0^2 + 4.\n\n\u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so \u03c0^2 \u2248 9.8696\n\nSo, \u03c0^2 + 4 \u2248 9.8696 + 4 = 13.8696\n\nThus, K1 \u2248 13.8696 / 50 \u2248 0.277392\n\nSo, K1 \u2248 0.277\n\nTherefore, K1 = 0.277 and K2 = 0.06\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. K2=0.6,K1=0.277\n\nB. K2=0.06,K1=0.377\n\nC. K2=0.06,K1=0.277\n\nD. K2=0.01,K1=0.177\n\nMy calculations suggest that K2 = 0.06 and K1 = 0.277, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found K2 = 0.06 from the first equation \u03b6 \u03c9_n = 2.\n\nThen, I expressed \u03b6 in terms of K1 and K2, and used the peak time equation to solve for K1.\n\nI set a = sqrt(50*K1), and then had a * sqrt(1 - (4/a^2)) = \u03c0\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(a^2 - 4) = \u03c0\n\nThen, a^2 = \u03c0^2 + 4\n\nAnd since a = sqrt(50*K1), then 50*K1 = \u03c0^2 + 4\n\nThus, K1 = (\u03c0^2 + 4)/50 \u2248 13.8696/50 \u2248 0.277392\n\nWhich rounds to 0.277, matching option C.\n\nHowever, I notice that option B has K2=0.06 and K1=0.377, which is close but not matching my calculation.\n\nI think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possible error in my approach.\n\nI assumed that the system behaves like a second-order system, which may not be entirely accurate, but given the block diagram and the transfer functions, it seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, I used the standard formulas for peak time and settling time for a second-order system, which should apply here.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to find the closed-loop poles and relate their locations to the peak time and settling time.\n\nFor a second-order system, the characteristic equation is s^2 + 2\u03b6\u03c9_n s + \u03c9_n^2 = 0\n\nThe peak time Tp is related to the damping ratio \u03b6 and natural frequency \u03c9_n by:\n\nTp = \u03c0 / (\u03c9_d), where \u03c9_d = \u03c9_n * sqrt(1 - \u03b6^2)\n\nAnd the settling time Ts = 4 / (\u03b6 \u03c9_n)\n\nSo, with Tp = 1 and Ts = 2, I can set up equations to solve for \u03b6 and \u03c9_n.\n\nBut I already did that in my earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the root locus method to find the values of K1 and K2 that place the poles at the desired locations corresponding to the specified Tp and Ts.\n\nBut that might be more time-consuming, and I'm not sure if it's necessary here.\n\nGiven that my calculations led me to option C, and upon double-checking, I can't find any errors in my reasoning, I'm confident that the correct answer is C.\n\nSo, the answer is C. K2=0.06, K1=0.277\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
