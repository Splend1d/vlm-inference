                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a beam that's fixed at both ends and then subjected to a uniform temperature increase. I need to find out the thermal stress that's induced in the beam due to this temperature change. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the beam is a W8x28, which is a standard I-beam, and it's 10 feet long. It's held between immovable supports, so both ends are fixed. The modulus of elasticity is given as 29,000 ksi, and the coefficient of thermal expansion is 6.5 times 10 to the power of minus 6 per degree Fahrenheit. The temperature is increased uniformly by 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and I need to find the thermal stress, sigma_T, in the beam.\n\nAlright, so when a material is subjected to a temperature change, it wants to expand or contract based on the temperature change and its coefficient of thermal expansion. But in this case, the ends are fixed, so it can't expand. This restriction will cause stresses to build up in the beam.\n\nI recall that for a rod or a beam fixed at both ends and subjected to a uniform temperature change, the thermal stress can be calculated using the formula:\n\nsigma_T = -E * alpha * delta_T\n\nwhere:\n\n- E is the modulus of elasticity\n\n- alpha is the coefficient of thermal expansion\n\n- delta_T is the change in temperature\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the stress is compressive if the temperature increases, and tensile if it decreases.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me think about it. If the temperature increases, the material wants to expand but can't because the ends are fixed, so it will be in compression. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nE = 29,000 ksi\n\nalpha = 6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 /\u00b0F\n\ndelta_T = 20 \u00b0F\n\nSo, sigma_T = -29,000 ksi * 6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 /\u00b0F * 20 \u00b0F\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply alpha and delta_T:\n\n6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 /\u00b0F * 20 \u00b0F = 6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 * 20 = 1.3 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nThen, sigma_T = -29,000 ksi * 1.3 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nMultiply 29,000 by 1.3:\n\n29,000 * 1.3 = 37,700\n\nThen, 37,700 * 10^-4 = 37,700 * 0.0001 = 3.77 ksi\n\nSo, sigma_T = -3.77 ksi\n\nThe negative sign indicates that it's compressive stress.\n\nWait, but one of the options is -2.77 ksi, which is option A, and -3.77 ksi is option B, and -4.77 ksi is option C. So, according to my calculation, it should be -3.77 ksi, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the formula for thermal stress in a fixed-ended member is indeed sigma_T = -E * alpha * delta_T.\n\nSecond, the units should be consistent. E is in ksi, alpha in /\u00b0F, and delta_T in \u00b0F, so the result should be in ksi, which is correct.\n\nThird, let me verify the multiplication:\n\n29,000 ksi * 6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 /\u00b0F * 20 \u00b0F\n\nCalculate 6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 * 20:\n\n6.5 \u00d7 10^-6 * 20 = 130 \u00d7 10^-6 = 0.00013\n\nThen, 29,000 * 0.00013 = 3.77\n\nSo, sigma_T = -3.77 ksi\n\nYes, that seems correct to me.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse the formula or forget the negative sign, but in this case, since the beam is fixed at both ends and can't expand, the stress should indeed be compressive, hence the negative sign.\n\nSo, my final answer is -3.77 ksi, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-3.77\\ \\text{ksi}} \\]"
