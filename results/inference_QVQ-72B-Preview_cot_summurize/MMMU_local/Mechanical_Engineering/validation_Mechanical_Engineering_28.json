                    "text": "So I've got this control system block diagram here, and I need to find the steady-state error for a specific input. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there are two blocks in the forward path. The first block has a transfer function of 5 over s(s + 1)(s + 2), and the second block is just (s + 3). There's a feedback path that subtracts the output from the input before these blocks. So, it's a negative feedback system.\n\nThe input is given as 50u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. I need to find the steady-state error for this input.\n\nI remember that the steady-state error for a step input can be found using the formula:\n\ness = (R / Kp)\n\nWhere:\n\n- ess is the steady-state error\n\n- R is the magnitude of the step input\n\n- Kp is the position error constant\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that the system is stable. Otherwise, talking about steady-state error doesn't make much sense because the system wouldn't reach a steady state.\n\nSo, let's check the stability of the system.\n\nTo do that, I need to find the closed-loop transfer function, C(s)/R(s), and then look at the denominator to find the characteristic equation.\n\nFirst, let's find the overall forward transfer function.\n\nThe first block is 5 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)], and the second block is (s + 3). So, the overall forward transfer function is the product of these two:\n\nG(s) = [5 / (s(s + 1)(s + 2))] * (s + 3)\n\nThe feedback factor is 1, since it's a unity negative feedback system.\n\nSo, the closed-loop transfer function is:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s))\n\nPlugging in G(s):\n\nC(s)/R(s) = [5(s + 3)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2) + 5(s + 3)]\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nDenominator = s(s + 1)(s + 2) + 5(s + 3)\n\nLet me expand s(s + 1)(s + 2):\n\n= s*(s^2 + 3s + 2) = s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s\n\nSo, denominator = s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 5s + 15\n\n= s^3 + 3s^2 + 7s + 15\n\nSo, C(s)/R(s) = 5(s + 3) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 7s + 15)\n\nNow, to check stability, I need to find the roots of the characteristic equation, which is the denominator:\n\ns^3 + 3s^2 + 7s + 15 = 0\n\nI need to find if all roots have negative real parts.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky, but I can try to use the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to check stability.\n\nFirst, set up the Routh array:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 3\n\ns^1: 7\n\ns^0: 15\n\nThere are no changes in sign, so the system is stable.\n\nGood, now I can proceed to find the steady-state error.\n\nBut wait, actually, the position error constant Kp is defined for a type 0 system as the DC gain of the open-loop transfer function.\n\nWait, but in this case, the system has an integrator in the forward path, so it might not be a type 0 system.\n\nLet me recall that the type of the system determines the behavior of the steady-state error for different inputs.\n\nFirst, let's find the open-loop transfer function, which is just G(s), since the feedback is 1.\n\nG(s) = [5 / (s(s + 1)(s + 2))] * (s + 3)\n\n= 5(s + 3) / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nNow, count the number of pure integrations in the forward path.\n\nThe denominator has s, which is an integration, so the system is of type 1.\n\nFor a type 1 system, the position error constant Kp is:\n\nKp = limit as s approaches 0 of s * G(s)\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, for a type 1 system, the position error constant is:\n\nKp = limit as s approaches 0 of s * G(s)\n\nBut, in this case, since there is an integration in the forward path, the steady-state error for a step input is:\n\ness = R / Kp\n\nWhere Kp is the position error constant.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this formula applies directly.\n\nAlternatively, for a unity feedback system, the steady-state error for a step input is:\n\ness = 1 / (1 + Kp)\n\nWait, I need to recall the correct formula.\n\nFor a step input of magnitude R, the steady-state error is:\n\ness = R / (1 + Kp)\n\nOr, more accurately, ess = R / (1 + K)\n\nWhere K is the DC gain of the forward path.\n\nBut in control theory, for a type 1 system, the steady-state error for a step input is zero because the system can track a step input without error.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the answer options are non-zero, so maybe the system isn't a type 1 system.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nA type 1 system has one pure integration in the forward path.\n\nIn this case, the forward path has 5 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] multiplied by (s + 3).\n\nSo, the open-loop transfer function G(s) is:\n\nG(s) = 5(s + 3) / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= 5(s + 3) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s)\n\nYes, there is one pure integration (the 1/s term), so it's a type 1 system.\n\nFor a type 1 system, the steady-state error for a step input is zero.\n\nBut the answer options are non-zero, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the feedback path affects the type of the system.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, there is a feedback path with (s + 3), not just 1.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not a unity feedback system.\n\nIn that case, I need to consider the overall transfer function.\n\nLet me recall that the overall transfer function is:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s)H(s))\n\nWhere H(s) is the feedback transfer function.\n\nIn this case, H(s) is (s + 3).\n\nSo, C(s)/R(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s)H(s))\n\n= [5(s + 3)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2) + 5(s + 3)]\n\nWait, earlier I had that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the error transfer function.\n\nThe error E(s) = R(s) - H(s)C(s)\n\nSo, E(s)/R(s) = 1 - H(s) * C(s)/R(s)\n\n= 1 - H(s) * G(s) / (1 + G(s)H(s))\n\n= [1 + G(s)H(s) - H(s)G(s)] / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\n= 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nSo, E(s)/R(s) = 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nThen, the steady-state error for a step input is:\n\ness = lim s->0 { s E(s) } / (s R)\n\nBut since R(s) is a step input, R(s) = 50 / s\n\nSo, ess = lim s->0 { s * (1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]) } * (s / 50)\n\nWait, that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for a unity feedback system, ess = R / (1 + Kp)\n\nBut here, it's not a unity feedback system.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the steady-state error directly from the error transfer function.\n\nGiven E(s)/R(s) = 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nThen, for a step input, ess = lim s->0 { s E(s) } / R\n\n= lim s->0 { s / [1 + G(s)H(s)] } / (50 / s)\n\n= lim s->0 { s^2 / [1 + G(s)H(s)] } / 50\n\n= lim s->0 { s^2 / [1 + G(s)H(s)] } * (1/50)\n\nNow, plug in G(s)H(s):\n\nG(s)H(s) = [5(s + 3)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] * (s + 3)\n\n= 5(s + 3)^2 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nSo, 1 + G(s)H(s) = 1 + 5(s + 3)^2 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= [s(s + 1)(s + 2) + 5(s + 3)^2] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nNow, expand the numerator:\n\ns(s + 1)(s + 2) = s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s\n\n5(s + 3)^2 = 5(s^2 + 6s + 9) = 5s^2 + 30s + 45\n\nSo, numerator = s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 5s^2 + 30s + 45\n\n= s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45\n\nTherefore, 1 + G(s)H(s) = [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nNow, plug back into the expression for ess:\n\ness = lim s->0 { s^2 / [ (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) / (s(s + 1)(s + 2)) ] } * (1/50)\n\n= lim s->0 { s^2 * [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] / (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) } * (1/50)\n\nNow, simplify as s approaches 0:\n\nThe limit of s^2 * [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] / (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) as s->0\n\nFirst, factor out s^3:\n\n= s^3 * [(s + 1)(s + 2)] / (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45)\n\nAs s approaches 0, the numerator approaches 0, and the denominator approaches 45.\n\nSo, ess = (0 / 45) * (1/50) = 0\n\nBut that can't be right because the answer options are non-zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the numerator.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nE(s)/R(s) = 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\n= [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] / [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45]\n\nThen, ess = lim s->0 { s E(s) / R(s) }\n\n= lim s->0 { s * [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] / [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45] } / (50 / s)\n\n= lim s->0 { s^2 (s + 1)(s + 2) / [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45] } * (s / 50)\n\n= lim s->0 { s^3 (s + 1)(s + 2) / [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45] } * (1 / 50)\n\nNow, as s approaches 0, the limit of s^3 (s + 1)(s + 2) / (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) is 0/45 = 0\n\nAgain, I get ess = 0, but that doesn't match the answer options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the system has a pole at zero, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the type of the system again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the steady-state error can be found using the final value theorem.\n\nThe final value theorem states that:\n\ness = lim t->infinity e(t) = lim s->0 s E(s)\n\nSo, I need to find s E(s) and take its limit as s approaches 0.\n\nGiven E(s)/R(s) = 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nThen, E(s) = R(s) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nFor R(s) = 50 / s\n\nSo, E(s) = (50 / s) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nThen, s E(s) = (50) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nSo, ess = lim s->0 {50 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]}\n\nNow, plug in G(s)H(s):\n\nG(s)H(s) = 5(s + 3)^2 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= [5(s^2 + 6s + 9)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= (5s^2 + 30s + 45) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s)\n\nTherefore, 1 + G(s)H(s) = 1 + (5s^2 + 30s + 45) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s)\n\n= [s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s + 5s^2 + 30s + 45] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= [s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nSo, ess = lim s->0 {50 / [ (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) / (s(s + 1)(s + 2)) ] }\n\n= lim s->0 {50 * [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] / (s^3 + 8s^2 + 32s + 45) }\n\nNow, as s approaches 0, the numerator approaches 0, and the denominator approaches 45.\n\nSo, ess = 0 / 45 = 0\n\nAgain, I get ess = 0, which doesn't match the answer options.\n\nThis suggests that I might be missing something in my approach.\n\nPerhaps the system isn't a type 1 system after all.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the system's type based on the overall transfer function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in calculating G(s)H(s).\n\nLet me double-check G(s):\n\nG(s) = 5 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] * (s + 3)\n\n= 5(s + 3) / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nH(s) = (s + 3)\n\nSo, G(s)H(s) = [5(s + 3)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)] * (s + 3)\n\n= 5(s + 3)^2 / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= [5(s^2 + 6s + 9)] / [s(s + 1)(s + 2)]\n\n= (5s^2 + 30s + 45) / (s^3 + 3s^2 + 2s)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the system is not type 1 because of the feedback path.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the system's type based on the closed-loop transfer function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the error transfer function directly.\n\nGiven that E(s)/R(s) = 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nAnd C(s)/R(s) = G(s) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nThen, E(s) = R(s) - H(s)C(s)\n\nSo, E(s)/R(s) = 1 - H(s) * C(s)/R(s)\n\n= 1 - H(s) * G(s) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\n= [1 + G(s)H(s) - H(s)G(s)] / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\n= 1 / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nBut this still leads to ess = 0, which doesn't match the answer options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the feedback is negative.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, the feedback path has (s + 3), and it's subtracted from the input.\n\nSo, the overall transfer function should be:\n\nC(s)/R(s) = G(s) / [1 + G(s)H(s)]\n\nWhere H(s) = (s + 3)\n\nBut perhaps the feedback is positive, which would change the sign.\n\nWait, no, the diagram shows a negative feedback.\n\nSo, that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the feedback path includes the (s + 3) factor, which affects the steady-state error.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the steady-state error using the formula:\n\ness = R / (1 + Kp)\n\nBut for a type 1 system, Kp is infinite, so ess = 0.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match the answer options.\n\nMaybe the system isn't a type 1 system due to the feedback path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the steady-state error for a ramp input, but the input is a step input.\n\nWait, no, the input is a step input, so it's a type 1 system, and ess should be zero.\n\nBut the answer options are non-zero, so"
