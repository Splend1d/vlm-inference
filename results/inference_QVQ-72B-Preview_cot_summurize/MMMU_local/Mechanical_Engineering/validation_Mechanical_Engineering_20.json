                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a machine frame made of steel with yield strength \\(S_y = 400\\) MPa and ultimate strength \\(S_{sy} = 250\\) MPa. Under a test load of 4 kN, we have principal stresses at two critical points: point A with \\(\\sigma_1 = 200\\) MPa and \\(\\sigma_2 = 100\\) MPa, and point B with \\(\\sigma_1 = 150\\) MPa and \\(\\sigma_2 = -100\\) MPa. We need to find the test load at which initial yielding occurs according to the maximum-normal-stress theory.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the maximum-normal-stress theory is. I think it's also known as the Rankine theory or the maximum principal stress theory. According to this theory, failure occurs when the maximum principal stress in the material reaches the yield strength in uniaxial tension or compression.\n\nSo, the criterion for yielding is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = S_y\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{\\text{max}}\\) is the maximum principal stress and \\(S_y\\) is the yield strength.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the load at which one of the principal stresses at points A or B reaches the yield strength.\n\nBut wait, in biaxial stress states, there are two principal stresses, \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\), and the maximum normal stress would be \\(\\sigma_1\\) if \\(\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2\\), or \\(\\sigma_2\\) if \\(\\sigma_2 > \\sigma_1\\). However, in both points A and B, \\(\\sigma_1\\) is larger than \\(\\sigma_2\\), so \\(\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\sigma_1\\).\n\nAt the 4-kN test load:\n\n- Point A: \\(\\sigma_1 = 200\\) MPa\n\n- Point B: \\(\\sigma_1 = 150\\) MPa\n\nWe need to find the load at which one of these \\(\\sigma_1\\) values reaches \\(S_y = 400\\) MPa.\n\nBut hold on, stresses are linearly proportional to load. So, if the load increases, the stresses at these points will increase proportionally.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the test load as \\(P\\), where \\(P = 4\\) kN initially.\n\nAt point A:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1A} = k_A \\times P\\]\n\nAt point B:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1B} = k_B \\times P\\]\n\nFrom the given 4-kN load:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1A} = 200 \\text{ MPa} = k_A \\times 4 \\text{ kN}\\]\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1B} = 150 \\text{ MPa} = k_B \\times 4 \\text{ kN}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[k_A = \\frac{200}{4} = 50 \\text{ MPa/kN}\\]\n\n\\[k_B = \\frac{150}{4} = 37.5 \\text{ MPa/kN}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the load \\(P\\) at which either \\(\\sigma_{1A}\\) or \\(\\sigma_{1B}\\) reaches \\(S_y = 400\\) MPa.\n\nSo,\n\nFor point A:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1A} = k_A \\times P = 50P = 400 \\text{ MPa}\\]\n\n\\[P = \\frac{400}{50} = 8 \\text{ kN}\\]\n\nFor point B:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1B} = k_B \\times P = 37.5P = 400 \\text{ MPa}\\]\n\n\\[P = \\frac{400}{37.5} = 10.666... \\text{ kN}\\]\n\nSince the load required to reach yield is lower at point A (8 kN) compared to point B (10.666 kN), the frame will yield at 8 kN according to the maximum-normal-stress theory.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions \\(S_{sy} = 250\\) MPa, which is the ultimate strength. I wonder if that's relevant here. The maximum-normal-stress theory typically uses the yield strength, not the ultimate strength.\n\nLet me check the units to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(S_y = 400\\) MPa\n\n- \\(S_{sy} = 250\\) MPa (ultimate strength)\n\n- At 4 kN:\n\n- Point A: \\(\\sigma_1 = 200\\) MPa, \\(\\sigma_2 = 100\\) MPa\n\n- Point B: \\(\\sigma_1 = 150\\) MPa, \\(\\sigma_2 = -100\\) MPa\n\nI calculated:\n\n- \\(k_A = 50\\) MPa/kN\n\n- \\(k_B = 37.5\\) MPa/kN\n\n- Yield occurs at point A when \\(P = 8\\) kN\n\nBut let's confirm if the maximum-normal-stress theory considers both tensile and compressive stresses.\n\nIn the maximum-normal-stress theory, failure is predicted when the maximum principal stress reaches the tensile yield strength or the minimum principal stress reaches the compressive yield strength. In this case, both \\(\\sigma_1\\) at point A and \\(\\sigma_1\\) at point B are tensile stresses.\n\nWait, at point B, \\(\\sigma_1 = 150\\) MPa and \\(\\sigma_2 = -100\\) MPa. So, \\(\\sigma_1\\) is tensile, and \\(\\sigma_2\\) is compressive.\n\nAccording to the maximum-normal-stress theory, failure occurs when the maximum principal stress reaches the tensile yield strength or the minimum principal stress reaches the compressive yield strength.\n\nAssuming the material has the same yield strength in tension and compression, which is often the case for metals like steel, then both tensile and compressive yield strengths are 400 MPa.\n\nTherefore, for point A:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1A} = 50P = 400 \\text{ MPa}\\]\n\n\\[P = 8 \\text{ kN}\\]\n\nFor point B:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{1B} = 37.5P = 400 \\text{ MPa}\\]\n\n\\[P = 10.666... \\text{ kN}\\]\n\nSo, yielding occurs first at point A at 8 kN.\n\nBut the problem mentions \\(S_{sy} = 250\\) MPa, which is the ultimate strength. Maybe I need to consider that as well.\n\nUltimate strength is typically higher than yield strength, so if the material reaches its ultimate strength at 250 MPa, that would be beyond yielding.\n\nBut according to the maximum-normal-stress theory, yielding occurs at 400 MPa, not at 250 MPa.\n\nI think I might have misread \\(S_{sy}\\). Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"steel having \\(S_y = 400\\) MPa and \\(S_{sy} = 250\\) MPa.\"\n\nWait, \\(S_{sy}\\) is likely the shear yield strength or something else. Let me see.\n\nOh, perhaps \\(S_{sy}\\) is the yield strength in shear. In that case, I might need to consider it in the analysis.\n\nFor the maximum-normal-stress theory, only the normal stresses are considered, not shear stresses. So, perhaps \\(S_{sy}\\) is not directly relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\(S_{sy}\\) is the yield strength in simple shear, and there's a relationship between normal and shear yield strengths.\n\nBut in the maximum-normal-stress theory, only the normal stresses are compared to the yield strength.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the answer should be 8 kN.\n\nHowever, looking back at the multiple-choice options, 8 kN is one of them, but I need to make sure there isn't something I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if there's another theory or aspect I should consider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants to use a different failure theory, but it specifically asks for the maximum-normal-stress theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8 kN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{8\\text{ kN}}\\]"
