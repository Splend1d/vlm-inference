                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a helical spring with stiffness k, and it's cut into two halves. These halves are then connected to a mass m as shown in image 1. The natural time period of this system is given as 0.5 seconds. Then, in image 2, another identical spring is cut into parts where one part is one-fourth and the other is three-fourths of the original length. These parts are connected to the same mass m, and we need to find the new natural period of the system.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how cutting the spring affects its stiffness. I recall that when you cut a spring into smaller pieces, the stiffness of each piece changes. Specifically, if you cut a spring into n equal parts, each part will have n times the stiffness of the original spring. Wait, is that right? Let me think again.\n\nActually, stiffness (k) is related to the spring constant, which is given by k = YA/L, where Y is Young's modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length of the spring. So, if I cut the spring into two equal halves, each half would have half the length of the original spring. Therefore, the stiffness of each half would be k_original = k = YA/L, and for each half, k_half = YA/(L/2) = 2*(YA/L) = 2k. So, yes, each half has twice the stiffness of the original spring.\n\nNow, in image 1, the mass m is connected to two halves of the spring, each with stiffness 2k, arranged in parallel. When springs are connected in parallel, their effective stiffness adds up. So, the effective stiffness k_eff for the system in image 1 would be k_eff1 = 2k + 2k = 4k.\n\nThe natural period \u03c4 of a mass-spring system is given by \u03c4 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/k_eff). So, for image 1, \u03c41 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/4k) = 2\u03c0/(2\u221a(m/k)) = \u03c0\u221a(m/k). But it's given that \u03c41 = 0.5 s. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.5 = \u03c0\u221a(m/k)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.25 = \u03c0\u00b2 * (m/k)\n\nSolving for m/k:\n\nm/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2\n\nAlright, so m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2.\n\nNow, moving on to image 2, where the spring is cut into one-fourth and three-fourths of the original length. So, one part has length l/4 and the other has length 3l/4.\n\nAgain, using k = YA/L, the stiffness of the l/4 part would be k1 = YA/(l/4) = 4*(YA/l) = 4k, and the stiffness of the 3l/4 part would be k2 = YA/(3l/4) = (4/3)*YA/l = (4/3)k.\n\nSo, in image 2, the mass m is connected to two springs with stiffness k1 = 4k and k2 = (4/3)k, arranged in parallel. Therefore, the effective stiffness for this system would be k_eff2 = k1 + k2 = 4k + (4/3)k = (12/3)k + (4/3)k = (16/3)k.\n\nNow, the natural period for this system would be \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/k_eff2) = 2\u03c0\u221a(m / (16/3)k) = 2\u03c0\u221a(3m / 16k) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3)/(4\u221ak/m).\n\nBut from earlier, we have m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2. So, \u221a(m/k) = \u221a(0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2) = 0.5 / \u03c0.\n\nSubstituting this into \u03c42:\n\n\u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3 / (4 * (0.5 / \u03c0))) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3 / (2 / \u03c0)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u03c0\u221a3 / 2) = (2\u03c0\u00b2\u221a3)/2 = \u03c0\u221a3 \u2248 3.1416 * 1.732 \u2248 5.416 s. Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 0.3 to 0.5 seconds.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my steps.\n\nFirst, for image 1:\n\n- Original spring cut into two halves, each with stiffness 2k.\n\n- Effective stiffness k_eff1 = 2k + 2k = 4k.\n\n- Natural period \u03c41 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/4k) = 0.5 s.\n\n- So, \u221a(m/k) = 0.5 / \u03c0.\n\nFor image 2:\n\n- Spring cut into l/4 and 3l/4 parts, with stiffness 4k and (4/3)k respectively.\n\n- Effective stiffness k_eff2 = 4k + 4k/3 = (16/3)k.\n\n- Natural period \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/(16k/3)) = 2\u03c0\u221a(3m/16k).\n\nNow, substituting \u221a(m/k) = 0.5 / \u03c0:\n\n\u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3)/(4 * (0.5/\u03c0)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(4*(0.5/\u03c0)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(2/\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * \u03c0\u221a3 / 2 = \u03c0\u221a3 \u2248 5.416 s.\n\nBut this doesn't match the options. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the springs are connected differently. In image 1, the mass is connected to both springs in parallel, which makes sense. In image 2, it seems similar, but maybe the effective stiffness calculation is incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check the stiffness for the springs in image 2.\n\nOriginal spring with stiffness k, length l.\n\nCut into l/4 and 3l/4.\n\nStiffness k1 for l/4: k1 = k * (l / (l/4)) = k * 4 = 4k.\n\nStiffness k2 for 3l/4: k2 = k * (l / (3l/4)) = k * (4/3) = (4/3)k.\n\nEffective stiffness k_eff2 = k1 + k2 = 4k + (4/3)k = (16/3)k.\n\nNatural period \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m / k_eff2) = 2\u03c0\u221a(m / (16k/3)) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3m / 16k).\n\nGiven that m/k = (0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2), then \u221a(m/k) = 0.5 / \u03c0.\n\nSo, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(4 * (0.5/\u03c0)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(2/\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 * \u03c0\u221a3 / 2 = \u03c0\u221a3 \u2248 5.416 s.\n\nBut this can't be right because the period shouldn't be that long compared to the first configuration.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding how the springs are connected in image 2.\n\nLet me look back at the problem statement.\n\n\"In image 2, an identical spring is cut so that one part is one-fourth and the other part three-fourths of the original length, and the mass m is connected to the two parts as shown.\"\n\nPerhaps the springs are connected in series with the mass.\n\nIf they are connected in series, the effective stiffness would be different.\n\nFor springs in series, 1/k_eff = 1/k1 + 1/k2.\n\nSo, 1/k_eff2 = 1/(4k) + 1/(4k/3) = (1/(4k)) + (3/(4k)) = 4/(4k) = 1/k.\n\nTherefore, k_eff2 = k.\n\nThen, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/k).\n\nFrom earlier, \u221a(m/k) = 0.5 / \u03c0.\n\nSo, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * (0.5 / \u03c0) = 1 s.\n\nBut this is still not matching the options.\n\nMaybe it's neither parallel nor series. Perhaps a combination.\n\nWait, looking back at image 1, it's clear that the springs are in parallel because both are connected to the mass directly.\n\nIn image 2, it seems similar, but maybe the arrangement is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the springs are connected in parallel with different lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when the springs are cut and reconnected, their individual stiffness changes, and thus the effective stiffness changes.\n\nBut I already did that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass is connected between the two springs in a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the springs in series for image 2.\n\nBut that gave me \u03c42 = 1 s, which is still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the springs are cut and their stiffness changes, and then connected in parallel.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nFor image 2:\n\nSpring cut into l/4 and 3l/4.\n\nStiffness k1 = 4k (for l/4)\n\nStiffness k2 = (4/3)k (for 3l/4)\n\nEffective stiffness k_eff2 = k1 + k2 = 4k + (4/3)k = (16/3)k\n\nNatural period \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m / (16k/3)) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3m / 16k)\n\nFrom m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2, so \u221a(m/k) = 0.5 / \u03c0\n\nTherefore, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(4 * (0.5/\u03c0)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a3)/(2/\u03c0) = \u03c0\u221a3 \u2248 5.416 s\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because the period shouldn't be longer than the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the springs are connected in parallel with the mass, and the effective stiffness is k_eff2 = k1 + k2 = (16/3)k\n\nThen, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0\u221a(m / (16k/3)) = 2\u03c0\u221a(3m / 16k)\n\nGiven that m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2, then m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2\n\nTherefore, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3*(0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2) / 16) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(0.75 / (16\u03c0\u00b2)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a0.75) / (4\u03c0) = (\u221a0.75)/2 \u2248 0.6495 s\n\nWait, let's calculate that properly.\n\nFirst, m/k = 0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2\n\nSo, \u03c42 = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(m / (16k/3)) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3m / 16k) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3*(m/k)/16) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(3*(0.25 / \u03c0\u00b2)/16) = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(0.75 / (16\u03c0\u00b2)) = 2\u03c0 * (\u221a0.75)/(4\u03c0) = \u221a0.75 / 2 \u2248 0.866 / 2 = 0.433 s\n\nAh, so \u03c42 \u2248 0.433 s, which matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the natural period of the system in image 2 is approximately 0.433 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
