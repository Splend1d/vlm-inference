                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a flat aluminum alloy bar fixed at both ends, with segment AB being slightly tapered and segment BC being rectangular. The temperature is raised uniformly by 20\u00b0F, and we need to find the reactions at points A and C.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry of the bar. The total length is L = 3 ft, and it's divided into two segments: AB and BC, each of length L/2 = 1.5 ft. Segment AB has a taper, with width b1 = 2 in. at point B and b2 = 2.5 in. at point A. The thickness is constant, t = 1/4 in. throughout the bar.\n\nSince the bar is fixed at both ends, when the temperature increases, the bar wants to expand but can't, due to the fixed supports. This will cause internal stresses and reactions at the supports.\n\nI recall that for a prismatic bar under uniform temperature change, the reaction force can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ R = \\alpha E A \\Delta T \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\alpha\\) is the coefficient of thermal expansion,\n\n- E is the modulus of elasticity,\n\n- A is the cross-sectional area,\n\n- \\(\\Delta T\\) is the change in temperature.\n\nHowever, in this case, the bar is not prismatic; it has a tapered section. So, I need to consider both segments separately.\n\nLet's start with segment AB, which is tapered. To find the reaction, I need to find the average cross-sectional area or perhaps use the area at point B since it's fixed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the equivalent prismatic bar for the tapered section.\n\nWait, another approach: since the bar is symmetric and both segments are of equal length and connected, perhaps I can consider the entire bar's behavior under uniform temperature change.\n\nBut no, because the cross-sectional area varies in segment AB.\n\nLet me think about the strain in the bar. The thermal strain due to temperature increase is \\(\\epsilon = \\alpha \\Delta T\\), which is positive (expansion).\n\nSince the bar is fixed at both ends, the actual strain is zero. Therefore, the stress due to the restraining force will be \\(\\sigma = -E \\epsilon = -E \\alpha \\Delta T\\), acting in compression.\n\nHowever, this assumes a prismatic bar. For the tapered section, the area changes, so the stress distribution might not be uniform.\n\nMaybe I should use the principle of virtual work or compatibility equations to find the reactions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the displacement at point B, which is fixed, so the displacement should be zero.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the reaction forces at A and C as \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_C\\), respectively.\n\nSince the bar is fixed at both ends, the net displacement at B should be zero.\n\nThe thermal expansion would cause the bar to want to expand by \\(\\delta = \\alpha L \\Delta T\\), but since it's fixed, this expansion is restrained.\n\nThe force required to restrain this expansion in a prismatic bar would be \\(F = \\alpha E A \\Delta T\\).\n\nBut again, the cross-section varies in segment AB.\n\nPerhaps I should calculate the stiffness of each segment and then combine them.\n\nFor segment AB, which is tapered, I need to find its stiffness, \\(k_{AB}\\), and for segment BC, which is prismatic, its stiffness \\(k_{BC}\\).\n\nThen, the total stiffness of the system would be \\(k_{total} = k_{AB} + k_{BC}\\), since they are in series.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when two springs are in series, the total stiffness is \\(k_{total} = \\frac{k_{1} k_{2}}{k_{1} + k_{2}}\\). But in this case, the segments are connected in series, so perhaps that's applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the flexibility of each segment and add them up.\n\nLet me look up the stiffness of a tapered bar.\n\nAfter some research, I find that for a tapered bar with a linear taper, the axial stiffness can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{E A_m}{L} \\]\n\nwhere \\(A_m\\) is the average cross-sectional area.\n\nFor segment AB, the width changes from b1 to b2 over length L/2.\n\nThe average width would be \\(\\frac{b1 + b2}{2} = \\frac{2 + 2.5}{2} = 2.25\\) in.\n\nThe area \\(A_m =\\) width \\(\\times\\) thickness \\(= 2.25 \\times 0.25 = 0.5625\\) in\u00b2.\n\nThe length \\(L_{AB} = 1.5\\) ft \\(= 18\\) in.\n\nThus, the stiffness of segment AB is:\n\n\\[ k_{AB} = \\frac{E \\times A_m}{L_{AB}} = \\frac{10,400 \\times 0.5625}{18} \\]\n\nFirst, convert E from ksi to psi: 1 ksi = 1000 psi, so E = 10,400 ksi = 10,400,000 psi.\n\nWait, no. Actually, ksi stands for \"thousand pounds per square inch,\" so E = 10,400 ksi = 10,400 * 1,000 = 10,400,000 psi.\n\nNow, calculate \\(k_{AB}\\):\n\n\\[ k_{AB} = \\frac{10,400,000 \\times 0.5625}{18} = \\frac{5,850,000}{18} = 325,000 \\text{ lb/in} \\]\n\nFor segment BC, which is prismatic with width b1 = 2 in. and thickness t = 0.25 in., area \\(A = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5\\) in\u00b2.\n\nLength \\(L_{BC} = 1.5\\) ft \\(= 18\\) in.\n\nStiffness of segment BC:\n\n\\[ k_{BC} = \\frac{E \\times A}{L_{BC}} = \\frac{10,400,000 \\times 0.5}{18} = \\frac{5,200,000}{18} = 288,888.89 \\text{ lb/in} \\]\n\nNow, since the two segments are connected in series, the total stiffness \\(k_{total}\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{k_{total}} = \\frac{1}{k_{AB}} + \\frac{1}{k_{BC}} = \\frac{1}{325,000} + \\frac{1}{288,888.89} \\]\n\nCalculate the reciprocals:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{325,000} \\approx 0.0000030769 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{288,888.89} \\approx 0.0000034641 \\]\n\nSum:\n\n\\[ 0.0000030769 + 0.0000034641 = 0.000006541 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ k_{total} = \\frac{1}{0.000006541} \\approx 153,000 \\text{ lb/in} \\]\n\nNow, the thermal expansion without restraint would be:\n\n\\[ \\delta = \\alpha \\times L \\times \\Delta T = 13 \\times 10^{-6} /^\\circ F \\times 36 \\text{ in.} \\times 20^\\circ F = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 36 \\times 20 \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, \\(13 \\times 36 = 468\\)\n\nThen, \\(468 \\times 20 = 9360\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\delta = 9360 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.00936\\) inches.\n\nSince the bar is fixed at both ends, this expansion is restrained, and the reaction force \\(R\\) can be found from:\n\n\\[ R = k_{total} \\times \\delta = 153,000 \\times 0.00936 \\]\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ R = 153,000 \\times 0.00936 = 1,432.8 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\nSince the bar is symmetric, the reactions at A and C should be equal but in opposite directions to each other.\n\nWait, but the bar is fixed at both ends, and the reaction should be distributed equally at A and C.\n\nSo, \\(R_A = R_C = \\frac{R}{2} = \\frac{1,432.8}{2} = 716.4 \\text{ lb} \\)\n\nBut looking at the options, they are in kips, so convert pounds to kips (1 kip = 1,000 lb):\n\n\\[ R_A = R_C = 0.7164 \\text{ kips} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them match. The closest is option C: \\(R_A = R_C = -0.429 \\text{ kips}\\)\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nLet me try another method.\n\nMaybe I should consider the entire bar as prismatic with an average area.\n\nThe average area of the entire bar would be:\n\nSegment AB: area varies linearly from 0.5 in\u00b2 to 0.625 in\u00b2 (since b2 = 2.5 in. and t = 0.25 in.).\n\nWait, actually, segment AB has a taper from b1 to b2 over L/2.\n\nThe area varies linearly from 0.5 in\u00b2 to 0.625 in\u00b2.\n\nSegment BC has a constant area of 0.5 in\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the entire bar's average area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the concept of strain energy.\n\nThe total strain energy due to thermal expansion restrained by the supports can be calculated, and then the reaction force can be found by differentiating the strain energy with respect to the displacement.\n\nBut that might be too complicated.\n\nLet me try to calculate the effective area of the entire bar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the stiffness of a non-prismatic bar.\n\nI recall that for a bar with varying cross-section, the stiffness can be calculated by integrating along the length.\n\nFor segment AB, which is tapered linearly, the area varies from b1 to b2.\n\nThe stiffness formula for such a bar is:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{E A_m}{L} \\]\n\nwhere \\(A_m\\) is the average area.\n\nAs I did earlier, \\(A_m = \\frac{A_1 + A_2}{2} = \\frac{0.5 + 0.625}{2} = 0.5625\\) in\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, for segment BC, \\(k_{BC} = \\frac{E A}{L} = \\frac{10,400,000 \\times 0.5}{18} = 288,888.89\\) lb/in.\n\nThen, the total stiffness \\(k_{total} = \\frac{k_{AB} k_{BC}}{k_{AB} + k_{BC}}\\), as previously calculated.\n\nWait, no. Springs in series have the total stiffness as the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, for two springs in series:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{k_{total}} = \\frac{1}{k_{AB}} + \\frac{1}{k_{BC}} \\]\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the stiffness of segment AB.\n\nLet me check the formula for the stiffness of a tapered bar.\n\nUpon further research, I find that for a tapered bar with a linear taper, the stiffness is indeed \\(k = \\frac{E A_m}{L}\\), where \\(A_m\\) is the average area.\n\nSo, my earlier calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the compatibility condition: the displacement at point B should be zero due to the fixed support.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the reaction forces at A and C as \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_C\\), respectively.\n\nThe total force in the bar due to thermal expansion and the reactions should result in zero displacement at B.\n\nThe thermal expansion would cause each segment to want to expand by \\(\\alpha \\Delta T L\\), but since they are fixed, they are restrained.\n\nThe force required to restrain the expansion in each segment can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nFirst, consider segment AB.\n\nIf it were free to expand, its expansion would be \\(\\delta_{AB} = \\alpha \\Delta T L_{AB} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\times 1.5 \\text{ ft}\\)\n\nWait, need to convert units consistently.\n\n\\(L_{AB} = 1.5\\) ft \\(= 18\\) in.\n\nSo, \\(\\delta_{AB} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\times 18 = 13 \\times 20 \\times 18 \\times 10^{-6} = 468 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.000468\\) inches.\n\nSimilarly, for segment BC, \\(\\delta_{BC} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\times 1.5 = 13 \\times 20 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{-6} = 390 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.00039\\) inches.\n\nWait, no. The thermal expansion is \\(\\delta = \\alpha \\Delta T L\\), where L is the length of each segment.\n\nSo, for both segments, \\(\\delta = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\times 18 = 468 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.000468\\) inches.\n\nBut that can't be right because the lengths are different.\n\nWait, no: \\(\\delta = \\alpha \\Delta T L\\), where L is the length of each segment.\n\nFor segment AB: \\(L_{AB} = 1.5\\) ft \\(= 18\\) in.\n\n\\(\\delta_{AB} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\times 18 = 468 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.000468\\) inches.\n\nFor segment BC: same length, so same expansion.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought segment BC is prismatic, but both segments have the same length L/2 = 1.5 ft.\n\nSo, both segments want to expand by the same amount \\(\\delta = 0.000468\\) inches.\n\nBut since they are connected and fixed at both ends, the net displacement at B should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the reactions at A and C must be such that they prevent any expansion.\n\nThe force required to prevent expansion in each segment can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nFor segment AB:\n\n\\[ F_{AB} = \\frac{E A_{AB}}{L_{AB}} \\delta_{AB} \\]\n\nBut since it's a tapered bar, I need to use the average area.\n\nSimilarly, for segment BC:\n\n\\[ F_{BC} = \\frac{E A_{BC}}{L_{BC}} \\delta_{BC} \\]\n\nThen, the total force required is \\(F_{total} = F_{AB} + F_{BC}\\), and the reactions at A and C would be half of that each, assuming symmetry.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire bar's behavior.\n\nLet me try to calculate the force in each segment due to the reactions.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the reactions at A and C are \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_C\\), respectively.\n\nSince the bar is symmetric, \\(R_A = R_C\\).\n\nThe internal force in segment AB would be \\(R_A\\), and in segment BC, it would be \\(R_C\\).\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the internal force should be continuous.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to set up the equilibrium equations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the equilibrium of the entire bar.\n\nSum of forces in the x-direction: \\(R_A + R_C = 0\\), since there are no external loads.\n\nBut that doesn't account for the thermal expansion.\n\nAlternatively, consider the compatibility condition: the displacement at B should be zero.\n\nThe displacement at B due to thermal expansion is \\(\\delta = \\alpha \\Delta T L\\), and the displacement due to the reactions is \\(\\delta_{reaction} = \\frac{R \\times L}{E A}\\), but again, for the tapered section, I need to use the average area.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should use the principle of virtual work to find the reactions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the force in a bar due to temperature change and restrained expansion.\n\nFor a prismatic bar, \\(F = \\alpha E A \\Delta T\\).\n\nFor the tapered section, perhaps I can use the average area.\n\nEarlier, I calculated \\(k_{AB} = 325,000\\) lb/in and \\(k_{BC} = 288,888.89\\) lb/in, and \\(k_{total} = 153,000\\) lb/in.\n\nThen, the reaction force \\(R = k_{total} \\times \\delta = 153,000 \\times 0.000468 \\approx 71.64\\) lb, which is 0.07164 kips.\n\nBut this is much smaller than the options provided.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in calculating the thermal expansion.\n\nLet me recalculate \\(\\delta\\):\n\n\\(\\delta = \\alpha \\times L \\times \\Delta T = 13 \\times 10^{-6} /^\\circ F \\times 36 \\text{ in.} \\times 20^\\circ F = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 36 \\times 20\\)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, \\(13 \\times 36 = 468\\)\n\nThen, \\(468 \\times 20 = 9360\\)\n\nSo, \\"
