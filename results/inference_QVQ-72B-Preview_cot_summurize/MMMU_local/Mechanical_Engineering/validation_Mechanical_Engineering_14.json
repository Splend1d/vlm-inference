                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about rotational dynamics and energy, which can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem describes a 1000-kg mass being lowered by a cable from a drum. The drum has a diameter of 550 mm, weighs 2.5 kN, and has a radius of gyration of 250 mm. The mass is being lowered at a uniform rate of 4 m/s. We need to find the kinetic energy in the system and then determine what additional brake torque is required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\n**Part (a): Kinetic Energy in the System**\n\nKinetic energy can be thought of as the energy an object has due to its motion. There are two types of kinetic energy here: translational kinetic energy of the mass and rotational kinetic energy of the drum.\n\n1. **Translational Kinetic Energy of the Mass:**\n\n   The mass is moving downward at a constant velocity of 4 m/s. Its kinetic energy is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   K.E._{trans} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\(m = 1000\\) kg\n   - \\(v = 4\\) m/s\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   K.E._{trans} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\times (4)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\times 16 = 8000 \\text{ J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotational Kinetic Energy of the Drum:**\n\n   The drum is rotating as it reels in the cable. We need to find its angular velocity and moment of inertia to calculate its rotational kinetic energy.\n\n   First, find the angular velocity (\\(\\omega\\)) of the drum. The linear velocity of the mass is related to the angular velocity of the drum by:\n\n   \\[\n   v = r \\omega\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\(v = 4\\) m/s\n   - \\(r\\) is the radius of the drum\n\n   Given the diameter is 550 mm, the radius is:\n\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{550}{2} = 275 \\text{ mm} = 0.275 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} = \\frac{4}{0.275} \\approx 14.55 \\text{ rad/s}\n   \\]\n\n   Next, find the moment of inertia (\\(I\\)) of the drum. The moment of inertia can be found using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   I = mk^2\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\(m\\) is the mass of the drum\n   - \\(k\\) is the radius of gyration\n\n   First, we need to find the mass of the drum. We know its weight is 2.5 kN:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{weight} = m g \\implies m = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{g} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 255 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n   Given the radius of gyration \\(k = 250\\) mm = 0.25 m,\n\n   \\[\n   I = 255 \\times (0.25)^2 = 255 \\times 0.0625 = 15.9375 \\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n   Now, the rotational kinetic energy is:\n\n   \\[\n   K.E._{rot} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.9375 \\times (14.55)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.9375 \\times 211.7025 \\approx 1723 \\text{ J}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Kinetic Energy:**\n\n   \\[\n   K.E._{total} = K.E._{trans} + K.E._{rot} = 8000 + 1723 = 9723 \\text{ J}\n   \\]\n\n   Looking at the options, the closest value is 9673 J. There might be a slight calculation error due to rounding, but option A lists 9673 J, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Part (b): Additional Brake Torque Required**\n\nWe need to find the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nFirst, understand the current situation:\n\n- The drum is rotating at an angular velocity of approximately 14.55 rad/s.\n\n- A brake is already applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m to maintain the uniform rate of descent.\n\nWe need to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nTo find the required torque, we can use the formula for angular acceleration:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\omega_f - \\omega_i}{t} = \\frac{0 - 14.55}{0.6} \\approx -24.25 \\text{ rad/s}^2\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates deceleration.\n\nThe torque required to produce this angular acceleration is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = I \\alpha = 15.9375 \\times (-24.25) \\approx -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThis is the total torque required to decelerate the drum to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nHowever, there is already a brake applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m.\n\nTherefore, the additional brake torque needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = \\tau_{total} - \\tau_{existing} = (-386.3) - 2698 = -3084.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of the torque, but the problem likely just wants the magnitude.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- Option A: 9673J, 2218N\u00b7m\n\n- Option B: 5723J, 1218N\u00b7m\n\n- Option C: 9673J, 1218N\u00b7m\n\n- Option D: 5723J, 2218N\u00b7m\n\nGiven that my calculations suggest the kinetic energy is approximately 9673 J and the additional torque required is around 3084 N\u00b7m, none of the options exactly match my calculations. However, considering possible rounding errors and the fact that the exact calculations aren't provided, I need to choose the closest option.\n\nOption C has 9673J and 1218N\u00b7m, which is closer to my kinetic energy calculation but not close for the torque. Option D has 5723J and 2218N\u00b7m, which doesn't match my kinetic energy calculation but has a torque value closer to my calculation.\n\nGiven that, I might have made a mistake in calculating the additional torque.\n\nLet me re-examine the torque calculation.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Current brake torque: 2698 N\u00b7m (assuming this torque is already providing some deceleration, but it's maintaining a constant velocity, so perhaps it's balancing some other torque, like the torque due to the weight of the mass.)\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the torque due to the weight of the mass.\n\nThe weight of the mass is pulling downward, which translates to a torque on the drum.\n\nThe torque due to the weight is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_w = r \\times F = 0.275 \\times (1000 \\times 9.81) = 0.275 \\times 9810 = 2698 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nInteresting, this matches the existing brake torque of 2698 N\u00b7m.\n\nSo, the drum is in equilibrium with the brake torque balancing the torque due to the weight of the mass, resulting in a constant angular velocity.\n\nNow, to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds, we need to apply an additional torque to overcome both the weight torque and to decelerate the drum.\n\nSo, the total torque required is the torque to overcome the weight torque and the torque to decelerate the drum.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{total} = \\tau_{\\text{to decelerate}} + \\tau_{w}\n\\]\n\nWe already calculated \\(\\tau_{\\text{to decelerate}} \\approx -386.3\\) N\u00b7m and \\(\\tau_{w} = 2698\\) N\u00b7m.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{total} = (-386.3) + 2698 = 2311.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the existing brake is already applying 2698 N\u00b7m, which is more than the required total torque of 2311.7 N\u00b7m.\n\nThis suggests that the existing brake torque is sufficient to bring the system to rest, but that doesn't make sense because it's currently maintaining a constant velocity.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the total torque required is the torque to decelerate the drum plus the torque to counteract the weight torque.\n\nBut since the existing brake is already applying 2698 N\u00b7m, which is equal to the weight torque, perhaps the additional torque needed is just the torque to decelerate the drum.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = \\tau_{\\text{to decelerate}} = -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nBut this is less than the existing brake torque, which is 2698 N\u00b7m.\n\nThis suggests that the brake torque needs to be reduced, but that doesn't align with bringing the system to rest.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me consider the net torque required to bring the drum to rest.\n\nThe net torque required is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{net} = I \\alpha = 15.9375 \\times (-24.25) \\approx -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThe existing brake torque is 2698 N\u00b7m, which is likely opposing the weight torque.\n\nThe weight torque is 2698 N\u00b7m, so the net torque due to the brake and weight is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{net} = \\tau_{brake} - \\tau_{w} = 2698 - 2698 = 0 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nWhich explains why the system is in equilibrium and moving at constant velocity.\n\nTo achieve the deceleration, we need to apply an additional brake torque such that:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{net} = \\tau_{brake, total} - \\tau_{w} = -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{brake, total} = \\tau_{w} + \\tau_{net} = 2698 + (-386.3) = 2311.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the additional brake torque needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = \\tau_{brake, total} - \\tau_{brake, existing} = 2311.7 - 2698 = -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the brake torque needs to be reduced by 386.3 N\u00b7m, which doesn't make sense because we need to decelerate the system.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the direction of the torques.\n\nLet's consider the directions carefully.\n\n- The weight of the mass applies a torque that tends to rotate the drum in one direction (let's say clockwise).\n\n- The brake applies a torque in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) to maintain the constant velocity.\n\n- To bring the system to rest, we need to apply additional brake torque in the same direction as the existing brake torque (counterclockwise) to overcome the weight torque and decelerate the drum.\n\nTherefore, the total brake torque needed is 2311.7 N\u00b7m, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the additional brake torque required is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = 2311.7 - 2698 = -386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nBut since we can't have negative additional torque, perhaps I need to consider that the existing brake torque is already providing some deceleration, but in reality, it's maintaining constant velocity, so it's balancing the weight torque.\n\nI think I need to consider that the existing brake torque is exactly balancing the weight torque, so to decelerate, I need to apply additional torque beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing brake torque includes the torque needed to balance the weight plus some additional torque for deceleration.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider the power required to bring the system to rest.\n\nPower is the rate at which work is done, and work is equal to change in kinetic energy.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is approximately 9673 J, and we need to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nThe power required is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\Delta K.E.}{t} = \\frac{9673}{0.6} \\approx 16121.67 \\text{ W}\n\\]\n\nNow, power is also equal to torque times angular velocity:\n\n\\[\nP = \\tau \\omega\n\\]\n\nWe can find the required torque using this equation.\n\nFirst, find the angular velocity of the drum, which is approximately 14.55 rad/s.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{P}{\\omega} = \\frac{16121.67}{14.55} \\approx 1108 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThis would be the total torque required to dissipate the kinetic energy in 0.60 seconds.\n\nGiven that the existing brake torque is 2698 N\u00b7m, the additional torque needed would be:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = 1108 - 2698 = -1590 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this suggests reducing the brake torque, which doesn't align with decelerating the system.\n\nI must be missing something fundamental here.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the forces acting on the mass and the drum together.\n\nThe mass is being lowered at 4 m/s, and the drum is rotating at a constant angular velocity.\n\nTo bring the system to rest, both the mass and the drum need to come to rest.\n\nLet's consider the dynamics of the system.\n\nThe force acting on the mass is its weight (mg = 9810 N) and the tension in the cable (T).\n\nThe net force on the mass is:\n\n\\[\nF_{net} = mg - T = m a\n\\]\n\nSince the mass is being lowered at a constant velocity, \\(a = 0\\), so:\n\n\\[\nmg - T = 0 \\implies T = mg = 9810 \\text{ N}\n\\]\n\nThis tension in the cable exerts a torque on the drum:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = r T = 0.275 \\times 9810 = 2698 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the existing brake torque, confirming that the brake is balancing the torque due to the tension in the cable to maintain constant velocity.\n\nNow, to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds, we need to apply additional brake torque to decelerate both the mass and the drum.\n\nThe angular acceleration of the drum is:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\omega_f - \\omega_i}{t} = \\frac{0 - 14.55}{0.6} \\approx -24.25 \\text{ rad/s}^2\n\\]\n\nThe torque required to produce this angular acceleration is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\text{decelerate}} = I \\alpha = 15.9375 \\times 24.25 \\approx 386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nBut since it's deceleration, the torque should be in the opposite direction, hence negative.\n\nThe total torque required is the torque to counteract the tension torque plus the torque to decelerate the drum.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{total} = -\\tau_{tension} + \\tau_{\\text{decelerate}} = -2698 + (-386.3) = -3084.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThis means the total brake torque needed is 3084.3 N\u00b7m in the decelerating direction.\n\nGiven that the existing brake torque is 2698 N\u00b7m in the opposing direction, the additional torque required is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = 3084.3 - 2698 = 386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nWait, but earlier I had a negative sign, which confused me.\n\nLet me clarify the directions.\n\nLet's assume:\n\n- Clockwise rotation is positive.\n\n- The weight torque is clockwise.\n\n- The brake torque is counterclockwise.\n\nSo, existing brake torque is 2698 N\u00b7m counterclockwise, balancing the weight torque of 2698 N\u00b7m clockwise.\n\nTo decelerate, we need an additional torque of 386.3 N\u00b7m counterclockwise (since deceleration is counterclockwise).\n\nTherefore, the total brake torque required is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{total} = 2698 + 386.3 = 3084.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the additional torque needed is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_{additional} = 3084.3 - 2698 = 386.3 \\text{ N\u00b7m}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Option A: 9673J, 2218N\u00b7m\n\n- Option B: 5723J, 1218N\u00b7m\n\n- Option C: 9673J, 12"
