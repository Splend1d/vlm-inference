                    "text": "So I have this control system block diagram, and I need to find the range of K for which the system is stable using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to understand the block diagram. There's an input R(s), an error E(s), and the output C(s). There's a summing junction with a plus and a minus sign, indicating that the error is the difference between the input and the feedback.\n\nThe forward path has a transfer function of K(s + 1) over s(s + 2)(s + 3), and the feedback path has a transfer function of (s + 5)/(s + 7).\n\nTo find the overall transfer function, I think I need to find C(s)/R(s). Generally, for a feedback system, C(s)/R(s) = G(s)/(1 + G(s)H(s)), where G(s) is the forward path transfer function and H(s) is the feedback path transfer function.\n\nSo, G(s) = K(s + 1)/(s(s + 2)(s + 3)) and H(s) = (s + 5)/(s + 7).\n\nAssuming it's a negative feedback system, which it seems like from the summing junction, the overall transfer function should be G(s)/(1 + G(s)H(s)).\n\nFirst, let's find G(s)H(s):\n\nG(s)H(s) = [K(s + 1)/(s(s + 2)(s + 3))] * [(s + 5)/(s + 7)] = K(s + 1)(s + 5)/(s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7))\n\nNow, 1 + G(s)H(s) = 1 + K(s + 1)(s + 5)/(s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7))\n\nThe denominator of C(s)/R(s) is 1 + G(s)H(s), and the system is stable if this denominator doesn't have any poles in the right-half plane, i.e., no positive real parts.\n\nSo, I need to find the characteristic equation, which is 1 + G(s)H(s) = 0.\n\nLet's set 1 + G(s)H(s) = 0:\n\n1 + K(s + 1)(s + 5)/(s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7)) = 0\n\nNow, multiply both sides by s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7) to eliminate the denominator:\n\ns(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7) + K(s + 1)(s + 5) = 0\n\nExpand both terms:\n\nFirst term: s(s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 7)\n\nLet's expand step by step:\n\n(s + 2)(s + 3) = s^2 + 5s + 6\n\nNow, (s^2 + 5s + 6)(s + 7) = s^3 + 7s^2 + 5s^2 + 35s + 6s + 42 = s^3 + 12s^2 + 41s + 42\n\nSecond term: K(s + 1)(s + 5)\n\n(s + 1)(s + 5) = s^2 + 6s + 5\n\nSo, K(s^2 + 6s + 5) = Ks^2 + 6Ks + 5K\n\nNow, the characteristic equation is:\n\ns^3 + 12s^2 + 41s + 42 + Ks^2 + 6Ks + 5K = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ns^3 + (12 + K)s^2 + (41 + 6K)s + (42 + 5K) = 0\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\ns^3 + (12 + K)s^2 + (41 + 6K)s + (42 + 5K) = 0\n\nNow, I need to apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to this equation to find the range of K for which all the roots have negative real parts.\n\nFirst, list the coefficients of the characteristic equation:\n\na3 = 1 (coefficient of s^3)\n\na2 = 12 + K\n\na1 = 41 + 6K\n\na0 = 42 + 5K\n\nThe Routh array is built as follows:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: 41 + 6K\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nNow, the first element of each row for s^3, s^2, s^1, s^0 is:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: (41 + 6K) - (1)(something)\n\nWait, I think I need to calculate the second element of the s^1 row.\n\nThe formula for the second element of the s^1 row is:\n\nb = (a3 * a1) - (a2 * a3)\n\nWait, no. The Routh array is built by dividing the coefficients.\n\nLet me recall the steps for building the Routh array.\n\nFor the s^3 row: 1\n\nFor the s^2 row: 12 + K\n\nFor the s^1 row: c = (12 + K)(1) - (1)(41 + 6K) / (12 + K)\n\nWait, no. Actually, the Routh array is built by dividing the coefficients in a specific way.\n\nLet me write it again:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: (41 + 6K)/(12 + K)\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nWait, no. That's not correct.\n\nActually, the Routh array is built as follows:\n\nFirst row:\n\ns^3: a3 = 1\n\ns^1: (a3 * a1) - (a2 * a3) / a3 = (1 * (41 + 6K)) - ((12 + K) * 1) / 1 = (41 + 6K) - (12 + K) = 29 + 5K\n\nSecond row:\n\ns^2: a2 = 12 + K\n\ns^0: (12 + K)(42 + 5K) - (1)(42 + 5K) / (12 + K) = [(12 + K)(42 + 5K) - 42 - 5K] / (12 + K)\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the correct way to build the Routh array.\n\nOkay, the Routh array is built as follows:\n\nFirst row:\n\ns^3: a3 = 1\n\ns^1: (a3 * a1 - a2 * a0) / a3 = (1 * (41 + 6K) - (12 + K)(42 + 5K)) / 1\n\nWait, no. Actually, the Routh array is built by dividing the coefficients in a specific manner.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nThe Routh array for a characteristic equation a3 s^3 + a2 s^2 + a1 s + a0 = 0 is:\n\ns^3: a3\n\ns^2: a2\n\ns^1: (a2 * a0 - a3 * a1) / a2\n\ns^0: a0\n\nWait, but in this case, since a3 is 1, which is positive, we can proceed.\n\nSo, let's build the Routh array:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: [(12 + K)(41 + 6K) - 1*(42 + 5K)] / (12 + K)\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nNow, let's compute s^1:\n\n(12 + K)(41 + 6K) - (42 + 5K)\n\nFirst, expand (12 + K)(41 + 6K):\n\n12*41 + 12*6K + K*41 + K*6K = 492 + 72K + 41K + 6K^2 = 6K^2 + 113K + 492\n\nThen, subtract (42 + 5K): 6K^2 + 113K + 492 - 42 - 5K = 6K^2 + 108K + 450\n\nNow, divide by (12 + K):\n\n(6K^2 + 108K + 450) / (12 + K)\n\nLet's factor out 6:\n\n6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\nNow, K^2 + 18K + 75 divided by 12 + K.\n\nLet's perform the polynomial division:\n\nDivide K^2 by K to get K, then multiply (12 + K) by K to get 12K + K^2.\n\nSubtract: K^2 + 18K + 75 - (K^2 + 12K) = 6K + 75\n\nNow, divide 6K by K to get 6, multiply (12 + K) by 6 to get 72 + 6K.\n\nSubtract: 6K + 75 - (72 + 6K) = 3\n\nSo, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K^2 + 12K) + (6K + 72) + 3 = K(K + 12) + 6(K + 12) + 3 = (K + 6)(K + 12) + 3\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should try factoring K^2 + 18K + 75.\n\nThe factors of 75 that add up to 18 are 15 and 3.\n\nSo, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 15)(K + 5)\n\nWait, 15 + 5 = 20, which is not 18. Maybe 15 and 3.\n\nK^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 15)(K + 5) = K^2 + 20K + 75, which is not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 15)(K + 3) = K^2 + 18K + 45, which is not 75.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in factoring.\n\nLet me try completing the square or using the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n\nThe quadratic is K^2 + 18K + 75.\n\nThe discriminant is D = b^2 - 4ac = 18^2 - 4*1*75 = 324 - 300 = 24\n\nSo, K = [-18 \u00b1 sqrt(24)] / 2 = -9 \u00b1 sqrt(6)\n\nThus, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 9 - sqrt(6))(K + 9 + sqrt(6))\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should try polynomial long division.\n\nDivide K^2 + 18K + 75 by K + 12:\n\nK + 12 ) K^2 + 18K + 75\n\nFirst term: K divided by K is 1K\n\nMultiply: 1K * (K + 12) = K^2 + 12K\n\nSubtract: (K^2 + 18K + 75) - (K^2 + 12K) = 6K + 75\n\nNow, divide 6K by K to get 6\n\nMultiply: 6 * (K + 12) = 6K + 72\n\nSubtract: (6K + 75) - (6K + 72) = 3\n\nSo, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 12)(K + 6) + 3\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought it was (K + 15)(K + 5), but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division.\n\nLet me try dividing K^2 + 18K + 75 by K + 12 again.\n\nK + 12 ) K^2 + 18K + 75\n\nFirst term: K divided by K is 1K\n\nMultiply: 1K * (K + 12) = K^2 + 12K\n\nSubtract: (K^2 + 18K + 75) - (K^2 + 12K) = 6K + 75\n\nNow, divide 6K by K to get 6\n\nMultiply: 6 * (K + 12) = 6K + 72\n\nSubtract: (6K + 75) - (6K + 72) = 3\n\nSo, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 12)(K + 6) + 3\n\nWait, but (K + 12)(K + 6) = K^2 + 18K + 72, and adding 3 makes K^2 + 18K + 75.\n\nSo, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 12)(K + 6) + 3\n\nNow, going back to the division:\n\n(6K^2 + 108K + 450) / (12 + K) = 6*(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K) = 6*((K + 12)(K + 6) + 3) / (12 + K)\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should factor out a 6:\n\n6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K) = 6*(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\nNow, K^2 + 18K + 75 = (K + 12)(K + 6) + 3\n\nSo, 6*(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K) = 6*((K + 12)(K + 6) + 3) / (12 + K)\n\nThis still seems messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave it as 6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\nNow, in the Routh array, this would be the entry for s^1.\n\nSo, s^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: 6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nNow, to apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, all the elements in the first column must be positive, and there should be no sign changes.\n\nBut with this complicated expression for s^1, it's difficult to determine the conditions on K.\n\nMaybe I need to find another way to simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the denominator of C(s)/R(s), which is 1 + G(s)H(s), and set it equal to zero, then find the roots and see for which K values all roots have negative real parts.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the characteristic equation again and see if I can factor it or find its roots.\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\ns^3 + (12 + K)s^2 + (41 + 6K)s + (42 + 5K) = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in s, and I need to ensure that all its roots have negative real parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Routh array with the expression for s^1 as it is and try to find the conditions for stability.\n\nLet me try to build the Routh array step by step.\n\nFirst row:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^1: 6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\nSecond row:\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nNow, the Routh array is:\n\ns^3: 1\n\ns^2: 12 + K\n\ns^1: 6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K)\n\ns^0: 42 + 5K\n\nFor the system to be stable, all the elements in the first column must be positive.\n\nSo, 1 > 0 (always true)\n\n12 + K > 0 \u21d2 K > -12\n\n6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K) > 0\n\nAnd 42 + 5K > 0 \u21d2 K > -42/5 = -8.4\n\nNow, 6(K^2 + 18K + 75) / (12 + K) > 0\n\nSince 6 > 0 and (12 + K) > 0 (from earlier), we need (K^2 + 18K + 75) > 0\n\nNow, K^2 + 18K + 75 > 0\n\nEarlier, I found that the roots are K = -9 \u00b1 sqrt(6), which are both negative.\n\nWait, earlier I tried to factor K^2 + 18K + 75 and got K = [-18 \u00b1 sqrt(24)]/2 = -9 \u00b1 sqrt(6)\n\nSo, the roots are K = -9 + sqrt(6) and K = -9 - sqrt(6)\n\nSince sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so K = -9 + 2.449 \ufffd"
