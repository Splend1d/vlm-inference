                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about a bolted joint. The bolt is made from cold-drawn steel, and it's clamping steel plates together. The load on the bolt fluctuates between 0 and 8,000 pounds, and the clamped plates have a stiffness that's six times the bolt's stiffness. I need to find two things:\n\n(a) The minimum required initial preload to prevent loss of compression in the plates.\n\n(b) The minimum force in the plates when the preload is 8,500 pounds.\n\nAnd there are options provided for the answers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a bolt clamping two plates together. The load \\(F_a\\) varies from 0 to 8,000 lb, and the stiffness of the clamped plates \\(k_c\\) is six times the bolt's stiffness \\(k_b\\). The bolt's stiffness is given as \\(k_b = 5k_b\\), but that seems like a typo. Probably, it should be \\(k_c = 6k_b\\), since it's mentioned that the clamped plates have a stiffness six times the bolt's stiffness. So, I'll assume \\(k_c = 6k_b\\).\n\nFor part (a), I need to find the minimum initial preload \\(F_p\\) to prevent loss of compression in the plates. That means I need to ensure that the force in the bolt never drops to zero under the varying load.\n\nIn a bolted joint, the total force on the bolt \\(F_t\\) is the sum of the preload \\(F_p\\) and the applied load \\(F_a\\), but considering the stiffnesses of both the bolt and the clamped plates.\n\nThe relationship between the forces and displacements in the bolt and the plates can be expressed using their stiffnesses.\n\nThe formula for the force in the bolt \\(F_b\\) under applied load \\(F_a\\) is:\n\n\\[F_b = F_p + \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c} F_a\\]\n\nAnd the force in the plates \\(F_c\\) is:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p + \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} F_a\\]\n\nTo prevent loss of compression, \\(F_b\\) should always be greater than zero. So, for the minimum preload, set \\(F_b\\) to zero when \\(F_a\\) is at its maximum (8,000 lb):\n\n\\[0 = F_p + \\frac{k_b}{k_b + 6k_b} \\times 8000\\]\\[0 = F_p + \\frac{k_b}{7k_b} \\times 8000\\]\\[0 = F_p + \\frac{1}{7} \\times 8000\\]\\[0 = F_p + 1142.86\\]\\[F_p = -1142.86\\]\n\nBut preload can't be negative, so this suggests that even with zero preload, the bolt won't go into tension under the applied load. However, in reality, we need to ensure that the bolt doesn't lose compression, meaning \\(F_b > 0\\).\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the preload should be such that \\(F_b \\geq\\) some minimum value, but typically, we ensure \\(F_b \\geq 0\\). Since the calculation gives a negative value, it indicates that with any positive preload, \\(F_b\\) will remain positive under the applied load.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the minimum and maximum forces.\n\nLet me think differently. In machine design, to prevent loosening, the minimum bolt force should be greater than or equal to the minimum clamping force required.\n\nThe minimum bolt force \\(F_{b_{\\text{min}}}\\) is:\n\n\\[F_{b_{\\text{min}}} = F_p - \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c} F_{a_{\\text{max}}}\\]\n\nGiven \\(F_{a_{\\text{max}}} = 8000 \\, \\text{lb}\\), and \\(k_c = 6k_b\\):\n\n\\[F_{b_{\\text{min}}} = F_p - \\frac{k_b}{k_b + 6k_b} \\times 8000 = F_p - \\frac{1}{7} \\times 8000 = F_p - 1142.86\\]\n\nSet \\(F_{b_{\\text{min}}} \\geq 0\\):\n\n\\[F_p - 1142.86 \\geq 0\\]\\[F_p \\geq 1142.86 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this value. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the minimum preload to prevent loosening:\n\n\\[F_p \\geq \\frac{F_{a_{\\text{max}}}}{k_c/k_b + 1}\\]\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\):\n\n\\[F_p \\geq \\frac{8000}{6/1 + 1} = \\frac{8000}{7} \\approx 1142.86 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nAgain, the same value, but it's not matching any options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the coefficient of friction or something else, but the problem doesn't mention any friction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the preload should be higher to account for the fluctuating load.\n\nLet me check the formula again.\n\nIn bolted joints, the preload is often set to be higher than just the applied load to ensure that the clamping force doesn't drop below a certain level.\n\nPerhaps I need to use the formula:\n\n\\[F_p \\geq \\frac{F_{a_{\\text{max}}}}{k_c/k_b} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to ensure that the minimum bolt force is a certain percentage of the preload to prevent loosening.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me look at part (b) for a moment.\n\nPart (b) asks for the minimum force in the plates when the preload is 8,500 lb.\n\nFirst, I need to find the force in the plates \\(F_c\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p + \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} F_a\\]\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\):\n\n\\[F_c = F_p + \\frac{6k_b}{k_b + 6k_b} F_a = F_p + \\frac{6}{7} F_a\\]\n\nSo, \\(F_c = F_p + \\frac{6}{7} F_a\\)\n\nGiven \\(F_p = 8500 \\, \\text{lb}\\), and \\(F_a\\) fluctuates between 0 and 8,000 lb.\n\nThe minimum \\(F_c\\) would be when \\(F_a = 0\\):\n\n\\[F_{c_{\\text{min}}} = 8500 + \\frac{6}{7} \\times 0 = 8500 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the maximum \\(F_a\\), but that would give \\(F_{c_{\\text{max}}} = 8500 + \\frac{6}{7} \\times 8000 = 8500 + 6857.14 = 15,357.14 \\, \\text{lb}\\), which is also not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the force in the plates differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula for the force in the plates considering the stiffnesses.\n\nLet me recall that in a bolted joint, the force in the plates \\(F_c\\) is related to the bolt force \\(F_b\\) and the applied load \\(F_a\\) by:\n\n\\[F_c = F_b - F_a\\]\n\nBut I think that's not correct. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, the force in the plates is the preload plus the portion of the applied load carried by the plates.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to use the formula:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p + \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} F_a\\]\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\), as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula for the force in the plates as:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p \\times \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} + F_a \\times \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c}\\]\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I had before.\n\nLet me try calculating it again.\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\), then:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p \\times \\frac{6k_b}{7k_b} + F_a \\times \\frac{k_b}{7k_b} = F_p \\times \\frac{6}{7} + F_a \\times \\frac{1}{7}\\]\n\nSo, \\(F_c = \\frac{6}{7} F_p + \\frac{1}{7} F_a\\)\n\nGiven \\(F_p = 8500 \\, \\text{lb}\\), and \\(F_a\\) varies from 0 to 8,000 lb.\n\nThe minimum \\(F_c\\) would be when \\(F_a = 0\\):\n\n\\[F_{c_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{6}{7} \\times 8500 = 6 \\times 1,214.29 = 7,285.71 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nBut that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the force in the plates is:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p + F_a \\times \\frac{k_c}{k_b + k_c} = F_p + F_a \\times \\frac{6}{7}\\]\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the plates are in compression, and the bolt is in tension, and there's a relationship between their displacements.\n\nLet me think about the displacement compatibility.\n\nThe displacement of the bolt \\(\\delta_b\\) and the displacement of the plates \\(\\delta_c\\) must be equal under the applied load.\n\n\\[\\delta_b = \\frac{F_b}{k_b}, \\quad \\delta_c = \\frac{F_c}{k_c}\\]\n\nSince \\(\\delta_b = \\delta_c\\), then:\n\n\\[\\frac{F_b}{k_b} = \\frac{F_c}{k_c}\\]\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\), then:\n\n\\[\\frac{F_b}{k_b} = \\frac{F_c}{6k_b} \\implies F_c = 6F_b\\]\n\nBut also, the total force balance is:\n\n\\[F_b + F_c = F_p + F_a\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(F_c = 6F_b\\):\n\n\\[F_b + 6F_b = F_p + F_a \\implies 7F_b = F_p + F_a \\implies F_b = \\frac{F_p + F_a}{7}\\]\n\nAnd \\(F_c = 6F_b = \\frac{6}{7}(F_p + F_a)\\)\n\nSo, \\(F_c = \\frac{6}{7} F_p + \\frac{6}{7} F_a\\)\n\nGiven \\(F_p = 8500 \\, \\text{lb}\\), and \\(F_a\\) varies from 0 to 8,000 lb.\n\nThe minimum \\(F_c\\) would be when \\(F_a = 0\\):\n\n\\[F_{c_{\\text{min}}} = \\frac{6}{7} \\times 8500 = 6 \\times 1,214.29 = 7,285.71 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the force in the plates is:\n\n\\[F_c = F_p - F_a \\times \\frac{k_b}{k_b + k_c}\\]\n\nGiven \\(k_c = 6k_b\\):\n\n\\[F_c = F_p - F_a \\times \\frac{k_b}{7k_b} = F_p - \\frac{1}{7} F_a\\]\n\nBut that would mean:\n\n\\[F_c = 8500 - \\frac{1}{7} \\times 8,000 = 8500 - 1,142.86 = 7,357.14 \\, \\text{lb}\\]\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. 7522lb,1643lb\n\nB. 6857lb,1643lb\n\nC. 7522lb,1728lb\n\nD. 6857lb,1728lb\n\nFor part (a), my earlier calculation gave approximately 1,143 lb, but that's not in the options.
