To investigate whether this association also exists in the Chinese population, the University of Oxford (UK), in collaboration with Professor Li Liming's group at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), recruited 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 different regions of China (including five cities and five villages) between June 2004 and July 2008, to investigate the association between the use of fresh fruits and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. The study investigated the relationship between fresh fruit use and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. Five frequency criteria were set for the main exposure factor \"fruit intake\": \"never eat fruit\", \"once a month\", \"1-3 times a week\", \"4-6 times a week\", \"every day \", which were filled in by the respondents themselves.The primary cardiovascular disease death was used as the outcome event in this study. Survival and health status of all subjects were regularly reported to the disease surveillance system of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their data were checked against the health insurance records of the investigated subjects' localities and confirmed by the street or village committees. Coding was based on the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases.After 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 451,665 subjects completed the follow-up after excluding lost and ineligible subjects. Those who consumed fresh fruit daily were found to have a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg, a reduction in blood glucose of about 0.5 mmol/L, a 40% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, and a 34%, 25%, and 36% reduction in the risk of major coronary heart disease events, ischemic strokes, and cerebral hemorrhages, respectively, when compared with those who consumed very little fresh fruit. Their fruit intake and cardiovascular disease profiles were shown in the table below.<image 1>What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?\n\nA. point prevalence and period prevalence\nB. mortality rate and case fatality rate\nC. cumulative incidence and incidence density\nD.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this study about fruit intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in China. It's interesting because most research on this topic has been done in Western countries, and China has different patterns of fruit consumption and higher stroke rates. The study looked at 512,891 adults aged 30-79 from various regions in China between 2004 and 2008. They categorized fruit intake into five groups: never, once a month, 1-3 times a week, 4-6 times a week, and every day. The main outcome is death from CVD.\n\nFrom the table provided, we can see the number of observers in each category and the number of deaths from CVD. For example, 28,479 people never eat fruit, and among them, 735 died from CVD. On the other hand, 81,386 people eat fruit every day, and 452 died from CVD.\n\nThe study found that those who eat fruit daily have a lower risk of CVD death compared to those who eat very little fruit. Specifically, daily fruit eaters had a 40% reduced risk of CVD death, and reductions in systolic blood pressure and blood glucose levels.\n\nNow, the question is asking about appropriate indicators for describing the risk of morbidity in different population groups. The options are:\n\nA. Point prevalence and period prevalence\n\nB. Mortality rate and case fatality rate\n\nC. Cumulative incidence and incidence density\n\nD. PYLL and DALY\n\nFirst, let's clarify what each of these terms means.\n\n**Point prevalence:** This is the proportion of a population that has a particular disease at a specific point in time.\n\n**Period prevalence:** This is the proportion of a population that has a particular disease during a specified time interval.\n\n**Mortality rate:** This is the rate of death in a population over a specific period, usually expressed per 1,000 or 100,000 people.\n\n**Case fatality rate:** This is the proportion of individuals with a particular disease who die from that disease within a specified period.\n\n**Cumulative incidence:** This is the probability that a person will develop a disease over a specified period.\n\n**Incidence density:** Also known as incidence rate, this measures the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period.\n\n**PYLL (Years of Potential Life Lost):** This is a measure that sums the years of life lost due to premature death.\n\n**DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years):** This is a measure that combines years lost due to premature death and years lived with disability.\n\nThe question is about describing the risk of morbidity in various population groups. Morbidity refers to the incidence or prevalence of disease.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**Option A: Point prevalence and period prevalence**\n\n- These measures are related to the prevalence of a disease in a population at a particular time or over a period.\n\n- They are useful for understanding how common a disease is in a population but do not directly measure the risk of developing the disease.\n\n**Option B: Mortality rate and case fatality rate**\n\n- Mortality rate measures the frequency of deaths in a population.\n\n- Case fatality rate measures the proportion of deaths among individuals diagnosed with a disease.\n\n- These measures are more related to the severity and fatal outcomes of disease rather than the risk of developing the disease.\n\n**Option C: Cumulative incidence and incidence density**\n\n- Cumulative incidence measures the probability of developing a disease over a specified period.\n\n- Incidence density measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population.\n\n- These measures directly assess the risk of developing a disease and are commonly used in epidemiology to compare risks across different groups.\n\n**Option D: PYLL and DALY**\n\n- PYLL and DALY are measures of disease burden that combine years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with disability.\n\n- While they provide comprehensive measures of health loss, they are not specifically indicators of morbidity risk.\n\nGiven these definitions, options C (cumulative incidence and incidence density) seem to be the most direct measures of morbidity risk in different population groups.\n\nBut let's think again. The question mentions \"risk of morbidity,\" which refers to the likelihood of developing a disease. Cumulative incidence is indeed a measure of this risk over a specified period. Incidence density also measures the rate at which new cases occur, which is another way to look at the risk of developing the disease.\n\nPoint prevalence and period prevalence, on the other hand, tell us how common the disease is at a particular time or over a period but don't directly measure the risk of developing the disease.\n\nMortality rate and case fatality rate are more about the fatal outcomes of disease, not about the risk of developing the disease.\n\nPYLL and DALY are broader measures of health loss due to disease, combining both mortality and morbidity, but again, they don't directly measure the risk of developing the disease.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate indicators for describing the risk of morbidity in various population groups would be cumulative incidence and incidence density.\n\nWait a minute, but in the study described, they talk about mortality from CVD, not necessarily morbidity. However, the question is general, asking about morbidity risk in different population groups.\n\nBut to answer the question accurately, we should consider what the study is focusing on. The study is looking at fruit intake and CVD mortality, but the question is about morbidity risk in general population groups.\n\nPerhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?\" In the context of the study, they might be referring to measures used to assess the relationship between fruit intake and CVD outcomes.\n\nHowever, based on standard epidemiological practices, cumulative incidence and incidence density are indeed measures of morbidity risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the study used other measures like relative risk or hazard ratios to assess the association between fruit intake and CVD mortality.\n\nBut given the options provided, cumulative incidence and incidence density are indeed appropriate measures for describing morbidity risk.\n\nLet me check again. In the table provided, we have the number of observers and the number of deaths from CVD. This seems to be a cohort study where participants are followed over time to see who develops the outcome (death from CVD).\n\nIn such studies, cumulative incidence could be calculated as the number of events divided by the total number of people at risk over a certain period. Incidence density (or incidence rate) could also be calculated by considering the person-time at risk.\n\nThese measures would allow us to compare the risk of CVD death across different fruit intake groups.\n\nOn the other hand, prevalence measures would not be as suitable because they don't account for the timing of disease onset or the risk over time.\n\nMortality rate is related to death, but the question specifies morbidity risk.\n\nPYLL and DALY are more complex measures that combine different aspects of health loss and are not directly measures of morbidity risk.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate indicators for describing morbidity risk in various population groups are cumulative incidence and incidence density.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC"
