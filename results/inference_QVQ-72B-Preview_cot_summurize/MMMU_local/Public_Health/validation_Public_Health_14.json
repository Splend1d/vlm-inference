                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I have a case-control study table here, and I need to calculate the odds ratio (OR). The options are 18, 16, 20, and 10. Okay, let's make sure I understand what an odds ratio is and how to calculate it.\n\nFirst off, in a case-control study, we have two groups: the case group and the control group. The case group consists of individuals who have the outcome of interest, and the control group consists of individuals who do not have that outcome. In this table, we're looking at exposure history. So, in the case group, there are 400 individuals with a history of exposure and 100 without. In the control group, there are 100 with a history of exposure and 400 without. The totals for each group are 500.\n\nNow, the odds ratio compares the odds of exposure in the case group to the odds of exposure in the control group. The formula for the odds ratio is:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a/b}{c/d}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(a\\) = number of cases with exposure = 400\n\n- \\(b\\) = number of cases without exposure = 100\n\n- \\(c\\) = number of controls with exposure = 100\n\n- \\(d\\) = number of controls without exposure = 400\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the odds of exposure in the case group and the odds of exposure in the control group, and then divide the two.\n\nLet's calculate the odds in the case group:\n\n\\[\n\\text{odds of exposure in cases} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{400}{100} = 4\n\\]\n\nAnd in the control group:\n\n\\[\n\\text{odds of exposure in controls} = \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{100}{400} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nNow, the odds ratio is the division of these two odds:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{4}{0.25} = 16\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that's 16, which is one of the options. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might use the formula:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c}\n\\]\n\nLet's try that method to confirm.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{400 \\times 400}{100 \\times 100} = \\frac{160000}{10000} = 16\n\\]\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same result, 16. So, the odds ratio is 16.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what this means. The odds ratio of 16 suggests that the odds of exposure are 16 times higher in the case group compared to the control group. In other words, there's a strong association between exposure and the outcome in this study.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any other way to interpret this table. Is there any chance that I might have misidentified which group is which? No, the table labels are clear: case group and control group, with exposure and no exposure in each.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the odds ratio should be calculated as \\(a*d / (b*c)\\) or \\(a*c / (b*d)\\). Wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong earlier. Let me look it up to confirm.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for the odds ratio in a case-control study is indeed:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a/d}{c/b} = \\frac{a \\times b}{c \\times d}\n\\]\n\nWait, no, actually, there's a confusion here. The standard formula is:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{a/d}{c/b} = \\frac{a \\times b}{c \\times d}\n\\]\n\nBut that seems off because it would simplify to \\(a \\times b / (c \\times d)\\), which is not the correct formula. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's recall that in a 2x2 contingency table, the odds ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{\\text{odds of exposure in cases}}{\\text{odds of exposure in controls}} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)} = \\frac{a \\times d}{b \\times c}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial calculation using \\(a \\times d / (b \\times c)\\) is right.\n\nGiven that, my calculation of 16 is accurate. But since the question provides multiple options, and 16 is one of them, I should check if there's any possibility of misinterpretation.\n\nLet me consider if the table might have been labeled incorrectly or if there's a transpose error. For example, if I mistakenly considered the rows and columns differently. But no, the table seems straightforward: case vs. control, with exposure and no exposure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that in a case-control study, the odds ratio can be calculated using the cross-product of the table.\n\nWait, but in any case, the calculation leads to 16, which is one of the options. So, I think the answer is 16.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's plug in the numbers again:\n\n\\[\nOR = \\frac{400 \\times 400}{100 \\times 100} = \\frac{160000}{10000} = 16\n\\]\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]"
