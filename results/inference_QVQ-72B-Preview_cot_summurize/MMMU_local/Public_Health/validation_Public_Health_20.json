                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I have this table from a prospective cohort study about smoking and lung cancer. There are two groups: an exposure group (which I assume are smokers) and a non-exposed group (non-smokers). For each group, there are cases of lung cancer, non-cases, and the total number of people, along with the incidence rates per 100,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what attributable risk (AR) is. From what I recall, attributable risk is the difference in incidence rates between the exposed and non-exposed groups. It measures how much of the disease risk can be attributed to the exposure, in this case, smoking.\n\nSo, the formula for attributable risk should be:\n\nAR = Incidence rate in exposed - Incidence rate in non-exposed\n\nGiven that, I have the incidence rates directly in the table:\n\n- Exposure group: 58 per 100,000\n\n- Non-exposed group: 5 per 100,000\n\nSubtracting these:\n\nAR = 58 - 5 = 53 per 100,000\n\nLooking at the options, B. 53.0/100000 seems to match this calculation.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should verify the incidence rates to ensure they're correctly calculated.\n\nIncidence rate is generally calculated as (number of new cases) divided by (total population at risk) multiplied by 100,000 to get per 100,000 people.\n\nFor the exposure group:\n\nCases = 58\n\nTotal population = 100,000\n\nIncidence rate = (58 / 100,000) * 100,000 = 58 per 100,000\n\nFor the non-exposed group:\n\nCases = 5\n\nTotal population = 100,000\n\nIncidence rate = (5 / 100,000) * 100,000 = 5 per 100,000\n\nSo, the given incidence rates are accurate.\n\nNow, let's consider if there's another way to calculate attributable risk or if there might be a trick here.\n\nOption A is 11.6, which doesn't seem to relate directly to the incidence rates. Maybe it's a percentage or another measure?\n\nOption C is 63.0/100,000, which is higher than our calculation. Perhaps someone added the incidences instead of subtracting?\n\nOption D is 0.91, which might be the relative risk or odds ratio, but that's not the attributable risk.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. Attributable risk is simply the difference between the two incidence rates, which is 53 per 100,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the units again. The incidence is given per 100,000, so subtracting them should be in the same unit.\n\nAlso, sometimes attributable risk can be expressed in different ways, like as a proportion or percentage, but in this context, since the units are per 100,000, option B seems appropriate.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. 53.0/100000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
