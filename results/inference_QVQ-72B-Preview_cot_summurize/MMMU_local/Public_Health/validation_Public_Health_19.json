                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have data on systolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) for 10 men, and we've done a linear regression analysis with systolic blood pressure as the dependent variable and BMI as the independent variable. The regression coefficient is given as b = 1.648, and we have some sum of squares values: SS residual = 1044.352 and SS total = 1878.400. We need to find the coefficient of determination, which I believe is R-squared (R\u00b2).\n\nFirst off, I remember that the coefficient of determination, R\u00b2, is a measure that tells us how much of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable in a regression model. So, higher R\u00b2 values mean that the model explains more of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n\nNow, there are a few ways to calculate R\u00b2, but from the information provided, it seems like we have the sum of squares residual (SS residual) and the sum of squares total (SS total). I think R\u00b2 can be calculated using these values. Let me recall the formula.\n\nI think R\u00b2 = 1 - (SS residual / SS total). Does that sound right? Let me double-check that.\n\nYes, in regression analysis, the total sum of squares (SS total) is the sum of the explained variation (SS regression) and the unexplained variation (SS residual). So, SS total = SS regression + SS residual.\n\nAnd the coefficient of determination, R\u00b2, is the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation, which is SS regression / SS total.\n\nAlternatively, since SS total = SS regression + SS residual, I can express R\u00b2 as 1 - (SS residual / SS total). That seems simpler, and I have SS residual and SS total given.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers:\n\nR\u00b2 = 1 - (1044.352 / 1878.400)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 1044.352 by 1878.400.\n\n1044.352 \u00f7 1878.400 = 0.556\n\nThen, 1 - 0.556 = 0.444\n\nSo, R\u00b2 = 0.444\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 0.444, which seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not missing something. Is there another way to calculate R\u00b2 that might give a different result?\n\nWell, another way to calculate R\u00b2 is by using the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the actual values, or between the independent and dependent variables. But in this case, since we have SS values directly, the first method should suffice.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the regression coefficient b = 1.648 is relevant here. Since R\u00b2 is a measure of how well the independent variable explains the dependent variable, and we have SS values, I think b is just the slope of the regression line and isn't directly needed for calculating R\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a relationship between b and R\u00b2, but I don't think so. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I should calculate R\u00b2 using the formula R\u00b2 = (SS regression / SS total).\n\nFirst, I need to find SS regression.\n\nSince SS total = SS regression + SS residual,\n\nThen SS regression = SS total - SS residual = 1878.400 - 1044.352 = 834.048\n\nThen, R\u00b2 = SS regression / SS total = 834.048 / 1878.400\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n834.048 \u00f7 1878.400 = 0.444\n\nAgain, R\u00b2 = 0.444\n\nSo, this confirms my previous result.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other information in the problem that might affect this calculation. The problem mentions that the data is from 10 men aged 35-45 years, but that shouldn't affect the calculation of R\u00b2.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a linear regression with one independent variable shouldn't matter for this specific calculation.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be A. 0.444\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here. Maybe I need to consider degrees of freedom or something like that, but no, for R\u00b2 calculation in simple linear regression, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate adjusted R\u00b2, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of determination, which is typically R\u00b2.\n\nSo, I think A. 0.444 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.444} \\]"
