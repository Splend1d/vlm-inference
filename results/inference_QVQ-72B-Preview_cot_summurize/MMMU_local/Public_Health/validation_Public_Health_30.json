                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a table that shows the results of two tests for cervical lesions: electronic colposcopy and TCT. There are 600 patients in total, with 100 having cervical lesions and 500 without. The table breaks down the test results into positives and negatives for each test, and how they correspond to the actual presence or absence of lesions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a parallel test is. In diagnostic testing, a parallel test means that a patient is considered positive if either one of the tests is positive. So, if either electronic colposcopy or TCT is positive, the parallel test is positive. If both are negative, then the parallel test is negative.\n\nMy goal is to find the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) of this parallel test. The +LR is defined as the probability of a positive test given the disease divided by the probability of a positive test given no disease. In formula terms, it's:\n\n\\[\n+LR = \\frac{Sensitivity}{1 - Specificity}\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to find the sensitivity and specificity of the parallel test.\n\nSensitivity is the true positive rate: the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such.\n\nSpecificity is the true negative rate: the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such.\n\nLet me first figure out the sensitivity of the parallel test.\n\nLooking at the patients with cervical lesions (100 in total):\n\n- Electronic colposcopy positive and TCT negative: 15\n\n- Electronic colposcopy negative and TCT positive: 5\n\n- Both positive: 70\n\n- Both negative: 10\n\nSo, the total number of patients with cervical lesions who test positive via the parallel test is the sum of the first three categories: 15 + 5 + 70 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sensitivity} = \\frac{90}{100} = 0.90 \\text{ or } 90\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, for specificity, we look at the patients without cervical lesions (500 in total):\n\n- Electronic colposcopy positive and TCT negative: 10\n\n- Electronic colposcopy negative and TCT positive: 220\n\n- Both positive: 25\n\n- Both negative: 245\n\nThe number of patients without lesions who test positive via the parallel test is the sum of the first three categories: 10 + 220 + 25 = 255.\n\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{false positive rate} = \\frac{255}{500} = 0.51 \\text{ or } 51\\%\n\\]\n\nSpecificity is 1 minus the false positive rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{specificity} = 1 - 0.51 = 0.49 \\text{ or } 49\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging these into the +LR formula:\n\n\\[\n+LR = \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.49} = \\frac{0.90}{0.51} \\approx 1.765\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 1.76.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.76\n\nB. 14\n\nC. 12.14\n\nD. 8.67\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the sensitivity calculation:\n\n- Patients with lesions who test positive: 15 + 5 + 70 = 90\n\n- Total with lesions: 100\n\n- Sensitivity: 90/100 = 0.90\n\nSeems right.\n\nSecond, specificity:\n\n- Patients without lesions who test positive: 10 + 220 + 25 = 255\n\n- Total without lesions: 500\n\n- False positive rate: 255/500 = 0.51\n\n- Specificity: 1 - 0.51 = 0.49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, +LR = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) = 0.90 / 0.51 \u2248 1.76\n\nI think that's solid. Maybe another way to look at it is to calculate the positive predictive value, but that's not necessary for +LR.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might calculate +LR using odds, but that's the diagnostic odds ratio, which is different.\n\nNo, I believe I've followed the correct steps for +LR calculation for a parallel test.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 1.76\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
