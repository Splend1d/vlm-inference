One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The protective rate against all EV71 related diseases was\n\nA. 100%\nB. 94.8%\nC. 94.6%\nD. 88.1%\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a clinical trial for an inactivated EV71 vaccine, and there are two groups: a vaccination group and a placebo group. The table provides some data on the number of new cases for various outcomes in each group, along with the person-years of observation. My goal is to calculate the protective rate against all EV71-related diseases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a protective rate is. I think it's a measure of how effective the vaccine is in preventing diseases caused by EV71. So, it should be calculated based on the number of cases in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"All EV71 related diseases,\" the vaccination group has 13 new cases, and the placebo group has 106 new cases. The person-years are 4973.2 for the vaccination group and 4873.0 for the placebo group.\n\nTo calculate the protective rate, I should probably use the formula for vaccine efficacy or effectiveness. I recall that vaccine efficacy (VE) is calculated as:\n\nVE = [ (Incidence in placebo group) - (Incidence in vaccination group) ] / (Incidence in placebo group) * 100%\n\nBut first, I need to calculate the incidence rates for both groups. Incidence rate is typically calculated as the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk.\n\nSo, for the vaccination group:\n\nIncidence rate = 13 / 4973.2\n\nFor the placebo group:\n\nIncidence rate = 106 / 4873.0\n\nLet me calculate these.\n\nFirst, vaccination group incidence rate:\n\n13 / 4973.2 \u2248 0.00261 cases per person-year\n\nPlacebo group incidence rate:\n\n106 / 4873.0 \u2248 0.02175 cases per person-year\n\nNow, plug these into the vaccine efficacy formula:\n\nVE = (0.02175 - 0.00261) / 0.02175 * 100%\n\nCalculate the difference:\n\n0.02175 - 0.00261 = 0.01914\n\nThen, VE = (0.01914 / 0.02175) * 100% \u2248 88.04%\n\nSo, the protective rate against all EV71-related diseases is approximately 88.1%.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 88.1% matches this calculation.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's another way to calculate this or if I've missed something.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes vaccine efficacy is calculated using the relative risk reduction:\n\nRRR = [ (Incidence in placebo group) - (Incidence in vaccination group) ] / (Incidence in placebo group) * 100%\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I used earlier.\n\nAnother way could be to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"protective rate,\" which might be another term for vaccine efficacy.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation leading to 88.1%, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nHowever, let's see if perhaps the protective rate is calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using the formula:\n\nProtective rate = 1 - (Incidence in vaccination group / Incidence in placebo group) * 100%\n\nUsing the incidence rates I calculated earlier:\n\nProtective rate = 1 - (0.00261 / 0.02175) * 100% \u2248 1 - 0.1195 * 100% \u2248 88.05%\n\nAgain, this is approximately 88.1%.\n\nSo, this confirms my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 88.1%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this calculation.\n\nLooking back at the table, under \"All EV71 related diseases,\" there are 13 cases in the vaccination group and 106 in the placebo group.\n\nIf I were to calculate the protective rate simply based on the number of cases, without considering person-years, it would be:\n\n[ (106 - 13) / 106 ] * 100% = (93 / 106) * 100% \u2248 87.74%, which is still roughly 88.1%.\n\nSo, whether I consider person-years or just the number of cases, I get a similar protective rate.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that D. 88.1% is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's check the other options.\n\nOption A is 100%, which is clearly not the case since there were 13 cases in the vaccination group.\n\nOption B is 94.8%, which might be a miscalculation.\n\nOption C is 94.6%, which might be another way of calculating, but based on my calculations, 88.1% seems accurate.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. 88.1%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
