The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is\n\nA. 1.70\nB. 2.50\nC. 3.20\nD. 4.80\n"

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this case-control study about the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension. There are 154 cases of hypertension and 583 controls, with data on whether they drink alcohol or not. The table shows that among the cases, 73 (47.4%) drank alcohol, and among the controls, 202 (34.6%) did. The total number of drinkers is 275, and non-drinkers are 462, making a grand total of 737 participants.\n\nI need to calculate the crude odds ratio (cOR) to measure the association between alcohol drinking and hypertension. An odds ratio tells me how much more likely people who drink alcohol are to have hypertension compared to those who don't drink.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms:\n\n- Cases: people with hypertension (154)\n\n- Controls: people without hypertension (583)\n\n- Exposed: people who drink alcohol\n\n- Unexposed: people who do not drink alcohol\n\nIn a case-control study, the odds ratio is calculated using the number of exposed and unexposed individuals in both cases and controls.\n\nThe formula for the odds ratio is:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{a/d}{b/c} = \\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) = number of cases that are exposed (drinkers with hypertension)\n\n- \\( b \\) = number of cases that are unexposed (non-drinkers with hypertension)\n\n- \\( c \\) = number of controls that are exposed (drinkers without hypertension)\n\n- \\( d \\) = number of controls that are unexposed (non-drinkers without hypertension)\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- a = 73\n\n- b = 81\n\n- c = 202\n\n- d = 381\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{73 \\times 381}{81 \\times 202} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 73 \\times 381 \\):\n\n73 \u00d7 381 =\n\n73 \u00d7 300 = 21,900\n\n73 \u00d7 80 = 5,840\n\n73 \u00d7 1 = 73\n\nTotal = 21,900 + 5,840 + 73 = 27,813\n\nNext, calculate \\( 81 \\times 202 \\):\n\n81 \u00d7 200 = 16,200\n\n81 \u00d7 2 = 162\n\nTotal = 16,200 + 162 = 16,362\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{27,813}{16,362} \\]\n\nLet me divide 27,813 by 16,362.\n\nFirst, 16,362 \u00d7 1 = 16,362\n\n27,813 - 16,362 = 11,451\n\nSo, 16,362 \u00d7 1 = 16,362\n\n Remainder 11,451\n\nNow, 16,362 \u00d7 0.7 = 11,453.4\n\nBut 11,453.4 is slightly more than 11,451, so maybe 0.68 or something.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a calculator for accuracy.\n\nWait, since this is a manual calculation, I can approximate.\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1 = 16,362\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.7 = 16,362 + 8,181 = 24,543\n\nBut that's less than 27,813.\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.7 = 24,543\n\nDifference: 27,813 - 24,543 = 3,270\n\nSo, 16,362 \u00d7 (1 + 0.7) = 24,543\n\nThen, 16,362 \u00d7 0.2 = 3,272.4\n\nSo, 16,362 \u00d7 1.7 = 24,543\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.6 = 24,543 - 16,362 \u00d7 0.1 = 24,543 - 1,636.2 = 22,906.8\n\nStill less than 27,813.\n\nWait, maybe 1.65?\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.65 = 16,362 \u00d7 1.6 + 16,362 \u00d7 0.05 = 26,179.2 + 818.1 = 27,007.3\n\nStill less than 27,813.\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.68?\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.6 = 26,179.2\n\n16,362 \u00d7 0.08 = 1,308.96\n\nTotal: 26,179.2 + 1,308.96 = 27,488.16\n\nStill less than 27,813.\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.7 = 24,543\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.72?\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1.7 = 24,543\n\n16,362 \u00d7 0.02 = 327.24\n\nTotal: 24,543 + 327.24 = 24,870.24\n\nStill less.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{a/d}{b/c} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} \\]\n\nBut I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me recall that the odds ratio is:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{a/d}{b/c} = \\frac{a \\times c}{b \\times d} \\]\n\nI already have a, b, c, d.\n\nPerhaps I can calculate it directly using these values.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 73\n\nb = 81\n\nc = 202\n\nd = 381\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{73 \\times 381}{81 \\times 202} \\]\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n73 \u00d7 381 = 27,813\n\nDenominator:\n\n81 \u00d7 202 = 16,362\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{27,813}{16,362} \\]\n\nNow, dividing 27,813 by 16,362.\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\n16,362 \u00d7 1 = 16,362\n\nSubtract from 27,813: 27,813 - 16,362 = 11,451\n\nNow, 16,362 \u00d7 0.7 = 11,453.4, which is slightly more than 11,451.\n\nAlternatively, 16,362 \u00d7 0.68 = 11,126.16\n\nSubtract from 11,451: 11,451 - 11,126.16 = 324.84\n\nSo, the total is 1 + 0.68 + (324.84 / 16,362)\n\n324.84 / 16,362 \u2248 0.0198\n\nSo, OR \u2248 1 + 0.68 + 0.0198 \u2248 1.7\n\nSo, the crude odds ratio is approximately 1.7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.70\n\nB. 2.50\n\nC. 3.20\n\nD. 4.80\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any other way to calculate this or if I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{a/d}{b/c} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} \\]\n\nBut I think I've done it correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that in a case-control study, the odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of exposure in cases to the odds of exposure in controls.\n\nSo, odds of exposure in cases: a / b = 73 / 81 \u2248 0.901\n\nOdds of exposure in controls: c / d = 202 / 381 \u2248 0.530\n\nSo, OR = 0.901 / 0.530 \u2248 1.70\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the crude odds ratio is approximately 1.70.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 1.70\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
