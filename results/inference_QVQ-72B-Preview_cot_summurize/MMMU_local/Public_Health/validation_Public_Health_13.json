                    "text": "So I've got this table here that shows different foods and the number of people who ate each food and then got sick. There are five foods listed: cold chicken, potato salad, egg sandwiches, fruit pie and cream, and cheese. Next to each food, there are two numbers: the number of people who ate that food and the number of those people who got sick. I need to figure out which food is the most likely cause of the food poisoning outbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what food poisoning is. Food poisoning is usually caused by eating contaminated food, often due to improper handling, cooking, or storage. So, if a particular food is causing sickness in people who ate it, it's probably because that food was contaminated in some way.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Cold chicken: 86 people ate it, and 34 got sick.\n\n- Potato salad: 54 people ate it, and 38 got sick.\n\n- Egg sandwiches: 76 people ate them, and 40 got sick.\n\n- Fruit pie and cream: 32 people ate it, and 12 got sick.\n\n- Cheese: 48 people ate it, and 12 got sick.\n\nI need to determine which of these foods has the highest likelihood of being the source of the food poisoning.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the percentage of people who ate each food and then got sick. The food with the highest percentage would be the one where the largest proportion of eaters got sick, which might indicate it's the most likely cause of the outbreak.\n\nLet me try calculating the percentage for each food.\n\nStarting with cold chicken:\n\n34 people got sick out of 86 who ate it. To find the percentage, I can divide 34 by 86 and then multiply by 100.\n\nSo, 34 \u00f7 86 = 0.4\n\n0.4 \u00d7 100 = 40%\n\nNext, potato salad:\n\n38 out of 54 got sick.\n\n38 \u00f7 54 \u2248 0.7037\n\n0.7037 \u00d7 100 \u2248 70.37%\n\nEgg sandwiches:\n\n40 out of 76 got sick.\n\n40 \u00f7 76 \u2248 0.5263\n\n0.5263 \u00d7 100 \u2248 52.63%\n\nFruit pie and cream:\n\n12 out of 32 got sick.\n\n12 \u00f7 32 = 0.375\n\n0.375 \u00d7 100 = 37.5%\n\nCheese:\n\n12 out of 48 got sick.\n\n12 \u00f7 48 = 0.25\n\n0.25 \u00d7 100 = 25%\n\nSo, summarizing the percentages:\n\n- Cold chicken: 40%\n\n- Potato salad:\u7ea6 70.37%\n\n- Egg sandwiches:\u7ea6 52.63%\n\n- Fruit pie and cream: 37.5%\n\n- Cheese: 25%\n\nFrom these percentages, potato salad has the highest rate of sickness among people who ate it, at approximately 70.37%. That suggests that people who ate the potato salad were more likely to get sick compared to those who ate the other foods.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other information or factors that could influence this conclusion. For example, maybe some people ate multiple foods, and it could be a combination of foods causing the sickness. But the question seems to suggest that it's one specific food that's causing the outbreak.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the total number of people who ate each food. For instance, more people ate cold chicken (86) compared to potato salad (54), but even though more people ate cold chicken, a higher percentage of those who ate potato salad got sick.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should look at the absolute numbers as well. Even though a higher percentage of people who ate potato salad got sick, maybe the total number of people who got sick from cold chicken is higher because more people ate it.\n\nLet me check the numbers:\n\n- Cold chicken: 34 sick out of 86\n\n- Potato salad: 38 sick out of 54\n\n- Egg sandwiches: 40 sick out of 76\n\n- Fruit pie and cream: 12 sick out of 32\n\n- Cheese: 12 sick out of 48\n\nSo, for cold chicken, 34 people got sick, while for potato salad, 38 people got sick. Even though the percentage is higher for potato salad, actually more people got sick from potato salad. Similarly, for egg sandwiches, 40 people got sick out of 76, which is more than the 34 from cold chicken but less than the 40.\n\nBut I think the key here is the percentage, not the absolute number. If a higher percentage of people who ate a particular food got sick, it suggests that that food is more likely to be contaminated or the source of the outbreak.\n\nSo, based on the percentages, potato salad has the highest percentage of people getting sick after eating it.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe I can calculate the odds of getting sick from each food.\n\nOdds are calculated as the number of people who got sick divided by the number who ate the food but didn't get sick.\n\nSo, for cold chicken:\n\n34 sick / (86 - 34) = 34 / 52 \u2248 0.6538\n\nFor potato salad:\n\n38 / (54 - 38) = 38 / 16 = 2.375\n\nFor egg sandwiches:\n\n40 / (76 - 40) = 40 / 36 \u2248 1.1111\n\nFor fruit pie and cream:\n\n12 / (32 - 12) = 12 / 20 = 0.6\n\nFor cheese:\n\n12 / (48 - 12) = 12 / 36 \u2248 0.3333\n\nSo, the odds of getting sick from potato salad are the highest at approximately 2.375, meaning almost 2.4 times more likely to get sick than not to.\n\nAgain, this points towards potato salad being the most likely cause of the outbreak.\n\nAnother angle I could consider is the incidence rate, but I think percentage and odds give a good enough picture.\n\nPerhaps I should also consider if any of these foods are more prone to contamination or food poisoning than others. For example, potato salad often contains mayonnaise, which can spoil if not refrigerated properly, making it a common culprit in food poisoning outbreaks. Similarly, egg sandwiches also contain mayonnaise and eggs, which can be risky if not handled correctly. Cold chicken could also be a risk if not stored properly or if cross-contaminated with raw chicken. Fruit pie and cream might be less likely to cause food poisoning unless they contain perishable ingredients that have spoiled. Cheese can also cause food poisoning, especially if it's soft cheese or hasn't been stored correctly.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the type of food poisoning or the ingredients used, it's hard to weigh these factors accurately. So, based on the data provided in the table, the percentage and odds approaches suggest that potato salad is the most likely cause of the outbreak.\n\nWait, but let's think about this differently. Suppose there is some dependency or interaction between the foods. For example, maybe people who ate potato salad also ate cheese, and perhaps the combination is causing the sickness, not just one food. But the question specifies that it's an \"outbreak of food poisoning,\" and it's asking which single food is the most likely cause, implying it's one specific food, not a combination.\n\nGiven that, and based on the percentages and odds, potato salad seems to be the most likely culprit.\n\nLet me check if there's any other statistical measure I should consider. Maybe I should look into relative risk or attributable risk, but that might be overcomplicating things for this scenario.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I should consider the number of people who ate multiple foods and got sick, but again, without data on who ate what in combination, that's not possible to determine.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The straightforward approach is to look at the percentage of people who got sick from each food and choose the one with the highest percentage, which is potato salad.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Potato salad.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Potato salad}} \\]"
