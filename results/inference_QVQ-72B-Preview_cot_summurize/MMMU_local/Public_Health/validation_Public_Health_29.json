                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a case-control study looking at the association between drinking surface water and rectal cancer. The person conducting the study thought that where people live\u2014rural or urban\u2014might affect the results, so they split the data into those two categories. We've got a table here that shows the numbers of cases and controls in both rural and urban areas, and whether they drink surface water or deep water.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) is. I know that in case-control studies, we often calculate ORs to see how much more likely cases are to have been exposed to a certain factor compared to controls. But here, since we're considering two different strata\u2014rural and urban\u2014I think we need to adjust for the potential confounding effect of residence location.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the adjusted OR, and there are four options provided. My task is to calculate or estimate this adjusted OR based on the data given.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rural area:\n\n- Cases:\n\n- Drinking surface water: 20 (40.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water: 30 (60.0%)\n\n- Controls:\n\n- Drinking surface water: 50 (25.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water: 150 (75.0%)\n\n- Urban area:\n\n- Cases:\n\n- Drinking surface water: 150 (75.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water: 50 (25.0%)\n\n- Controls:\n\n- Drinking surface water: 30 (60.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water: 20 (40.0%)\n\nTotal numbers:\n\n- Rural: 50 cases and 200 controls\n\n- Urban: 200 cases and 50 controls\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the totals.\n\nIn the rural area:\n\n- Cases: 20 + 30 = 50\n\n- Controls: 50 + 150 = 200\n\nIn the urban area:\n\n- Cases: 150 + 50 = 200\n\n- Controls: 30 + 20 = 50\n\nOkay, that adds up.\n\nNow, to calculate the adjusted OR, I think I need to calculate the OR separately for each stratum (rural and urban) and then combine them somehow, probably using a weighted average based on the number of subjects in each stratum.\n\nLet me recall how to calculate the OR for each stratum.\n\nFor rural area:\n\n- Odds of drinking surface water among cases: 20 / 30 = 2/3\n\n- Odds of drinking surface water among controls: 50 / 150 = 1/3\n\n- So, OR_rural = (2/3) / (1/3) = 2\n\nFor urban area:\n\n- Odds of drinking surface water among cases: 150 / 50 = 3\n\n- Odds of drinking surface water among controls: 30 / 20 = 1.5\n\n- So, OR_urban = 3 / 1.5 = 2\n\nInteresting, both strata have an OR of 2. So, if I just take a simple average, it's still 2. But I suspect it's not that straightforward.\n\nI think I need to perform a stratified analysis, perhaps using the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate the combined OR.\n\nThe formula for the Mantel-Haenszel OR is:\n\nOR_MH = \u03a3 [(a_i / n_i) * OR_i]\n\nWhere a_i is the number of cases in stratum i, n_i is the total number of subjects in stratum i, and OR_i is the OR within stratum i.\n\nBut since both strata have the same OR, maybe it's just OR_MH = 2.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 2.0 is one of them (option B), but there are other options as well, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the overall OR without stratifying.\n\nLet me see the overall numbers:\n\n- Total cases: 250 (50 rural + 200 urban)\n\n- Total controls: 250 (200 rural + 50 urban)\n\nNow, total cases drinking surface water: 20 + 150 = 170\n\nTotal cases drinking deep water: 30 + 50 = 80\n\nTotal controls drinking surface water: 50 + 30 = 80\n\nTotal controls drinking deep water: 150 + 20 = 170\n\nSo, overall odds of drinking surface water among cases: 170 / 80 = 2.125\n\nAmong controls: 80 / 170 \u2248 0.4706\n\nSo, overall OR = 2.125 / 0.4706 \u2248 4.515 \u2248 4.52\n\nWhich matches option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier I calculated the stratum-specific ORs as 2, and now the overall OR is 4.52. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI need to understand why this is happening.\n\nI recall that when there is confounding, the overall OR can be different from the stratum-specific ORs.\n\nGiven that the stratum-specific ORs are both 2, but the overall OR is 4.52, it suggests that there is confounding by residence type.\n\nIn such cases, the Mantel-Haenszel method would give the adjusted OR, which, in this scenario, should be the same as the stratum-specific ORs, assuming no interaction.\n\nSince both strata have the same OR, the adjusted OR should indeed be 2.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the overall OR is 4.52, which seems to suggest that adjusting for residence type would halve the OR.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense intuitively.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, for rural:\n\n- Cases: 20 surface, 30 deep \u2192 total 50\n\n- Controls: 50 surface, 150 deep \u2192 total 200\n\nOR_rural = (20/30)/(50/150) = (20/30)/(1/3) = (20/30)*(3/1) = (20*3)/(30*1) = 60/30 = 2\n\nFor urban:\n\n- Cases: 150 surface, 50 deep \u2192 total 200\n\n- Controls: 30 surface, 20 deep \u2192 total 50\n\nOR_urban = (150/50)/(30/20) = (150/50)/(30/20) = (3)/(1.5) = 2\n\nOverall:\n\n- Cases: 170 surface, 80 deep \u2192 total 250\n\n- Controls: 80 surface, 170 deep \u2192 total 250\n\nOverall OR = (170/80)/(80/170) = (170/80)/(80/170) = (170/80) * (170/80) = (170*170)/(80*80) = 28900 / 6400 \u2248 4.515\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for OR is (a/c)/(b/d), where:\n\n- a = cases with exposure (surface water) = 170\n\n- b = cases without exposure (deep water) = 80\n\n- c = controls with exposure = 80\n\n- d = controls without exposure = 170\n\nSo, OR = (a/c)/(b/d) = (170/80)/(80/170) = (170/80) / (80/170) = (170/80) * (170/80) = (17/8) * (17/8) = (289)/(64) \u2248 4.515\n\nOkay, that matches option A.\n\nBut earlier, the stratum-specific ORs were both 2, yet the overall OR is 4.52. This suggests that there is confounding, and the overall OR is not adjusted for residence type.\n\nTherefore, to get the adjusted OR, I should use the Mantel-Haenszel method.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel OR is calculated as:\n\nOR_MH = \u03a3 [(a_i / n_i) * OR_i]\n\nWhere a_i is the number of cases in stratum i, and n_i is the total number in stratum i.\n\nBut since both strata have the same OR, and the weights are proportional to the number of cases in each stratum, the combined OR should still be 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the Mantel-Haenszel formula more carefully.\n\nThe general formula for the Mantel-Haenszel OR is:\n\nOR_MH = \u03a3 [(a_i / n_i) * OR_i] / \u03a3 (a_i / n_i)\n\nBut in this case, since both strata have the same OR, OR_MH should equal OR_i, which is 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the weighted average of the stratum-specific ORs, weighted by the number of cases in each stratum.\n\nRural: 50 cases, OR = 2\n\nUrban: 200 cases, OR = 2\n\nWeighted OR = (50*2 + 200*2)/(50 + 200) = (100 + 400)/250 = 500/250 = 2\n\nSo, the adjusted OR should be 2.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the overall OR is 4.52, which is different from the adjusted OR of 2.\n\nThis suggests that there is confounding by residence type, and adjusting for it brings the OR back to 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 2.0, which is option B.\n\nBut the question says \"the adjusted OR was\", and it's a multiple-choice question with options A. 4.52, B. 2.0, C. 1.26, D. 3.45.\n\nGiven that my calculation points to 2.0, but the overall OR is 4.52, which is also an option, I need to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the crude OR, not the adjusted one, but it specifically says \"adjusted OR\", so I think it's 2.0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the exposure prevalence in the control group when adjusting.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to calculate the OR within each stratum and then combine them using weights.\n\nUsing the Mantel-Haenszel formula:\n\nOR_MH = \u03a3 [(a_i * d_i) / (b_i * c_i)] / \u03a3 (1 / (b_i * c_i))\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_i = number of exposed cases in stratum i\n\n- b_i = number of unexposed cases in stratum i\n\n- c_i = number of exposed controls in stratum i\n\n- d_i = number of unexposed controls in stratum i\n\nFor rural:\n\n- a_i = 20\n\n- b_i = 30\n\n- c_i = 50\n\n- d_i = 150\n\nFor urban:\n\n- a_i = 150\n\n- b_i = 50\n\n- c_i = 30\n\n- d_i = 20\n\nSo, for rural:\n\n- (a_i * d_i) / (b_i * c_i) = (20 * 150) / (30 * 50) = (3000)/(1500) = 2\n\n- 1 / (b_i * c_i) = 1 / (30 * 50) = 1/1500\n\nFor urban:\n\n- (a_i * d_i) / (b_i * c_i) = (150 * 20) / (50 * 30) = (3000)/(1500) = 2\n\n- 1 / (b_i * c_i) = 1 / (50 * 30) = 1/1500\n\nTherefore, OR_MH = [2*(1/1500) + 2*(1/1500)] / [(1/1500) + (1/1500)] = [2/1500 + 2/1500] / [1/1500 + 1/1500] = [4/1500] / [2/1500] = 4/1500 * 1500/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nSo, again, the adjusted OR is 2.\n\nI think the answer is B. 2.0.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe calculating the OR using logistic regression to adjust for residence type.\n\nIn a simple logistic regression model with exposure (surface water vs deep water) and residence type (rural vs urban), the adjusted OR for exposure would be the exponentiated coefficient for exposure, adjusting for residence.\n\nGiven that both strata have the same OR of 2, the adjusted OR should still be 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the population weights based on the number of cases or the population sizes.\n\nBut in any case, it seems that the adjusted OR is 2, not 4.52.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is B. 2.0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
