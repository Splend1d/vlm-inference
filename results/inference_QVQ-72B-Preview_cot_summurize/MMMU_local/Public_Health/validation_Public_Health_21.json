One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was\n\nA. 51.4%\nB. 52.4%\nC. 3.1%\nD. 10.8%\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a table here that's showing adverse reactions from a vaccination study comparing a vaccination group and a placebo group. The vaccination group has 5044 people, and the placebo group has 4873 people. There are different categories of adverse reactions and the number of incidents in each group for those categories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says: \"The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was...\" and then gives four options: A. 51.4%, B. 52.4%, C. 3.1%, D. 10.8%.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group. Incidence typically refers to the proportion of individuals in a group who experience a particular event or condition over a specified period.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"Adverse Reactions,\" there are several categories:\n\n1. Serious adverse reactions within 28 days after injection\n\n2. Serious adverse reactions within 14 months after injection\n\n3. Other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection\n\n- Any adverse reactions\n\n- Tertiary adverse reactions\n\nFor both the vaccination and placebo groups, there are numbers next to these categories.\n\nSo, specifically, I need to focus on \"Tertiary adverse reactions\" in the placebo group.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In the vaccination group (5044 persons), the number of tertiary adverse reactions is 150.\n\n- In the placebo group (4873 persons), the number of tertiary adverse reactions is 158.\n\nOkay, so to find the incidence, I need to take the number of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group and divide it by the total number of persons in the placebo group, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nSo, incidence = (number of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group / total number of persons in placebo group) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nIncidence = (158 / 4873) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, divide 158 by 4873.\n\n158 \u00f7 4873 = 0.0324 (approximately)\n\nThen, 0.0324 * 100 = 3.24%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 51.4%\n\nB. 52.4%\n\nC. 3.1%\n\nD. 10.8%\n\nSo, 3.24% is closest to option C. 3.1%.\n\nBut wait, is there something I'm missing here? The question says \"the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was,\" and I've calculated it to be approximately 3.24%, which is closest to 3.1% in the options.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there's any other information in the table that might affect this calculation.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Serious adverse reactions within 28 days: both groups have 45 incidents\n\n- Within 14 months: vaccination group has 111, placebo has 131\n\n- Other adverse reactions within 7 days:\n\n- Any adverse reactions: vaccination 2593, placebo 2639\n\n- Tertiary adverse reactions: vaccination 150, placebo 158\n\nSo, it seems straightforward that the number of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group is 158 out of 4873 persons.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider the timing of these reactions. The table mentions \"within 7 days after injection,\" so maybe the incidence should be calculated based on the number of persons who received the injection within that time frame.\n\nBut no, the table clearly states \"other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection,\" and it's specified as \"any adverse reactions\" and \"tertiary adverse reactions.\"\n\nSo, I think the number 158 is the count of tertiary adverse reactions occurring within 7 days after injection in the placebo group.\n\nTherefore, the incidence would be 158 out of 4873.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n158 / 4873 \u2248 0.0324 or 3.24%, which is closest to 3.1%.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's any trick here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the sample size or any other factors.\n\nWait, the table also mentions \"serious adverse reactions\" in different time frames, but tertiary adverse reactions are separate from serious adverse reactions, I assume.\n\nUnless tertiary adverse reactions are a subset of serious adverse reactions, but the table doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven that, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 3.1%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
