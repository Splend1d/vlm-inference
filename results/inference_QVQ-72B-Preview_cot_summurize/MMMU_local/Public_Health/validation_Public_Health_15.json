                    "text": "So I've got this contingency table here that shows the relationship between age groups and whether people always exceed speed limits or not. There are two age groups: under 30 and over 30. For each age group, there are two categories under \"Exceed Limit if Possible?\": Always and Not Always. The table also has totals for each row and column.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contingency table is. It's a table that shows the frequency distribution of variables, in this case, age groups and their tendency to exceed speed limits. The rows represent one variable (age groups), and the columns represent another variable (whether they always exceed limits or not).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Under 30:\n\n- Always: 100\n\n- Not Always: 100\n\n- Total: 200\n\n- Over 30:\n\n- Always: 40\n\n- Not Always: 160\n\n- Total: 200\n\n- Totals:\n\n- Always: 140\n\n- Not Always: 260\n\n- Grand total: 400\n\nSo, there are 200 people in each age group, making a total of 400 people surveyed.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the odds that people under 30 always exceed the speed limit. Specifically, among people with age under 30, what are the odds that they always exceed the speed limit?\n\nOdds are calculated as the ratio of the probability of an event happening to the probability of it not happening. So, odds = probability of always exceeding / probability of not always exceeding.\n\nFrom the table, for under 30:\n\n- Always: 100\n\n- Not Always: 100\n\nTotal under 30: 200\n\nSo, probability of always exceeding = 100 / 200 = 0.5\n\nProbability of not always exceeding = 100 / 200 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, odds = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 to 1\n\nWait, but the options are given in terms of ratios, like 1 to 2, 2 to 1, etc. So, 1 to 1 means the odds are equal for exceeding and not exceeding.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal under 30 is 200, and 100 said always exceed, and 100 said not always. So, indeed, the probability is 0.5 for each.\n\nTherefore, the odds are 1 to 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1 to 2\n\nB. 2 to 1\n\nC. 1 to 1\n\nD. 50%\n\n50% is the probability, not the odds. So, D is incorrect.\n\nSome people might confuse probability with odds, but they are different.\n\nProbability is P(event)/P(not event), while odds is P(event)/(1 - P(event)).\n\nBut in this case, since P(always) = P(not always) = 0.5, the odds are 1 to 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 1 to 1.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, odds can also be calculated directly from the contingency table as the ratio of always to not always within the under 30 group.\n\nSo, always: 100\n\nNot always: 100\n\nOdds = always / not always = 100 / 100 = 1 to 1\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1 to 1.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
