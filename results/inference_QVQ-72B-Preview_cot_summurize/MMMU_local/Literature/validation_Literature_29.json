There's an orange arrow pointing downward on one of the lines. The question is asking about story structure terms: exposition, rising action, climax, and falling action. It says to refer to the figure, but since I can't see the image, I need to interpret this based on what's described.\n\nFrom the description, there are three points connected by lines: the first line goes up, the second goes down, and the third is flat. The orange arrow is pointing downward on the rising line. So, if I imagine this as a story plot, the rising line would be the rising action, the peak would be the climax, and then the downward line would be the falling action, and finally, the flat line might be the resolution.\n\nThe question is: which term refers to the part that follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced? So, in story structure, the exposition is where the background information is provided, and the conflict is introduced. Then, the rising action is where the tension builds up towards the climax.\n\nGiven that, the part that follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced would be the rising action. So, in the diagram, if the exposition is the starting point, and then the line rises, that rising part should be the rising action.\n\nWait, but the orange arrow is pointing downward on the rising line. That seems confusing. If the line is rising, but the arrow is pointing down, does that mean that within the rising action, there's a moment of falling action or some sort of decrease?\n\nMaybe the orange arrow indicates a specific event or a change within the rising action. But the question is asking about the term that refers to the part following the exposition where the conflict is introduced, which is generally the rising action.\n\nLet me think again. Exposition introduces the conflict, and then the rising action builds up the tension towards the climax. So, the rising action comes right after the exposition.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. falling action\n\nB. climax\n\nC. exposition\n\nD. rising action\n\nGiven that, D. rising action seems the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any chance that the orange arrow might indicate something else. If the arrow is pointing downward on the rising line, perhaps it's indicating a momentary setback or a decrease in tension within the rising action. However, overall, the line is still rising, so the general trend is still towards increasing tension.\n\nTherefore, the term that refers to the part following the exposition where the conflict is introduced is still the rising action.\n\nI think the answer is D. rising action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
