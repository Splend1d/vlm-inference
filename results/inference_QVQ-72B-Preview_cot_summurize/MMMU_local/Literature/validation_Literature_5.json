I need to identify which one of these books was written by Mark Twain.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at each option and see who the author is for each book.\n\nStarting with option A, the book is \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" by Ken Kesey. I remember this is a famous novel about a mental institution and the struggles between the patients and the staff. Definitely not written by Mark Twain.\n\nMoving on to option B, it's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" by Mark Twain. Oh, this rings a bell. I think Tom Sawyer is a classic story about a young boy's adventures and mischiefs in a small town. This seems to match the author's name, Mark Twain.\n\nOption C is \"Of Mice and Men\" by John Steinbeck. I know Steinbeck wrote this novel about two friends, George and Lennie, and their struggles during the Great Depression. Not Mark Twain.\n\nLastly, option D is \"Catch-22\" by Joseph Heller. This is a renowned novel about the absurdities of war, particularly set during World War II. Again, not written by Mark Twain.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that option B, \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" is the book written by Mark Twain.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check if any of the other books could possibly be attributed to Mark Twain by mistake.\n\nLet me think about \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" No, that's definitely Ken Kesey's work. Mark Twain lived in the 19th century, and this book was published in the 1960s, long after Twain's death.\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" is clearly John Steinbeck's novel, published in 1937, while Mark Twain passed away in 1910.\n\n\"Catch-22\" was published in 1961 by Joseph Heller, another distinct author from Mark Twain.\n\nTherefore, the only book among these options written by Mark Twain is \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\"\n\nWait a minute, I should confirm if Mark Twain indeed wrote Tom Sawyer. I think he did, but maybe there's some confusion with other works like Huckleberry Finn, which is also by Mark Twain.\n\nLet me recall: Mark Twain, whose real name is Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was an American author and humorist, known for several classics set in his childhood home of Hannibal, Missouri, near the Mississippi River. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn are both set in that region and are part of the same literary universe.\n\nSo, yes, Mark Twain wrote \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\"\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I should check the publication date or any other details that might indicate otherwise, but given the options, it's clear that option B is the correct answer.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer is option B, \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" by Mark Twain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
