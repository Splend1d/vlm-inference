The question is: \"which term refers to the theme of lesser importance to the book but of significance to the lives of specific readers?\" And the options are A. Theme, B. Explicit Themes, C. Biography Series, D. Secondary Themes.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a theme is in the context of a book. A theme is like the underlying message or the big idea that the author is trying to convey through the story. It's something that runs throughout the book and can be about all sorts of things, like love, courage, friendship, or even more complex ideas like the nature of reality or morality.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a theme that's of lesser importance to the book but is still significant to some readers because of their own lives or experiences. So, it's probably not the main theme that the author intended to focus on, but it's still relevant and meaningful to certain readers.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Theme: This seems too general. A theme could be the main idea or a smaller idea, but the question is specifically about a theme that's less important to the book overall.\n\nB. Explicit Themes: I think explicit themes are the ones that are clearly stated or easy to see in the book. They're probably the main themes that the author wants to highlight. So, they're likely to be the primary themes, not the secondary ones.\n\nC. Biography Series: This seems unrelated to the question. A biography series is a type of book that tells the story of a person's life, often in multiple volumes. It doesn't directly relate to the concept of themes in literature, especially not to the idea of secondary themes.\n\nD. Secondary Themes: This sounds promising. If the primary theme is the main idea that the story revolves around, then secondary themes would be the smaller, supporting ideas that add depth to the story. These might not be as central to the plot or the author's intent, but they can still resonate strongly with certain readers based on their personal experiences.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Secondary Themes.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the definition of each option again:\n\n- Theme: A central idea or underlying message in a literary work.\n\n- Explicit Themes: Themes that are clearly expressed and easy to identify in the text.\n\n- Biography Series: A type of book that focuses on the life of an individual, often in multiple parts.\n\n- Secondary Themes: Themes that are present in the text but are not as prominent as the primary theme; they support the main ideas and can be significant to readers for various reasons.\n\nGiven this, secondary themes are indeed the ones that are less important to the book as a whole but can be very meaningful to specific readers. For example, a book might have a primary theme of adventure and discovery, but a secondary theme could be the importance of family ties or the impact of colonialism. These secondary themes might not drive the plot, but they can still offer deep insights and connections for readers who relate to those ideas.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. Secondary Themes is the correct answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
