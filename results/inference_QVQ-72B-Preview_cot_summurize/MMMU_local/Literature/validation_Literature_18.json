                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about types of books, and I need to pick the term that best refers to sources giving verifiable factual information or explaining some aspect of the biological, social, or physical world. The options are epics, multigenre books, informational books, and reference books.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each type is.\n\nStarting with epics: I think of epics as long poems or stories that tell about heroic deeds and important events in a country's history. Like, you know, Homer's Odyssey or something like that. They're more about storytelling and mythology rather than facts. So, I don't think epics fit the description of giving verifiable factual information.\n\nNext, multigenre books. Hmm, this sounds like books that combine different genres or styles within one book. Maybe something that has elements of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, etc. While they might include some factual information, I don't think they're primarily focused on providing verifiable facts or explaining aspects of the world. It seems too mixed to fit the description perfectly.\n\nThen there are informational books. This sounds promising. Informational books are likely to be focused on providing facts and information about various topics. They could be about science, history, culture, or any number of subjects. They seem to match the description of giving verifiable factual information and explaining aspects of the world.\n\nLastly, reference books. These are typically books that you look up information in, like dictionaries, encyclopedias, almanacs, etc. They're designed to provide specific pieces of information quickly and accurately. So, they also fit the description of giving verifiable factual information and explaining aspects of the world.\n\nBut the question is asking for the term that best refers to such sources. So, I need to decide between informational books and reference books.\n\nLet me think about the difference. Informational books can cover a wide range of topics and may provide in-depth information about a particular subject. Reference books, on the other hand, are more about providing quick access to specific pieces of information, often in a structured format.\n\nThe description in the question seems broad, covering sources that give verifiable factual information or explain aspects of the world, without specifying the format or the way the information is presented.\n\nGiven that, both informational books and reference books fit the bill. However, epics and multigenre books do not fit as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the context. The figure mentioned is the cover of the National Geographic Kids Almanac 2011, which is likely a reference book. It's an almanac, which is a type of reference material that provides a lot of factual information in a concise manner.\n\nSo, if the question is trying to relate to that context, perhaps reference books are the best answer.\n\nBut, on the other hand, informational books also provide factual information, and some might argue that they're even more focused on explaining aspects of the world.\n\nI need to think carefully here.\n\nLet me consider the definition of each term:\n\n- Epics: Long narrative poems or stories about heroes and historical events.\n\n- Multigenre books: Books that combine elements from different genres, possibly including fiction and non-fiction.\n\n- Informational books: Books that provide information about a particular subject, based on facts.\n\n- Reference books: Books intended to be consulted for specific pieces of information, rather than read from cover to cover.\n\nGiven these definitions, informational books and reference books both fit the description provided in the question.\n\nHowever, reference books are a specific type of informational book, designed for quick look-ups and factual information retrieval.\n\nThe almanac mentioned in the figure is a type of reference book, so it falls under reference books.\n\nBut the question isn't specifically about almanacs; it's about sources that give verifiable factual information or explain aspects of the world.\n\nInformational books can include a wide range of types, from textbooks to non-fiction trade books, all of which aim to provide factual information.\n\nReference books are a subset of informational books, optimized for quick information access.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is informational books, as it encompasses a broader range of books that provide factual information.\n\nBut the question specifies \"sources that give verifiable factual information or explain some aspect of the biological, social, or physical world,\" which could also include reference books.\n\nIt's a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think about the primary function of these books.\n\nEpics are primarily for entertainment and storytelling.\n\nMultigenre books might blend different styles but aren't primarily focused on providing factual information.\n\nInformational books are explicitly about providing information based on facts.\n\nReference books are about providing quick access to specific pieces of information.\n\nGiven that, both informational books and reference books fit the description.\n\nBut since reference books are a specific type of informational books, perhaps informational books is a better answer as it includes reference books as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe reference books are more specifically about providing verifiable factual information in a structured way.\n\nI need to make a decision here.\n\nI think I'll go with informational books as the best referent for sources that give verifiable factual information or explain aspects of the world.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Informational Books.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
