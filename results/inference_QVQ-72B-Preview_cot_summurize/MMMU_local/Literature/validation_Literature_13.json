On the spine, it says \"READ ME\" also in black. The background is gray with some yellow speckles, and there's a shadow under the book, which gives it a slightly 3D effect.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out what parts of the book are being referred to in the question. The question mentions \"usually two boards that make the book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf.\" Hmm, that sounds like the hard covers of a book. You know, the hardbound covers that protect the pages and help the book stand upright on a shelf.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Hates\n\nB. Motif\n\nC. Drifts\n\nD. Covers\n\nNone of these seem directly related to the description except for \"covers.\" \"Hates,\" \"motif,\" and \"drifts\" don't make much sense in this context. So, \"covers\" seems like the obvious choice.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there any possibility that one of the other options could be related if we interpret the question differently?\n\nLet's see. The question is: \"which term refers to the usually two boards that make the book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf?\"\n\n\"Two boards\" sounds like the two covers of a book\u2014the front and back covers\u2014that are typically made of cardboard or hardboard in hardcover books, which provide stiffness and protection.\n\n\"Make the book more durable\" \u2014 that fits because hard covers protect the book from wear and tear.\n\n\"Allow it to stand on a shelf\" \u2014 yes, because the covers are rigid, they enable the book to stand upright on a shelf without falling over.\n\nSo, \"covers\" is the logical answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly relate.\n\n\"A. Hates\" \u2014 this doesn't seem to relate to any part of a book. Maybe it's a typo or meant to be another word, but as it stands, it doesn't fit.\n\n\"B. Motif\" \u2014 a motif is a recurring element or theme in art or literature, which isn't related to the physical structure of a book.\n\n\"C. Drifts\" \u2014 this could refer to something like driftwood or drifting sand, but again, not related to book construction.\n\nTherefore, the only suitable answer is \"D. Covers.\"\n\nJust to double-check, perhaps there's some trick here. Maybe the question is trying to test understanding of book anatomy in a clever way.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the \"two boards\" are not just any covers but specifically the hardcovers. In bookbinding, a hardcover book has two rigid covers attached to the spine, which indeed make the book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf.\n\nAlternatively, a paperback book has softer covers, which are less sturdy and don't provide the same structural support for shelving.\n\nSo, yes, the hardcovers are the two boards that make a book durable and shelf-friendly.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The question is straightforward, and the answer is \"covers.\"\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I should consider the context of the image. The book has a face on it and says \"DON'T JUDGE ME\" and \"READ ME.\" This seems to personify the book, giving it a personality and perhaps suggesting that it doesn't want to be judged by its cover.\n\nBut that's more about the thematic elements of the image rather than the structural components of the book.\n\nIn conclusion, the term that refers to the usually two boards that make a book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf is \"covers.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Covers}} \\]"
