Let me try to understand this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative over its entire domain, and it's concave if the second derivative is non-positive. So, maybe I should start by finding the second derivative of this function.\n\nGiven f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4, let's find f''(x).\n\nFirst, find f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 6\n\nNow, find f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(x) = 2, which is positive for all x, that means the function is convex.\n\nWait, but I think there's something called strictly convex or strictly concave, but in this case, since the second derivative is positive and constant, it should be strictly convex.\n\nBut let me double-check. If f''(x) > 0, the function is strictly convex. Here, f''(x) = 2 > 0 for all x, so yes, it's strictly convex.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Convex\n\nB. Concave\n\nC. Neither\n\nD. Both\n\nSo, according to this, it should be A. Convex.\n\nBut let me think about another way to look at this. Maybe I can analyze the function graphically.\n\nI know that f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4 is a quadratic function, and quadratic functions are parabolas. The coefficient of x^2 is positive (which is 1), so the parabola opens upwards. That means it's a minimum point at the vertex, and overall, it's convex.\n\nIf it were concave, the parabola would open downwards, like f(x) = -x^2, which has a maximum point.\n\nSo, again, this suggests that the function is convex.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I can check if the function is convex by definition.\n\nA function is convex if for any two points x1 and x2, and any t in [0,1], the following holds:\n\nf(tx1 + (1-t)x2) <= t f(x1) + (1-t) f(x2)\n\nBut this seems a bit involved for this function. Since it's a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient, I'm pretty confident it's convex.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the Hessian matrix for multivariate functions, but since this is a univariate function, the second derivative test suffices.\n\nWait a minute, the function is f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 4. Is there any part of the function that could make it non-convex or concave in some regions?\n\nLet me consider the first derivative: f'(x) = 2x - 6. Setting this to zero, x = 3.\n\nAt x = 3, the function has a minimum, which is consistent with a convex function.\n\nSo, all signs point to A. Convex.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the definition of concave.\n\nA function is concave if for any two points x1 and x2, and any t in [0,1], the following holds:\n\nf(tx1 + (1-t)x2) >= t f(x1) + (1-t) f(x2)\n\nGiven that our function is a parabola opening upwards, this wouldn't hold, as the function is always above the straight line connecting two points.\n\nTherefore, it's not concave.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Convex.\n\nWait, but option D says \"Both.\" That can't be right because a function can't be both convex and concave unless it's affine, which this isn't.\n\nSo, A. Convex is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Convex}} \\]"
