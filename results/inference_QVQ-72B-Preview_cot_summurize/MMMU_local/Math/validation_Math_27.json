                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this geometry problem where two chords of a circle intersect at a point called E. The chords are AB and CD, and they cross each other at E. I'm given some lengths: CE is 10, ED is 6, and AE is 4. I need to find the length of EB.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a theorem about intersecting chords in a circle. Let me recall... Oh, right! It's called the Intersecting Chords Theorem. That says that when two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of the lengths of their segments are equal. So, in other words, CE times ED should equal AE times EB.\n\nWait, let's write that down to make sure. So, according to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:\n\nCE * ED = AE * EB\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n10 * 6 = 4 * EB\n\nLet me calculate 10 times 6. That's 60.\n\nSo, 60 = 4 * EB\n\nNow, I need to solve for EB. I can divide both sides by 4.\n\nEB = 60 / 4\n\nEB = 15\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to approach this, or perhaps there's something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider similar triangles. Since AB and CD are chords intersecting at E, there might be similar triangles there. Let's see.\n\nTriangle CED and triangle AEB are both formed by the intersecting chords. Maybe they have some relationship.\n\nLooking at angles:\n\nIn triangle CED, angle CED is the same as angle AEB because they are vertical angles.\n\nAlso, angles C and A are both subtended by the same arc, so they might be equal.\n\nWait, actually, in a circle, angles subtended by the same arc are equal.\n\nSo, angle C might be equal to angle A, and angle D might be equal to angle B.\n\nIf that's the case, then triangles CED and AEB would be similar by AA similarity.\n\nIf they are similar, then their corresponding sides are proportional.\n\nSo, let's assume triangles CED and AEB are similar.\n\nThen, CE/AE = ED/EB\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n10/4 = 6/EB\n\nSimplify 10/4, which is 2.5.\n\nSo, 2.5 = 6 / EB\n\nNow, solving for EB:\n\nEB = 6 / 2.5\n\nEB = 2.4\n\nWait a second, now I have EB = 2.4 from the similar triangles, but earlier, using the Intersecting Chords Theorem, I got EB = 15. That can't be right; they should both lead to the same answer.\n\nHmm, there must be a mistake in one of these approaches.\n\nLet me check the similar triangles method again.\n\nIf triangles CED and AEB are similar, then the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.\n\nSo, CE/AE should equal ED/EB, which is what I set up.\n\nBut if CE is 10, AE is 4, ED is 6, then 10/4 = 2.5, and 6/EB = 2.5, so EB = 6/2.5 = 2.4.\n\nBut earlier, using the Intersecting Chords Theorem, I got EB = 15.\n\nThere must be a mistake in assuming the triangles are similar. Maybe they're not similar in this case.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should draw radii or look for other properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Power of a Point Theorem, which is related to the Intersecting Chords Theorem.\n\nWait, the Intersecting Chords Theorem states that CE * ED = AE * EB, which is what I used earlier.\n\nBut I must have made a mistake because I got two different values for EB.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst method:\n\nCE * ED = AE * EB\n\n10 * 6 = 4 * EB\n\n60 = 4 EB\n\nEB = 60 / 4 = 15\n\nSecond method:\n\nTriangles CED and AEB are similar.\n\nIf they are similar, then CE/AE = ED/EB\n\nSo, 10/4 = 6/EB\n\n10/4 = 2.5\n\n2.5 = 6/EB\n\nEB = 6 / 2.5 = 2.4\n\nBut these give different answers. One is 15, the other is 2.4.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI suspect that the similar triangles assumption is incorrect in this case.\n\nLet me try to find out if triangles CED and AEB are indeed similar.\n\nLooking at the angles:\n\nAngle CED and angle AEB are vertical angles, so they are equal.\n\nBut for the triangles to be similar by AA, I need another pair of corresponding angles to be equal.\n\nAre angle C and angle A equal? Are angle D and angle B equal?\n\nI don't think so, unless there's some other property at play.\n\nMaybe I need to look at different triangles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the fact that the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord, which is what the Intersecting Chords Theorem says.\n\nSince that gave me EB = 15, and the similar triangles method gave me EB = 2.4, and these are very different, I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me consider the options provided. The choices are:\n\nA. 15\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 6.7\n\nD. 2.4\n\nSo, both methods gave me answers that are among the options.\n\nBut since the Intersecting Chords Theorem is a standard theorem and directly applicable here, I should trust that more.\n\nMaybe the similar triangles approach is flawed because the triangles aren't similar in this case.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the Intersecting Chords Theorem.\n\nThus, EB = 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
