                    "text": "Let's dive into this geometry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. We have a trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(BC = CD = 43\\). Also, \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BD\\), and there's a point \\(O\\) where the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) intersect. Additionally, \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), and we're given that \\(OP = 11\\). We need to find the length of \\(AD\\) in the form \\(m\\sqrt{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers and \\(n\\) is square-free, and then find \\(m + n\\).\n\nFirst, since \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) has one pair of parallel sides. Given that \\(BC = CD = 43\\), it seems like sides \\(BC\\) and \\(CD\\) are equal, which might make the trapezoid isosceles, but wait, in an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal, and the base angles are equal. However, here \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are parallel, and \\(BC = CD = 43\\), so it's not necessarily isosceles in the usual sense unless \\(AD\\) also equals 43, which we don't know yet.\n\nNext, \\(AD \\perp BD\\), meaning \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BD\\). That gives us a right angle at \\(D\\), which could be useful for setting up coordinates or using properties of right triangles.\n\nLet's consider placing the trapezoid on a coordinate plane to make things easier. Let's place point \\(D\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), and since \\(AD \\perp BD\\), let's assume \\(BD\\) lies along the x-axis for simplicity. Wait, but \\(BD\\) is a diagonal, so that might not be the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(AD \\perp BD\\), maybe it's better to consider \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((0,a)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((b,0)\\), with \\(C\\) at \\((c,d)\\). But that might get messy.\n\nLet me think differently. Since \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), the slopes of \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) must be equal. If I can find coordinates for all four points, I can use that.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way using properties of trapezoids and their diagonals.\n\nGiven that \\(O\\) is the intersection point of the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\), and \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), with \\(OP = 11\\), maybe I can find relationships between these points.\n\nLet's recall that in a trapezoid with parallel sides \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\), the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) intersect at point \\(O\\), and the ratio \\(AO:OC = BO:OD\\).\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can express lengths in terms of this ratio.\n\nLet me denote the ratio \\(k = \\frac{AO}{OC} = \\frac{BO}{OD}\\).\n\nSince \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), then \\(BP = PD\\), and \\(OP = 11\\).\n\nLet me consider triangle \\(BOP\\) and triangle \\(DOP\\). Since \\(P\\) is the midpoint, \\(BP = PD\\), and \\(OP = 11\\).\n\nWait, perhaps mass point geometry could be useful here, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry is still the way to go. Let's try that.\n\nLet's place point \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), and since \\(AD \\perp BD\\), let's place \\(A\\) at \\((0,a)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((b,0)\\), with \\(C\\) at \\((c,d)\\).\n\nSince \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), the vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{CD}\\) should be scalar multiples of each other.\n\n\\(\\vec{AB} = (b, -a)\\), and \\(\\vec{CD} = (c - 0, d - 0) = (c, d)\\).\n\nFor them to be parallel, their slopes should be equal, so \\(\\frac{-a}{b} = \\frac{d}{c}\\), which implies \\(ad = -bc\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nNext, let's find the equations of the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\).\n\nFirst, diagonal \\(BD\\): it goes from \\(B(b,0)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), so its equation is just the x-axis, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(D\\) is at \\((0,0)\\), and \\(B\\) is at \\((b,0)\\), so yes, \\(BD\\) is along the x-axis.\n\nThen, diagonal \\(AC\\) goes from \\(A(0,a)\\) to \\(C(c,d)\\). Its slope is \\(\\frac{d - a}{c - 0} = \\frac{d - a}{c}\\), so its equation is \\(y = \\frac{d - a}{c}x + a\\).\n\nThe intersection point \\(O\\) is where \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) intersect. Since \\(BD\\) is \\(y = 0\\), substitute into \\(AC\\):\n\n\\(0 = \\frac{d - a}{c}x + a\\), which gives \\(x = -\\frac{a c}{d - a}\\).\n\nSo, point \\(O\\) is at \\((- \\frac{a c}{d - a}, 0)\\).\n\nNow, point \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), which is from \\(B(b,0)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), so \\(P\\) is at \\((\\frac{b + 0}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2}) = (\\frac{b}{2}, 0)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(OP = 11\\), the distance between \\(O\\) and \\(P\\) is 11.\n\nSo, the distance between \\((- \\frac{a c}{d - a}, 0)\\) and \\((\\frac{b}{2}, 0)\\) is 11.\n\nThus, \\(\\left| -\\frac{a c}{d - a} - \\frac{b}{2} \\right| = 11\\).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nLet me consider the lengths given: \\(BC = CD = 43\\).\n\nSince \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(BC = CD\\), perhaps trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) is symmetrical in some way, but not necessarily isosceles because the non-parallel sides aren't specified to be equal unless \\(AB = AD\\), which we don't know.\n\nWait, but \\(BC = CD = 43\\), and \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), so maybe \\(AB = CD = 43\\)? But that would make it a parallelogram, which it's not, since \\(AD\\) isn't necessarily equal to \\(BC\\).\n\nWait, no. If \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) and \\(AB = CD\\), then it would be a parallelogram, but the problem states it's a trapezoid, so \\(AB \\neq CD\\). Therefore, \\(AB \\neq CD\\), meaning \\(AB \\neq 43\\).\n\nSo, \\(CD = 43\\), and \\(AB \\neq 43\\).\n\nNow, considering \\(AD \\perp BD\\), perhaps I can look at triangle \\(ABD\\) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the properties of medians or centroids, but \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), and \\(O\\) is the intersection of the diagonals.\n\nWait, perhaps similar triangles can help here.\n\nLet me see: since \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), triangles \\(ABO\\) and \\(CDO\\) are similar by AA similarity because corresponding angles are equal.\n\nSo, \\(\\triangle ABO \\sim \\triangle CDO\\).\n\nTherefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:\n\n\\(\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{BO}{DO} = \\frac{AO}{CO}\\).\n\nLet me denote \\(k = \\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{BO}{DO} = \\frac{AO}{CO}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(CD = 43\\), and \\(AB \\neq 43\\), \\(k\\) is either greater than or less than 1.\n\nNow, since \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), \\(BP = PD\\), and \\(OP = 11\\).\n\nLet me consider the vector from \\(O\\) to \\(P\\), which is \\(\\vec{OP}\\).\n\nSince \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), and \\(O\\) is the intersection of the diagonals, perhaps there's a relationship involving the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mass point geometry could be applied here, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to express lengths in terms of \\(k\\).\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\(DO = x\\), then \\(BO = kx\\), and \\(AO = k \\cdot CO\\).\n\nBut since \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(AB = k \\cdot CD\\), then \\(AO = k \\cdot CO\\), and \\(BO = k \\cdot DO\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I can find coordinates based on this.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates again.\n\nLet\u2019s place \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((43,0)\\), since \\(CD = 43\\), and \\(B\\) somewhere in the plane such that \\(BC = 43\\), so \\(B\\) is on a circle centered at \\(C\\) with radius 43.\n\nSince \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(CD\\) is along the x-axis from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((43,0)\\), then \\(AB\\) should also be parallel to the x-axis, meaning it's horizontal.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the height of the trapezoid as \\(h\\), which would be the y-coordinate of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), since \\(AB\\) is horizontal.\n\nWait, but \\(AB\\) is parallel to \\(CD\\), which is along the x-axis, so \\(AB\\) should also be along a horizontal line, meaning \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same y-coordinate.\n\nBut \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(BD\\), and \\(D\\) is at \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) is at \\((a,h)\\), \\(B\\) is at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(C\\) is at \\((43,0)\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I placed \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((43,0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(A\\) at \\((a,h)\\), but that might not be accurate because \\(AB\\) should be parallel to \\(CD\\), which is along the x-axis, so \\(AB\\) should also be horizontal, meaning \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same y-coordinate.\n\nBut \\(AD\\) is from \\(A(a,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), and \\(BD\\) is from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(AD \\perp BD\\), the slopes of \\(AD\\) and \\(BD\\) should be negative reciprocals.\n\nThe slope of \\(AD\\) is \\(\\frac{h - 0}{a - 0} = \\frac{h}{a}\\), and the slope of \\(BD\\) is \\(\\frac{h - 0}{b - 0} = \\frac{h}{b}\\).\n\nFor them to be perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:\n\n\\(\\frac{h}{a} \\cdot \\frac{h}{b} = -1\\), so \\(\\frac{h^2}{a b} = -1\\), which doesn't make sense because lengths are positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning coordinates.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSince \\(AD \\perp BD\\), and \\(D\\) is at \\((0,0)\\), maybe it's better to place \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((0,a)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((b,0)\\), with \\(C\\) at \\((c,d)\\).\n\nThen, \\(AD\\) is from \\((0,a)\\) to \\((0,0)\\), which is vertical, and \\(BD\\) is from \\((b,0)\\) to \\((0,0)\\), which is horizontal. Indeed, they are perpendicular.\n\nNow, since \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), the vectors \\(\\vec{AB}\\) and \\(\\vec{CD}\\) should be scalar multiples of each other.\n\n\\(\\vec{AB} = (b - 0, 0 - a) = (b, -a)\\), and \\(\\vec{CD} = (c - 0, d - 0) = (c, d)\\).\n\nFor them to be parallel, their slopes should be equal, so \\(\\frac{-a}{b} = \\frac{d}{c}\\), which implies \\(a d = -b c\\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nNext, since \\(BC = CD = 43\\), and \\(C\\) is at \\((c,d)\\), \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((b,0)\\), then the distance from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is 43:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(c - b)^2 + (d - 0)^2} = 43\\), so \\((c - b)^2 + d^2 = 43^2 = 1849\\).\n\nAlso, the distance from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) is 43:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(c - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2} = 43\\), so \\(c^2 + d^2 = 1849\\).\n\nSubtracting these two equations:\n\n\\((c - b)^2 + d^2 - (c^2 + d^2) = 0\\), which simplifies to \\((c - b)^2 - c^2 = 0\\), so \\(c^2 - 2 b c + b^2 - c^2 = -2 b c + b^2 = 0\\), hence \\(b^2 = 2 b c\\), so \\(b = 2 c\\), assuming \\(c \\neq 0\\).\n\nSo, \\(b = 2 c\\).\n\nNow, since \\(c^2 + d^2 = 1849\\), and \\(b = 2 c\\), we can express everything in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nLet me substitute \\(b = 2 c\\) into the earlier equation \\(a d = -b c\\):\n\n\\(a d = - (2 c) c = -2 c^2\\), so \\(a d = -2 c^2\\).\n\nNot sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point \\(O\\), the intersection of diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\).\n\nFirst, diagonal \\(BD\\) goes from \\(B(2 c, 0)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), which is just the x-axis, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nDiagonal \\(AC\\) goes from \\(A(0,a)\\) to \\(C(c,d)\\).\n\nThe equation of \\(AC\\) is:\n\nThe slope is \\(\\frac{d - a}{c - 0} = \\frac{d - a}{c}\\), so the equation is \\(y - a = \\frac{d - a}{c} (x - 0)\\), which simplifies to \\(y = \\frac{d - a}{c} x + a\\).\n\nTo find \\(O\\), set \\(y = 0\\) (since it's on \\(BD\\), which is \\(y = 0\\)):\n\n\\(0 = \\frac{d - a}{c} x + a\\), so \\(\\frac{d - a}{c} x = -a\\), hence \\(x = -a \\cdot \\frac{c}{d - a}\\).\n\nSo, \\(O\\) is at \\(\\left( -a \\cdot \\frac{c}{d - a}, 0 \\right)\\).\n\nNow, point \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), which goes from \\(B(2 c, 0)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), so \\(P\\) is at \\(\\left( \\frac{2 c + 0}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (c, 0)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(OP = 11\\), the distance between \\(O\\) and \\(P\\) is 11.\n\nSo, the distance between \\(\\left( -a \\cdot \\frac{c}{d - a}, 0 \\right)\\) and \\((c, 0)\\) is 11.\n\nThe x-coordinate difference is \\(c - \\left( -a \\cdot \\frac{c}{d - a} \\right) = c + a \\cdot \\frac{c}{d - a} = c \\left(1 + \\frac{a}{d - a}\\right) = c \\left( \\frac{d - a + a}{d - a} \\right) = c \\left( \\frac{d}{d - a} \\right)\\).\n\nSo, \\(OP = \\left| c \\cdot \\frac{d}{d - a} \\right| = 11\\).\n\nAssuming \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are positive, we can write \\(c \\cdot \\frac{d}{d - a} = 11\\).\n\nNow, recall from earlier that \\(a d = -2 c^2\\) (from \\(a d = -b c\\) and \\(b = 2 c\\)).\n\nSo, \\(a d = -2 c^2\\).\n\nLet me express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\): \\(a = -\\frac{2 c^2}{d}\\).\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for \\(OP\\):\n\n\\(c \\cdot \\frac{d}{d - \\left( -\\frac{2 c^2}{d} \\right)} = 11\\), which simplifies to \\(c \\cdot \\frac{d}{d + \\frac{2 c^2}{d}} = 11\\).\n\nCombining the terms in the denominator:\n\n\\(d + \\frac{2 c^"
