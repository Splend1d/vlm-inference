                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rocket being shot from the top of a tower at a 45\u00b0 angle above the horizontal. It hits the ground in 5 seconds, and the horizontal distance from the foot of the tower to where it lands is three times the height of the tower. We need to find the height of the tower.\n\nFirst, let's try to visualize what's going on. There's a tower of height \\(h\\), and from the top of this tower, a rocket is launched at a 45\u00b0 angle. It travels through the air and lands on the ground, which is a horizontal distance of \\(3h\\) from the base of the tower. The total time of flight is 5 seconds.\n\nOkay, so to solve this, I think we should use the equations of motion for projectile motion. Projectile motion problems usually involve breaking things down into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(v_0\\) as the initial velocity of the rocket.\n- \\(g\\) as the acceleration due to gravity (which is approximately 32 ft/s\u00b2 downward).\n- \\(t\\) as the time of flight, which is 5 seconds.\n- \\(h\\) as the height of the tower.\n- The horizontal distance as \\(3h\\).\n\nSince the rocket is launched at a 45\u00b0 angle, the initial horizontal and vertical velocities are equal in magnitude:\n\\[v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(45\u00b0) = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\\[v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(45\u00b0) = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the horizontal motion. The horizontal distance covered in time \\(t\\) is:\n\\[x = v_{0x} \\times t = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5\\]\n\nBut we also know that this horizontal distance is \\(3h\\), so:\n\\[3h = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5\\]\n\nNext, let's consider the vertical motion. The rocket starts at a height of \\(h\\) and ends at a height of 0 (since it hits the ground). The vertical displacement is:\n\\[y = h - 0 = h\\]\n\nThe vertical motion is affected by gravity, so the equation for vertical displacement is:\n\\[y = v_{0y} \\times t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[h = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\times 5^2\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. The equation should be:\n\\[y = y_0 + v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(y_0\\) is the initial height (\\(h\\))\n- \\(v_{0y}\\) is the initial vertical velocity\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity\n- \\(t\\) is time\n\nGiven that it lands on the ground, the final height \\(y = 0\\). So:\n\\[0 = h + v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(45\u00b0) = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and \\(t = 5\\) seconds:\n\\[0 = h + v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\times 25\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[0 = h + v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - 16 \\times 25\\]\n\\[0 = h + v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - 400\\]\n\nNow, from the horizontal part, we have:\n\\[3h = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5\\]\n\nSo, we can solve this equation for \\(v_0\\):\n\\[v_0 = \\frac{3h}{5 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{3h}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6h}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nNow, plug this expression for \\(v_0\\) back into the vertical equation:\n\\[0 = h + \\left(\\frac{6h}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - 400\\]\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{6h}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{6h}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6h}{10} = \\frac{3h}{5}\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[0 = h + \\frac{3h}{5} \\times 5 - 400\\]\n\\[0 = h + 3h - 400\\]\n\\[0 = 4h - 400\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(h\\):\n\\[4h = 400\\]\n\\[h = 100 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nWait, but that's one of the options\u2014option A is \\(h = 100\\) ft. But let's double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the horizontal distance is \\(3h\\), and time is 5 seconds, with \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(45\u00b0) = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). So:\n\\[3h = v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5\\]\n\\[v_0 = \\frac{3h}{5 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{3h \\times 2}{5\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6h}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nThen, vertical motion equation:\n\\[0 = h + v_{0y} \\times t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\]\n\\[0 = h + v_0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\times 25\\]\n\\[0 = h + \\left(\\frac{6h}{5\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 5 - 400\\]\n\\[0 = h + \\frac{6h}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{2} - 400\\]\n\\[0 = h + 3h - 400\\]\n\\[0 = 4h - 400\\]\n\\[h = 100 \\text{ feet}\\]\n\nEverything checks out. So, the height of the tower is 100 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ h = 100 \\ \\text{ft}} \\]"
