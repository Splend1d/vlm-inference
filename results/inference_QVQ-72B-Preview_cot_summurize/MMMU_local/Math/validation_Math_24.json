                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a right circular cone with radius R and height H, and we need to find the dimensions of the right circular cylinder of maximum volume that can be inscribed in this cone. The options are given for the radius of the cylinder, but I want to understand the whole process.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the situation. There's a cone, and inside it, there's a cylinder that fits perfectly without sticking out. The cylinder has a radius r and a height h. Our goal is to find r in terms of R, and also to find h in terms of H, but the question specifically asks for the radius.\n\nI think the key here is to relate r and h to R and H. Since the cylinder is inscribed in the cone, there must be some similarity or proportionality between the dimensions.\n\nLet me consider similar triangles. If I imagine slicing the cone vertically, I can see a triangle formed by the height H and the slant height, with the base being R. Similarly, the cylinder will have a height h and a base of radius r, and when sliced vertically, it will form a smaller similar triangle within the larger one.\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section would show a triangle for the cone and a rectangle for the cylinder, but the top of the cylinder would correspond to a horizontal slice within the cone.\n\nMaybe it's better to think in terms of similar triangles by considering the radius and height relationships.\n\nLet me denote the height from the base of the cone to the base of the cylinder as x, and the height from the base of the cylinder to the apex of the cone as h. So, the total height is H = x + h.\n\nNow, the radius of the cylinder, r, is related to x because as the cylinder moves up, its radius decreases.\n\nSince the cone is a straight-sided figure, the radius and height are linearly related. So, the radius of the cylinder can be expressed in terms of x and H.\n\nSpecifically, the slope of the cone's side is (R - 0)/(H - 0) = R/H. So, for every unit increase in height, the radius increases by R/H.\n\nWait, no. Actually, as the height increases from 0 to H, the radius increases from 0 to R. So, the relationship is r = (R/H) * x, where x is the height from the base to the base of the cylinder.\n\nBut in our case, the cylinder's height h is measured from the base of the cone, so h = x.\n\nWait, I think I need to be careful here. The total height of the cone is H, and the height of the cylinder from the base of the cone is h. So, the height above the cylinder to the apex is H - h.\n\nNow, the radius of the cylinder, r, is related to the height above it, which is H - h, by the similar triangles.\n\nSo, r = (R / H) * (H - h).\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check. At h = 0, r should be R, which makes sense because if the cylinder is at the base, its radius should be the same as the cone's base radius.\n\nAt h = H, r = (R / H) * (H - H) = 0, which also makes sense because if the cylinder is at the apex, its radius should be zero.\n\nSo, yes, r = (R / H) * (H - h) seems correct.\n\nNow, the volume of the cylinder, V, is \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nSubstituting r from above, V = \u03c0 * [(R / H) * (H - h)]\u00b2 * h.\n\nSimplify this: V = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2 * (H - h)\u00b2 * h.\n\nLet me expand (H - h)\u00b2: V = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2 * (H\u00b2 - 2Hh + h\u00b2) * h.\n\nMultiply by h: V = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2 * (H\u00b2h - 2Hh\u00b2 + h\u00b3).\n\nOur goal is to maximize V with respect to h.\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we can take the derivative of V with respect to h and set it to zero.\n\nLet me first factor out constants: V = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2 * (H\u00b2h - 2Hh\u00b2 + h\u00b3).\n\nLet me define k = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2, which is a constant.\n\nSo, V = k * (H\u00b2h - 2Hh\u00b2 + h\u00b3).\n\nNow, take the derivative dV/dh:\n\ndV/dh = k * (H\u00b2 - 4Hh + 3h\u00b2).\n\nSet dV/dh = 0 for maximum volume:\n\nk * (H\u00b2 - 4Hh + 3h\u00b2) = 0.\n\nSince k \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by k:\n\nH\u00b2 - 4Hh + 3h\u00b2 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of h.\n\nLet me try to solve for h using the quadratic formula:\n\nh = [4H \u00b1 sqrt((4H)\u00b2 - 4*3*H\u00b2)] / 6\n\n= [4H \u00b1 sqrt(16H\u00b2 - 12H\u00b2)] / 6\n\n= [4H \u00b1 sqrt(4H\u00b2)] / 6\n\n= [4H \u00b1 2H] / 6\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nh = (4H + 2H)/6 = 6H/6 = H\n\nh = (4H - 2H)/6 = 2H/6 = H/3\n\nNow, h = H would correspond to the minimum volume, since at h = H, r = 0, and V = 0.\n\nSo, the relevant solution is h = H/3.\n\nNow, let's find r when h = H/3.\n\nFrom earlier, r = (R / H) * (H - h) = (R / H) * (H - H/3) = (R / H) * (2H/3) = (2/3) R.\n\nSo, r = (2/3) R.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. r = 2R/3\n\nB. r = 3R/2\n\nC. r = R/3\n\nD. r = 2R\n\nSo, option A. r = 2R/3 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I established the relationship between r and h using similar triangles: r = (R / H) * (H - h).\n\nThen, expressed the volume V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0 * (R / H)\u00b2 * (H - h)\u00b2 * h.\n\nTook the derivative dV/dh and set it to zero to find the maximum volume.\n\nSolved the quadratic equation and found h = H/3.\n\nSubstituted back to find r = (R / H) * (H - H/3) = (2/3) R.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these problems can have multiple solutions or different interpretations, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using similar triangles differently or using proportions.\n\nAnother approach: since r/(H - h) = R/H, as established earlier.\n\nThen, r = (R / H) * (H - h).\n\nWe can express h in terms of r: h = H - (H / R) * r.\n\nNow, the volume V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0r\u00b2 * (H - (H / R) * r).\n\nSimplify: V = \u03c0H r\u00b2 - \u03c0 (H / R) r\u00b3.\n\nNow, take the derivative dV/dr:\n\ndV/dr = \u03c0H (2r) - \u03c0 (H / R) (3r\u00b2) = 2\u03c0Hr - (3\u03c0H / R) r\u00b2.\n\nSet dV/dr = 0 for maximum volume:\n\n2\u03c0Hr - (3\u03c0H / R) r\u00b2 = 0.\n\nFactor out \u03c0Hr:\n\n\u03c0Hr (2 - (3/R) r) = 0.\n\nSince \u03c0Hr \u2260 0, we have:\n\n2 - (3/R) r = 0 \u21d2 2R - 3r = 0 \u21d2 3r = 2R \u21d2 r = (2/3) R.\n\nAgain, we get r = (2/3) R, which confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. r = 2R/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ r = \\frac{2}{3}R} \\]"
