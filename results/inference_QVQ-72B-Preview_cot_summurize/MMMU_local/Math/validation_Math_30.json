Points \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) are located on the sides of the square such that the hexagon \\( APQCRS \\) is equilateral with side length \\( s \\). We need to find the value of \\( s \\).\n\nFirst, let's visualize the square and the hexagon. The square has vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\), with \\( AB = BC = CD = DA = 1 \\). Points \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) are on the sides of the square, and the hexagon formed by connecting \\( A \\), \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( C \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length, each being \\( s \\).\n\nLet's label the sides of the hexagon:\n- \\( AP = s \\)\n- \\( PQ = s \\)\n- \\( QC = s \\)\n- \\( CR = s \\)\n- \\( RS = s \\)\n- \\( SA = s \\)\n\nSince \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) lie on the sides of the square, we can express their positions in terms of \\( s \\).\n\nLet's assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place the square on the coordinate plane:\n\n- Let \\( A = (0, 1) \\)\n- \\( B = (1, 1) \\)\n- \\( C = (1, 0) \\)\n- \\( D = (0, 0) \\)\n\nNow, let's determine the coordinates of points \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\).\n\nStarting with point \\( P \\) on \\( AB \\):\n\n- \\( A = (0, 1) \\)\n- \\( B = (1, 1) \\)\n\nLet\u2019s say \\( P \\) is at a distance \\( s \\) from \\( A \\) along \\( AB \\). Since \\( AB \\) is horizontal at \\( y = 1 \\), moving \\( s \\) units along \\( AB \\) from \\( A \\), \\( P \\) would be at \\( (s, 1) \\).\n\nNext, point \\( Q \\) is on \\( BC \\), and \\( PQ = s \\). \\( P \\) is at \\( (s, 1) \\), and \\( Q \\) is somewhere on \\( BC \\).\n\nSimilarly, point \\( R \\) is on \\( CD \\), and \\( CR = s \\). Finally, point \\( S \\) is on \\( DA \\), and \\( SA = s \\).\n\nLet's find the coordinates step by step.\n\nFirst, find \\( Q \\) on \\( BC \\) such that \\( PQ = s \\).\n\n- \\( P = (s, 1) \\)\n- \\( BC \\) is from \\( B = (1, 1) \\) to \\( C = (1, 0) \\), so it's a vertical line at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( Q = (1, q) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq q \\leq 1 \\).\n\nThen, the distance \\( PQ \\) is:\n\n\\[\nPQ = \\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + (q - 1)^2} = s\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 - s)^2 + (q - 1)^2 = s^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2s + s^2 + q^2 - 2q + 1 = s^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n2 - 2s + q^2 - 2q = 0\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nq^2 - 2q + (2 - 2s) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( q \\):\n\n\\[\nq^2 - 2q + (2 - 2s) = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( q \\):\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(2 - 2s)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 8 + 8s}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4 + 8s}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\n\\[\n-4 + 8s \\geq 0 \\implies 8s \\geq 4 \\implies s \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( s \\) must be at least \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, let's find \\( C = (1, 0) \\), and \\( QC = s \\). Since \\( Q = (1, q) \\), the distance \\( QC \\) is:\n\n\\[\nQC = |q - 0| = |q| = s\n\\]\n\nBecause \\( q \\) is between 0 and 1, \\( |q| = q \\), so \\( q = s \\).\n\nNow, we have \\( q = s \\), and from the quadratic equation earlier:\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4 + 8s}}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( q = s \\), we can set the equation:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4 + 8s}}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n2s = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4 + 8s}\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2:\n\n\\[\n2s - 2 = \\pm \\sqrt{-4 + 8s}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2s - 2)^2 = -4 + 8s\n\\]\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n\\[\n4s^2 - 8s + 4 = -4 + 8s\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n4s^2 - 8s + 4 + 4 - 8s = 0 \\implies 4s^2 - 16s + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by 4:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( s \\) must be less than 1 (the side of the square), we take the smaller root:\n\n\\[\ns = 2 - \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nLet's verify if this value satisfies the earlier condition \\( s \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2 - 1.414 = 0.586 > 0.5\n\\]\n\nSo, it satisfies \\( s \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, let's check the other points to ensure consistency.\n\nNext, point \\( R \\) is on \\( CD \\), and \\( CR = s \\). \\( C = (1, 0) \\), and \\( D = (0, 0) \\), so \\( CD \\) is from \\( (1, 0) \\) to \\( (0, 0) \\), moving left along the x-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( R = (r, 0) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq r \\leq 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( CR = 1 - r = s \\), so \\( r = 1 - s \\).\n\nSimilarly, point \\( S \\) is on \\( DA \\), which is from \\( D = (0, 0) \\) to \\( A = (0, 1) \\), moving up along the y-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( S = (0, s) \\), since \\( SA = s \\), and \\( A = (0, 1) \\).\n\nNow, we need to ensure that \\( RS = s \\).\n\nWe have \\( R = (1 - s, 0) \\) and \\( S = (0, s) \\).\n\nThe distance \\( RS \\) is:\n\n\\[\nRS = \\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + (0 - s)^2} = \\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + s^2}\n\\]\n\nSet this equal to \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + s^2} = s\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 - s)^2 + s^2 = s^2\n\\]\n\nExpand:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2s + s^2 + s^2 = s^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2s + s^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, this is different from what we had earlier. Earlier, we got \\( s = 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\) from the condition \\( QC = s \\), but now from \\( RS = s \\), we get a different equation.\n\nLet\u2019s solve \\( 1 - 2s + s^2 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 2s + 1 = 0 \\implies (s - 1)^2 = 0 \\implies s = 1\n\\]\n\nBut \\( s = 1 \\) would mean that the hexagon sides are equal to the side of the square, which doesn't make sense because the hexagon is supposed to lie inside the square.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that there might be an error in the approach.\n\nLet me re-examine the steps.\n\nFirst, I assumed coordinates for the points, which is fine.\n\nThen, I set \\( P = (s, 1) \\), \\( Q = (1, s) \\), \\( R = (1 - s, 0) \\), and \\( S = (0, s) \\), based on the side lengths.\n\nBut perhaps the positions of \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) are not simply at distances \\( s \\) from their starting points because the hexagon is equilateral, which might impose different constraints.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the hexagon's sides more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nConsider the hexagon \\( APQCRS \\) with all sides equal to \\( s \\).\n\nWe can use vector methods or complex numbers to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using properties of equilateral hexagons inscribed in squares.\n\nLet\u2019s look for symmetries or special properties.\n\nIn an equilateral hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal.\n\nWait, in general, equilateral hexagons have opposite sides equal and parallel, but in this case, since it's inscribed in a square with specific points on the sides, it might not hold.\n\nBut perhaps we can use this property to set up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s place the square on the coordinate plane as before:\n\n- \\( A = (0, 1) \\)\n- \\( B = (1, 1) \\)\n- \\( C = (1, 0) \\)\n- \\( D = (0, 0) \\)\n\nPoints:\n\n- \\( P \\) on \\( AB \\)\n- \\( Q \\) on \\( BC \\)\n- \\( R \\) on \\( CD \\)\n- \\( S \\) on \\( DA \\)\n\nWith \\( AP = PQ = QC = CR = RS = SA = s \\)\n\nLet\u2019s denote the positions:\n\n- \\( P = (p, 1) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq p \\leq 1 \\)\n- \\( Q = (1, q) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq q \\leq 1 \\)\n- \\( R = (r, 0) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq r \\leq 1 \\)\n- \\( S = (0, s) \\), where \\( 0 \\leq s \\leq 1 \\)\n\nWait, but earlier I set \\( S = (0, s) \\), but perhaps it's better to denote it as \\( S = (0, t) \\) to avoid confusion with the side length \\( s \\).\n\nLet\u2019s redefine:\n\n- \\( P = (p, 1) \\)\n- \\( Q = (1, q) \\)\n- \\( R = (r, 0) \\)\n- \\( S = (0, t) \\)\n\nNow, the sides of the hexagon are:\n\n- \\( AP = p \\)\n- \\( PQ = \\sqrt{(1 - p)^2 + (q - 1)^2} \\)\n- \\( QC = 1 - q \\)\n- \\( CR = 1 - r \\)\n- \\( RS = \\sqrt{r^2 + t^2} \\)\n- \\( SA = t \\)\n\nBut according to the problem, all sides are equal to \\( s \\), so:\n\n\\[\np = s \\\\\n\\sqrt{(1 - p)^2 + (q - 1)^2} = s \\\\\n1 - q = s \\\\\n1 - r = s \\\\\n\\sqrt{r^2 + t^2} = s \\\\\nt = s\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( p = s \\), and \\( P = (p, 1) = (s, 1) \\).\n\nFrom \\( 1 - q = s \\), so \\( q = 1 - s \\).\n\nFrom \\( 1 - r = s \\), so \\( r = 1 - s \\).\n\nFrom \\( t = s \\), so \\( S = (0, s) \\).\n\nNow, we need to ensure that \\( RS = s \\), where \\( R = (1 - s, 0) \\) and \\( S = (0, s) \\).\n\nThe distance \\( RS \\) is:\n\n\\[\nRS = \\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + s^2} = s\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(1 - s)^2 + s^2} = s \\\\\n(1 - s)^2 + s^2 = s^2 \\\\\n1 - 2s + s^2 + s^2 = s^2 \\\\\n1 - 2s + s^2 = 0 \\\\\ns^2 - 2s + 1 = 0 \\\\\n(s - 1)^2 = 0 \\\\\ns = 1\n\\]\n\nBut \\( s = 1 \\) would mean the hexagon sides are equal to the side of the square, which doesn't make sense because the hexagon can't fit inside the square with sides equal to the square's sides.\n\nThis suggests there's an inconsistency in the approach.\n\nPerhaps the assumption that \\( S = (0, s) \\) is incorrect. Maybe \\( S \\) is at \\( (s, 0) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( S = (s, 0) \\).\n\nThen, \\( SA = \\sqrt{s^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{s^2 + 1} \\), which should equal \\( s \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{s^2 + 1} = s \\\\\ns^2 + 1 = s^2 \\\\\n1 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( S = (0, 1 - s) \\).\n\nThen, \\( SA = 1 - s \\), which should equal \\( s \\), so:\n\n\\[\n1 - s = s \\\\\n1 = 2s \\\\\ns = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut earlier, we had \\( s \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\), and from the quadratic \\( s = 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.586 \\), which is greater than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), but now from \\( SA = s \\), we get \\( s = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which is inconsistent.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the positions of the points is flawed.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the hexagon's properties more carefully.\n\nIn an equilateral hexagon, opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n\nGiven that, maybe points \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), \\( R \\), and \\( S \\) are positioned such that \\( AP \\parallel CR \\), \\( PQ \\parallel SA \\), and \\( QC \\parallel RS \\).\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps I can set up equations based on these parallelisms.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nFirst, \\( AP \\parallel CR \\).\n\nSince \\( AP \\) is along \\( AB \\), which is horizontal, and \\( CR \\) is along \\( CD \\), which is also horizontal, they are already parallel.\n\nSimilarly, \\( PQ \\) is from \\( P \\) to \\( Q \\), and \\( SA \\) is from \\( S \\) to \\( A \\).\n\nIf \\( PQ \\parallel SA \\), and \\( QC \\parallel RS \\), then perhaps I can find relationships between the coordinates.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( P = (p, 1) \\)\n- \\( Q = (1, q) \\)\n- \\( R = (r, 0) \\)\n- \\( S = (0, t) \\)\n\nGiven that \\( AP = PQ = QC = CR = RS = SA = s \\), and \\( AP \\parallel CR \\), \\( PQ \\parallel SA \\), \\( QC \\parallel RS \\).\n\nFrom \\( AP \\parallel CR \\), since both are horizontal, their lengths are equal to \\( s \\), so:\n\n- \\( AP = p = s \\)\n- \\( CR = 1 - r = s \\), so \\( r = 1 - s \\)\n\nFrom \\( PQ \\parallel SA \\):\n\n- Vector \\( PQ = (1 - p, q - 1) = (1 - s, q - 1) \\)\n- Vector \\( SA = (0 - s, 1 - t) = (-s, 1 - t) \\)\n\nSince \\( PQ \\parallel SA \\), their vectors are scalar multiples of each other:\n\n\\[\n(1 - s, q - 1) = k (-s, 1 - t)\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n1 - s = -k s \\\\\nq - 1 = k (1 - t)\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[\n1 - s = -k s \\\\\nk = -\\frac{1 - s}{s}\n\\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[\nq - 1 = k (1 - t) = -\\frac{1 - s}{s} (1 - t)\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, from \\( QC \\parallel RS \\):\n\n- Vector \\( QC = (0, -q) \\)\n- Vector \\( RS = (r - 0, 0 - t) = (1 - s, -t) \\)\n\nSince \\( QC \\parallel RS \\):\n\n\\[\n(0, -q) = m (1"
