                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got this excursion company that wants to add some small boats to its fleet. There are two types of boats, and they have some constraints on budget and customer demand. The goal is to figure out how many of each type to buy to maximize profit. It sounds like a linear programming problem, which makes sense because there are constraints and an objective function to optimize.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given data:\n\n- For Type 1 boats:\n\n- Capacity: 1,200 customers per season\n\n- Initial cost: $25,000 per boat\n\n- Profit: $4,000 per boat\n\n- For Type 2 boats:\n\n- Capacity: 2,000 customers per season\n\n- Initial cost: $80,000 per boat\n\n- Profit: $7,000 per boat\n\n- Constraints:\n\n- Total investment cannot exceed $200,000\n\n- Total capacity should not exceed the maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season\n\n- Decision variables:\n\n- Let \\( x_1 \\) be the number of Type 1 boats\n\n- Let \\( x_2 \\) be the number of Type 2 boats\n\nThe objective is to maximize profit, which is given by:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 4,000x_1 + 7,000x_2 \\]\n\nNow, let's identify the constraints:\n\n1. Budget constraint:\n\n\\[ 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\n2. Demand constraint:\n\n\\[ 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000 \\]\n\nAdditionally, since the number of boats cannot be negative:\n\n\\[ x_1 \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 \\geq 0 \\]\n\nNow, to solve this linear programming problem, we can graph the feasible region defined by these inequalities and find the point where the objective function reaches its maximum value.\n\nLet's start by graphing the constraints.\n\nFirst, plot the budget constraint:\n\n\\[ 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\nTo make it easier, let's divide the entire inequality by 1,000 to simplify the numbers:\n\n\\[ 25x_1 + 80x_2 \\leq 200 \\]\n\nNow, find the intercepts:\n\n- When \\( x_1 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 80x_2 \\leq 200 \\implies x_2 \\leq \\frac{200}{80} = 2.5 \\]\n\n- When \\( x_2 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 25x_1 \\leq 200 \\implies x_1 \\leq \\frac{200}{25} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, plot points (0, 2.5) and (8, 0) and draw the line \\( 25x_1 + 80x_2 = 200 \\), shading below it.\n\nNext, plot the demand constraint:\n\n\\[ 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000 \\]\n\nAgain, divide by 1,000:\n\n\\[ 1.2x_1 + 2x_2 \\leq 6 \\]\n\nFind the intercepts:\n\n- When \\( x_1 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 2x_2 \\leq 6 \\implies x_2 \\leq 3 \\]\n\n- When \\( x_2 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 1.2x_1 \\leq 6 \\implies x_1 \\leq 5 \\]\n\nPlot points (0, 3) and (5, 0) and draw the line \\( 1.2x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 \\), shading below it.\n\nNow, the feasible region is the area where both shaded regions overlap, and considering \\( x_1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x_2 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nSince we're dealing with whole numbers of boats, we should consider integer values for \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), but for the purpose of graphing, we can treat them as continuous variables and then round appropriately.\n\nNext, we need to find the vertices of the feasible region, as the optimal solution will occur at one of these vertices.\n\nFrom the graph, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at:\n\n1. (0, 0)\n\n2. (0, 2.5)\n\n3. (2, 1)\n\n4. (5, 0)\n\nWait, I need to make sure about the exact coordinates of the vertices. Let's calculate them more carefully.\n\nFirst vertex: (0, 0)\n\nSecond vertex: intersection of the budget constraint and the demand constraint.\n\nSet the two equations equal:\n\n\\[ 25x_1 + 80x_2 = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.2x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 \\]\n\nLet's solve this system.\n\nFirst, multiply the second equation by 20 to make coefficients comparable:\n\n\\[ 25x_1 + 80x_2 = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ 24x_1 + 40x_2 = 120 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[ (25x_1 - 24x_1) + (80x_2 - 40x_2) = 200 - 120 \\]\n\n\\[ x_1 + 40x_2 = 80 \\]\n\n\\[ x_1 = 80 - 40x_2 \\]\n\nNow, plug back into the demand constraint:\n\n\\[ 1.2(80 - 40x_2) + 2x_2 = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 96 - 48x_2 + 2x_2 = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ 96 - 46x_2 = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ -46x_2 = 6 - 96 \\]\n\n\\[ -46x_2 = -90 \\]\n\n\\[ x_2 = \\frac{90}{46} = \\frac{45}{23} \\approx 1.9565 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ x_1 = 80 - 40 \\left( \\frac{45}{23} \\right) = 80 - \\frac{1800}{23} = 80 - 78.2609 \\approx 1.7391 \\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately (1.74, 1.96). However, since we're dealing with whole numbers of boats, we might need to consider (2, 2), but let's see.\n\nThird vertex: intersection of the budget constraint with the x-axis (x_2 = 0):\n\nFrom the budget constraint:\n\n\\[ 25x_1 + 80(0) = 200 \\implies x_1 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, (8, 0)\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was (5, 0) based on the demand constraint. Let's check that.\n\nFrom the demand constraint:\n\n\\[ 1.2x_1 + 2(0) = 6 \\implies x_1 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the third vertex should be (5, 0), not (8, 0).\n\nFourth vertex: intersection of the demand constraint with the y-axis (x_1 = 0):\n\nFrom the demand constraint:\n\n\\[ 1.2(0) + 2x_2 = 6 \\implies x_2 = 3 \\]\n\nBut we also have the budget constraint:\n\n\\[ 25(0) + 80x_2 = 200 \\implies x_2 = 2.5 \\]\n\nSo, the actual vertex is (0, 2.5), since beyond that, the budget constraint is violated.\n\nWait, there's inconsistency here. Let's re-examine.\n\nFrom the demand constraint, x_1 can be at most 5 when x_2 = 0. From the budget constraint, x_1 can be up to 8 when x_2 = 0. However, due to the demand constraint, x_1 cannot exceed 5. Similarly, for x_2, from the budget constraint, x_2 cannot exceed 2.5 when x_1 = 0, and from the demand constraint, x_2 cannot exceed 3. So, the feasible region is bounded by:\n\n- (0, 0)\n\n- (0, 2.5)\n\n- Intersection point of budget and demand constraints: (approximately 1.74, 1.96)\n\n- (5, 0)\n\nBut since we need integer solutions, we'll consider the integer points within this region.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. At (0, 0):\n\n\\[ f(0, 0) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(0) = 0 \\]\n\n2. At (0, 2):\n\n\\[ f(0, 2) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(2) = 14,000 \\]\n\nWait, but x_2 can be 2.5, but since we need integer values, x_2 can be 2 or 3. But at x_2 = 3, does it satisfy the budget constraint?\n\nLet's check:\n\nAt x_1 = 0, x_2 = 3:\n\n\\[ 25(0) + 80(3) = 240,000 \\leq 200,000? \\]\n\nNo, 240,000 > 200,000, so x_2 cannot be 3 when x_1 = 0. Therefore, the feasible integer values for x_2 when x_1 = 0 are up to 2.\n\nSimilarly, at x_2 = 2:\n\n\\[ f(0, 2) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(2) = 14,000 \\]\n\nAt x_2 = 1:\n\n\\[ f(0, 1) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(1) = 7,000 \\]\n\nNow, at x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2:\n\nCheck if this satisfies both constraints.\n\nFirst, cost:\n\n\\[ 25,000(1) + 80,000(2) = 25,000 + 160,000 = 185,000 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\nDemand:\n\n\\[ 1,200(1) + 2,000(2) = 1,200 + 4,000 = 5,200 \\leq 6,000 \\]\n\nSo, feasible.\n\n\\[ f(1, 2) = 4,000(1) + 7,000(2) = 4,000 + 14,000 = 18,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1:\n\n\\[ cost = 25,000 + 80,000 = 105,000 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\n\\[ demand = 1,200 + 2,000 = 3,200 \\leq 6,000 \\]\n\n\\[ f(1, 1) = 4,000 + 7,000 = 11,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0:\n\n\\[ f(1, 0) = 4,000 + 0 = 4,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 2, x_2 = 1:\n\n\\[ cost = 50,000 + 80,000 = 130,000 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\n\\[ demand = 2,400 + 2,000 = 4,400 \\leq 6,000 \\]\n\n\\[ f(2, 1) = 8,000 + 7,000 = 15,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 2, x_2 = 0:\n\n\\[ f(2, 0) = 8,000 + 0 = 8,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 3, x_2 = 0:\n\n\\[ f(3, 0) = 12,000 + 0 = 12,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 4, x_2 = 0:\n\n\\[ f(4, 0) = 16,000 + 0 = 16,000 \\]\n\nAt x_1 = 5, x_2 = 0:\n\n\\[ f(5, 0) = 20,000 + 0 = 20,000 \\]\n\nWait a minute, according to the demand constraint, x_1 can be up to 5, which gives a capacity of 6,000, exactly meeting the demand. But according to the budget constraint, at x_1 = 5:\n\n\\[ 25,000(5) + 80,000(0) = 125,000 \\leq 200,000 \\]\n\nSo, feasible.\n\nBut earlier, I thought x_1 could be up to 8 based on the budget constraint, but the demand constraint limits it to 5.\n\nNow, looking back at the intersection point (1.74, 1.96), which corresponds to approximately x_1 = 2, x_2 = 2.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave x_1 \u2248 1.74 and x_2 \u2248 1.96.\n\nBut since we need integer solutions, we consider x_1 = 2 and x_2 = 2, which we already evaluated.\n\nNow, let's list all feasible integer combinations and their corresponding profits:\n\n1. (0, 0): $0\n\n2. (0, 1): $7,000\n\n3. (0, 2): $14,000\n\n4. (1, 0): $4,000\n\n5. (1, 1): $11,000\n\n6. (1, 2): $18,000\n\n7. (2, 0): $8,000\n\n8. (2, 1): $15,000\n\n9. (3, 0): $12,000\n\n10. (4, 0): $16,000\n\n11. (5, 0): $20,000\n\nFrom these, the maximum profit is $20,000 at (5, 0), which corresponds to buying 5 Type 1 boats and 0 Type 2 boats.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there are any other combinations that might yield a higher profit.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2\n\nLet's check if (4, 1) is feasible.\n\nCost: 25,000*4 + 80,000*1 = 100,000 + 80,000 = 180,000 \u2264 200,000\n\nDemand: 1,200*4 + 2,000*1 = 4,800 + 2,000 = 6,800 > 6,000 \u2192 violates demand constraint. So, not feasible.\n\nB. 5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2\n\nAs previously calculated, feasible with profit $20,000.\n\nC. 3 boats of Type 1 and 2 boats of Type 2\n\nCost: 25,000*3 + 80,000*2 = 75,000 + 160,000 = 235,000 > 200,000 \u2192 not feasible.\n\nD. 6 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2\n\nDemand: 1,200*6 = 7,200 > 6,000 \u2192 not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible option among these is B. 5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2, yielding a profit of $20,000.\n\nHowever, looking back at the feasible region, (5, 0) is indeed on the demand constraint boundary, and within the feasible region. No other combination within the feasible region offers a higher profit.\n\nThus, the optimal solution is to purchase 5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
