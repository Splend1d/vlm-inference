                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a circular lake with a radius of 1 mile, and points P and Q are diametrically opposite each other on the shore. That means Q is directly across from P, right? So, the distance between P and Q along the shore would be the circumference of the circle, which is 2\u03c0 miles, but walking all the way around wouldn't be the most efficient way.\n\nThe man can row at 1.5 miles per hour and walk at 3 miles per hour. He wants to minimize the time it takes to get from P to Q, and he can choose an angle \u03b8 to row from P towards a point R on the shore, and then walk from R to Q.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry of the situation. Since it's a circle with radius 1, and P and Q are diametrically opposite, the straight line from P to Q passes through the center O of the circle. The distance from O to P or O to Q is 1 mile.\n\nHe rows from P to R at an angle \u03b8 from the line PQ. So, angle POR is \u03b8, and angle QOR is 2\u03b8 because the angle at O is twice the angle at R subtended by the same arc PR.\n\nWait, actually, in a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. But in this case, PR is a chord, and the angle at R subtended by arc PR would be \u03b8, and the central angle POR would be 2\u03b8. But in this diagram, it seems like angle POR is \u03b8, and angle QOR is 2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at the figure again. The figure is Figure 16-5, and it shows points P, Q, R on the circumference, with angles \u03b8 and 2\u03b8 marked.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Point P is one end of the diameter, Q is the other end, and O is the center. If I draw PR at an angle \u03b8 from PQ, then the central angle POR should be \u03b8, and the angle between QR and PQ should be 2\u03b8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates to make this clearer. Let's place the circle on a coordinate plane with center O at (0,0), P at (-1,0), and Q at (1,0). Then, point R is at an angle \u03b8 from P, so its coordinates would be (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8).\n\nThe distance he rows from P to R is the chord length, which can be calculated using the law of cosines or just the distance formula. The distance formula between two points in the plane is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So, distance PR = sqrt[(cos \u03b8 - (-1))^2 + (sin \u03b8 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(cos \u03b8 + 1)^2 + sin^2 \u03b8].\n\nExpanding that: (cos \u03b8 + 1)^2 = cos^2 \u03b8 + 2 cos \u03b8 + 1, and sin^2 \u03b8 = 1 - cos^2 \u03b8. So, the expression becomes sqrt[cos^2 \u03b8 + 2 cos \u03b8 + 1 + 1 - cos^2 \u03b8] = sqrt[2 + 2 cos \u03b8] = sqrt[2(1 + cos \u03b8)].\n\nI recall that 1 + cos \u03b8 = 2 cos^2 (\u03b8/2), so sqrt[2(1 + cos \u03b8)] = sqrt[4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2)] = 2 |cos (\u03b8/2)|. Since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, cos (\u03b8/2) is positive, so distance PR = 2 cos (\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about using the law of cosines. Let's see if that matches.\n\nIn triangle POR, where O is the center, angle at O is \u03b8, and the radii are 1. So, by law of cosines, PR^2 = OP^2 + OR^2 - 2*OP*OR*cos \u03b8 = 1 + 1 - 2*1*1*cos \u03b8 = 2 - 2 cos \u03b8.\n\nBut earlier, I got PR = 2 cos (\u03b8/2). So, PR^2 = 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2). Setting them equal: 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) = 2 - 2 cos \u03b8.\n\nWait, is that true? Let's see: cos (\u03b8) = 2 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) - 1, so 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 = 2 - 2(2 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) - 1) = 2 - 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) + 2 = 4 - 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2). But PR^2 = 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2), so 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) = 4 - 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2), which implies 8 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) = 4, so cos^2 (\u03b8/2) = 1/2, which would imply \u03b8/2 = \u03c0/4, or \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. But that can't be, because \u03b8 is supposed to be between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nI must have made a mistake in equating the two expressions for PR^2. Let's re-examine.\n\nFrom the distance formula: PR = 2 cos (\u03b8/2).\n\nFrom the law of cosines: PR^2 = 2 - 2 cos \u03b8.\n\nSo, PR = sqrt(2 - 2 cos \u03b8).\n\nSetting them equal: sqrt(2 - 2 cos \u03b8) = 2 cos (\u03b8/2).\n\nSquaring both sides: 2 - 2 cos \u03b8 = 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2).\n\nBut cos \u03b8 = 2 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) - 1, so substituting: 2 - 2(2 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) - 1) = 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2).\n\nSimplify: 2 - 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2) + 2 = 4 cos^2 (\u03b8/2).\n\nSo, 4 = 8 cos^2 (\u03b8/2), hence cos^2 (\u03b8/2) = 1/2, which indeed gives \u03b8/2 = \u03c0/4, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\nBut \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is one of the options, but I suspect this is a special case.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the walking distance from R to Q.\n\nPoint Q is at (1,0), and R is at (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8). The walking distance QR is the straight line distance between R and Q.\n\nSo, QR = sqrt[(cos \u03b8 - 1)^2 + (sin \u03b8 - 0)^2] = sqrt[cos^2 \u03b8 - 2 cos \u03b8 + 1 + sin^2 \u03b8] = sqrt[1 - 2 cos \u03b8 + 1] = sqrt[2 - 2 cos \u03b8] = sqrt[2(1 - cos \u03b8)].\n\nSimilarly, using the identity 1 - cos \u03b8 = 2 sin^2 (\u03b8/2), so sqrt[2(1 - cos \u03b8)] = sqrt[4 sin^2 (\u03b8/2)] = 2 |sin (\u03b8/2)|. Since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, sin (\u03b8/2) is positive, so QR = 2 sin (\u03b8/2).\n\nNow, the total time T is the time rowing plus the time walking: T = (PR)/v_row + (QR)/v_walk = (2 cos (\u03b8/2))/1.5 + (2 sin (\u03b8/2))/3.\n\nSimplify: T = (4/3) cos (\u03b8/2) + (2/3) sin (\u03b8/2).\n\nI need to minimize T with respect to \u03b8.\n\nTo find the minimum, take the derivative of T with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nLet me denote \u03b8/2 as \u03b1 for simplicity. Then T = (4/3) cos \u03b1 + (2/3) sin \u03b1.\n\nDifferentiate with respect to \u03b1: dT/d\u03b1 = -(4/3) sin \u03b1 + (2/3) cos \u03b1.\n\nSet dT/d\u03b1 = 0: -(4/3) sin \u03b1 + (2/3) cos \u03b1 = 0 \u21d2 -2 sin \u03b1 + cos \u03b1 = 0 \u21d2 cos \u03b1 = 2 sin \u03b1 \u21d2 tan \u03b1 = 1/2.\n\nSo, tan (\u03b8/2) = 1/2.\n\nThen, \u03b8/2 = arctan(1/2), so \u03b8 = 2 arctan(1/2).\n\nBut this is not one of the given options directly. Let's see what \u03b8 is.\n\nOption A is \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, which is 90 degrees.\n\nOption B is \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, which is 60 degrees.\n\nOption C is \u03b8 = \u03c0, which is 180 degrees.\n\nOption D is \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, which is 360 degrees.\n\nGiven that \u03b8 must be between 0 and \u03c0/2, option D is out of range.\n\nNow, arctan(1/2) is approximately 26.565 degrees, so \u03b8 = 2*26.565 = 53.13 degrees, which is roughly \u03c0/3 radians.\n\nWait, \u03c0/3 is approximately 57.296 degrees, so close but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express \u03b8.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of the rowing and walking speeds.\n\nThe rowing speed is 1.5 mph, and walking is 3 mph.\n\nLet me think about the time spent rowing and walking.\n\nTime rowing: t_row = PR / v_row = 2 cos(\u03b8/2) / 1.5.\n\nTime walking: t_walk = QR / v_walk = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) / 3.\n\nTotal time: T = t_row + t_walk = (2/1.5) cos(\u03b8/2) + (2/3) sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nSimplify: T = (4/3) cos(\u03b8/2) + (2/3) sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nTo minimize T, set dT/d\u03b8 = 0.\n\nAs before, dT/d\u03b8 = - (2/3) sin(\u03b8/2) + (1/3) cos(\u03b8/2) = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: -2 sin(\u03b8/2) + cos(\u03b8/2) = 0.\n\nSo, cos(\u03b8/2) = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) \u21d2 tan(\u03b8/2) = 1/2.\n\nThus, \u03b8/2 = arctan(1/2), so \u03b8 = 2 arctan(1/2).\n\nThis is approximately 53.13 degrees, which is close to 60 degrees, or \u03c0/3 radians.\n\nLooking back at the options, \u03c0/3 is option B.\n\nBut let's confirm if this is indeed the minimum time.\n\nSecond derivative test: d\u00b2T/d\u03b8\u00b2 = - (1/3) cos(\u03b8/2) - (1/3) sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nAt \u03b8/2 = arctan(1/2), cos(arctan(1/2)) = 2/\u221a5, sin(arctan(1/2)) = 1/\u221a5.\n\nSo, d\u00b2T/d\u03b8\u00b2 = - (1/3)(2/\u221a5) - (1/3)(1/\u221a5) = - (3/3)(1/\u221a5) = -1/\u221a5 < 0.\n\nWait, that would suggest a maximum, not a minimum.\n\nThat can't be right.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the second derivative.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\ndT/d\u03b8 = - (2/3) sin(\u03b8/2) + (1/3) cos(\u03b8/2).\n\nThen, d\u00b2T/d\u03b8\u00b2 = - (2/3)(1/2) cos(\u03b8/2) - (1/3)(1/2) sin(\u03b8/2) = - (1/3) cos(\u03b8/2) - (1/6) sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nAt \u03b8/2 = arctan(1/2), cos(\u03b8/2) = 2/\u221a5, sin(\u03b8/2) = 1/\u221a5.\n\nSo, d\u00b2T/d\u03b8\u00b2 = - (1/3)(2/\u221a5) - (1/6)(1/\u221a5) = - (2/3\u221a5) - (1/6\u221a5) = - (4/6\u221a5 + 1/6\u221a5) = - (5/6\u221a5) < 0.\n\nWait, that still gives a negative second derivative, which would suggest a local maximum, not a minimum.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a minimum time.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the nature of the function differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using calculus isn't the best approach here, and I should consider the physics principle that minimizes time.\n\nLet me think about the condition for minimum time.\n\nThe time is T = t_row + t_walk = PR/v_row + QR/v_walk.\n\nTo minimize T, perhaps there's a relationship between the velocities and the path taken.\n\nIn physics, when minimizing time, the path taken should satisfy the condition that the derivative of time with respect to some parameter is zero, which is what I did with calculus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Snell's law can be applied here, although it's typically used in optics for refraction.\n\nBut let's consider the velocities.\n\nLet v_row = 1.5 mph, v_walk = 3 mph.\n\nThe time to row from P to R is PR / v_row, and the time to walk from R to Q is QR / v_walk.\n\nThe total time T is the sum of these two.\n\nTo minimize T, perhaps the ratio of the velocities should be equal to the ratio of the distances in some way.\n\nWait, in optimal control problems, sometimes the derivative of time with respect to the control variable is set to zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers or considering the path that makes the derivative zero.\n\nBut this seems complicated for this problem.\n\nLet me try to compute T for \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 and see if it's less than for other angles.\n\nFor \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, \u03b8/2 = \u03c0/6, so cos(\u03c0/6) = \u221a3/2, sin(\u03c0/6) = 1/2.\n\nThen, T = (4/3)(\u221a3/2) + (2/3)(1/2) = (4/3)(\u221a3/2) + (2/3)(1/2) = (2\u221a3)/3 + 1/3 = (2\u221a3 + 1)/3.\n\nNow, for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, \u03b8/2 = \u03c0/4, cos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2.\n\nThen, T = (4/3)(\u221a2/2) + (2/3)(\u221a2/2) = (2\u221a2)/3 + (\u221a2)/3 = (3\u221a2)/3 = \u221a2.\n\nComparing (2\u221a3 + 1)/3 and \u221a2:\n\n(2\u221a3 + 1)/3 \u2248 (2*1.732 + 1)/3 = (3.464 + 1)/3 = 4.464/3 \u2248 1.488 hours.\n\n\u221a2 \u2248 1.414 hours.\n\nSo, for \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, T \u2248 1.488 hours, and for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, T \u2248 1.414 hours.\n\nWait, that suggests that \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 gives a smaller time than \u03b8 = \u03c0/3.\n\nBut earlier, when I set the derivative to zero, I got \u03b8 = 2 arctan(1/2), which is approximately 53.13 degrees, and that seems to correspond to a maximum time based on the second derivative test.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I need to plot T as a function of \u03b8 to see its behavior.\n\nLet me compute T for a few values of \u03b8.\n\nLet's take \u03b8 = 0\u00b0: but \u03b8 must be between 0 and \u03c0/2, so \u03b8 > 0.\n\n\u03b8 = 30\u00b0 = \u03c0/6 radians.\n\n\u03b8/2 = 15\u00b0 = \u03c0/12 radians.\n\ncos(\u03c0/12) \u2248 0.9659, sin(\u03c0/12) \u2248 0.2588.\n\nThen, T = (4/3)(0.9659) + (2/3)(0.2588) \u2248 (4/3)*0.9659 + (2/3)*0.2588 \u2248 1.2878 + 0.1725 \u2248 1.4603 hours.\n\n\u03b8 = 45\u00b0 = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\n\u03b8/2 = 22.5\u00b0 \u2248 0.3927 radians.\n\ncos(0.3927) \u2248 0.9239, sin(0.3927) \u2248 0.3827.\n\nT \u2248 (4/3)(0.9239) + (2/3)(0.3827) \u2248 1.2318 + 0.2551 \u2248 1.4869 hours.\n\n\u03b8 = 60\u00b0 = \u03c0/3 radians.\n\n\u03b8/2 = 30\u00b0 = \u03c0/6 radians.\n\ncos(\u03c0/6) = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660, sin(\u03c0/6) = 0.5.\n\nT \u2248 (4/3)(0.8660) + (2/3)(0.5) \u2248 1.1547 + 0.3333 \u2248 1.4880 hours.\n\n\u03b8 = 90\u00b0 = \u03c0/2 radians.\n\n\u03b8/2 = 45\u00b0 = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 \ufffd"
