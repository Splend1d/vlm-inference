                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two different gallery layouts, labeled as Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b). Each layout consists of rooms connected by doorways, and we need to place attendants in these doorways to supervise all the rooms. The goal is to find the smallest number of attendants needed for each layout using integer programming and the simplex method.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. Each doorway can have an attendant, and each attendant can supervise the two rooms connected by that doorway. So, the idea is to cover all the rooms with the minimum number of attendants placed in the doorways.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the set cover problem, where we have a collection of sets and we want to cover all the elements with the smallest possible number of sets. In this case, each doorway defines a set consisting of the two rooms it connects.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nFor Figure 1(a):\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rooms and the doorways that connect them.\n\nLooking at Figure 1(a), there are four rooms arranged in a grid, with doorways connecting them horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's label the rooms for clarity:\n\nLet's say the rooms are labeled as follows:\n\n- Room 1 (top-left)\n\n- Room 2 (top-right)\n\n- Room 3 (bottom-left)\n\n- Room 4 (bottom-right)\n\nNow, the doorways are:\n\n- Doorway A: between Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Doorway B: between Room 1 and Room 3\n\n- Doorway C: between Room 2 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway D: between Room 3 and Room 4\n\nEach doorway covers two rooms:\n\n- Doorway A: Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Doorway B: Room 1 and Room 3\n\n- Doorway C: Room 2 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway D: Room 3 and Room 4\n\nOur goal is to select the minimum number of doorways such that every room is covered by at least one doorway.\n\nThis is indeed a set cover problem.\n\nTo formulate this as an integer program, we can define binary variables for each doorway:\n\nLet \\( x_i \\) be a binary variable where \\( x_i = 1 \\) if doorway \\( i \\) is chosen, and \\( x_i = 0 \\) otherwise.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total number of doorways used:\n\n\\[ \\text{minimize} \\quad z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D \\]\n\nSubject to the constraints that each room is covered by at least one doorway.\n\nFor Room 1, it is covered by doorways A and B.\n\nSo, the constraint for Room 1 is:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for Room 2, it's covered by doorways A and C:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 3, doorways B and D:\n\n\\[ x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 4, doorways C and D:\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\nSo, the integer program for Figure 1(a) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{minimize} \\quad z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D \\]\n\nSubject to:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\nWith:\n\n\\[ x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\]\n\nNow, to solve this integer program using the simplex method, we need to relax the integer constraints and solve it as a linear program, then round the solution appropriately.\n\nLet's solve the relaxed LP first.\n\nThe objective is to minimize \\( z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D \\)\n\nSubject to:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D \\geq 0 \\]\n\nLet's solve this LP.\n\nFirst, assume that \\( x_A = 0.5 \\), \\( x_B = 0.5 \\), \\( x_C = 0.5 \\), \\( x_D = 0.5 \\)\n\nThen, all constraints are satisfied:\n\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\nAnd the objective value is \\( z = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2 \\)\n\nBut perhaps there's a better solution.\n\nLet's try \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 1 \\)\n\nCheck constraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\nObjective value: \\( z = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\nSame as before.\n\nAnother option: \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 1 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 = 0 \\ngeq 1 \\] \u2014 this fails.\n\nSo, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, \\( x_A = 0 \\), \\( x_B = 1 \\), \\( x_C = 1 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 1 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\nObjective: \\( z = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\)\n\nSame as before.\n\nIt seems that the minimal objective value is 2.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if it's possible to have \\( z = 1 \\).\n\nSuppose \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 = 0 \\ngeq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 = 0 \\ngeq 1 \\]\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSimilarly, any single doorway chosen will leave at least one room uncovered.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of attendants needed for Figure 1(a) is 2.\n\nNow, let's look at Figure 1(b).\n\nAgain, I need to identify the rooms and the doorways.\n\nFrom Figure 1(b), there are five rooms arranged in a grid, with doorways connecting them horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's label the rooms:\n\n- Room 1 (top-left)\n\n- Room 2 (top-middle)\n\n- Room 3 (top-right)\n\n- Room 4 (bottom-left)\n\n- Room 5 (bottom-right)\n\nNow, the doorways are:\n\n- Doorway A: between Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Doorway B: between Room 2 and Room 3\n\n- Doorway C: between Room 1 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway D: between Room 2 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway E: between Room 4 and Room 5\n\nEach doorway covers two rooms:\n\n- Doorway A: Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Doorway B: Room 2 and Room 3\n\n- Doorway C: Room 1 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway D: Room 2 and Room 4\n\n- Doorway E: Room 4 and Room 5\n\nOur goal is to select the minimal number of doorways to cover all five rooms.\n\nFormulate this as an integer program.\n\nDefine binary variables:\n\n\\( x_i = 1 \\) if doorway \\( i \\) is chosen, 0 otherwise.\n\nObjective:\n\n\\[ \\text{minimize} \\quad z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D + x_E \\]\n\nConstraints:\n\nFor Room 1: covered by doorways A and C\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 2: doorways A, B, and D\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 3: doorway B\n\n\\[ x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 4: doorways C, D, and E\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D + x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\nFor Room 5: doorway E\n\n\\[ x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\nSo, the integer program is:\n\n\\[ \\text{minimize} \\quad z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D + x_E \\]\n\nSubject to:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D + x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, x_E \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\]\n\nAgain, solve the relaxed LP.\n\nObjective:\n\n\\[ z = x_A + x_B + x_C + x_D + x_E \\]\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ x_A + x_C \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A + x_B + x_D \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_B \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_C + x_D + x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_E \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D, x_E \\geq 0 \\]\n\nLet's find a feasible solution.\n\nSuppose \\( x_A = 0 \\), \\( x_B = 1 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 1 \\), \\( x_E = 1 \\)\n\nCheck constraints:\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 = 0 \\ngeq 1 \\] \u2014 fails\n\nNot feasible.\n\nTry \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 1 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 1 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\nObjective: \\( z = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3 \\)\n\nAnother option: \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 1 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 1 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 \\ngeq 1 \\] \u2014 fails\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternatively, \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 1 \\), \\( x_C = 0

= 1 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 0 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\ngeq 1 \\] \u2014 fails\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternatively, \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 1 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 1 \\)\n\nConstraints:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \\geq 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \\geq 1

= 1 \\), \\( x_C = 0 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 0 \\)\n\nAs seen, this doesn't satisfy the constraint for Room 4.\n\nAlternatively, \\( x_A = 1 \\), \\( x_B = 0 \\), \\( x_C = 1 \\), \\( x_D = 0 \\), \\( x_E = 1 \\)\n\nAgain, doesn't satisfy Room 3's constraint.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of attendants needed for Figure 1(b) is 3.\n\nSo, for Figure 1(a), it's 2, and for Figure 1(b), it's 3.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options:\n\nA.

(a) 2, (b) 3.\n\nBut I need to double-check this.\n\nFor Figure 1(a), with four rooms arranged in a grid, placing attendants in doorways A and D, for example, would cover all rooms:\n\n- Attendant in A covers Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Attendant in D covers Room 3 and Room 4\n\nThat covers all four rooms with two attendants.\n\nIs it possible to cover all rooms with just one attendant?\n\nIf I place an attendant in doorway A, it covers Room 1 and Room 2, but Room 3 and Room 4 are not covered.\n\nSimilarly, placing an attendant in doorway B covers Room 1 and Room 3, but Room 2 and Room 4 are not covered.\n\nSame for doorways C and D.\n\nTherefore, indeed, two attendants are necessary and sufficient for Figure 1(a).\n\nFor Figure 1(b), with five rooms, placing attendants in doorways A, B, and E would cover all rooms:\n\n- Attendant in A covers Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Attendant in B covers Room 2 and Room 3\n\n- Attendant in E covers Room 4 and Room 5\n\nThis way, all five rooms are covered with three attendants.\n\nIs it possible to cover all five rooms with just two attendants?\n\nSuppose I place attendants in doorways A and E:\n\n- Attendant in A covers Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Attendant in E covers Room 4 and Room 5\n\nBut Room 3 is not covered.\n\nAlternatively, placing attendants in doorways B and E:\n\n- Attendant in B covers Room 2 and Room 3\n\n- Attendant in E covers Room 4 and Room 5\n\nBut Room 1 is not covered.\n\nAnother option: doorways A and D:\n\n- Attendant in A covers Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Attendant in D covers Room 2 and Room 4\n\nBut Room 3 and Room 5 are not covered.\n\nIt seems impossible to cover all five rooms with just two attendants.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number is three.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B.
