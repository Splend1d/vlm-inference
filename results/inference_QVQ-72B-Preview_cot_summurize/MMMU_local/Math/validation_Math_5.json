                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem with two functions, f(x) and g(x), and they're graphed with shaded regions labeled R and S. The question is asking for an integral expression to find the area of R. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what region R is and how to calculate its area using integration.\n\nLooking at the graph, f(x) is a cubic function: f(x) = x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 8x. G(x) is a quadratic function: g(x) = -\u00bdx\u00b2 + 2x. There are points labeled (2,0) and (4,0) on the x-axis, which are probably points where one of the functions crosses the x-axis.\n\nRegion R is shaded between the origin and what looks like the point (2,0). It seems to be the area bounded by f(x) and g(x) from x = 0 to x = 2. The other shaded region is S, which is between x = 2 and x = 4, but the question is specifically about R.\n\nSo, to find the area of R, I need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval where R is located. That means I need to find the integral from a to b of [f(x) - g(x)] dx, where a and b are the x-values that bound region R.\n\nFrom the graph, region R starts at the origin (0,0) and extends to (2,0). So, the lower limit of integration should be 0, and the upper limit should be 2.\n\nWait a minute, but looking closely, it seems like f(x) and g(x) intersect somewhere between x = 0 and x = 2. I need to make sure that I'm integrating between the correct bounds and that I'm subtracting the lower function from the upper function in that interval.\n\nLet me check the functions. F(x) is a cubic, and g(x) is a quadratic. At x = 0, f(0) = 0, and g(0) = 0. At x = 2, f(2) = 8 - 24 + 16 = 0, and g(2) = -\u00bd(4) + 4 = -2 + 4 = 2. So, f(2) = 0 and g(2) = 2. At x = 4, g(x) = -\u00bd(16) + 8 = -8 + 8 = 0.\n\nSo, f(x) passes through (0,0) and (2,0), and g(x) passes through (0,0), (2,2), and (4,0).\n\nLooking back at the graph, region R is between f(x) and g(x) from x = 0 to x = 2. But wait, at x = 2, f(x) is zero and g(x) is 2, so f(x) \u2264 g(x) at that point.\n\nBut in the graph, region R seems to be above the x-axis, so maybe f(x) is above g(x) in that region. Wait, but at x = 2, f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 2, so g(x) is above f(x) there.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find the points where f(x) and g(x) intersect to determine the correct interval and the correct order of the functions in the integral.\n\nLet's set f(x) equal to g(x) to find the intersection points:\n\nx\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 8x = -\u00bdx\u00b2 + 2x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 8x - (-\u00bdx\u00b2 + 2x) = 0\n\nx\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 8x + \u00bdx\u00b2 - 2x = 0\n\nx\u00b3 - (6 - \u00bd)x\u00b2 + (8 - 2)x = 0\n\nx\u00b3 - 5.5x\u00b2 + 6x = 0\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(x\u00b2 - 5.5x + 6) = 0\n\nSo, x = 0 or x\u00b2 - 5.5x + 6 = 0\n\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5.5x + 6 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [5.5 \u00b1 \u221a(5.5\u00b2 - 4*1*6)] / (2*1)\n\n= [5.5 \u00b1 \u221a(30.25 - 24)] / 2\n\n= [5.5 \u00b1 \u221a6.25] / 2\n\n= [5.5 \u00b1 2.5] / 2\n\n= 8/2 = 4 or 3/2 = 1.5\n\nSo, the intersection points are at x = 0, x = 1.5, and x = 4.\n\nLooking back at the graph, region R is between x = 0 and x = 2, but actually, from the intersections at x = 0 and x = 1.5.\n\nWait, the problem mentions points (2,0) and (4,0), but from the function definitions, f(x) = x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 8x factors to x(x - 2)(x - 4), so f(x) crosses the x-axis at x = 0, x = 2, and x = 4.\n\nBut from the intersection points of f(x) and g(x), they intersect at x = 0, x = 1.5, and x = 4.\n\nSo, region R seems to be from x = 0 to x = 1.5, and region S from x = 1.5 to x = 4.\n\nTherefore, to find the area of R, I need to integrate from x = 0 to x = 1.5 the difference between the two functions.\n\nBut I need to determine which function is higher in that interval.\n\nLooking at x = 0, f(0) = 0, g(0) = 0. At x = 1.5, f(1.5) = (1.5)^3 - 6*(1.5)^2 + 8*(1.5) = 3.375 - 13.5 + 12 = 1.875, and g(1.5) = -\u00bd*(1.5)^2 + 2*(1.5) = -\u00bd*2.25 + 3 = -1.125 + 3 = 1.875.\n\nSo, at x = 1.5, both functions equal 1.875.\n\nBut looking at the graph, it seems that f(x) is above g(x) in region R.\n\nWait, but at x = 0, both are zero, at x = 1.5, both are equal, and at x = 2, f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 2.\n\nBut the region R is between x = 0 and x = 1.5, where both functions are equal at x = 0 and x = 1.5.\n\nMaybe I need to pick a test point between 0 and 1.5 to see which function is greater.\n\nLet's pick x = 1:\n\nf(1) = 1 - 6 + 8 = 3\n\ng(1) = -\u00bd + 2 = 1.5\n\nSo, f(1) = 3 > g(1) = 1.5, so f(x) > g(x) in that interval.\n\nTherefore, to find the area of R, I should integrate from x = 0 to x = 1.5 the difference [f(x) - g(x)] dx.\n\nSo, the correct expression should be \u222b from 0 to 1.5 of [f(x) - g(x)] dx.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. \u222b from 0 to 1.5 of [f(x) - g(x)] dx\n\nB. \u222b from 0 to 1.5 of [g(x) - f(x)] dx\n\nC. \u222b from 0 to 2 of [f(x) - g(x)] dx\n\nD. \u222b from 0 to 2 of [g(x) - f(x)] dx\n\nSo, option A matches what I just determined.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs the interval correct? Yes, from x = 0 to x = 1.5, as per the intersection points.\n\nAnd the order is correct: f(x) - g(x), since f(x) > g(x) in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions points (2,0) and (4,0), and region S is from x = 2 to x = 4, but the question is about region R, which is from x = 0 to x = 1.5.\n\nSo, even though the graph shows (2,0) and (4,0), the region R is only up to x = 1.5.\n\nHence, option C, which goes from 0 to 2, would include part of region S, which is not what we want.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
