                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem with a graph showing two functions, y = g(x) and y = f(x), and there's a shaded region between them from x = 0 to x = a. There's also a horizontal line at y = b, and the origin is labeled O. The question is asking for the area of the shaded region, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being shaded. It looks like the shaded area is between the two curves, y = g(x) and y = f(x), from x = 0 to x = a. So, generally, the area between two curves is given by the integral of the top function minus the bottom function over the interval of interest.\n\nSo, in this case, from x = 0 to x = a, g(x) seems to be the top function and f(x) is the bottom function. Therefore, the area should be \u222b from 0 to a of [g(x) - f(x)] dx.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is exactly that: \u222b from 0 to a of [g(x) - f(x)] dx.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't something tricky going on here. There's a horizontal line at y = b, but it doesn't seem to be directly involved in the shaded region. Maybe it's just there to help with the bounds or something.\n\nWait, in option B, there's a term added: b. So, it's \u222b from 0 to a of [b + g(x) - f(x)] dx. That seems odd because adding b would mean you're including the area from y = 0 to y = b, which isn't shaded here. Unless there's some other context, I don't think that's correct.\n\nOption C is \u222b from 0 to a of [b - g(x) - f(x)] dx. Again, this seems like it's subtracting g(x) and f(x) from b, which doesn't correspond to the shaded area shown.\n\nOption D is \u222b from 0 to a of [b - g(x) + f(x)] dx. This also doesn't match the area between g(x) and f(x).\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems correct. Let me double-check.\n\nI recall that the general formula for the area between two curves is indeed the integral of the top function minus the bottom function over the interval. In this case, g(x) is on top, and f(x) is at the bottom, so [g(x) - f(x)] dx from 0 to a should give the area.\n\nMaybe I should consider specific values to verify. Suppose g(x) = x, f(x) = x^2, and a = 1. Then the area would be \u222b from 0 to 1 of [x - x^2] dx, which is [1/2 x^2 - 1/3 x^3] from 0 to 1, equal to 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6.\n\nLooking at option A, it's exactly this integral. Option B adds b, which in this case would be some constant, say b = 1, then it would be 1 + \u222b from 0 to 1 of [x - x^2] dx = 1 + 1/6 = 7/6, which doesn't make sense because the shaded area is just 1/6.\n\nUnless there's something else going on, I think option A is the correct choice.\n\nWait, maybe the horizontal line y = b is intended to represent the upper limit of integration in some way. But from the graph, it seems like it's just a horizontal line crossing the shaded area, but not directly defining its bounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shaded area is bounded above by y = b and below by f(x), but that doesn't seem right from the graph. The shaded region appears to be entirely between g(x) and f(x), without considering y = b as a boundary.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one: the area between g(x) and f(x) from x = 0 to x = a is \u222b from 0 to a of [g(x) - f(x)] dx.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
