                    "text": "So I have this problem here about using the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the equation \\( f_1(x) = x e^{-x} = 0 \\). The question is asking for which values of the starting point \\( x_0 \\) the method will converge. Looking at the graph provided, it shows the function \\( f_1(x) = x e^{-x} \\), with a label indicating that at \\( x = 1 \\), there's a maximum point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Newton-Raphson method. It's an iterative method to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The formula for updating the guess is:\n\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n\\]\n\nSo, for my function \\( f_1(x) = x e^{-x} \\), I need to compute both \\( f(x) \\) and its derivative \\( f'(x) \\).\n\nLet me compute the derivative of \\( f_1(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x e^{-x}) = e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x)\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging into the Newton-Raphson formula:\n\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n e^{-x_n}}{e^{-x_n}(1 - x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n} = x_n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 - x_n}\\right) = x_n \\left(\\frac{1 - x_n - 1}{1 - x_n}\\right) = x_n \\left(\\frac{-x_n}{1 - x_n}\\right) = -\\frac{x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the iteration formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = -\\frac{x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to think about the convergence of this iteration. The function \\( f_1(x) = x e^{-x} \\) is equal to zero at \\( x = 0 \\) and as \\( x \\) approaches infinity, but the main root we're interested in is at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nLooking at the graph, it seems that the function starts at \\( (-\\infty, 0) \\), crosses the x-axis at \\( x = 0 \\), has a maximum at \\( x = 1 \\), and then decreases towards zero as \\( x \\) goes to infinity.\n\nNow, let's consider different starting points \\( x_0 \\) and see where the iteration leads.\n\n**Case 1: \\( x_0 = 0 \\)**\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{0^2}{1 - 0} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, it's already at the root. Converges immediately.\n\n**Case 2: \\( x_0 = 1 \\)**\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{1^2}{1 - 1} = -\\frac{1}{0}\n\\]\n\nDivision by zero is undefined. So, the iteration doesn't proceed. Maybe it's a point where the method fails.\n\n**Case 3: \\( x_0 > 1 \\)**\n\nLet's pick \\( x_0 = 2 \\) as an example.\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{2^2}{1 - 2} = -\\frac{4}{-1} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{4^2}{1 - 4} = -\\frac{16}{-3} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.333\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{(\\frac{16}{3})^2}{1 - \\frac{16}{3}} = -\\frac{\\frac{256}{9}}{-\\frac{13}{3}} = \\frac{256}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{13} = \\frac{256 \\times 3}{9 \\times 13} = \\frac{256}{39} \\approx 6.564\n\\]\n\nIt seems to be diverging towards positive infinity.\n\n**Case 4: \\( x_0 < 1 \\), but close to 1**\n\nLet's pick \\( x_0 = 0.5 \\)\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{0.5^2}{1 - 0.5} = -\\frac{0.25}{0.5} = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{(-0.5)^2}{1 - (-0.5)} = -\\frac{0.25}{1.5} = -0.1666...\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{(-0.1666)^2}{1 - (-0.1666)} = -\\frac{0.0277...}{1.1666...} \\approx -0.0238\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_4 = -\\frac{(-0.0238)^2}{1 - (-0.0238)} = -\\frac{0.000566...}{1.0238} \\approx -0.00055\n\\]\n\nIt's converging towards zero.\n\n**Case 5: \\( x_0 < 0 \\)**\n\nLet's pick \\( x_0 = -1 \\)\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{(-1)^2}{1 - (-1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{(-0.5)^2}{1 - (-0.5)} = -\\frac{0.25}{1.5} = -0.1666...\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{(-0.1666)^2}{1 - (-0.1666)} = -\\frac{0.0277...}{1.1666...} \\approx -0.0238\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_4 = -\\frac{(-0.0238)^2}{1 - (-0.0238)} = -\\frac{0.000566...}{1.0238} \\approx -0.00055\n\\]\n\nAgain, converging towards zero.\n\nSo, from these examples, it seems that for \\( x_0 < 1 \\), the method converges to zero, which is the root of the equation. For \\( x_0 > 1 \\), it diverges towards positive infinity. At \\( x_0 = 1 \\), the method fails due to division by zero.\n\nTherefore, the method converges for starting points \\( x_0 \\) that are less than 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. When \\( x_0 \\) is greater than 1\n\nB. When \\( x_0 \\) is equal to 1\n\nC. When \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1\n\nD. When \\( x_0 \\) is equal to 0\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be C. When \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nConsider \\( x_0 = 1 - \\epsilon \\), where \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small positive number.\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{(1 - \\epsilon)^2}{1 - (1 - \\epsilon)} = -\\frac{(1 - 2\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2)}{\\epsilon} = -\\frac{1 - 2\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon} = -\\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 2 + \\epsilon \\right)\n\\]\n\nAs \\( \\epsilon \\) approaches zero, \\( x_1 \\) becomes very negative, but then in the next iteration, it should correct towards zero. So, even if the first step goes far away, subsequent steps may still converge.\n\nWait, in my earlier examples, even though \\( x_1 \\) became negative, the iteration still converged to zero. So, perhaps the convergence is guaranteed for \\( x_0 < 1 \\), as long as it's not too far negative.\n\nLet me check with a more negative \\( x_0 \\). Say \\( x_0 = -10 \\)\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -\\frac{(-10)^2}{1 - (-10)} = -\\frac{100}{11} \\approx -9.0909\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_2 = -\\frac{(-9.0909)^2}{1 - (-9.0909)} = -\\frac{82.62}{10.0909} \\approx -8.181\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_3 = -\\frac{(-8.181)^2}{1 - (-8.181)} = -\\frac{66.93}{9.181} \\approx -7.293\n\\]\n\nIt seems like it's still moving towards zero, but each step is getting closer.\n\nSo, it appears that for any \\( x_0 < 1 \\), the method converges to zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. When \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
