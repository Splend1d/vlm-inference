The options are A. 1, B. 2, or C. Not exist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the greatest integer function does. It returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to a given number. For example, \\(\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor = 2\\), \\(\\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2\\), and \\(\\lfloor 1.9 \\rfloor = 1\\).\n\nLooking at the graph in Figure 6-1, it shows horizontal line segments for different integer values of \\(y\\), each starting from a solid dot on the left and ending at an open circle on the right. This likely represents the greatest integer function, where each segment corresponds to an interval of \\(x\\) values that map to a particular integer.\n\nNow, I need to find the limit of this function as \\(x\\) approaches 2. To find a limit, I need to see what value the function approaches as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to 2, but doesn't necessarily reach it.\n\nLet's consider the left-hand limit first, which means approaching 2 from the left, or from smaller values of \\(x\\). So, for \\(x\\) slightly less than 2, say \\(x = 1.999\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\). Similarly, for any \\(x\\) in the interval \\(1 \\leq x < 2\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\). Therefore, as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left, the function approaches 1.\n\nNow, for the right-hand limit, approaching 2 from the right, or from larger values of \\(x\\). For \\(x\\) slightly greater than 2, say \\(x = 2.001\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\). Similarly, for any \\(x\\) in the interval \\(2 \\leq x < 3\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\). Therefore, as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the right, the function approaches 2.\n\nFor the limit to exist at \\(x = 2\\), the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit must be equal. However, in this case, the left-hand limit is 1 and the right-hand limit is 2, which are not equal. Therefore, the limit does not exist.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is 2, which is the right-hand limit. Maybe I should check the value of the function at \\(x = 2\\). According to the greatest integer function, \\(\\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2\\). But for the limit, it's about approaching the value, not necessarily the value at the point itself.\n\nLooking back at the graph, at \\(x = 2\\), does the function have a jump discontinuity? From the left, it's at \\(y = 1\\), and from the right, it's at \\(y = 2\\). So, again, the left and right limits are different, confirming that the limit does not exist.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of a hole or something else going on at \\(x = 2\\), but in the case of the greatest integer function, it's a step function with jumps at every integer value.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer should be C. Not exist.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to look at it. Maybe considering the definition of the limit more carefully. The limit as \\(x\\) approaches 2 of \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) would require that for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists a \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that for all \\(x\\) satisfying \\(0 < |x - 2| < \\delta\\), we have \\(|\\lfloor x \\rfloor - L| < \\epsilon\\), where \\(L\\) is the limit.\n\nBut in this case, for any \\(\\delta > 0\\), there exist \\(x\\) in \\((2 - \\delta, 2)\\) where \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\) and \\(x\\) in \\((2, 2 + \\delta)\\) where \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\). So, no matter how small \\(\\delta\\) is, the function takes both 1 and 2 in any neighborhood of 2, which means we cannot find a single limit \\(L\\) that satisfies the definition.\n\nTherefore, the limit does not exist.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a different perspective. Maybe considering the limit from both sides separately. As I already did, the left-hand limit is 1 and the right-hand limit is 2. Since they are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the function's behavior in a deleted neighborhood of 2, meaning excluding the point itself. But still, the function approaches different values from the left and right, so the limit doesn't exist.\n\nI think I'm confident with this conclusion. The answer should be C. Not exist.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check a few more points. At \\(x = 1.5\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\); at \\(x = 1.99\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\); at \\(x = 2.01\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\); at \\(x = 2\\), \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\). So, yes, at \\(x = 2\\), the function has a jump from 1 to 2.\n\nTherefore, the limit does not exist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
