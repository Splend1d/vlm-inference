                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph of a trigonometric function, and I need to match it with one of the given equations. The options are:\n\nA. \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\)\n\nB. \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\)\n\nC. \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\)\n\nD. \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\)\n\nFirst, I should look at the general shape of the graph. It looks like a sine or cosine wave, oscillating between -1 and 1 on the y-axis. The x-axis is labeled from -4 to 4, and the y-axis is labeled from -5 to 5, but the scale seems to be in increments of 1 unit.\n\nI need to pay attention to the period and the amplitude of the graph. The amplitude seems to be 1, since the graph goes from y = -1 to y = 1. That matches all of the given options because they all have an amplitude of 1 when considering the standard form of trigonometric functions.\n\nNow, about the period. The period of a sine or cosine function is given by \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{|b|} \\), where the function is of the form \\( y = \\sin(bx) \\) or \\( y = \\cos(bx) \\).\n\nLooking at the graph, I need to determine how many cycles occur within a certain interval on the x-axis. From x = 0 to x = 1, there are two full cycles. Wait, let me check that again. Actually, from x = -1 to x = 1, which is a span of 2 units, there are 4 full cycles. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me count again.\n\nActually, from x = 0 to x = 1, there are 2 full cycles. So, the period seems to be 1 unit on the x-axis for one full cycle. Because from x = 0 to x = 0.5 is half a cycle, and from x = 0 to x = 1 is a full cycle. Wait, no, if from x = 0 to x = 1 there are 2 cycles, then the period should be 1 unit for one cycle.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. If from x = 0 to x = 1, there are 2 cycles, then the period (the length of one cycle) should be half of that, right? Because if 2 cycles are in 1 unit, then one cycle is in 0.5 units.\n\nWait, no. If there are 2 cycles in 1 unit, then the period is indeed 0.5 units. For example, if you have \\( y = \\sin(4\\pi x) \\), its period is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi} = 0.5 \\) units.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them have a period of 0.5. Option A is \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\), which has a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi} = 1 \\) unit.\n\nOption B is \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), same period, 1 unit.\n\nOption C is \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\), period \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2 \\) units\n\nOption D is \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\), same period, 2 units.\n\nBut according to my earlier observation, the graph seems to have a period of 0.5 units, which doesn't match any of these options. Maybe I miscounted the number of cycles.\n\nLet me look again. Perhaps from x = 0 to x = 1, there are 4 cycles? If that's the case, then the period would be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) units, which still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Perhaps the graph is not starting from x = 0. Let's see, the graph crosses the x-axis at x = -3.5, -3, -2.5, -2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc. So, it's crossing every 0.5 units.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the period is 1 unit, because from x = 0 to x = 1, there are 2 full cycles, meaning the period is 1 unit.\n\nWait, no. If from x = 0 to x = 1, there are 2 cycles, then the period is half of that, which is 0.5 units. But looking at the options, none have a period of 0.5 units.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of cycles. Let's count the number of times the graph crosses the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 1. From x = 0 to x = 0.5, it crosses twice, and from x = 0.5 to x = 1, it crosses twice again. So, total of 4 crossings, but that's not directly the number of cycles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function has a frequency of 2 cycles per unit length. If that's the case, then the period would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) units.\n\nBut again, none of the options have that period. Maybe the graph is not scaled correctly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the axes.\n\nLet me consider the general form of the sine and cosine functions. Both sine and cosine have a standard period of \\( 2\\pi \\) radians. If I introduce a coefficient inside the function, like \\( \\sin(bx) \\) or \\( \\cos(bx) \\), then the period becomes \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{|b|} \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\), period \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi} = 1 \\) unit\n\nB. \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), same period, 1 unit\n\nC. \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\), period \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2 \\) units\n\nD. \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\), same period, 2 units\n\nBut earlier, I thought the graph had a period of 0.5 units, which doesn't match any of these. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nPerhaps the graph is showing multiple periods within a certain interval, and I'm miscounting. Let's assume that from x = -4 to x = 4, there are 16 cycles. Then, the period would be \\( \\frac{8}{16} = 0.5 \\) units, which still doesn't match any options.\n\nWait, maybe the graph is not starting at x = 0. If the function is a sine or cosine shifted, it might appear differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a combination of sine and cosine, but no, the options are only sine and cosine without any phase shifts.\n\nLet me consider the phase shift. If there's a horizontal shift, it might change where the graph crosses the axes.\n\nBut assuming it's a standard sine or cosine without shifts, as given in the options, I need to look at the period and the shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the graph is showing \\( y = \\sin(4\\pi x) \\), which has a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi} = 0.5 \\) units, but that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), period 1 unit, which is option B.\n\nBut I need to confirm which one matches the graph.\n\nLet me think about the properties of sine and cosine. Sine starts at y = 0 and goes up, while cosine starts at y = 1 and goes down.\n\nLooking at the graph, it seems to start at y = 0 and go up, which suggests it's a sine function.\n\nAlternatively, if it starts at y = 1, it would be a cosine function.\n\nI need to check the starting point.\n\nLooking closely, the graph crosses the x-axis at x = -3.5, -3, -2.5, etc., and reaches its maximum at x = -3, -2, -1, 0, etc.\n\nSo, it reaches its maximum at integer values of x.\n\nThat suggests it's a cosine function, because \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\) would have a maximum at x = 0, 1, 2, etc., and zeros at x = 0.5, 1.5, etc.\n\nWait, but option A is \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\), which has period 1 unit, and reaches its maximum at x = 0, 1, 2, etc., and zeros at x = 0.5, 1.5, etc.\n\nLooking back at the graph, it seems to have peaks at x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., which aligns with \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\).\n\nOption B, \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), would have zeros at x = 0, 1, 2, etc., and peaks at x = 0.5, 1.5, etc.\n\nComparing that with the graph, which seems to have peaks at integers, suggests that option A is more fitting.\n\nOption C, \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\), has a period of 2 units, with peaks at x = 0, 2, 4, etc.\n\nOption D, \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\), also has period 2 units, with zeros at integers.\n\nNeither of these matches the graph shown, which has peaks every 1 unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be A. \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\).\n\nTo confirm, let's evaluate the function at a few points:\n\n- At x = 0: \\( y = \\cos(0) = 1 \\), which matches the graph's peak at y = 1.\n\n- At x = 0.5: \\( y = \\cos(\\pi) = -1 \\), which matches the trough at y = -1.\n\n- At x = 1: \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi) = 1 \\), another peak.\n\nThis matches the graph's behavior.\n\nOption B, \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), would have:\n\n- At x = 0: \\( y = \\sin(0) = 0 \\), which is a zero crossing, not a peak.\n\n- At x = 0.5: \\( y = \\sin(\\pi) = 0 \\), another zero crossing.\n\n- At x = 1: \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi) = 0 \\), still zero.\n\nThis doesn't match the graph, which shows peaks at integers.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
