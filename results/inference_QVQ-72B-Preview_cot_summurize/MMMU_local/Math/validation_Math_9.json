                    "text": "So I have this graph here, and I need to figure out if it's Hamiltonian. The options are \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Okay, first things first, I should recall what a Hamiltonian graph is. A Hamiltonian graph is one that has a Hamiltonian cycle, which is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nSo, in this graph, if I can find a path that goes through every vertex exactly once and comes back to where it started, then it's Hamiltonian. If not, it's not.\n\nLooking at the graph, there are six vertices, and they're connected in a way that seems like a hexagon with some additional edges. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nI can label the vertices to make it easier. Let's say the vertices are A, B, C, D, E, and F, arranged in a way that A is connected to B and C, B is connected to A and D, C is connected to A and E, D is connected to B and F, E is connected to C and F, and F is connected to D and E. That seems to match the graph in the image.\n\nNow, I need to find a cycle that includes all six vertices without repeating any until the end.\n\nOne way to approach this is to try different starting points and see if I can trace a path that visits each vertex once and returns to the start.\n\nLet's start with vertex A.\n\nFrom A, I can go to B. Then from B, I can go to D (since going back to A is not allowed yet). From D, I can go to F. Then from F, I can go to E. From E, I can go to C. And finally from C, back to A.\n\nSo, the path is A \u2192 B \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 E \u2192 C \u2192 A.\n\nWait a minute, does this visit each vertex exactly once? Yes, and it comes back to A. So, this seems like a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to arrange this.\n\nStarting again from A, going to C first. From C, go to E. From E, go to F. From F, go to D. From D, go to B. And from B, back to A.\n\nAgain, this is another Hamiltonian cycle: A \u2192 C \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 D \u2192 B \u2192 A.\n\nAlternatively, starting from D.\n\nD \u2192 F \u2192 E \u2192 C \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 D.\n\nAnother Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nIt seems like there are multiple Hamiltonian cycles in this graph. So, based on this, it looks like the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should check if there's any way to get stuck or if there are any vertices that can't be included in such a cycle.\n\nLooking back at the graph, all vertices seem to be connected in a way that allows for a cycle to form without excluding any vertex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem or some property that can help me determine this without explicitly finding the cycle.\n\nOne such property is Dirac's theorem, which states that if a graph with n vertices (n \u2265 3) has the property that every vertex has a degree of at least n/2, then the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nIn this case, n = 6, so n/2 = 3. Let's check the degrees of all vertices.\n\nFrom my earlier labeling:\n\n- A: connected to B and C \u2192 degree 2\n\n- B: connected to A and D \u2192 degree 2\n\n- C: connected to A and E \u2192 degree 2\n\n- D: connected to B and F \u2192 degree 2\n\n- E: connected to C and F \u2192 degree 2\n\n- F: connected to D and E \u2192 degree 2\n\nWait a second, all vertices have degree 2, which is equal to n/2 = 3. According to Dirac's theorem, this should make the graph Hamiltonian.\n\nBut hold on, I think there might be a mistake here. If all vertices have degree exactly 2, then the graph would be a cycle or a disjoint union of cycles. But in this graph, it's clearly connected, so it must be a single cycle. But looking back at the image, it seems more complex than just a single cycle.\n\nMaybe my labeling is incorrect. Let me try to label the vertices differently.\n\nLooking at the graph again, perhaps it's a hexagon with some additional edges.\n\nLet me try labeling the vertices as follows:\n\n- A at the top\n\n- B to the right of A\n\n- C below B\n\n- D below A\n\n- E to the left of D\n\n- F below E\n\nAnd the connections are:\n\n- A connected to B and D\n\n- B connected to A and C\n\n- C connected to B and E\n\n- D connected to A and E\n\n- E connected to D and F\n\n- F connected to E and C\n\nNow, checking degrees:\n\n- A: degree 2 (B and D)\n\n- B: degree 2 (A and C)\n\n- C: degree 2 (B and E)\n\n- D: degree 2 (A and E)\n\n- E: degree 2 (D and F)\n\n- F: degree 2 (E and C)\n\nStill, all vertices have degree 2. But this can't be right because in a graph where all vertices have degree 2, it must be a disjoint union of cycles, which contradicts the fact that the graph is connected.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the edges. Looking back at the image, maybe some vertices have higher degrees.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nIf I look at the graph carefully, it seems like some vertices are connected to more than two others.\n\nFor example, the central vertex might be connected to four others.\n\nLet me try a different labeling.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- A at the top\n\n- B to the right of A\n\n- C below B\n\n- D to the left of C\n\n- E below D\n\n- F below B\n\nAnd connections:\n\n- A connected to B and D\n\n- B connected to A, C, and F\n\n- C connected to B and E\n\n- D connected to A and E\n\n- E connected to D, C, and F\n\n- F connected to B and E\n\nNow, checking degrees:\n\n- A: 2 (B and D)\n\n- B: 3 (A, C, F)\n\n- C: 2 (B and E)\n\n- D: 2 (A and E)\n\n- E: 3 (D, C, F)\n\n- F: 2 (B and E)\n\nSo, vertices B, E have degree 3, while A, C, D, F have degree 2.\n\nAccording to Dirac's theorem, since some vertices have degree less than n/2 (which is 3), we can't directly apply it. So, perhaps Dirac's theorem doesn't apply here, or maybe I need to consider another theorem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for properties that prevent a graph from being Hamiltonian.\n\nOne such property is that if a graph contains a vertex of degree 0 or 1, it cannot be Hamiltonian. But in this graph, all vertices have degree at least 2, so that's not the case.\n\nAnother property is Ore's theorem, which states that if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices, their degrees sum to at least n, then the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nIn this graph, n = 6.\n\nLet's check Ore's condition.\n\nFirst, list all pairs of non-adjacent vertices and sum their degrees.\n\nFrom my labeling:\n\nNon-adjacent pairs:\n\n- A and C: degrees 2 and 2 \u2192 sum = 4 < 6\n\n- A and F: degrees 2 and 2 \u2192 sum = 4 < 6\n\n- B and D: degrees 3 and 2 \u2192 sum = 5 < 6\n\n- B and E: degrees 3 and 3 \u2192 sum = 6 \u2265 6\n\n- C and F: degrees 2 and 2 \u2192 sum = 4 < 6\n\n- D and F: degrees 2 and 2 \u2192 sum = 4 < 6\n\nSo, not all pairs satisfy the condition (sum of degrees \u2265 6). Therefore, Ore's theorem doesn't guarantee that the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nHowever, the absence of the condition in Ore's theorem doesn't necessarily mean the graph isn't Hamiltonian; it just means the theorem doesn't apply here to confirm it.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a Hamiltonian cycle explicitly.\n\nStarting from vertex A:\n\nA \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 D \u2192 A\n\nWait, is C connected to E? According to my labeling, C is connected to B and E, so yes.\n\nSo, A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 D \u2192 A\n\nDoes this visit each vertex exactly once? Let's see:\n\nA \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 D \u2192 A\n\nVertices visited: A, B, C, E, F, D, A\n\nYes, each vertex is visited exactly once, and it forms a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, starting from B:\n\nB \u2192 A \u2192 D \u2192 F \u2192 E \u2192 C \u2192 B\n\nAgain, each vertex is visited exactly once, and it's a cycle.\n\nIt seems like there are multiple Hamiltonian cycles in this graph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to find a different arrangement that doesn't allow for a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nBut from the examples I've tried, it seems possible to have such cycles.\n\nMaybe I should consider the graph's structure more carefully.\n\nLooking at the graph, it resembles a hexagon with some additional edges, possibly making it a more complex structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a triangular arrangement with some additional connections.\n\nBut given that I've already found at least two Hamiltonian cycles, it's likely that the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nTo further confirm, maybe I can look for properties that would prevent a graph from being Hamiltonian, such as having a cut vertex that, when removed, disconnects the graph in such a way that no Hamiltonian cycle can exist.\n\nBut in this graph, since it's fully connected with multiple paths between vertices, it's unlikely to have such a cut vertex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the graph's connectivity.\n\nA graph is Hamiltonian if it is 2-connected, meaning that removing any single vertex does not disconnect the graph.\n\nFrom my earlier observations, the graph seems to be 2-connected, as removing any single vertex still leaves a connected graph.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations and the explicit examples of Hamiltonian cycles I've found, I conclude that the graph is Hamiltonian.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Yes.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Yes}} \\]"
