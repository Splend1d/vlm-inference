There's a 25-foot ladder leaning against a vertical wall, and the top is slipping down at a rate of 1 foot per second. I need to find out how fast the bottom is slipping along the ground when the bottom is 7 feet away from the base of the wall.\n\nOkay, first things first, this sounds like a related rates problem, which means I'll probably need to use differentiation to find the rate of change of one thing in terms of the rate of change of another.\n\nLet me visualize the situation. There's a wall that's vertical, and the ground is horizontal. The ladder is leaning against the wall, forming a right triangle with the wall and the ground. The ladder is the hypotenuse of this triangle, with a length of 25 feet.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\(x\\) as the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the base of the wall (along the ground).\n\n- \\(y\\) as the height of the top of the ladder from the ground (along the wall).\n\nGiven that the ladder is 25 feet long, by the Pythagorean theorem, I have:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 25^2\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 625\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\), the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground, when \\(x = 7\\) feet.\n\nI know that \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s (negative because the height is decreasing).\n\nAlright, let's differentiate the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 625\\) implicitly with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\n\\[2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nWait, why is it equal to zero? Because the ladder's length is constant, so the rate of change of \\(x^2 + y^2\\) with respect to time is zero.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[x \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dt}\\]\n\nI know \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s, and I need to find \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) when \\(x = 7\\) feet.\n\nBut I don't know \\(y\\) yet. I can find \\(y\\) using the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 625\\).\n\nPlugging in \\(x = 7\\):\n\n\\[7^2 + y^2 = 625\\]\\[49 + y^2 = 625\\]\\[y^2 = 625 - 49\\]\\[y^2 = 576\\]\\[y = 24\\] feet (since \\(y\\) is positive, as it's a distance).\n\nNow, plug \\(y = 24\\) and \\(x = 7\\) into the equation for \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{24}{7} \\times (-1) = \\frac{24}{7} \\text{ ft/s}\\]\n\nSo, the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground at a rate of \\(\\frac{24}{7}\\) feet per second when the bottom is 7 feet from the base of the wall.\n\nWait a minute, is there anything else I should consider? Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem gives me the rate of change of \\(y\\) (\\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s), and I need to find \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) when \\(x = 7\\) feet.\n\nI used the Pythagorean theorem correctly, differentiated it with respect to time, and solved for \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\). It seems straightforward.\n\nMaybe I can think about similar triangles or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since I already have the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) through the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nAlternatively, I could parameterize the ladder's position, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there's any friction or other forces at play, but since the problem doesn't mention any, I can assume that the only forces are gravity and the normal forces from the wall and the ground.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider similar triangles, but again, with the Pythagorean theorem already applied, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nLet me see if I can derive the same result using a different method.\n\nSuppose I consider the ladder's position at any time \\(t\\). Let\u2019s denote \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) as the positions of the bottom and top of the ladder, respectively.\n\nGiven that the ladder is always 25 feet long, \\(x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = 625\\).\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[2x(t) x'(t) + 2y(t) y'(t) = 0\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[x x' + y y' = 0\\]\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nPlugging in \\(x = 7\\), \\(y = 24\\), and \\(y' = -1\\):\n\n\\[7 \\cdot x' + 24 \\cdot (-1) = 0\\]\\[7 x' - 24 = 0\\]\\[7 x' = 24\\]\\[x' = \\frac{24}{7} \\text{ ft/s}\\]\n\nSame result as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could use trigonometric relationships.\n\nLet me consider the angle between the ladder and the ground, say \\(\\theta\\).\n\nThen, \\(x = 25 \\cos \\theta\\), and \\(y = 25 \\sin \\theta\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s, I can find \\(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\), and then find \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\).\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nFirst, express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[y = 25 \\sin \\theta\\]\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = 25 \\cos \\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s, and when \\(x = 7\\), \\(y = 24\\), so \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{y}{25} = \\frac{24}{25}\\), and \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{x}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[-1 = 25 \\cdot \\frac{7}{25} \\cdot \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\]\\[-1 = 7 \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\]\\[\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{7} \\text{ radians per second}\\]\n\nNow, express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[x = 25 \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = -25 \\sin \\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{24}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{7}\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = -25 \\cdot \\frac{24}{25} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{7}) = 24 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{24}{7} \\text{ ft/s}\\]\n\nAgain, I get the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nLet me think about the units to make sure. \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) should be in feet per second, which it is, since 24 is feet and 7 is seconds.\n\nIs there any other approach I could take to verify this further?\n\nPerhaps using energy conservation, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the ladder's movement as a combination of horizontal and vertical components, but that might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently through two different methods.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\frac{24}{7}\\) feet per second.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from the base of the wall.\" It doesn't specify whether it's moving towards or away from the wall, but since it's slipping down the wall, the bottom is moving away from the wall, which matches the positive value of \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\).\n\nJust to be thorough, when \\(x = 7\\), \\(y = 24\\), and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -1\\) ft/s, \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{24}{7}\\) ft/s.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{7} \\text{ feet per second}} \\]"
