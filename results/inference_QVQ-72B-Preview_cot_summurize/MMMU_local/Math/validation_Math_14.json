                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about areas and average values of functions. There's a graph of y = f(x) with two shaded regions, A and B, which have areas a and b respectively. Then it introduces g(x) = f(x) + 3 and asks for the average value of g on the interval from x = -2 to x = 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the average value of a function on an interval means. I remember that the average value of a function f on an interval [a, b] is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average value} = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSo, for g(x) = f(x) + 3, the average value would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average value of } g = \\frac{1}{4 - (-2)} \\int_{-2}^{4} g(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{6} \\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nNow, I can integrate f(x) + 3 term by term:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx = \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe second integral is straightforward:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx = 3(x)\\big|_{-2}^{4} = 3(4 - (-2)) = 3(6) = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, the first integral is the area under f(x) from x = -2 to x = 4. Looking at the graph, region A is below the x-axis and region B is above the x-axis. So, the integral \\(\\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx\\) would be the area of B minus the area of A, because areas below the x-axis count as negative.\n\nGiven that the area of A is a and the area of B is b, the integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx = b - a\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{average value of } g = \\frac{1}{6} (b - a + 18) = \\frac{b - a + 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b - a + 18}{6} = \\frac{-a + b + 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. (a+b+3)/6\n\nB. (-a+b+3)/6\n\nC. (-a+b)/6 +3\n\nD. (a+b)/6 +3\n\nHmm, none of these exactly match what I got. I have \\(\\frac{-a + b + 18}{6}\\), which is similar to option B, but with 18 instead of 3. Wait, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. The average value formula seems correct. The integral of g(x) from -2 to 4 is the integral of f(x) from -2 to 4 plus the integral of 3 from -2 to 4. I calculated the integral of 3 correctly as 18. The integral of f(x) should be the area above the x-axis minus the area below the x-axis, which is b - a. So, putting it all together, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} (b - a + 18) = \\frac{-a + b + 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe I need to factor something differently or see if there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the areas are not just b - a. Maybe I need to consider the signs more carefully. Let's think again.\n\nThe function f(x) is such that from x = -2 to x = 0, it's below the x-axis, and from x = 0 to x = 4, it's above the x-axis. So, the integral from -2 to 0 would be negative (area below the x-axis), and from 0 to 4, it would be positive.\n\nSo, the total integral from -2 to 4 is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-2}^{0} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{4} f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area of A is a, which is the area from -2 to 0 below the x-axis, but since it's below the x-axis, the integral from -2 to 0 would be -a.\n\nSimilarly, the area of B is b, which is the area from 0 to 4 above the x-axis, so the integral from 0 to 4 is b.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx = -a + b\n\\]\n\nSo, my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nNow, adding the integral of 3 from -2 to 4, which is 18, so:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx = -a + b + 18\n\\]\n\nThen, the average value is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-a + b + 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nBut this isn't matching any of the options directly. Maybe I need to factor it differently. Let's see:\n\nOption B is (-a + b + 3)/6, which is similar but has 3 instead of 18.\n\nOption A is (a + b + 3)/6, which is different.\n\nOption C is (-a + b)/6 + 3, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-a + b}{6} + 3 = \\frac{-a + b + 18}{6}\n\\]\n\nWait, that's the same as my answer!\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{-a + b + 18}{6} = \\frac{-a + b}{6} + 3\\), which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nI must have overlooked that algebraic manipulation. So, option C is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
