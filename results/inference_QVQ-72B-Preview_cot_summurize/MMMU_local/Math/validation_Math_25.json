                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an object thrown upward from 10 meters above the ground. We're given the horizontal distance as \\( x(t) \\) and the vertical distance as \\( y(t) \\), with their respective derivatives \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4 \\) m/s and \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t \\) m/s for \\( t \\geq 0 \\). We need to find the angle \\( \\theta \\) between the path of the object and the ground at the instant it hits the ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this angle \\( \\theta \\) represents. It's the angle between the velocity vector of the object when it hits the ground and the horizontal ground. So, basically, it's the angle of the velocity vector with respect to the horizontal.\n\nTo find this angle, I think I need to know the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity at the instant the object hits the ground. The tangent of the angle \\( \\theta \\) should be the ratio of the vertical component of the velocity to the horizontal component of the velocity.\n\nSo, \\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{v_y}{v_x} \\), where \\( v_y \\) is the vertical velocity and \\( v_x \\) is the horizontal velocity when the object hits the ground.\n\nGiven that \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4 \\) m/s, which is the horizontal velocity, and it's constant (assuming no air resistance affects the horizontal component). So, \\( v_x = 1.4 \\) m/s.\n\nThe vertical velocity is given by \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t \\) m/s. This is a function of time, so I need to find the value of \\( t \\) when the object hits the ground.\n\nThe ground is at \\( y(t) = 0 \\), and it was thrown from 10 meters above the ground, so the vertical distance from the ground is \\( y(t) \\), and when \\( y(t) = 0 \\), the object hits the ground.\n\nI need to find \\( t \\) such that \\( y(t) = 0 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t \\), I can integrate this to find \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIntegrating \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t \\) with respect to \\( t \\), I get:\n\n\\( y(t) = 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + C \\)\n\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), the object is at 10 meters above the ground, so \\( y(0) = 10 \\) m.\n\nTherefore, \\( 10 = 4.2(0) - 4.9(0)^2 + C \\), which means \\( C = 10 \\) m.\n\nSo, \\( y(t) = 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + 10 \\)\n\nNow, set \\( y(t) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + 10 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\( -4.9t^2 + 4.2t + 10 = 0 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\n\\( 4.9t^2 - 4.2t - 10 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)\n\nHere, \\( a = 4.9 \\), \\( b = -4.2 \\), and \\( c = -10 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\( t = \\frac{-(-4.2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4.2)^2 - 4 \\times 4.9 \\times (-10)}}{2 \\times 4.9} \\)\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{17.64 + 196}}{9.8} \\)\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{213.64}}{9.8} \\)\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm 14.62}{9.8} \\)\n\nFirst, take \\( t = \\frac{4.2 + 14.62}{9.8} = \\frac{18.82}{9.8} \\approx 1.92 \\) s\n\nAnd \\( t = \\frac{4.2 - 14.62}{9.8} = \\frac{-10.42}{9.8} \\approx -1.06 \\) s\n\nWe discard the negative time since time cannot be negative in this context.\n\nSo, the object hits the ground at approximately \\( t = 1.92 \\) seconds.\n\nNow, find the vertical velocity at \\( t = 1.92 \\) s:\n\n\\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t = 4.2 - 9.8 \\times 1.92 \\)\n\nCalculate \\( 9.8 \\times 1.92 \\):\n\n\\( 9.8 \\times 1.92 = 9.8 \\times 2 - 9.8 \\times 0.08 = 19.6 - 0.784 = 18.816 \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 18.816 = -14.616 \\) m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates downward direction.\n\nNow, the horizontal velocity \\( v_x = 1.4 \\) m/s (constant)\n\nThe vertical velocity \\( v_y = -14.616 \\) m/s\n\nTherefore, the tangent of the angle \\( \\theta \\) is:\n\n\\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \\frac{-14.616}{1.4} = -10.44 \\)\n\nSince the angle is between 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), and tangent is negative, but angle should be between 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which is the first quadrant where tangent is positive. Maybe I need to take the absolute value or consider the direction.\n\nWait, the angle is between the path and the ground, and since the object is hitting the ground, the velocity vector is downward and forward. So, the angle should be measured from the horizontal to the velocity vector downward.\n\nSo, \\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\left|\\frac{v_y}{v_x}\\right|\\right) \\)\n\nBut in the options, \\( \\theta \\) is given in radians between 0 and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), so taking the absolute value makes sense.\n\nSo, \\( \\theta = \\arctan(10.44) \\)\n\nNow, calculate \\( \\arctan(10.44) \\).\n\nI know that \\( \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx 0.785 \\) radians\n\n\\( \\arctan(2) \\approx 1.107 \\) radians\n\n\\( \\arctan(10) \\approx 1.471 \\) radians\n\nGiven that, 10.44 is slightly more than 10, so \\( \\theta \\) should be slightly more than 1.471 radians.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \\( \\theta = 0.524 \\)\n\nB. \\( \\theta = 1.047 \\)\n\nC. \\( \\theta = 1.475 \\)\n\nD. \\( \\theta = 1.570 \\)\n\nOption C is 1.475 radians, which is very close to \\( \\arctan(10) \\approx 1.471 \\), and since our calculation gave 10.44, which is slightly more than 10, 1.475 seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if my calculation is accurate.\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, solving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\( 4.9t^2 - 4.2t - 10 = 0 \\)\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{4.2^2 - 4 \\times 4.9 \\times (-10)}}{2 \\times 4.9} \\)\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{17.64 + 196}}{9.8} \\)\n\n\\( t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{213.64}}{9.8} \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{213.64} \\approx 14.62 \\), as earlier.\n\nSo, \\( t = \\frac{4.2 + 14.62}{9.8} = \\frac{18.82}{9.8} \\approx 1.92 \\) s\n\nThen, \\( v_y = 4.2 - 9.8 \\times 1.92 = 4.2 - 18.816 = -14.616 \\) m/s\n\nThen, \\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{14.616}{1.4} = 10.44 \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\theta = \\arctan(10.44) \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\arctan(10.44) \\), I get approximately 1.50 radians.\n\nGiven the options, 1.475 is close to 1.50, so option C seems correct.\n\nHowever, let's confirm if \\( \\arctan(10.44) \\) is indeed approximately 1.5 radians.\n\nI know that \\( \\arctan(10) \\approx 1.471 \\) radians, and \\( \\arctan(11) \\approx 1.486 \\) radians.\n\nSo, since 10.44 is between 10 and 11, \\( \\arctan(10.44) \\) should be around 1.471 to 1.486.\n\nOption C is 1.475, which fits within this range.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \\( \\theta = 1.475 \\) radians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
