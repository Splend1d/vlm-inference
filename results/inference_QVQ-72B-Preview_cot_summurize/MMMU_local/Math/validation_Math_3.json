                    "text": "So I've got this problem here that asks me to determine which of the three graphs provided are not isomorphic. I'm not super familiar with graph theory, but I remember that two graphs are isomorphic if there's a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges that preserves the adjacency relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each graph looks like. Let's look at Graph 1:\n\nIt seems like Graph 1 has eight vertices labeled a through h, arranged in an octagon shape with additional diagonals connecting them. Specifically, there's a central point where some of the diagonals meet. Wait, actually, looking closer, it appears that all the vertices are connected to this central point, making it look like a star-shaped graph.\n\nMoving on to Graph 2: It also has eight vertices labeled a through h, arranged in a similar fashion, but the connections seem different. There are cross connections, but not in the same way as Graph 1. It looks like the edges cross each other more intricately.\n\nGraph 3: Again, eight vertices labeled a through h, but the arrangement is different. It looks more like a square with additional connections inside, forming smaller squares or something similar.\n\nOkay, so all three graphs have the same number of vertices and edges, but their structures differ. To determine if they are isomorphic, I need to check if there's a way to map the vertices of one graph to another while preserving the adjacency relationships.\n\nOne way to approach this is to look at the degree sequence of each graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. If two graphs are isomorphic, their degree sequences must be the same.\n\nLet me try to find the degree of each vertex in Graph 1:\n\n- Vertex a: connected to b, h, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex b: connected to a, c, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex c: connected to b, d, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex d: connected to c, e, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex e: connected to d, f, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex f: connected to e, g, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex g: connected to f, h, and the central point.\n\n- Vertex h: connected to g, a, and the central point.\n\nWait, actually, in Graph 1, it seems like every vertex is connected to the central point and to two neighboring vertices, forming the octagon. So each vertex has degree 3.\n\nIn Graph 2:\n\n- Vertex a: connected to b, h, and d.\n\n- Vertex b: connected to a, c, and h.\n\n- Vertex c: connected to b, d, and e.\n\n- Vertex d: connected to a, c, and e.\n\n- Vertex e: connected to c, d, and f.\n\n- Vertex f: connected to e, g, and h.\n\n- Vertex g: connected to f, h, and a.\n\n- Vertex h: connected to a, b, f, and g.\n\nSo here, vertices a, b, c, d have degree 4, while e, f, g, h have degree 3.\n\nIn Graph 3:\n\n- Vertex a: connected to b, d, and e.\n\n- Vertex b: connected to a, c, and e.\n\n- Vertex c: connected to b, d, and f.\n\n- Vertex d: connected to a, c, and h.\n\n- Vertex e: connected to a, b, f, and g.\n\n- Vertex f: connected to c, e, g, and h.\n\n- Vertex g: connected to e, f, and h.\n\n- Vertex h: connected to d, f, and g.\n\nSo in this graph, vertices a, b, c, d have degree 3, while e, f, g, h have degree 4.\n\nAlright, so Graph 1 has all vertices with degree 3, Graph 2 has alternating degrees of 4 and 3, and Graph 3 has the same pattern as Graph 2.\n\nTherefore, Graph 1 is distinct because all its vertices have the same degree, whereas Graphs 2 and 3 have vertices with different degrees.\n\nSo, Graph 1 is not isomorphic to Graphs 2 and 3, but Graphs 2 and 3 might be isomorphic to each other.\n\nWait, but the problem asks which of the following graphs are not isomorphic. It seems like Graph 1 is not isomorphic to Graphs 2 and 3, but Graphs 2 and 3 might be isomorphic.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if Graph 2 and Graph 3 are isomorphic.\n\nLooking at their degree sequences, both have four vertices of degree 4 and four vertices of degree 3. So their degree sequences match.\n\nBut is there a way to map the vertices of Graph 2 to Graph 3 while preserving adjacency?\n\nLet me try to find a mapping:\n\nIn Graph 2:\n\n- Degree 3: e, f, g, h\n\n- Degree 4: a, b, c, d\n\nIn Graph 3:\n\n- Degree 3: a, b, c, d\n\n- Degree 4: e, f, g, h\n\nSo the degree 3 vertices in Graph 2 correspond to degree 4 vertices in Graph 3, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, their degree sequences are inverses of each other, suggesting that they might not be isomorphic.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a different way to map them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Graph 2 and Graph 3 are mirror images or have some symmetry that makes them isomorphic.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should look at the number of cycles or other properties.\n\nIn Graph 2, there are multiple intersecting cycles, and similarly in Graph 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering planarity: Is one graph planar while the other is not?\n\nPlanarity means whether the graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.\n\nGraph 1 looks planar; even though it has a central point, the edges don't seem to cross.\n\nGraph 2 has crossing edges, so it might not be planar.\n\nGraph 3 also has crossing edges, so probably not planar.\n\nIf neither Graph 2 nor Graph 3 is planar, and they both have similar properties, maybe they are isomorphic.\n\nBut earlier, I thought their degree sequences were inverses of each other, which might indicate they are not isomorphic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if there's a specific mapping that preserves adjacency.\n\nLet me try mapping vertex a in Graph 2 to vertex e in Graph 3, since both have degree 4.\n\nSimilarly, map b in Graph 2 to f in Graph 3, c to g, and d to h.\n\nThen, map e in Graph 2 to a in Graph 3, f to b, g to c, h to d.\n\nLet's see if this mapping preserves adjacency.\n\nFor example, in Graph 2, a is connected to b, h, d.\n\nIn Graph 3, e (which corresponds to a) is connected to a, b, f.\n\nWait, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the mapping.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the adjacency matrices of the graphs.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming without software.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for unique properties in each graph that others don't have.\n\nFor instance, in Graph 1, all vertices have the same degree, which is 3.\n\nIn Graph 2, vertices have degrees 3 and 4, alternating.\n\nIn Graph 3, similarly, vertices have degrees 3 and 4, but the pattern is different.\n\nTherefore, Graph 1 is distinct because all its vertices have the same degree, whereas Graphs 2 and 3 have a mix of degrees 3 and 4.\n\nSo, Graph 1 is not isomorphic to Graphs 2 and 3.\n\nBetween Graph 2 and Graph 3, their degree sequences are similar, with four vertices of degree 3 and four of degree 4.\n\nBut their arrangements are different, as in Graph 2, the degree 3 vertices are connected to degree 4 vertices, and in Graph 3, the degree 3 vertices are connected to degree 4 vertices in a different pattern.\n\nPerhaps Graph 2 and Graph 3 are also not isomorphic due to this difference in connection patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are isomorphic, and I just haven't found the right mapping.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with the initial observation that Graph 1 is distinct because of its uniform degree sequence, while Graphs 2 and 3 share a similar degree pattern but differ in structure.\n\nTherefore, Graph 1 is not isomorphic to Graphs 2 and 3, and Graphs 2 and 3 might or might not be isomorphic, but based on their structures, it's likely that they are not.\n\nSo, the answer should include Graph 1 and possibly Graph 2 or 3, but given that the problem asks for which graphs are not isomorphic, and assuming that Graph 2 and Graph 3 are not isomorphic, then the answer would be Graphs 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll select Graph 1 as definitely not isomorphic to the others, and Graphs 2 and 3 might be non-isomorphic to each other.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for \"which of the following graphs are not isomorphic,\" and considering that Graph 1 is distinct from Graphs 2 and 3, and Graphs 2 and 3 might be non-isomorphic to each other, the correct choice would be to select all three graphs as not necessarily isomorphic to each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. <image 1>, B. <image 2>, C. <image 3>.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ <image 1>}, B. \\text{ <image 2>}, C. \\text{ <image 3>}} \\]"
