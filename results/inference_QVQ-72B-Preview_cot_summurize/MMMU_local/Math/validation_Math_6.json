Let's look at the diagram first, but it says \"not drawn to scale,\" so I can't rely on how it looks.\n\nSo, PS is a tangent to the circle at point S, and PQR is a secant passing through points Q and R. The lengths are given as PS = x, PQ = 3, and PR = x + 18.\n\nI remember there's a theorem about tangents and secants. Oh, right! It's the Power of a Point Theorem. Specifically, the Tangent-Secant Theorem, which states that the square of the length of the tangent from a point to a circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segments from that point.\n\nSo, in mathematical terms, PS^2 = PQ * PR.\n\nGiven that PS = x, PQ = 3, and PR = x + 18, I can plug these into the equation:\n\nx^2 = 3 * (x + 18)\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, expand the right side:\n\nx^2 = 3x + 54\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\nx^2 - 3x - 54 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. I can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.\n\nLet's try factoring:\n\nI need two numbers that multiply to -54 and add up to -3. Let's see, -9 and +6. Because -9 * 6 = -54, and -9 + 6 = -3.\n\nSo, (x - 9)(x + 6) = 0\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\n\nx + 6 = 0 => x = -6\n\nSince length can't be negative, x = 9.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nStarting from x^2 - 3x - 54 = 0\n\nIf I plug x = 9 into the original equation:\n\nPS = 9, PQ = 3, PR = 9 + 18 = 27\n\nThen, PS^2 = 81, and PQ * PR = 3 * 27 = 81\n\nYes, it satisfies the equation.\n\nIf I plug x = -6:\n\nPS = -6, PQ = 3, PR = -6 + 18 = 12\n\nPS^2 = 36, PQ * PR = 3 * 12 = 36\n\nIt also satisfies the equation, but PS can't be negative, so we discard that.\n\nTherefore, the length of PS is 9.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 27\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 9.\n\nI think that's it. I used the Tangent-Secant Theorem correctly, and the math checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
