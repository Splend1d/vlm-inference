                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have to minimize the function \\((x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2\\) subject to three constraints: \\(x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0\\), \\(x_2 - 1 \\leq 0\\), and \\(-x_1 \\leq 0\\). The options are four points: (0,0), (2,2), (3,3), and (2,1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these constraints mean geometrically. The feasible region is where all these inequalities are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nLet's look at each constraint:\n\n1. \\(x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 this is a quadratic inequality involving \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). It represents the region below a parabola.\n\n2. \\(x_2 - 1 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 this is a linear inequality that represents the region below the line \\(x_2 = 1\\).\n\n3. \\(-x_1 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 this is equivalent to \\(x_1 \\geq 0\\), which means the region to the right of the y-axis.\n\nCombining these, the feasible region should be the intersection of these three areas.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, it seems like the feasible region is shaded, with boundaries labeled \\(g_1\\), \\(g_2\\), and \\(g_3\\). Assuming \\(g_1 = x_1^2 - x_2 - 3\\), \\(g_2 = x_2 - 1\\), and \\(g_3 = -x_1\\), which aligns with our constraints.\n\nThe objective function is \\((x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2\\), which is the square of the Euclidean distance from the point \\((3,2)\\). So, minimizing this function means finding the point in the feasible region that is closest to \\((3,2)\\).\n\nIn the diagram, there's a point labeled \"Optimal point\" at (2,1), and contours of the objective function are circles centered at (3,2).\n\nGiven that, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. (0,0)\n\nIs this point in the feasible region? Let's check the constraints:\n\n1. \\(0^2 - 0 - 3 = -3 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\n2. \\(0 - 1 = -1 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\n3. \\(-0 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\nSo, (0,0) is feasible. Now, calculate the objective function:\n\n\\((0 - 3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13\\)\n\nB. (2,2)\n\nCheck constraints:\n\n1. \\(2^2 - 2 - 3 = 4 - 2 - 3 = -1 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\n2. \\(2 - 1 = 1 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 no, 1 is not less than or equal to 0. So, infeasible.\n\nC. (3,3)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. \\(3^2 - 3 - 3 = 9 - 3 - 3 = 3 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 no\n\n2. \\(3 - 1 = 2 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 no\n\n3. \\(-3 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes, but since one constraint is violated, it's infeasible.\n\nD. (2,1)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. \\(2^2 - 1 - 3 = 4 - 1 - 3 = 0 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\n2. \\(1 - 1 = 0 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\n3. \\(-2 \\leq 0\\) \u2013 yes\n\nSo, (2,1) is feasible. Objective function:\n\n\\((2 - 3)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\nComparing to (0,0):\n\n(0,0): 13\n\n(2,1): 2\n\nClearly, (2,1) has a lower objective function value and is feasible.\n\nBut let's make sure there aren't any other points in the feasible region with a lower objective function.\n\nThe feasible region includes points where \\(x_1 \\geq 0\\), \\(x_2 \\leq 1\\), and \\(x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0\\).\n\nGiven that the objective function is the squared distance from (3,2), the minimal distance should be along the line connecting the current point and (3,2).\n\nGiven that, the optimal point should be where the line from (3,2) to the feasible region first touches the boundary.\n\nIn the diagram, that's indicated at (2,1).\n\nAlternatively, considering the constraints, the feasible region is a subset of \\(x_1 \\geq 0\\) and \\(x_2 \\leq 1\\) and \\(x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 \\leq 0\\).\n\nGiven that, the minimal distance should be at (2,1), as any other point in the feasible region would be farther from (3,2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (2,1)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
