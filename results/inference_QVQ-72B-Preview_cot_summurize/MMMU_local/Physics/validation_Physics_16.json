                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle moving in a circular path at a constant speed. It starts at point P and goes to point Q, which is exactly halfway around the circle. The question is asking for the direction of the average velocity during this time interval. The options are rightward, leftward, upward, or that the average velocity is zero.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what average velocity is. Average velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time taken. So, if I can figure out the displacement from point P to point Q, and the direction of that displacement, I should be able to answer the question.\n\nOkay, so the particle starts at point P and moves to point Q, which is exactly halfway around the circle. That means it's moving 180 degrees around the circle. If I imagine the circle with point P at, say, the right side, then point Q would be at the left side. So, the displacement vector would be from P to Q, which is straight across the diameter of the circle.\n\nSince displacement is a vector quantity, it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude would be the straight-line distance from P to Q, which is the diameter of the circle. But what about the direction?\n\nWell, if point P is on the right and point Q is on the left, then the displacement would be towards the left. So, that would make the average velocity directed leftward.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the particle is moving counterclockwise, and it goes from P to Q, which is halfway around, yes, that should be leftward. But is there any chance that the shortest path is the other way around? No, since it's specified that it moves along the circular path from P to Q, and Q is exactly halfway, so the path is clear.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the initial and final positions. The initial position is P, and the final position is Q, which is directly opposite. So, the displacement vector points from P to Q, which is leftward.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor that might affect the average velocity. Since the speed is constant and the motion is along a circular path, there's centripetal acceleration, but that's instantaneous acceleration towards the center. However, for average velocity, it's just the displacement divided by time, and direction is based on the displacement vector.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using vectors or considering the angular displacement. The angular displacement from P to Q is \u03c0 radians or 180 degrees. But again, that seems to confirm the straight-line displacement is the diameter.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of components. If I set up a coordinate system with the circle centered at the origin, point P at (r, 0), and point Q at (-r, 0), then the displacement vector would be from P to Q, which is (-r - r, 0 - 0) = (-2r, 0). So, the displacement is in the negative x-direction, which is leftward.\n\nTherefore, the average velocity, being displacement over time, would also be in the negative x-direction, assuming time is positive. So, that confirms it's leftward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the particle was moving in a different direction or if point Q was in a different position. For example, if Q was 90 degrees from P, the displacement would be along the y-axis, which would make the average velocity upward or downward depending on the direction. But in this specific case, Q is directly opposite from P, so the displacement is along the x-axis towards the left.\n\nI should also consider if the motion is at constant speed, which means the magnitude of velocity is constant, but the direction changes. However, for average velocity over this interval, it's still just the total displacement divided by time, regardless of the path taken, as long as we're considering the actual displacement between starting and ending points.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that average velocity is different from average speed. Average speed would be the total distance traveled divided by time, which in this case would be half the circumference of the circle divided by time. But that's not what's being asked here. The question specifically asks for average velocity, which is a vector quantity, not scalar like speed.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the displacement is from P to Q, which is leftward, and the average velocity is in that direction.\n\nWait, but one of the options is \"upward.\" Is there any scenario where the average velocity would be upward? Well, if point Q were above point P, then yes, but in this case, Q is directly opposite from P, so the displacement is horizontal, not vertical.\n\nAlso, the option includes \"the average velocity is zero.\" That would only be the case if the particle started and ended at the same point, which is not the case here. Since it's moving from P to Q, which are two different points, the displacement isn't zero, so the average velocity can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be leftward.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it one more time. Particle moves counterclockwise from P to Q, which is halfway around the circle. Displacement is from P to Q, which is leftward. Average velocity is displacement over time, so it's leftward.\n\nYes, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. leftward}} \\]"
