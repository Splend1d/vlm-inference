                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a light ray hitting a thin layer of glass normally, and it's reflecting an orange-like color with a wavelength of 600 nm in air. We need to find the minimum thickness of the glass that causes this reflection. The options are 50 nm, 100 nm, 150 nm, and 200 nm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's air with a refractive index of 1.00 above the glass, the glass has a refractive index of 1.50, and below the glass is water with a refractive index of 1.33. The light is coming straight down, perpendicular to the surfaces, since it's incident normal to the glass layer.\n\nWhen light reflects off a thin film, like the glass layer here, interference occurs between the light reflecting off the top surface and the light reflecting off the bottom surface. This interference can result in constructive or destructive interference, depending on the thickness of the film and the wavelengths of the light.\n\nSince the reflected light is orange, with a wavelength of 600 nm in air, I need to find the thickness 't' of the glass layer that leads to constructive interference for this wavelength.\n\nBut wait, the wavelength in air is 600 nm, but when light enters the glass, its wavelength changes because the refractive index changes. So, I need to find the wavelength of the light in the glass.\n\nThe relationship between the wavelength in vacuum and the wavelength in a medium is given by:\n\n\\[\\lambda_{\\text{medium}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{vacuum}}}{n}\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nAssuming that the wavelength in air is approximately the same as in vacuum for visible light, since the refractive index of air is very close to 1.\n\nSo, for the glass:\n\n\\[\\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{600 \\, \\text{nm}}{1.50} = 400 \\, \\text{nm}\\]\n\nNow, for constructive interference in reflection from a thin film, the path difference between the two reflected rays should be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium. So, the condition for constructive interference is:\n\n\\[2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is an integer representing the order of interference, and \\(t\\) is the thickness of the film.\n\nHowever, this is for a film with air on both sides. In our case, the film (glass) has air on top and water below, with different refractive indices.\n\nWhen the film is between two media with different refractive indices, the reflection coefficients at each interface need to be considered. Specifically, the phase changes upon reflection depend on the refractive indices of the adjacent media.\n\nAt the air-glass interface, light goes from a lower refractive index (n=1.00) to a higher refractive index (n=1.50), so there is a phase change of 180 degrees upon reflection. At the glass-water interface, light goes from a higher refractive index (n=1.50) to a lower refractive index (n=1.33), so there is no phase change upon reflection.\n\nIn this scenario, the effective path difference for constructive interference is:\n\n\\[2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nBut considering the phase changes, since there's a phase change at the first interface and none at the second, the total phase difference due to reflections is equivalent to an additional half-wavelength path difference.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recall the conditions for constructive and destructive interference in thin films.\n\nFor a film with different media on either side, the condition for constructive interference in reflection is:\n\n\\[2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nif there is a net phase change of 180 degrees upon reflection.\n\nIn our case, there is a phase change at the first interface (air-glass) but not at the second (glass-water). So, the condition should include an additional half-wavelength for constructive interference.\n\nTherefore, the path difference should be:\n\n\\[2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{2}\\]\n\nfor constructive interference.\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\n\\[2t = \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nFor the minimum thickness, \\(m\\) should be 0, so:\n\n\\[2t = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\n\\[t = \\frac{1}{4} \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = 400 \\, \\text{nm}\\),\n\n\\[t = \\frac{400 \\, \\text{nm}}{4} = 100 \\, \\text{nm}\\]\n\nSo, the minimum thickness should be 100 nm.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen the condition for constructive interference in thin films given as:\n\n\\[2t = \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\\]\n\nwhen there is a phase change at one interface but not at the other.\n\nIn this case, yes, that seems to apply here.\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness for constructive interference is indeed \\(t = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{4} = 100 \\, \\text{nm}\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 100 nm.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nIs the refractive index of water relevant here? The water is below the glass, and the light is incident normally, so I think the main factors are the refractive indices of air and glass, and the thickness of the glass layer.\n\nUnless the water affects the boundary conditions, but in this setup, since the light is reflecting off the top and bottom surfaces of the glass, and the water is below, I think the main consideration is the reflection at the air-glass and glass-water interfaces.\n\nGiven that, and the phase changes at those interfaces, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 100 nm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
