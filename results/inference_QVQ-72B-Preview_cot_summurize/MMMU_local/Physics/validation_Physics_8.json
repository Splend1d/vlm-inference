                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about torque on a rod. So, there's a rod pivoted at one end, free to rotate, and a force F is applied at the other end at an angle \u03b8 to the rod. The question is, if the force were applied perpendicular to the rod, at what distance from the axis should it be applied to produce the same torque?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what torque is. Torque is what causes rotational motion, right? And it's defined as the cross product of the position vector and the force vector. But maybe a simpler way to think about it is torque equals force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force.\n\nIn the first scenario, the force is applied at an angle \u03b8 to the rod, which has a length L. So, the perpendicular distance from the axis to the force is L times the sine of \u03b8, I think. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me visualize this. The rod is horizontal, pivoted at one end, and the force is applied at the other end at an angle \u03b8 to the rod. So, if I look from above, the force is pushing at an angle to the rod. To find the perpendicular distance, I need to find the component of L that is perpendicular to the force.\n\nActually, maybe I should use the formula for torque, which is \u03c4 = r * F * sin\u03b1, where r is the length of the position vector, F is the force, and \u03b1 is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, r is L, and the force is F, but the angle between L and F is \u03b8, I think. Wait, no, the angle between L and F is 90\u00b0 - \u03b8, because F is at angle \u03b8 to the rod, which is along L.\n\nWait, if the rod is horizontal and the force is at angle \u03b8 to the rod, then the angle between L and F is \u03b8, not 90\u00b0 - \u03b8. I might have confused that.\n\nLet me draw a diagram in my mind. The rod is horizontal, pivoted at the left end. The right end has force F applied at an angle \u03b8 above the rod. So, the force is making an angle \u03b8 with the rod, which is along the horizontal.\n\nSo, the angle between L and F is indeed \u03b8. Therefore, the torque is \u03c4 = L * F * sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the second part is, if the force is applied perpendicular to the rod, at what distance from the axis should it be applied to produce the same torque?\n\nIf the force is applied perpendicular to the rod, then the angle between L and F is 90\u00b0, and the torque is \u03c4 = L * F * sin90\u00b0 = L * F * 1 = L * F.\n\nBut we want this torque to be equal to the previous torque, which is L * F * sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, set L * F = L * F * sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because L * F * sin\u03b8 is less than L * F unless \u03b8 is 90\u00b0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWe have \u03c41 = L * F * sin\u03b8, and \u03c42 = d * F, where d is the distance from the axis where the force is applied perpendicular to the rod.\n\nWe want \u03c41 = \u03c42, so L * F * sin\u03b8 = d * F.\n\nWe can cancel F from both sides, assuming F \u2260 0, which gives L * sin\u03b8 = d.\n\nTherefore, d = L * sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the distance should be L sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, but one of the options is L sin\u03b8, which is option A.\n\nBut let's double-check if my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the moment arm, which is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force.\n\nIn the first case, the moment arm is L sin\u03b8, so torque is F times L sin\u03b8.\n\nIn the second case, the force is applied perpendicular to the rod, so the moment arm is the distance where it's applied, say d, and torque is F times d.\n\nSet them equal: F * L sin\u03b8 = F * d, which simplifies to L sin\u03b8 = d.\n\nYes, that confirms d = L sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A: L sin\u03b8.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect the torque?\n\nWell, the problem specifies that the force is applied at the end in the first case and we need to find the distance from the axis in the second case to produce the same torque.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ L \\sin \\theta} \\]"
