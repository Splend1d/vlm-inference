                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about two long parallel wires, both carrying current into the page, and they're separated by a distance d. I need to figure out the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire. The options are to the right, to the left, upward in the plane of the page, or downward in the plane of the page.\n\nOkay, first things first, I remember that currents in wires create magnetic fields around them, and these magnetic fields can exert forces on nearby currents. So, maybe I should start by recalling the formula for the force between two parallel wires.\n\nI think the force per unit length between two parallel wires carrying currents I1 and I2 is given by:\n\nF_per_unit_length = (\u03bc\u2080 / (2\u03c0)) * (I1 * I2) / d\n\nWhere \u03bc\u2080 is the permeability of free space. But in this problem, both wires have the same current i, so F_per_unit_length = (\u03bc\u2080 / (2\u03c0)) * (i * i) / d\n\nBut the problem is asking for the direction of the force, not the magnitude. So maybe I need to recall the direction based on the directions of the currents.\n\nI recall that if two parallel wires carry currents in the same direction, they attract each other, and if they carry currents in opposite directions, they repel each other. In this case, both currents are into the page, so they should attract each other. That means the force on the right-hand wire should be towards the left, towards the left-hand wire.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field created by one wire and then see how that field affects the other wire.\n\nSo, the left-hand wire is carrying current into the page. If I point my right thumb into the page, the fingers curl around in a clockwise direction, meaning the magnetic field lines are clockwise around the left-hand wire.\n\nNow, at the location of the right-hand wire, which is to the right of the left-hand wire, the magnetic field due to the left-hand wire would be directed downward in the plane of the page.\n\nThen, the right-hand wire is carrying current into the page as well. So, the force on the right-hand wire due to the magnetic field of the left-hand wire can be found using the formula F = I * L \u00d7 B, where L is the length vector in the direction of the current, and B is the magnetic field vector.\n\nSince both currents are into the page, and the magnetic field at the right-hand wire is downward, the cross product L \u00d7 B would point to the left.\n\nWait, let me visualize that. If the current is into the page, and the magnetic field is downward, then using the right-hand rule for the force on a current-carrying wire: point my thumb in the direction of the current (into the page), and then curl my fingers in the direction of the magnetic field (downward); the force should be perpendicular to both, which would be to the left.\n\nYes, that matches what I thought earlier about the wires attracting each other. So, the force on the right-hand wire is to the left.\n\nLet me consider another way to think about this. Maybe using Amp\u00e8re's law or something, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the magnetic field created by the right-hand wire and see how it interacts with the left-hand wire, but I think that might confuse me more.\n\nNo, actually, I recall that the force between two parallel wires is mutual; it's the same on both wires but in opposite directions. So, if the left-hand wire is also experiencing a force to the right towards the right-hand wire, that makes sense with the idea that like currents attract.\n\nBut in this problem, they're asking specifically for the force on the right-hand wire due to the left-hand wire's current. So, based on that, it should be to the left.\n\nWait, but let's consider the magnetic field created by the right-hand wire at the location of the left-hand wire. The right-hand wire carries current into the page, so using the right-hand rule, the magnetic field around it would be clockwise. At the location of the left-hand wire, which is to the left of the right-hand wire, the magnetic field would be upward in the plane of the page.\n\nThen, the left-hand wire carries current into the page, so the force on the left-hand wire due to the magnetic field of the right-hand wire would be F = I * L \u00d7 B. With current into the page and magnetic field upward, the force would be to the right.\n\nThis confirms that the left-hand wire is being pulled towards the right-hand wire, and vice versa, the right-hand wire is being pulled towards the left-hand wire, which is to the left.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire is to the left.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. to the right\n\nB. to the left\n\nC. upward in the plane of the page\n\nD. downward in the plane of the page\n\nI think the correct answer is B. to the left.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider the formula for the force between two parallel wires again. The formula is F_per_unit_length = (\u03bc\u2080 / (2\u03c0)) * (I1 * I2) / d, and the direction is such that like currents attract and unlike currents repel.\n\nSo, since both currents are into the page, they attract each other, meaning the force on the right-hand wire is to the left.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't think I've made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the magnetic field created by one wire and integrate the force over the length of the other wire, I should get the same result.\n\nBut I think I've covered enough ground here to be confident in my answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. to the left}} \\]"
