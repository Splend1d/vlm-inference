                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a square loop of wire with a side length of 0.5 meters and a resistance of 10^{-2} ohms. It's placed in a uniform magnetic field that's pointing out of the page, and the magnitude of this field is being decreased from 0.4 tesla to zero in 2 seconds. We need to find the magnitude and direction of the current induced in the loop during this process.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when a magnetic field changes in time, it induces an electromotive force (EMF) in any nearby conductor, which in this case is our square loop. This EMF causes a current to flow in the loop. So, the first thing I need to do is find the induced EMF and then use Ohm's law to find the current.\n\nThe induced EMF can be found using Faraday's law of induction, which states that the EMF induced in a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. Mathematically, that's:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}=-\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the magnetic flux, and \\(t\\) is time.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the change in magnetic flux over time.\n\nThe magnetic flux \\(\\Phi\\) through the loop is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi=B \\cdot A\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength and \\(A\\) is the area of the loop.\n\nGiven that the field is uniform and perpendicular to the plane of the loop (since it's pointing out of the page), the flux is simply \\(B\\) times \\(A\\).\n\nThe area of the square loop is:\n\n\\[\nA=(\\text{side})^{2}=(0.5 \\text{ m})^{2}=0.25 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, the magnetic field is decreased from 0.4 tesla to 0 in 2 seconds. So, the change in magnetic field \\(\\Delta B\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta B=0 \\text{ T } - 0.4 \\text{ T }=-0.4 \\text{ T }\n\\]\n\nThe rate of change of magnetic field is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta B}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{-0.4 \\text{ T }}{2 \\text{ s }}=-0.2 \\text{ T/s }\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the induced EMF is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}=-\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}=-\\frac{A \\cdot \\Delta B}{\\Delta t}=-\\left(0.25 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\\right)\\left(-0.2 \\text{ T/s }\\right)=0.05 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, the negative signs are a bit confusing here. Let's see.\n\nThe magnetic field is decreasing, which means the flux is decreasing. According to Lenz's law, the induced current will flow in a direction that opposes this change. Since the field is decreasing out of the page, the induced current should create a field out of the page to oppose the decrease.\n\nSo, the induced current should be clockwise, because a clockwise current in the loop would produce a magnetic field out of the page (using the right-hand rule), thereby opposing the decrease in the external field.\n\nBut let's confirm that with the minus signs in the equation.\n\nFaraday's law includes a negative sign, which indicates that the induced EMF opposes the change in flux. So, if the flux is decreasing, the EMF and thus the current should be positive, meaning clockwise.\n\nOkay, so the induced EMF is 0.05 volts, and the current is clockwise.\n\nNow, to find the magnitude of the current, we can use Ohm's law, which states that:\n\n\\[\nI=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the resistance of the loop.\n\nGiven that \\(R=10^{-2} \\mathrm{ohms}\\), the current is:\n\n\\[\nI=\\frac{0.05 \\mathrm{~V}}{0.01 \\Omega}=5 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\]\n\nSo, the magnitude of the current is 5 amperes, and the direction is clockwise.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Zero\n\nB. 5 A, counterclockwise\n\nC. 5 A, clockwise\n\nD. 20 A, counterclockwise\n\nThe correct answer should be C. 5 A, clockwise.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the area calculation:\n\n\\[\nA=(0.5 \\mathrm{~m})^{2}=0.25 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}\n\\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nThe change in magnetic field:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta B=0 \\mathrm{~T}-0.4 \\mathrm{~T}=-0.4 \\mathrm{~T}\n\\]\n\nRate of change:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta B}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{-0.4 \\mathrm{~T}}{2 \\mathrm{~s}}=-0.2 \\mathrm{~T} / \\mathrm{s}\n\\]\n\nInduced EMF:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}=-\\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t}=-A \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta B}{\\Delta t}=-(0.25 \\mathrm{~m}^{2})(-0.2 \\mathrm{~T} / \\mathrm{s})=0.05 \\mathrm{~V}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, Ohm's law:\n\n\\[\nI=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}=\\frac{0.05 \\mathrm{~V}}{0.01 \\Omega}=5 \\mathrm{~A}\n\\]\n\nCorrect.\n\nAs for the direction, Lenz's law confirms that the current should be clockwise to produce a field out of the page, opposing the decrease in the external field.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 5 A, clockwise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
