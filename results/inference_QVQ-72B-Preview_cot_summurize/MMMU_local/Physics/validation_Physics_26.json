                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph of velocity versus time for a duck flying due south. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is velocity. There are four points labeled A, B, C, and D on the graph. The question is asking at which point the duck stops its forward motion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the duck to stop its forward motion. Since it's flying due south, its initial velocity is positive (assuming south is the positive direction). If it stops its forward motion, that means its velocity becomes zero at that point.\n\nSo, I should look for the point on the graph where the velocity crosses zero, meaning the duck is not moving anymore in the southward direction.\n\nLet me describe the graph as I see it:\n\n- Starting from time zero, the velocity increases steadily until point A.\n\n- After point A, the velocity continues to increase but with some fluctuations, reaching a peak at point B.\n\n- After point B, the velocity decreases sharply, drops below zero, and then levels off around point C.\n\n- Finally, it decreases again to point D, where the velocity is zero.\n\nFrom this description, point D seems to be where the velocity returns to zero. But I need to make sure.\n\nLet me think about each point:\n\nA. Velocity is positive and increasing.\n\nB. Velocity is at its maximum positive value.\n\nC. Velocity is positive but decreasing.\n\nD. Velocity is zero.\n\nSo, point D is where the velocity is zero, which should be the point where the duck stops its forward motion.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful. Is there any chance that the velocity could be zero before point D?\n\nLooking at the graph, from point B to point C, the velocity decreases sharply and seems to level off, possibly staying positive for a while before dropping to zero at point D.\n\nSo, no, the velocity doesn't cross zero between B and C; it stays positive.\n\nTherefore, point D is indeed the point where the duck stops its forward motion.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of the duck changing direction before point D. For example, if the velocity becomes negative, that would mean it's flying northward. But the problem states it's flying due south for the winter, so I assume it's always trying to fly south, even if its velocity fluctuates.\n\nIn any case, at point D, the velocity is zero, meaning it has stopped moving southward.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"the duck stops its forward motion.\" If forward motion is southward, then stopping forward motion means velocity becomes zero.\n\nYes, that matches point D.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a point where velocity changes direction, that would be another story, but in this graph, velocity goes positive, then zero, then possibly negative, but in this problem, it's only shown going to zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
