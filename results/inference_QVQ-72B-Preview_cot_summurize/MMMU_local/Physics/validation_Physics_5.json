                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a uniformly accelerating ball, and I need to find its average speed between 3 and 4 seconds. The diagram shows the position of the ball each second, with positions at 0 cm at 0 seconds, 1 cm at 1 second, 4 cm at 2 seconds, 9 cm at 3 seconds, 16 cm at 4 seconds, and 25 cm at 5 seconds. The options for the average speed between 3 and 4 seconds are 3.0 cm/s, 7.0 cm/s, 3.5 cm/s, and 12.5 cm/s.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what average speed is. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, between 3 and 4 seconds, the ball moves from 9 cm to 16 cm. The distance traveled in that interval is 16 cm minus 9 cm, which is 7 cm. The time interval is 1 second. So, the average speed should be 7 cm per second. Looking at the options, that would be 7.0 cm/s, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem mentions that the ball is uniformly accelerating, which means its speed is increasing at a constant rate. But since we're asked for the average speed over a specific interval, and we have the starting and ending positions, the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe calculating the instantaneous speeds at 3 and 4 seconds and then finding the average of those. Let's see, if the ball is moving with constant acceleration, the positions follow a quadratic relationship with time. From the data points, it looks like the position versus time graph is a perfect square function, like s = at\u00b2, where s is position and t is time.\n\nLet's see, at t=0s, s=0cm; t=1s, s=1cm; t=2s, s=4cm; t=3s, s=9cm; t=4s, s=16cm; t=5s, s=25cm. Yeah, that fits s = t\u00b2, where t is in seconds and s is in centimeters.\n\nSo, the position equation is s = t\u00b2 cm.\n\nNow, the instantaneous velocity at any time t would be the derivative of position with respect to time, which is v = ds/dt = 2t cm/s.\n\nAt t=3s, v = 6 cm/s\n\nAt t=4s, v = 8 cm/s\n\nThe average speed over the interval from t=3s to t=4s would be the average of these instantaneous velocities, which is (6 cm/s + 8 cm/s)/2 = 7 cm/s.\n\nThis matches the earlier result of calculating the distance traveled divided by time.\n\nAlternatively, since acceleration is constant, we can use the formula for average velocity in uniformly accelerated motion, which is v_avg = (v_initial + v_final)/2. Again, that gives us 7 cm/s.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the average speed between 3 and 4 seconds is 7.0 cm/s.\n\nWait a minute, what about option C, 3.5 cm/s? That seems like it might be the instantaneous speed at some point, but not the average over the interval. Maybe it's the instantaneous speed at t=3.5 seconds, but that's not within the interval from 3 to 4 seconds.\n\nOption A, 3.0 cm/s, seems too low compared to the calculated value.\n\nOption D, 12.5 cm/s, is higher than both instantaneous speeds at t=3s and t=4s, so that doesn't make sense for an average speed in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 7.0 cm/s.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the average speed in this interval. Since the problem states that the ball is uniformly accelerating, and we have positions at integer seconds, there shouldn't be any sudden changes or external factors affecting its motion.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"average speed\" between 3 and 4 seconds, not instantaneous speed at any particular moment. So, calculating the total distance traveled and dividing by the time interval is the right approach.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the answer is B. 7.0 cm/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
