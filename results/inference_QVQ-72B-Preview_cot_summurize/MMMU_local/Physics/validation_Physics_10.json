                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about two spheres undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM). One is attached to a spring and the other is a simple pendulum. Both are released from rest from their respective displaced positions. The question is asking which of the given statements is true for both spheres.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what simple harmonic motion is. SHM is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and is always directed towards that position. Both a mass-spring system and a simple pendulum with small angles approximate this behavior.\n\nLet's consider the mass-spring system first. For a mass \\(m_1\\) attached to a spring, when it's displaced downward from its equilibrium position and released, it will oscillate up and down. The equilibrium position is where the spring force balances the weight of the mass.\n\nNow, for the simple pendulum, a mass \\(m_2\\) is suspended from a string of length \\(L\\). When it's displaced to the right and released, it will swing back and forth with small amplitude, which approximates SHM.\n\nI need to look at the options and see which one applies to both systems.\n\nOption A: The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nIn SHM, the kinetic energy is maximum at the equilibrium position because the velocity is highest there. As the mass or pendulum bob passes through equilibrium, it's moving fastest, so kinetic energy is greatest. For both the mass-spring system and the pendulum, this should be true.\n\nOption B: The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nFor the mass-spring system, the gravitational potential energy is constant because the mass moves vertically, but the spring potential energy changes. Wait, actually, in the mass-spring system, if the spring is vertical, the mass moves up and down, and gravitational potential energy does change because gravity is acting vertically.\n\nWait, in the diagram, the mass-spring system is vertical. So, when the mass is at its lowest point, gravitational potential energy is minimum, and at the highest point, it's maximum.\n\nBut the equilibrium position is where the spring force balances gravity. So, as the mass oscillates above and below equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy changes.\n\nBut does it attain its minimum as the sphere passes through equilibrium? Let's think.\n\nIf the equilibrium position is where the spring force equals the weight, then at that point, the gravitational potential energy is not necessarily at its minimum. Actually, gravitational potential energy is minimum at the lowest point of motion, which may not be the equilibrium position.\n\nWait, in a vertical mass-spring system, the equilibrium position is where \\(k x = m g\\), where \\(x\\) is the equilibrium stretch of the spring due to gravity.\n\nWhen the mass is at its lowest point, which is below the equilibrium position, gravitational potential energy is lower than at equilibrium. So, minimum gravitational potential energy is not at equilibrium; it's at the lowest point of oscillation.\n\nSimilarly, for the pendulum, gravitational potential energy is minimum at the lowest point of its swing, which is the equilibrium position, because that's the lowest height.\n\nWait, but for the pendulum, equilibrium is the lowest height, so gravitational potential energy is minimum there.\n\nBut for the mass-spring system, minimum gravitational potential energy is at the lowest point of oscillation, which may not be the equilibrium position.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFor the pendulum, equilibrium is directly below, at the lowest point, so gravitational potential energy is indeed minimum there.\n\nFor the mass-spring system, if the spring is vertical, the equilibrium position is where the spring force equals the weight. But the mass oscillates above and below this position.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy is minimum when the mass is at its lowest point, which is below the equilibrium position.\n\nSo, for the pendulum, minimum gravitational potential energy is at equilibrium, but for the mass-spring system, it's below equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, option B is not true for both spheres.\n\nOption C: The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.\n\nFor the pendulum, when it's released from rest at some angle, its maximum gravitational potential energy is indeed at the release point, because that's where it's highest.\n\nFor the mass-spring system, which is vertical, the point of release is below the equilibrium position, since it's displaced downward and released.\n\nWait, in the diagram, the mass-spring system is displaced downward from equilibrium and released.\n\nSo, for the mass-spring system, the point of release is below equilibrium, and gravitational potential energy is higher at higher positions.\n\nWait, no. Gravitational potential energy is \\(m g h\\), where \\(h\\) is the height relative to some reference level.\n\nIn the mass-spring system, if it's released from a position below equilibrium, then as it moves up towards equilibrium, gravitational potential energy increases.\n\nWait, no. If it's released below equilibrium, and moves up towards equilibrium, its height is increasing, so gravitational potential energy is increasing.\n\nBut the maximum gravitational potential energy would be at the highest point of its oscillation, which is above equilibrium.\n\nBut the point of release is below equilibrium, where gravitational potential energy is lower.\n\nSo, for the mass-spring system, maximum gravitational potential energy is not at the point of release; it's at the top of its oscillation.\n\nWhereas for the pendulum, maximum gravitational potential energy is at the release point.\n\nTherefore, option C is not true for both spheres.\n\nOption D: The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nIn SHM, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved, assuming no friction or air resistance.\n\nFor both systems, the total energy is constant throughout the motion.\n\nSo, the maximum total energy is not attained only at equilibrium; it's the same at all points in the oscillation, as long as there's no energy loss.\n\nTherefore, option D is not true for both spheres.\n\nSo, going back, option A seems to be the correct answer, as maximum kinetic energy is indeed attained at equilibrium for both systems.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFor the mass-spring system, at equilibrium, the spring force and weight balance, so the net force is zero, and the mass is passing through with maximum velocity, hence maximum kinetic energy.\n\nFor the pendulum, at equilibrium, it's at the lowest point of its swing, moving fastest, so kinetic energy is maximum there as well.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
