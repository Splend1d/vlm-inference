                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a uniform rod being held in place by a rope and a wall. There's a diagram with points labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Point 1 seems to be where the rope is attached to the rod, point 2 is where the rod touches the wall, point 3 is the midpoint of the rod, and point 4 is the end of the rod opposite to point 1. The question is asking about which point I should use to write expressions for torques to solve for the force exerted by the rope.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about torques and equilibrium. For an object to be in equilibrium, the sum of the forces and the sum of the torques must both be zero. That makes sense because if there's a net force or a net torque, the object would start moving or rotating, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, \\(\\sum F = 0\\) and \\(\\sum \\tau = 0\\).\n\nGiven that the rod is uniform, its center of mass is at the midpoint, which is point 3. The weight of the rod acts downward at point 3.\n\nThere are forces acting on the rod:\n\n1. The weight of the rod acting downward at point 3.\n\n2. The normal force from the wall acting at point 2, perpendicular to the wall.\n\n3. The tension in the rope acting at point 1, along the rope.\n\n4. Possibly, a reaction force at point 4 if the rod is resting on something, but from the description, it seems like it's only held by the rope and the wall, so maybe not.\n\nWait, the problem says the rod is held in place by the rope and the wall, so perhaps the only external forces are the tension in the rope, the normal force from the wall, and the weight of the rod. No mention of any other supports, so I'll assume there's no support at point 4, meaning no external force there besides possibly the weight of the rod, but since it's uniform, the weight is concentrated at the center.\n\nSo, forces:\n\n- Tension (T) at point 1, along the rope.\n\n- Normal force (N) at point 2, perpendicular to the wall.\n\n- Weight (W) at point 3, downward.\n\nNow, to find the force exerted by the rope, which is the tension T.\n\nTo find T, I need to set up equations based on equilibrium conditions.\n\nFirst, sum of forces:\n\n\\(\\sum F_y = T \\sin \\theta - N - W = 0\\)\n\n\\(\\sum F_x = T \\cos \\theta = 0\\)\n\nWait, actually, I need to consider the directions.\n\nIf the rope is at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal, then:\n\n- The vertical component of tension is T sin \\(\\theta\\).\n\n- The horizontal component is T cos \\(\\theta\\).\n\nThe normal force N is perpendicular to the wall, which I assume is horizontal, so it's vertical.\n\nThe weight W is downward.\n\nSo, for translational equilibrium:\n\n\\(\\sum F_x = T \\cos \\theta = 0\\)\n\n\\(\\sum F_y = T \\sin \\theta + N - W = 0\\)\n\nFrom \\(\\sum F_x = 0\\), since T cos \\(\\theta\\) = 0, and T is not zero, cos \\(\\theta\\) must be zero. That would mean the rope is vertical, which may or may not be the case. Maybe I need to consider the actual geometry.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the rope has a horizontal component, and I need to consider both components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on torque equilibrium first to find relationships between the forces.\n\nThe problem mentions that all dimensions are known, and the weight of the rod is known. So, I can express the torques in terms of known quantities and solve for T.\n\nTo calculate torque, I need to choose a pivot point. The key here is to choose a pivot point that will eliminate as many unknown forces as possible, making it easier to solve for T.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Point 1 (where the rope is attached)\n\nIf I choose point 1 as the pivot, then the torque due to the tension T is zero because the force is applied at the pivot.\n\nTorques:\n\n- Torque due to N: N times the perpendicular distance from point 1 to point 2.\n\n- Torque due to W: W times the perpendicular distance from point 1 to point 3.\n\nSo, \\(\\sum \\tau_1 = N \\times d_{2-1} + W \\times d_{3-1} = 0\\)\n\nHere, \\(d_{2-1}\\) is the perpendicular distance from point 2 to point 1, and \\(d_{3-1}\\) is the perpendicular distance from point 3 to point 1.\n\nThis equation has two unknowns: N and T (since T appears in the expression for N from the translational equilibrium equation).\n\nSo, choosing point 1 as the pivot doesn't directly give me an equation with only T.\n\nB. Point 2 (where the rod touches the wall)\n\nIf I choose point 2 as the pivot, then the torque due to N is zero because N is applied at the pivot.\n\nTorques:\n\n- Torque due to T: T times the perpendicular distance from point 2 to point 1.\n\n- Torque due to W: W times the perpendicular distance from point 2 to point 3.\n\nSo, \\(\\sum \\tau_2 = T \\times d_{1-2} - W \\times d_{3-2} = 0\\)\n\nHere, \\(d_{1-2}\\) is the perpendicular distance from point 1 to point 2, and \\(d_{3-2}\\) is the perpendicular distance from point 3 to point 2.\n\nThis equation has only T as an unknown, assuming that all distances and W are known.\n\nWait, but T appears in the torque due to T.\n\nHowever, I can solve this equation directly for T.\n\nSo, choosing point 2 as the pivot gives me a single equation with only one unknown, T.\n\nThat seems promising.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nC. Point 3 (midpoint, where the weight acts)\n\nIf I choose point 3 as the pivot, then the torque due to W is zero.\n\nTorques:\n\n- Torque due to T: T times the perpendicular distance from point 3 to point 1.\n\n- Torque due to N: N times the perpendicular distance from point 3 to point 2.\n\nSo, \\(\\sum \\tau_3 = T \\times d_{1-3} - N \\times d_{2-3} = 0\\)\n\nThis equation has two unknowns, T and N.\n\nNot as straightforward as when choosing point 2.\n\nD. Point 4 (the end opposite to point 1)\n\nIf I choose point 4 as the pivot, then:\n\nTorques:\n\n- Torque due to T: T times the perpendicular distance from point 4 to point 1.\n\n- Torque due to N: N times the perpendicular distance from point 4 to point 2.\n\n- Torque due to W: W times the perpendicular distance from point 4 to point 3.\n\nSo, \\(\\sum \\tau_4 = T \\times d_{1-4} + N \\times d_{2-4} - W \\times d_{3-4} = 0\\)\n\nThis has two unknowns, T and N.\n\nAgain, not as straightforward as choosing point 2.\n\nE. Points 1, 2, or 3\n\nBased on the above analysis, choosing point 2 as the pivot gives a single equation with only one unknown, T, which can be directly solved.\n\nChoosing point 1 or point 3 introduces an additional unknown, N, while choosing point 4 also introduces N.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is point 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any possibility that choosing point 3 could also lead to a solvable equation?\n\nIf I choose point 3, I have:\n\n\\(\\sum \\tau_3 = T \\times d_{1-3} - N \\times d_{2-3} = 0\\)\n\nBut I also have from translational equilibrium:\n\n\\(\\sum F_y = T \\sin \\theta + N - W = 0\\)\n\nSo, I can express N from the translational equilibrium equation and substitute into the torque equation.\n\nFrom \\(\\sum F_y = 0\\), \\(N = W - T \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nPlugging into the torque equation:\n\n\\(T \\times d_{1-3} - (W - T \\sin \\theta) \\times d_{2-3} = 0\\)\n\nThis is now an equation with only T as the unknown.\n\nSo, in theory, I could solve for T this way as well.\n\nBut it's a bit more involved than when choosing point 2, where the equation directly gives T in terms of known quantities.\n\nTherefore, choosing point 2 is still the most straightforward option.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose point 1, I have:\n\n\\(\\sum \\tau_1 = N \\times d_{2-1} + W \\times d_{3-1} = 0\\)\n\nAnd from \\(\\sum F_y = 0\\), \\(N = W - T \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nSo, plugging in N:\n\n\\( (W - T \\sin \\theta) \\times d_{2-1} + W \\times d_{3-1} = 0\\)\n\nAgain, this gives an equation with T as the only unknown.\n\nBut compared to choosing point 2, where the equation is simpler, choosing point 1 seems less efficient.\n\nTherefore, the optimal choice is indeed point 2.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
