There are four points labeled A, B, C, and D on the graph. The x-axis is distance, and the y-axis is force. The curve starts high and positive at point A, drops down to zero at point B, then becomes negative until point C, and finally rises back to zero at point D.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what the strong nuclear force is and how it behaves with respect to distance between nucleons.\n\nI remember that the strong nuclear force is the force that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. It's a short-range force, meaning it only affects particles that are very close to each other, like within a few femtometers.\n\nNow, the graph shows that at very small distances, the force is positive and very large, which means it's repulsive. As the distance increases, the force decreases, passes through zero, becomes negative (which would mean attractive), reaches a minimum, and then increases back to zero as distance increases further.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these points\u2014A, B, C, or D\u2014shows the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nAt point A, the force is positive and high, which means it's repulsive. But is this the primary region where the repulsive nature is significant?\n\nAs the distance increases, at point B, the force becomes zero. So, beyond point B, the force starts to become attractive, which is negative, until point C, where it reaches its most negative value, and then starts becoming less negative, approaching zero again at point D.\n\nSo, between points A and B, the force is repulsive, and beyond B, it becomes attractive.\n\nBut the question is asking for a single point that shows the repulsive nature. So, among A, B, C, and D, which one represents the repulsive nature?\n\nWell, point A is definitely in the repulsive region, since the force is positive there. Point B is where the force is zero, so it's neither repulsive nor attractive at that exact point. Point C is in the attractive region, as the force is negative. And point D is where the force is zero again.\n\nSo, based on this, point A is the one where the force is repulsive.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force.\" Is there more to it?\n\nI recall that at very close distances, the strong nuclear force is repulsive, preventing the nucleons from collapsing into each other. This is similar to how springs resist being compressed too much.\n\nSo, in that case, point A, where the force is positive and high, represents this repulsive force.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other point that could also be considered repulsive.\n\nPoint B is where the force is zero, so that's neither repulsive nor attractive. Point C is negative, which is attractive, and point D is also zero.\n\nSo, yes, only point A shows the repulsive nature.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look at the shape of the curve more carefully.\n\nAt point A, the force is positive and quite high, indicating strong repulsion. As the distance increases, the force decreases, meaning it becomes less repulsive and then crosses zero to become attractive.\n\nSo, the repulsive nature is strongest at point A and decreases as distance increases towards point B.\n\nTherefore, point A is the best representation of the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force.\n\nI think the answer is point A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
