                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this velocity versus time graph, and I need to figure out when the object passes through its initial position again after t=0. The options are 1 second, between 1 and 2 seconds, 2 seconds, or between 2 and 3 seconds. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what the graph is telling me.\n\nSo, the graph shows velocity on the y-axis in meters per second (m/s) and time on the x-axis in seconds (s). The initial position is at t=0, and I need to find when it passes through that position again.\n\nI remember that velocity is the rate of change of position, so if I integrate the velocity over time, I should get the displacement of the object. The area under the velocity-time graph gives the displacement. Since displacement is position relative to the origin, the initial position is at displacement zero.\n\nSo, I need to find the time when the cumulative area under the velocity curve is zero again, meaning the object has returned to its initial position.\n\nLooking at the graph:\n\n- From t=0 to t=1 second, the velocity is negative and increasing towards zero. It starts at -2 m/s and increases to 0 m/s.\n\n- From t=1 to t=3 seconds, the velocity is positive and constant at 2 m/s.\n\n- From t=3 to t=4 seconds, the velocity decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nLet me try to calculate the area under the curve for different intervals.\n\nFirst, from t=0 to t=1 second:\n\nThe velocity increases linearly from -2 m/s to 0 m/s. So, the area under the curve is a triangle below the time axis.\n\nArea from t=0 to t=1s: (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1s * 2 m/s = -1 m (negative because it's below the time axis).\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3 seconds:\n\nThe velocity is constant at 2 m/s. So, the area under the curve is a rectangle.\n\nArea from t=1 to t=3s: 2 m/s * 2s = 4 m.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=4 seconds:\n\nThe velocity decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s. So, the area under the curve is a triangle above the time axis.\n\nArea from t=3 to t=4s: (1/2) * 1s * 2 m/s = 1 m.\n\nNow, let's add up these areas to find when the cumulative displacement returns to zero.\n\nAt t=0: displacement = 0.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: displacement = 0 + (-1) m = -1 m.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3s: displacement = -1 m + 4 m = 3 m.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=4s: displacement = 3 m + 1 m = 4 m.\n\nHmm, at t=1s, displacement is -1 m, at t=3s it's 3 m, and at t=4s it's 4 m. None of these are zero. So, maybe it passes through zero somewhere between these times.\n\nLet me think about it more carefully.\n\nSince the displacement is the integral of velocity over time, I can set up an equation for displacement as a function of time and find when it equals zero.\n\nLet's define the initial position as x=0 at t=0.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s:\n\nv(t) = mt + b, where m is the slope.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s, v(t) increases linearly from -2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nSo, m = (0 - (-2)) / (1 - 0) = 2 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThus, v(t) = 2t - 2.\n\nTo find x(t), integrate v(t):\n\nx(t) = \u222b(2t - 2) dt = t\u00b2 - 2t + c.\n\nAt t=0, x=0, so c=0.\n\nThus, x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t.\n\nSet x(t) = 0:\n\nt\u00b2 - 2t = 0 => t(t - 2) = 0 => t=0 or t=2s.\n\nWait, t=0 is the initial time, and t=2s is another time when displacement is zero.\n\nSo, at t=2s, the object is back at its initial position.\n\nBut looking back at the graph:\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3s, v(t) = 2 m/s.\n\nSo, from t=1 to t=2s, the object moves with constant velocity of 2 m/s for 1 second.\n\nDisplacement from t=1 to t=2s: area = 2 m/s * 1s = 2 m.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: displacement = t\u00b2 - 2t = 2\u00b2 - 2*2 = 4 - 4 = 0 m.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Earlier, I calculated area from t=0 to t=1s as -1 m.\n\nThere's a confusion here.\n\nWait, the area under the velocity-time graph from t=0 to t=1s is indeed negative.\n\nIn the equation x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t, at t=1s, x=1 - 2 = -1 m.\n\nSo, at t=1s, displacement is -1 m.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3s, v(t) = 2 m/s.\n\nSo, from t=1 to t=2s: displacement = 2 m/s * 1s = 2 m.\n\nThus, total displacement at t=2s: -1 m + 2 m = 1 m.\n\nWait, that's not zero.\n\nHmm, maybe my earlier assumption about the equation x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t is incorrect.\n\nLet me recast the problem.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s, v(t) = mt + b.\n\nWe have v(0) = -2 m/s and v(1) = 0 m/s.\n\nSo, m = (0 - (-2))/1 = 2 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThus, v(t) = 2t - 2.\n\nIntegrate to find x(t):\n\nx(t) = \u222b(2t - 2) dt = t\u00b2 - 2t + c.\n\nAt t=0, x=0, so c=0.\n\nThus, x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t.\n\nBut this only holds from t=0 to t=1s.\n\nAt t=1s, x=1 - 2 = -1 m.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3s, v(t) = 2 m/s.\n\nSo, from t=1 to t=2s, displacement = 2 m/s * 1s = 2 m.\n\nThus, at t=2s, x = -1 m + 2 m = 1 m.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=3s, displacement = 2 m/s * 1s = 2 m.\n\nAt t=3s, x = 1 m + 2 m = 3 m.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=4s, v(t) decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nThe area from t=3 to t=4s is a triangle: (1/2) * 1s * 2 m/s = 1 m.\n\nAt t=4s, x = 3 m + 1 m = 4 m.\n\nSo, none of these times give zero displacement.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=2s might be a candidate, but it's giving x=1 m.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the exact shape of the graph more carefully.\n\nLooking back at the graph:\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: velocity increases linearly from -2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=3s: velocity is constant at 2 m/s.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=4s: velocity decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nSo, my calculations should be accurate based on this description.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, it's supposed to be between 2 and 3 seconds.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me consider the displacement up to t=2s is 1 m, and from t=2s to t=3s, it's another 2 m, making 3 m.\n\nBut maybe the displacement returns to zero before t=3s.\n\nWait, from t=2s to t=3s, the velocity is constant at 2 m/s.\n\nSo, for every second, it adds 2 m to the displacement.\n\nThus, from t=2s to t=2.5s, displacement added is 2 m/s * 0.5s = 1 m, making total displacement 2 m.\n\nFrom t=2.5s to t=3s, another 1 m, making 3 m.\n\nSo, no, it doesn't cross zero in that interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total area up to a certain time.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up the displacement equation piecewise.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t.\n\nFrom t=1s to t=3s: x(t) = x(1) + v * (t - 1) = -1 + 2*(t - 1) = 2t - 3.\n\nFrom t=3s to t=4s: v(t) decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nWait, the graph shows from t=3s to t=4s, v(t) decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nSo, v(t) = -2(t - 3), assuming it's linear.\n\nThus, from t=3s to t=4s: v(t) = -2(t - 3).\n\nIntegrate to find x(t):\n\nx(t) = \u222b -2(t - 3) dt = -t\u00b2 + 6t + c.\n\nAt t=3s, x=3 m, so:\n\n3 = -9 + 18 + c => c = 3 - 9 + 18 = 12.\n\nThus, x(t) = -t\u00b2 + 6t + 12.\n\nBut this is from t=3s to t=4s.\n\nNow, let's check if x(t) = 0 at any time in this interval.\n\nSet x(t) = 0:\n\n-t\u00b2 + 6t + 12 = 0 => t\u00b2 - 6t - 12 = 0.\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(36 + 48)] / 2 = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(84)] / 2 \u2248 [6 \u00b1 9.165]/2.\n\nSo, t \u2248 (6 + 9.165)/2 \u2248 7.58 s and t \u2248 (6 - 9.165)/2 \u2248 -1.58 s.\n\nSince t=7.58 s is outside the interval from t=3s to t=4s, and t=-1.58 s is invalid, there's no zero crossing in this interval.\n\nHmm, that doesn't help.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the total displacement up to a certain time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the areas more carefully.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: area = -1 m.\n\nFrom t=1s to t=3s: area = 2 m/s * 2s = 4 m.\n\nTotal up to t=3s: -1 + 4 = 3 m.\n\nFrom t=3s to t=4s: area = 1 m.\n\nTotal up to t=4s: 3 + 1 = 4 m.\n\nNo zero crossing here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the object could pass through the initial position before t=3s.\n\nLet me plot the displacement over time.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: x(t) = t\u00b2 - 2t.\n\nAt t=0s: x=0.\n\nAt t=1s: x=-1 m.\n\nFrom t=1s to t=3s: x(t) = -1 + 2*(t - 1) = 2t - 3.\n\nAt t=1s: x=-1 m.\n\nAt t=2s: x=4 - 3=1 m.\n\nAt t=3s: x=6 - 3=3 m.\n\nFrom t=3s to t=4s: x(t) = 3 + (t - 3)*v_avg.\n\nWait, v(t) from t=3s to t=4s decreases linearly from 2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n\nThe average velocity in this interval is (2 + 0)/2 = 1 m/s.\n\nThus, displacement from t=3s to t=4s is 1 m/s * 1s = 1 m.\n\nTotal displacement at t=4s: 3 m + 1 m = 4 m.\n\nStill no zero crossing.\n\nWait, but from t=1s to t=2s, displacement increases from -1 m to 1 m.\n\nSo, somewhere between t=1s and t=2s, the displacement must be zero.\n\nLet me solve for x(t) = 0 in the interval from t=1s to t=2s.\n\nIn this interval, x(t) = 2t - 3.\n\nSet x(t) = 0: 2t - 3 = 0 => t = 1.5 s.\n\nSo, at t=1.5 s, x=0.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought t=2s gives x=1 m, which is correct: x(1.5) = 2*(1.5) - 3 = 0 m.\n\nSo, at t=1.5 s, the object is back at the initial position.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, that would be between 1 and 2 seconds.\n\nWait, but 1.5 s is indeed between 1 and 2 seconds.\n\nBut the answer choices are:\n\nA. 1 s\n\nB. Between 1 and 2 s\n\nC. 2 s\n\nD. Between 2 and 3 s\n\nSo, 1.5 s is between 1 and 2 seconds, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought t=2s gives x=1 m, which is not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating x(t) from t=1s to t=3s.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFrom t=1s to t=3s, v(t) = 2 m/s.\n\nDisplacement from t=1s to t=2s: 2 m/s * 1s = 2 m.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1s: x = t\u00b2 - 2t, so at t=1s, x=-1 m.\n\nThus, at t=2s: x = -1 m + 2 m = 1 m.\n\nBut according to the piecewise function, x(t) = 2t - 3 in the interval t=1s to t=3s.\n\nAt t=1.5s: x=2*(1.5) - 3=0 m.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, at t=1.5s, x=0 m, meaning the object is back at the initial position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is between 1 and 2 seconds, which is option B.\n\nI think I might have misread the graph earlier or miscalculated the areas, but this seems consistent now.\n\nSo, the final answer is B. Between 1 and 2 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
