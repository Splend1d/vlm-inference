                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this circuit with several resistors, and they're all the same resistance. There's a voltmeter with very high resistance connected between two points, and I need to figure out between which two points the voltmeter would read zero. The options are Q and U, P and T, Q and W, or S and U.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit. There are six resistors connected in a specific way, and there's a battery providing the voltage. The points are labeled T, W, U, P, S, Q. Since the resistors are all the same, maybe I can simplify the circuit or find equivalent resistances.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the circuit, it seems like there are two separate branches: one from T to P via W, U, and another from T to P via S and Q. So, it's like two series circuits in parallel.\n\nLet me try to visualize that. Starting from point T, one path goes T - W - U - P, and another path goes T - S - Q - P. And there's a battery connected between P and T, I think, or is it between T and P? Wait, looking back, the battery is connected between T and P, with the positive terminal at T and negative at P.\n\nWait, no, in the diagram, the battery is connected between T and P, with the positive at T and negative at P. So, current flows from T to P through the circuit.\n\nNow, since all resistors are the same, let's call each resistor R.\n\nIn the top branch: R_T_W, R_W_U, R_U_P.\n\nIn the bottom branch: R_T_S, R_S_Q, R_Q_P.\n\nSo, the top branch has three Rs in series, so the equivalent resistance is 3R.\n\nThe bottom branch also has three Rs in series, so equivalent resistance is 3R.\n\nThen, these two branches are in parallel between T and P.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance between T and P would be 1.5R, since two 3R resistors in parallel give (3R * 3R)/(3R + 3R) = 9R\u00b2/6R = 1.5R.\n\nBut I don't think I need the equivalent resistance for this problem. Maybe I need to find the potential difference between different points.\n\nThe question is asking for the points between which the voltmeter reads zero. That means the potential difference between those two points is zero, so they are at the same potential.\n\nSo, I need to find which pair of points is at the same electric potential.\n\nGiven that all resistors are the same (R), and the battery is providing a certain voltage, say V, from T to P (positive to negative), I need to find the potentials at points Q and U, etc.\n\nMaybe I can assign potentials to each point step by step.\n\nLet's assume the battery provides a voltage V from T to P, with T being positive.\n\nSo, potential at T is V, and at P is 0.\n\nNow, in the top branch: T - W - U - P.\n\nSince all resistors are R, and assuming steady state, the voltage drops across each resistor are equal.\n\nWait, but they are in series, so the voltage drops add up.\n\nBut since all resistors are equal, the voltage drops are equal across each.\n\nIn the top branch: from T to P, total voltage drop is V, and there are three resistors, so each resistor has a voltage drop of V/3.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom branch: from T to P, total voltage drop is V, and three resistors, each with V/3 drop.\n\nSo, let's calculate the potentials step by step.\n\nStarting at T: potential = V.\n\nFrom T to W: voltage drop of V/3, so potential at W = V - V/3 = 2V/3.\n\nFrom W to U: another V/3 drop, so potential at U = 2V/3 - V/3 = V/3.\n\nFrom U to P: another V/3 drop, so potential at P = V/3 - V/3 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom branch:\n\nFrom T to S: voltage drop of V/3, so potential at S = V - V/3 = 2V/3.\n\nFrom S to Q: another V/3 drop, so potential at Q = 2V/3 - V/3 = V/3.\n\nFrom Q to P: another V/3 drop, so potential at P = V/3 - V/3 = 0.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n- T: V\n\n- W: 2V/3\n\n- U: V/3\n\n- P: 0\n\n- S: 2V/3\n\n- Q: V/3\n\nNow, I need to find which two points have the same potential.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Q and U: Q is V/3, U is V/3 \u2192 same potential.\n\nB. P and T: P is 0, T is V \u2192 different.\n\nC. Q and W: Q is V/3, W is 2V/3 \u2192 different.\n\nD. S and U: S is 2V/3, U is V/3 \u2192 different.\n\nSo, the only pair with the same potential is Q and U.\n\nTherefore, the voltmeter would read zero if connected between Q and U.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that the current is flowing differently or that there are other factors?\n\nNo, since all resistors are equal and the branches are symmetric, the currents should be equal in both branches.\n\nAlso, since the voltmeter has very high resistance, it shouldn't affect the circuit significantly.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the voltmeter reads zero between Q and U.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
