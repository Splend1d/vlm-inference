                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about mutual inductance in a coupled inductor circuit. There are two inductors, L1 and L2, each with 10 henries, and there's a mutual inductance of 9 henries between them. There are currents i1 and i2, but i2 is zero. I need to find the voltage v2 across L2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations for mutual inductance. I know that in a coupled inductor, the voltage across one inductor can be affected by the current through the other inductor due to mutual inductance.\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is given by v = L * di/dt, where L is the inductance and di/dt is the rate of change of current through the inductor.\n\nBut in this case, since there's mutual inductance, there's also a voltage induced in L2 due to the change in current in L1.\n\nThe mutual voltage is given by v_m = M * di/dt, where M is the mutual inductance and di/dt is the rate of change of current in the other inductor.\n\nSince i2 is zero, there's no current through L2, so the voltage due to its own current change should be zero. But wait, even if i2 is zero, there might be a voltage induced in L2 due to the changing current in L1.\n\nLet me write down the equations for both inductors.\n\nFor L1:\n\nv1 = L1 * di1/dt + M * di2/dt\n\nBut since i2 is zero and its derivative is zero, v1 = L1 * di1/dt\n\nGiven that i1 = 10 sin(t), then di1/dt = 10 cos(t)\n\nSo v1 = 10 H * 10 cos(t) = 100 cos(t) V\n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for v1; it asks for v2.\n\nFor L2:\n\nv2 = L2 * di2/dt + M * di1/dt\n\nAgain, i2 is zero, and its derivative is zero, so v2 = M * di1/dt\n\nGiven that di1/dt = 10 cos(t), and M = 9 H, then v2 = 9 * 10 cos(t) = 90 cos(t) V\n\nBut looking at the options, there are both positive and negative signs, and also different arguments for the cosine function.\n\nWait, the options have cos(t) and cos(2t), which makes me think that maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven that i1 = 10 sin(t), then di1/dt = 10 cos(t), which is correct.\n\nMutual inductance M = 9 H.\n\nSo v2 = M * di1/dt = 9 * 10 cos(t) = 90 cos(t) V\n\nBut option A is -90 cos(t) V, and option C is 90 cos(t) V.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nI need to consider the polarity and the direction of the currents and voltages.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, there are dots indicating the polarity of the coupled flux.\n\nThe voltage v2 is defined with a positive sign at the top, and i2 would enter the positive terminal.\n\nBut since i2 is zero, only the mutual induction from L1 affects v2.\n\nI need to determine the sign based on the dot convention.\n\nIn mutual inductance, when current in one coil increases, the induced voltage in the other coil will be such that its polarity is opposite to the voltage causing it, according to Lenz's law.\n\nWait, maybe I need to apply the sign convention more carefully.\n\nThe general equation for mutual inductance is:\n\nv2 = -M * di1/dt\n\nThe negative sign accounts for the opposition due to Lenz's law.\n\nSo, v2 = -9 * 10 cos(t) = -90 cos(t) V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: -90 cos(t) V\n\nBut let me make sure.\n\nIs the negative sign necessary? According to Lenz's law, the induced voltage opposes the change in current that causes it.\n\nSo, if i1 is increasing, di1/dt is positive, then v2 should be negative, meaning it's opposing the increase in i1.\n\nTherefore, the negative sign is appropriate.\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option A is -90 cos(t) V, but there's also option B: -90 cos(2t) V\n\nWhy would someone think it's cos(2t)?\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the frequency.\n\nWait, no. The current i1 = 10 sin(t), so the angular frequency is 1 rad/s.\n\nIts derivative is cos(t), which has the same frequency.\n\nSo, the frequency shouldn't change.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect because it has cos(2t), which would be twice the frequency.\n\nProbably a mistake in the options.\n\nBut based on my calculation, v2 = -90 cos(t) V, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the negative sign is not needed if the reference directions are such that the voltage and current are defined appropriately.\n\nBut in the diagram, the voltage v2 is defined with a positive sign at the top, and i2 would enter the positive terminal.\n\nBut since i2 is zero, only the mutual effect from L1 is present.\n\nGiven the dot convention, when current i1 enters the dotted terminal of L1, it induces a voltage in L2 such that the induced voltage is positive at the dotted terminal of L2.\n\nWait, in the diagram, the dotted terminal of L2 is on the left side, connected to the positive terminal of v2.\n\nSo, if i1 is increasing positively, di1/dt is positive, then the induced voltage in L2 should be positive at the dotted terminal, which is connected to the positive terminal of v2.\n\nTherefore, v2 should be positive, meaning +90 cos(t) V.\n\nSo, perhaps the negative sign is not needed.\n\nThis contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nI need to think again.\n\nLet me recall the sign convention for mutual inductance.\n\nThe voltage induced in L2 due to L1 is given by:\n\nv2 = -M * di1/dt\n\nBut this is based on Lenz's law, where the induced voltage opposes the change in the magnetic flux.\n\nHowever, in circuit analysis, we often use the sign based on the reference directions of the currents and voltages.\n\nIn the diagram, the current i1 is defined entering the dotted terminal of L1, and v2 is defined with positive at the top, which is connected to the dotted terminal of L2.\n\nIf i1 is increasing positively, di1/dt is positive, then the induced voltage in L2 should be positive at the dotted terminal, which is the positive terminal of v2.\n\nTherefore, v2 should be positive, meaning +90 cos(t) V.\n\nSo, option C is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the negative sign was necessary due to Lenz's law.\n\nBut based on the reference directions, it seems that v2 should be positive.\n\nI think I need to consider the sign based on the reference directions.\n\nLet me try writing the equations again.\n\nFor L2:\n\nv2 = L2 * di2/dt + M * di1/dt\n\nGiven that di2/dt = 0, then v2 = M * di1/dt\n\nGiven that di1/dt = 10 cos(t), and M = 9 H, then v2 = 9 * 10 cos(t) = 90 cos(t) V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 90 cos(t) V\n\nI think I was overcomplicating it with the negative sign from Lenz's law.\n\nIn circuit analysis, when using the voltage equations with reference directions, the signs are determined based on the directions assigned to the currents and voltages.\n\nTherefore, in this case, v2 is defined with positive at the top, and the mutual voltage contribution is positive because the current i1 is entering the dotted terminal of L1, inducing a positive voltage at the dotted terminal of L2, which is connected to the positive terminal of v2.\n\nHence, v2 = M * di1/dt\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 90 cos(t) V\n\nI think option A with the negative sign is incorrect in this context.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 cos(t) V, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
