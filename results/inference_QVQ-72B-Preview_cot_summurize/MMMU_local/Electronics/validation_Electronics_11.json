The circuit has several components like voltage and current sources, and resistors. Let me try to understand the circuit first.\n\nFrom the diagram, there are four nodes labeled \\(n_1\\), \\(n_2\\), \\(n_3\\), and the reference node. There are voltage sources, current sources, and resistors connected between these nodes. My goal is to find \\(v_x\\), which seems to be a voltage defined between two points in the circuit.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the elements connected to each node.

Does that mean that the voltage at \\(n1\\) is determined by the voltage source, regardless of the current source?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I need to consider the voltage source as setting the voltage between \\(n1\\) and the reference, and the current source as providing the necessary current to maintain that voltage.\n\nSo, perhaps \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\), and the current through the voltage source is determined by the rest of the circuit.\n\nBut there is also a current source connected directly from \\(n1\\) to the reference, which is 14A. So, the total current from \\(n1\\) to the reference is the current through the voltage source plus the 14A current source.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider super nodes or use mesh analysis instead, but the problem asks for nodal analysis.\n\nLet me try to write the nodal equations step by step.\n\nFirst, note that \\(v_{\\text{ref}} = 0V\\).\n\nNode \\(n1\\):\n\n- There is a 20\u03a9 resistor connected between \\(n1\\) and the reference, so current through it is \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - 0}{20}\\).\n\n- There is a 10\u03a9 resistor connected between \\(n1\\) and \\(n3\\), so current is \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10}\\).\n\n- There is a 4A current source leaving \\(n1\\) towards \\(n2\\).\n\n- There is a 14A current source leaving \\(n1\\) towards the reference.\n\n- There is a 0.5V voltage source connected between \\(n1\\) and the reference, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the voltage source as setting the voltage at \\(n1\\) to be \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\), and then proceed with the other nodes.\n\nSo, \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\).\n\nNow, node \\(n2\\):\n\n- There is a 0.2V voltage source connected between \\(n3\\) and \\(n2\\), so \\(v_{n2} = v_{n3} + 0.2V\\).\n\n- There is a 4A current source entering \\(n2\\) from \\(n1\\).\n\nSo, the current entering node \\(n2\\) is 4A, and the voltage at \\(n2\\) is \\(v_{n3} + 0.2V\\).\n\nBut node \\(n2\\) seems to have no other connections besides the current source and the voltage source.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram, there is a 4A current source connected from \\(n1\\) to \\(n2\\), and a 0.2V voltage source connected from \\(n3\\) to \\(n2\\).\n\nSo, the voltage at \\(n2\\) is \\(v_{n3} + 0.2V\\), and the current entering \\(n2\\) is 4A.\n\nNow, node \\(n3\\):\n\n- There is a 10\u03a9 resistor connected between \\(n1\\) and \\(n3\\), so current is \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10}\\).\n\n- There is a 5\u03a9 resistor connected between \\(n3\\) and the reference, so current is \\(\\frac{v_{n3} - 0}{5}\\).\n\n- There is a voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) connected between \\(n3\\) and the reference, with a value of \\(2v_x\\). Wait, but \\(v_x\\) is defined elsewhere in the circuit. Looking back, there is a voltage labeled \\(v_x\\) between two points, and a VCVS with a gain of 2 connected to \\(n3\\).\n\nWait, actually, in the diagram, there is a VCVS connected between \\(n3\\) and the reference, with a value of \\(2v_x\\). But \\(v_x\\) is defined elsewhere.\n\nLooking back, there is a voltage labeled \\(v_x\\) between two points, and a VCVS dependent on \\(v_x\\).\n\nThis suggests that the VCVS is dependent on \\(v_x\\), which is yet to be determined.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to express all node voltages in terms of \\(v_x\\) and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nGiven that \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\), and \\(v_{n2} = v_{n3} + 0.2V\\), and considering the currents through the resistors and sources.\n\nBut I need to relate these to \\(v_x\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to write the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\), expressing currents in terms of \\(v_x\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\):\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} = \\frac{0.5 - v_{n3}}{10}\\)\n\nCurrent through 5\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n3} - 0}{5}\\)\n\nCurrent through VCVS: Since it's a VCVS with a gain of \\(2v_x\\), and it's connected from \\(n3\\) to the reference, the voltage across it is \\(2v_x\\), so the current through it would depend on the voltage at \\(n3\\).\n\nWait, no. A VCVS sets the voltage between two nodes based on another voltage in the circuit. So, the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference is \\(2v_x\\), meaning \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(v_{n3}\\) is also related to other components.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to consider loop analysis instead, but the problem specifies nodal analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of super nodes where voltage sources are present.\n\nGiven that, let's consider node \\(n1\\) and the reference node connected by a voltage source of 0.5V, which makes them a super node.\n\nSimilarly, node \\(n3\\) and the reference node are connected by a VCVS of \\(2v_x\\), which also forms a super node.\n\nThis might simplify things.\n\nFirst, consider the super node consisting of \\(n1\\) and the reference node.\n\nWithin this super node, the voltage difference is 0.5V, so \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\).\n\nNow, for the super node consisting of \\(n3\\) and the reference node, the voltage difference is \\(2v_x\\), so \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nGiven that, I can express \\(v_{n3}\\) in terms of \\(v_x\\): \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nNow, going back to node \\(n2\\), which is connected to \\(n3\\) via a 0.2V voltage source, so \\(v_{n2} = v_{n3} + 0.2V = 2v_x + 0.2V\\).\n\nNow, there is a 4A current source connected from \\(n1\\) to \\(n2\\). So, the current through this source is 4A.\n\nNow, considering the currents at node \\(n2\\):\n\nThe only current entering node \\(n2\\) is the 4A current source from \\(n1\\). There are no other connections to node \\(n2\\), so the current leaving node \\(n2\\) must be zero, meaning that node \\(n2\\) is essentially at the same potential as whatever it's connected to, but in this case, it's only connected to \\(n1\\) via the 4A source.\n\nWait, but node \\(n2\\) is also connected to \\(n3\\) via the 0.2V source.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to consider the currents through the resistors.\n\nLet me try to write the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\), considering that \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\):\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} = \\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10}\\)\n\nCurrent through 5\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n3} - 0}{5} = \\frac{2v_x}{5}\\)\n\nCurrent through VCVS: Since the VCVS sets the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference to be \\(2v_x\\), and it's a voltage source, the current through it is determined by the rest of the circuit.\n\nBut in nodal analysis, we consider the currents through the passive elements and the current sources, and the VCVS affects the voltage at the node.\n\nSo, the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n3}}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\) and \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{2v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{4v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 + 2v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.5 + 2v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2v_x = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_x = -0.25V\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because voltage can't be negative in this context. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the nodal equation.\n\nLet me double-check the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\) is connected to \\(n1\\) via a 10\u03a9 resistor, to the reference via a 5\u03a9 resistor, and to the reference via a VCVS of \\(2v_x\\).\n\nThe VCVS sets the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference to be \\(2v_x\\), so \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nThe current through the VCVS is determined by the voltage across it, but since it's a voltage source, it imposes its own voltage, and the current is determined by the rest of the circuit.\n\nSo, the nodal equation should only include the currents through the passive elements: the 10\u03a9 and 5\u03a9 resistors.\n\nTherefore, the nodal equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n3}}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\) and \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{2v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\n0.5 - 2v_x + 4v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.5 + 2v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2v_x = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_x = -0.25V\n\\]\n\nHmm, still getting a negative value, which seems odd. Maybe I need to consider the direction of currents more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the 4A current source connected between \\(n1\\) and \\(n2\\). Since it's a current source, it imposes a current of 4A from \\(n1\\) to \\(n2\\), which affects the potentials at both nodes.\n\nLet me try to write the nodal equation for node \\(n1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n1}}{20} + 14 + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0"

Wait, but \\(v_x\\) is defined elsewhere in the circuit. Looking back, there is a voltage labeled \\(v_x\\) between two points, and a VCVS with a gain of 2 connected to \\(n3\\).\n\nWait, actually, in the diagram, there is a VCVS connected between \\(n3\\) and the reference, with a value of \\(2v_x\\). But \\(v_x\\) is defined elsewhere.\n\nLooking back, there is a voltage labeled \\(v_x\\) between two points, and a VCVS dependent on \\(v_x\\).\n\nThis suggests that the VCVS is dependent on \\(v_x\\), which is yet to be determined.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to express all node voltages in terms of \\(v_x\\) and see if I can find a relationship.\n\nGiven that \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\), and \\(v_{n2} = v_{n3} + 0.2V\\), and considering the currents through the resistors and sources.\n\nBut I need to relate these to \\(v_x\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to write the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\), expressing currents in terms of \\(v_x\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\):\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} = \\frac{0.5 - v_{n3}}{10}\\)\n\nCurrent through 5\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n3} - 0}{5}\\)\n\nCurrent through VCVS: Since it's a VCVS with a gain of \\(2v_x\\), and it's connected from \\(n3\\) to the reference, the voltage across it is \\(2v_x\\), so the current through it would depend on the voltage at \\(n3\\).\n\nWait, no. A VCVS sets the voltage between two nodes based on another voltage in the circuit. So, the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference is \\(2v_x\\), meaning \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(v_{n3}\\) is also related to other components.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to consider loop analysis instead, but the problem specifies nodal analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of super nodes where voltage sources are present.\n\nGiven that, let's consider node \\(n1\\) and the reference node connected by a voltage source of 0.5V, which makes them a super node.\n\nSimilarly, node \\(n3\\) and the reference node are connected by a VCVS of \\(2v_x\\), which also forms a super node.\n\nThis might simplify things.\n\nFirst, consider the super node consisting of \\(n1\\) and the reference node.\n\nWithin this super node, the voltage difference is 0.5V, so \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\).\n\nNow, for the super node consisting of \\(n3\\) and the reference node, the voltage difference is \\(2v_x\\), so \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nGiven that, I can express \\(v_{n3}\\) in terms of \\(v_x\\): \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nNow, going back to node \\(n2\\), which is connected to \\(n3\\) via a 0.2V voltage source, so \\(v_{n2} = v_{n3} + 0.2V = 2v_x + 0.2V\\).\n\nNow, there is a 4A current source connected from \\(n1\\) to \\(n2\\). So, the current through this source is 4A.\n\nNow, considering the currents at node \\(n2\\):\n\nThe only current entering node \\(n2\\) is the 4A current source from \\(n1\\). There are no other connections to node \\(n2\\), so the current leaving node \\(n2\\) must be zero, meaning that node \\(n2\\) is essentially at the same potential as whatever it's connected to, but in this case, it's only connected to \\(n1\\) via the 4A source.\n\nWait, but node \\(n2\\) is also connected to \\(n3\\) via the 0.2V source.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to consider the currents through the resistors.\n\nLet me try to write the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\), considering that \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\):\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} = \\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10}\\)\n\nCurrent through 5\u03a9 resistor: \\(\\frac{v_{n3} - 0}{5} = \\frac{2v_x}{5}\\)\n\nCurrent through VCVS: Since the VCVS sets the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference to be \\(2v_x\\), and it's a voltage source, the current through it is determined by the rest of the circuit.\n\nBut in nodal analysis, we consider the currents through the passive elements and the current sources, and the VCVS affects the voltage at the node.\n\nSo, the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n3}}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\) and \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{2v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{4v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 + 2v_x}{10} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.5 + 2v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2v_x = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_x = -0.25V\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because voltage can't be negative in this context. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the nodal equation.\n\nLet me double-check the nodal equation for node \\(n3\\).\n\nNode \\(n3\\) is connected to \\(n1\\) via a 10\u03a9 resistor, to the reference via a 5\u03a9 resistor, and to the reference via a VCVS of \\(2v_x\\).\n\nThe VCVS sets the voltage between \\(n3\\) and the reference to be \\(2v_x\\), so \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\).\n\nThe current through the VCVS is determined by the voltage across it, but since it's a voltage source, it imposes its own voltage, and the current is determined by the rest of the circuit.\n\nSo, the nodal equation should only include the currents through the passive elements: the 10\u03a9 and 5\u03a9 resistors.\n\nTherefore, the nodal equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n3}}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0.5V\\) and \\(v_{n3} = 2v_x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5 - 2v_x}{10} + \\frac{2v_x}{5} = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\n0.5 - 2v_x + 4v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.5 + 2v_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2v_x = -0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_x = -0.25V\n\\]\n\nHmm, still getting a negative value, which seems odd. Maybe I need to consider the direction of currents more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the 4A current source connected between \\(n1\\) and \\(n2\\). Since it's a current source, it imposes a current of 4A from \\(n1\\) to \\(n2\\), which affects the potentials at both nodes.\n\nLet me try to write the nodal equation for node \\(n1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n3}}{10} + \\frac{v_{n1}}{20} + 14 + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_{n1} = 0",
