                    "text": "So I've got this circuit problem here. There's a circuit with a voltage source, a resistor, and an inductor. The voltage source is given by v_s(t) = 3t u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. I need to find the current i(t) through the circuit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit configuration. There's a voltage source in series with a 2-ohm resistor and a 1-henry inductor. The current i(t) is flowing through the inductor and the resistor.\n\nI recall that for a series circuit like this, the voltage across each component adds up to the total voltage. The voltage across the resistor is i(t) multiplied by the resistance, which is 2 ohms, so that's 2i(t). The voltage across the inductor is L di/dt, where L is 1 H, so that's just di/dt.\n\nSo, according to Kirchhoff's voltage law, the sum of the voltages around the loop is equal to the voltage supplied by the source. Therefore, I can write the equation:\n\nv_s(t) = 2i(t) + di(t)/dt\n\nGiven that v_s(t) = 3t u(t), and knowing that u(t) is 1 for t >= 0 and 0 otherwise, I can write the equation as:\n\n3t u(t) = 2i(t) + di(t)/dt\n\nNow, since the step function u(t) is 1 for t >= 0, I can focus on t >= 0, assuming that for t < 0, everything is zero.\n\nSo, for t >= 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n3t = 2i(t) + di(t)/dt\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. I need to solve for i(t).\n\nTo solve this differential equation, I can use an integrating factor. First, I'll rearrange the equation:\n\ndi(t)/dt + 2i(t) = 3t\n\nThe standard form is dy/dt + p(t)y = q(t), where p(t) = 2 and q(t) = 3t.\n\nThe integrating factor is e^(\u222bp(t) dt) = e^(\u222b2 dt) = e^(2t)\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(2t) di(t)/dt + 2e^(2t) i(t) = 3t e^(2t)\n\nThe left side is the derivative of the product i(t) e^(2t):\n\nd/dt [i(t) e^(2t)] = 3t e^(2t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n\u222b d[i(t) e^(2t)] = \u222b 3t e^(2t) dt\n\ni(t) e^(2t) = \u222b 3t e^(2t) dt + C\n\nNow, I need to compute the integral of 3t e^(2t) dt. I'll use integration by parts.\n\nLet u = t, dv = 3 e^(2t) dt\n\nThen du = dt, v = (3/2) e^(2t)\n\nIntegration by parts formula: \u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\nSo, \u222b 3t e^(2t) dt = t * (3/2) e^(2t) - \u222b (3/2) e^(2t) dt\n\n= (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/2) \u222b e^(2t) dt\n\n= (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/2) * (1/2) e^(2t) + C1\n\n= (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1\n\nTherefore, i(t) e^(2t) = (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1\n\nNow, solve for i(t):\n\ni(t) = [(3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1] / e^(2t)\n\n= (3/2) t - (3/4) + C e^(-2t), where C = C1 / e^(2t)\n\nWait, actually, when I divide by e^(2t), it should be:\n\ni(t) = (3/2) t - (3/4) + C e^(-2t)\n\nBut let me check that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\ni(t) e^(2t) = (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1\n\nDividing both sides by e^(2t):\n\ni(t) = (3/2) t - (3/4) + C e^(-2t)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to determine the constant C. To do that, I need an initial condition for i(t).\n\nI assume that at t = 0, the current is zero, which is a common assumption for circuits with energy storage elements like inductors, especially when the switch is open initially.\n\nSo, i(0) = 0\n\nPlugging in t = 0:\n\n0 = (3/2)(0) - (3/4) + C e^(0)\n\n0 = 0 - (3/4) + C\n\nTherefore, C = 3/4\n\nSo, the expression for i(t) is:\n\ni(t) = (3/2) t - (3/4) + (3/4) e^(-2t)\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 2 e^{-2t} u(t)\n\nB. 3 e^{-2t} u(t)\n\nC. 2.2 e^{-2t} u(t)\n\nD. 3 e^{-3t} u(t)\n\nNone of these match my expression for i(t). That suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting from the differential equation:\n\ndi(t)/dt + 2i(t) = 3t\n\nIntegrating factor is e^(2t)\n\nMultiply both sides:\n\ne^(2t) di(t)/dt + 2e^(2t) i(t) = 3t e^(2t)\n\nLeft side is d/dt [i(t) e^(2t)] = 3t e^(2t)\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\ni(t) e^(2t) = \u222b 3t e^(2t) dt + C\n\nNow, \u222b 3t e^(2t) dt = (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1\n\nSo, i(t) e^(2t) = (3/2) t e^(2t) - (3/4) e^(2t) + C1\n\nDivide by e^(2t):\n\ni(t) = (3/2) t - (3/4) + C e^(-2t)\n\nApply i(0) = 0:\n\n0 = 0 - (3/4) + C => C = 3/4\n\nSo, i(t) = (3/2) t - (3/4) + (3/4) e^(-2t)\n\nThis doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the step function u(t) is implicitly assumed in the options, so perhaps my solution needs to be expressed only for t >= 0 and multiplied by u(t).\n\nBut even then, my expression doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe I need to rearrange the terms or check if there's an error in the problem statement or the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the Laplace transform method to solve this problem, which might give a different form of the solution.\n\nLet me try using Laplace transforms.\n\nFirst, take the Laplace transform of the differential equation:\n\nL{di(t)/dt} + 2 L{i(t)} = L{3t u(t)}\n\nAssuming zero initial conditions for simplicity, since no initial conditions are given.\n\nL{di(t)/dt} = s I(s) - i(0) = s I(s)\n\nL{i(t)} = I(s)\n\nL{3t u(t)} = 3 / s^2\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ns I(s) + 2 I(s) = 3 / s^2\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(s + 2) I(s) = 3 / s^2\n\nSolve for I(s):\n\nI(s) = 3 / (s^2 (s + 2))\n\nNow, perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by s^2 (s + 2):\n\n3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nLet s = 0:\n\n3 = A(0) + B(0) + C(0) => 3 = 0? That can't be right.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the partial fractions.\n\nAlternatively, I can write:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by s^2 (s + 2):\n\n3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nLet s = 0:\n\n3 = A(0) + B(0) + C(0) => 3 = 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to expand it differently.\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n3 = A s^3 + 2 A s^2 + B s^2 + 2 B s + C s^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3 = s^3 (A) + s^2 (2A + B + C) + s (2B) + 0\n\nNow, set up the system of equations by equating coefficients:\n\ns^3: A = 0\n\ns^2: 2A + B + C = 0\n\ns^1: 2B = 0\n\ns^0: 0 = 3\n\nWait, that's impossible. There must be an error in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by s^2 (s + 2):\n\n3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nLet s = -2:\n\n3 = A (-2)^2 (-2 + 2) + B (-2) (-2 + 2) + C (-2)^2\n\n3 = A (4)(0) + B (-2)(0) + C (4)(0)\n\n3 = 0, which is still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let s = 0:\n\n3 = A(0) + B(0) + C(0)\n\n3 = 0, again, which is wrong.\n\nThis suggests I might have set up the partial fractions incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nThen, multiply both sides by s^2 (s + 2):\n\n3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nNow, expand:\n\n3 = A s^3 + 2 A s^2 + B s^2 + 2 B s + C s^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3 = s^3 (A) + s^2 (2A + B + C) + s (2B) + 0\n\nNow, set up the system of equations:\n\ns^3: A = 0\n\ns^2: 2A + B + C = 0\n\ns^1: 2B = 0 => B = 0\n\ns^0: 0 = 3, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my partial fraction decomposition is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nThen, 3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nLet s = -2:\n\n3 = A (-2)^2 (-2 + 2) + B (-2) (-2 + 2) + C (-2)^2\n\n3 = A (4)(0) + B (-2)(0) + C (4)(0)\n\n3 = 0, which is impossible.\n\nThis indicates that I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the cover-up method for partial fractions.\n\nFor terms with linear factors, the cover-up method can be used.\n\nFor A / s:\n\nA = [3 / (s^2 (s + 2))] evaluated at s = 0\n\nA = 3 / (0 (0 + 2)) = 3 / 0, which is undefined.\n\nThis suggests that the cover-up method isn't directly applicable here due to the repeated root.\n\nPerhaps I need to use a different method for partial fractions with repeated roots.\n\nAlternatively, I can perform polynomial division or another method to decompose the fraction.\n\nLet me try to decompose 3 / (s^2 (s + 2))\n\nFirst, express it as A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nThen, 3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nExpand:\n\n3 = A s^3 + 2 A s^2 + B s^2 + 2 B s + C s^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3 = s^3 (A) + s^2 (2A + B + C) + s (2B) + 0\n\nNow, set up the system:\n\ns^3: A = 0\n\ns^2: 2A + B + C = 0\n\ns^1: 2B = 0 => B = 0\n\ns^0: 0 = 3, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set A = 3/4, B = -3/4, C = 3/4\n\nLet me check:\n\n3 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0, which doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A = 3/4, B = -3/4, C = 3/4\n\nPlug in:\n\n3 = (3/4) s^3 + (2)(3/4) s^2 + (-3/4) s^2 + 2(-3/4) s + (3/4) s^2\n\nCombine s^2 terms: (6/4 - 3/4 + 3/4) s^2 = (6/4) s^2 = (3/2) s^2\n\nAnd there's no s^3 term, so A = 0.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the Laplace transform of t^n.\n\nI know that L{t} = 1 / s^2\n\nAnd L{t e^(a t)} = 1 / (s - a)^2\n\nBut in this case, I have 3 / s^2 (s + 2)\n\nPerhaps I can perform partial fraction decomposition differently.\n\nLet me try to decompose 3 / (s^2 (s + 2))\n\nLet 3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = A / s + B / s^2 + C / (s + 2)\n\nThen, 3 = A s^2 (s + 2) + B s (s + 2) + C s^2\n\nLet s = -2:\n\n3 = A (-2)^2 (-2 + 2) + B (-2) (-2 + 2) + C (-2)^2\n\n3 = A (4)(0) + B (-2)(0) + C (4)(0)\n\n3 = 0, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write:\n\n3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = (3/4) [ 1 / s^2 - 1 / s^2 + 2 / (s + 2) ]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = (s + 2 - s) / (s^2 (s + 2)) = 1 / (s^2) - 1 / (s (s + 2))\n\nThen, 3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = 3 / s^2 - 3 / (s (s + 2))\n\nNow, decompose 3 / (s (s + 2)) = A / s + B / (s + 2)\n\nThen, 3 = A (s + 2) + B s\n\nLet s = 0: 3 = A(2) + B(0) => A = 3/2\n\nLet s = -2: 3 = A(0) + B(-2) => B = -3/2\n\nSo, 3 / (s (s + 2)) = (3/2) / s - (3/2) / (s + 2)\n\nTherefore, 3 / (s^2 (s + 2)) = 3 / s^2 - (3/2) / s + (3/2) / (s + 2)\n\nNow, take the inverse Laplace transform:\n\ni(t) = 3 t u(t) - (3/2) u(t) + (3/2) e^{-2t} u(t)\n\nSo, i(t) = 3t - (3/2) + (3/2) e^{-2t} for t >= 0\n\nThis matches my earlier result using the integrating factor method.\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the provided options. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to express the solution in a different form.\n\nLet me see:\n\ni(t) = 3t - (3/2) + (3/2) e^{-2t}\n\nI can factor out (3/2):\n\ni(t) = (3/2) ["
