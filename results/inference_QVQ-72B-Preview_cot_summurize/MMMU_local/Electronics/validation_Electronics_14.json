                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this graph of f(t), and I need to express it using step functions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that step functions can help piece together different parts of a function based on time intervals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the graph. There's a curve starting from the origin, reaching up to f(t) = 20 at t = 2, and then it's flat until t = 5. After t = 5, it drops down to zero and stays there except for a positive slope starting at t = 7.\n\nLet me try to break this down into parts:\n\n1. From t = 0 to t = 2, the function is a parabola, specifically f(t) = 5t^2. It starts at (0,0) and reaches (2,20).\n\n2. From t = 2 to t = 5, the function is a horizontal line at f(t) = 20.\n\n3. From t = 5 to t = 7, the function is zero.\n\n4. From t = 7 onwards, there's a straight line starting from (7,0) with a positive slope.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the graph, it seems like from t = 5 to t = 7, the function is zero, but then at t = 7, it starts increasing again. But looking closely, the line after t = 7 seems to have a slope of 15, because it reaches f(t) = -30 at t = 8, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the vertical axis goes down to -30, but the line after t = 7 seems to be going upwards, not downwards. Maybe I need to look again.\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, the line after t = 7 is increasing from (7,0) upwards with a positive slope. So, it's not going down to -30; perhaps the -30 is just part of the axis label. So, from t = 7, f(t) = 15(t - 7) for t > 7.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- For 0 \u2264 t < 2, f(t) = 5t^2\n\n- For 2 \u2264 t < 5, f(t) = 20\n\n- For 5 \u2264 t < 7, f(t) = 0\n\n- For t \u2265 7, f(t) = 15(t - 7)\n\nNow, I need to express this using step functions. I recall that the unit step function u(t - a) is 1 for t > a and 0 for t < a.\n\nLet's try to write each piece accordingly:\n\nFirst, the 5t^2 part from 0 to 2. To make it start at t = 0 and end at t = 2, I can use u(t) - u(t - 2). So, 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)].\n\nNext, from t = 2 to t = 5, f(t) = 20. So, 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)].\n\nThen, from t = 5 to t = 7, f(t) = 0. So, no addition here, but to ensure continuity, we might need to subtract something, but since it's zero, maybe not.\n\nFinally, from t = 7 onwards, f(t) = 15(t - 7). This should start at t = 7, so 15(t - 7)[u(t - 7) - u(t - \u221e)], but since u(t - \u221e) is always zero, we can just use u(t - 7).\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, they all have u(t - 5) - u(t - 7) in the last term, which might be to account for the zero in the interval from t = 5 to t = 7.\n\nLet me see: from t = 5 to t = 7, f(t) = 0, which is already taken care of by not adding anything in that interval. So, perhaps I don't need to subtract anything extra.\n\nLooking at option C: 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\n\nThis seems to match what I thought:\n\n- 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] covers the parabolic part from 0 to 2.\n\n- 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] covers the flat part from 2 to 5.\n\n- 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)] seems to be trying to cover the part after t = 7, but the interval here is u(t - 5) - u(t - 7), which would be from t = 5 to t = 7, but we want zero there and then the linear part starting at t = 7.\n\nWait, but if I use u(t - 5) - u(t - 7), that would be 1 from t = 5 to t = 7, and 0 elsewhere. So, multiplying by 15(t - 7) would give zero until t = 7, and then 15(t - 7) for t > 7, which is what I want.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's check option B: 4t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\n\nHere, the coefficient of t^2 is 4 instead of 5, which doesn't match the parabolic part in the graph.\n\nOption A: 4t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 5)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\n\nAgain, the coefficient is 4t^2, and it's from t = 0 to t = 5, which doesn't match the graph.\n\nOption D: 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 3)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\n\nHere, the flat part is from t = 2 to t = 3 instead of t = 5, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct option should be C.\n\nWait, but in option C, there's a typo: it says \"4t^2\" in the first term, but looking back, the parabolic part is 5t^2, not 4t^2. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, no, looking back at option C, it says \"5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\", which matches what I thought.\n\nBut in the original question, option C has \"4t^2\", but that might be a typo, and it should be \"5t^2\". Assuming it's a typo, then C would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parabolic part is indeed 4t^2, but looking back at the graph, it reaches f(t) = 20 at t = 2, so f(t) = 5t^2, since 5*2^2 = 20.\n\nUnless the scale is different, but the axis labels suggest that's correct.\n\nTherefore, assuming option C has a typo and should have \"5t^2\", then C is the correct answer.\n\nBut since the question presents option C with \"4t^2\", and assuming it's a typo, the intended answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, if the parabolic part is indeed 4t^2, which would reach f(t) = 16 at t = 2, but that doesn't match the graph.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's confusion in the options.\n\nBut based on the graph description, the correct expression should have the parabolic part as 5t^2, the flat part from t=2 to t=5 as 20, and the linear part starting at t=7 as 15(t - 7).\n\nTherefore, the correct option, assuming a typo in C, is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
