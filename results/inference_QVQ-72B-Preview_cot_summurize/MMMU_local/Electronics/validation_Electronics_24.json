Here are the given values:\n\n- \\( V_{BB} = +15V \\)\n\n- \\( V_{CC} = +15V \\)\n\n- \\( V_{BE} = 0.3V \\) (for a germanium transistor)\n\n- \\( R_C = 4k\\Omega \\)\n\n- \\( R_E = 600\\Omega \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta = 60 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( R_B \\) such that \\( V_{CE} \\) is set to 8V.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit. It's a common-emitter amplifier with an NPN transistor. The base is connected to \\( V_{BB} \\) through resistor \\( R_B \\), the collector is connected to \\( V_{CC} \\) through resistor \\( R_C \\), and the emitter is connected to ground through resistor \\( R_E \\).\n\nI recall that in a common-emitter configuration, the base-emitter voltage \\( V_{BE} \\) is about 0.3V for a germanium transistor, which matches what's given.\n\nI need to find \\( R_B \\) such that \\( V_{CE} = 8V \\). To do that, I probably need to find the collector current \\( I_C \\) first, since \\( V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C \\cdot R_C \\).\n\nGiven that, if \\( V_{CE} = 8V \\) and \\( V_{CC} = 15V \\), then:\n\n\\[ I_C = \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}}{R_C} = \\frac{15V - 8V}{4k\\Omega} = \\frac{7V}{4k\\Omega} = 1.75mA \\]\n\nOkay, so \\( I_C = 1.75mA \\).\n\nNext, I need to find the base current \\( I_B \\). I know that for a transistor, \\( I_C = \\beta \\cdot I_B \\), so:\n\n\\[ I_B = \\frac{I_C}{\\beta} = \\frac{1.75mA}{60} \\approx 0.029167mA = 29.167\\mu A \\]\n\nNow, I need to find the voltage at the base. Since \\( V_{BE} = 0.3V \\), and the emitter is grounded, the base is at 0.3V above ground.\n\nWait, is that right? The emitter is connected to ground through \\( R_E \\), but there's also a current through \\( R_E \\). So, actually, the emitter voltage \\( V_E \\) is not zero because there's a voltage drop across \\( R_E \\) due to the emitter current \\( I_E \\).\n\nI remember that \\( I_E \\approx I_C + I_B \\), but for small-signal transistors, \\( I_C \\approx \\beta \\cdot I_B \\), and \\( I_E \\approx I_C + I_B = I_C + \\frac{I_C}{\\beta} = I_C \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right) \\)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ I_E = 1.75mA \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{60}\\right) = 1.75mA \\times \\left(1 + 0.0167\\right) = 1.75mA \\times 1.0167 \\approx 1.78mA \\]\n\nThen, the voltage across \\( R_E \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_E = I_E \\cdot R_E = 1.78mA \\times 600\\Omega = 1.78 \\times 0.6V = 1.068V \\]\n\nSo, the emitter is at 1.068V above ground.\n\nNow, the base voltage \\( V_B \\) is:\n\n\\[ V_B = V_E + V_{BE} = 1.068V + 0.3V = 1.368V \\]\n\nNow, the base is connected to \\( V_{BB} = 15V \\) through resistor \\( R_B \\), and to ground through the base-emitter diode and \\( R_E \\).\n\nWait, actually, the base is connected to \\( V_{BB} \\) through \\( R_B \\), and to the emitter (which is at \\( V_E \\)) through the base-emitter junction.\n\nSo, the current through \\( R_B \\) is the base current \\( I_B \\), and the voltage across \\( R_B \\) is \\( V_{BB} - V_B \\).\n\nTherefore, I can write:\n\n\\[ I_B = \\frac{V_{BB} - V_B}{R_B} \\]\n\nI already know \\( I_B \\approx 29.167\\mu A \\) and \\( V_B = 1.368V \\), so:\n\n\\[ 29.167\\mu A = \\frac{15V - 1.368V}{R_B} \\]\n\n\\[ 29.167\\mu A = \\frac{13.632V}{R_B} \\]\n\n\\[ R_B = \\frac{13.632V}{29.167\\mu A} \\approx 467.2k\\Omega \\]\n\nSo, \\( R_B \\) should be approximately 467.2k\u03a9.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, \\( I_C = \\frac{15V - 8V}{4k\\Omega} = 1.75mA \\), that seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( I_B = \\frac{1.75mA}{60} \\approx 29.167\\mu A \\), correct.\n\n\\( V_E = I_E \\cdot R_E \\), but I approximated \\( I_E \\approx I_C + I_B = 1.75mA + 29.167\\mu A = 1.75029167mA \\), which is approximately 1.75mA.
