                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this circuit diagram, Figure 1, which shows a voltage source V_C connected in parallel with a capacitor of 10 to the power of -5 farads. The current through the capacitor is labeled as I. The problem states that V_C is equal to sin(2\u03c0t), and I need to find an expression for I and calculate its value at t=0.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between voltage across a capacitor and the current through it. I remember that the current through a capacitor is given by the derivative of the voltage with respect to time, multiplied by the capacitance. So, mathematically, I = C * dv/dt.\n\nGiven that V_C = sin(2\u03c0t), I need to find the derivative of sin(2\u03c0t) with respect to t. The derivative of sin(ax) is a*cos(ax), so dv/dt should be 2\u03c0*cos(2\u03c0t).\n\nPlugging this into the formula for current, I get I = C * dv/dt = 10^-5 * 2\u03c0*cos(2\u03c0t). So, the expression for I is I = 2\u03c0*10^-5 * cos(2\u03c0t) amperes.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the current at t=0. Plugging t=0 into the expression, I get I = 2\u03c0*10^-5 * cos(0). Cos(0) is 1, so I = 2\u03c0*10^-5 * 1 = 2\u03c0*10^-5 A.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 3\u03c0 x 10^-5 A\n\nB. \u03c0 x 10^-5 A\n\nC. 2\u03c0 x 10^-5 A\n\nD. \u03c0 x 10^-4 A\n\nMy calculation gives me 2\u03c0 x 10^-5 A, which matches option C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from V_C = sin(2\u03c0t), the derivative dv/dt should indeed be 2\u03c0*cos(2\u03c0t). Multiplying by C = 10^-5 F, I get I = 2\u03c0*10^-5 * cos(2\u03c0t). At t=0, cos(2\u03c0*0) = cos(0) = 1, so I = 2\u03c0*10^-5 A.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think the answer is C. 2\u03c0 x 10^-5 A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any other way to interpret the circuit or the question. The circuit is a simple capacitive circuit with a voltage source and a capacitor in parallel. The current through the capacitor should indeed be I = C * dv/dt, where v is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nSince the voltage source is directly connected across the capacitor, V_C is the voltage across the capacitor, and dv/dt is the derivative of V_C with respect to time, which I calculated correctly.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the expression for I is correct, and the calculation at t=0 is accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll confirm the units. Capacitance C is in farads (F), dv/dt is in volts per second (V/s), so their product is in amperes (A), which matches the units of current.\n\nAlso, checking the given options, option C matches my answer, while the others have different coefficients or exponents.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 2\u03c0 x 10^-5 A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
