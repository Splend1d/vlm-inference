But there's only one graph provided, labeled as (a), showing a sine wave current with values in amperes over time in milliseconds. The y-axis is labeled i(A), ranging from -4 to 4 amperes, and the x-axis is labeled t(ms), ranging from -1 to 4 milliseconds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what RMS value means. RMS stands for Root Mean Square, and it's a way to determine the effective value of a varying quantity, like alternating current (AC). For a sinusoidal current, the RMS value is equal to the peak value divided by the square root of 2, or approximately 0.707 times the peak value.\n\nLooking at the graph, the current waveform appears to be a sine wave that crosses zero at t=0 ms and reaches its peak positive value of 4 A around t=1 ms, and then drops back to zero by t=2 ms. It continues negatively, reaching -4 A around t=3 ms, and back to zero by t=4 ms. So, the period of the waveform seems to be 4 milliseconds.\n\nSince it's a sine wave, I can use the formula for the RMS value of a sine wave, which is:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\frac{I_{peak}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( I_{peak} \\) is the peak current.\n\nFrom the graph, the peak current is 4 A, so:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\] amperes\n\nSimplifying that, \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\) is approximately 2.828 A.\n\nBut the question mentions \"three periodic current waveforms,\" even though only one graph is provided. Maybe it's referring to three different parts of the graph or perhaps there are multiple waves, but from what's given, it seems like there's only one sine wave shown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the RMS value over different intervals or considering multiple waves. But based on the image provided in the user's message, it's just a single sine wave.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the other parts (b) and (c) are not shown, and part (a) is the graph. Assuming that, I'll proceed with calculating the RMS value for this single sine wave.\n\nAnother way to calculate the RMS value is by using the formula for the RMS value of a function over one period:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} [i(t)]^2 dt } \\]\n\nwhere T is the period of the waveform.\n\nFrom the graph, the period T is 4 ms or 0.004 seconds.\n\nSince it's a sine wave, \\( i(t) = I_{peak} \\sin(2\\pi f t) \\), where f is the frequency.\n\nFirst, find the frequency f:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{f} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{0.004} = 250 Hz \\]\n\nNow, plug into the RMS formula:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{0.004} \\int_{0}^{0.004} [4 \\sin(2\\pi \\times 250 \\times t)]^2 dt } \\]\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{0.004} \\int_{0}^{0.004} 16 \\sin^2(500\\pi t) dt } \\]\n\nRecall that \\( \\sin^2(x) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2x)}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{0.004} \\int_{0}^{0.004} 16 \\times \\frac{1 - \\cos(1000\\pi t)}{2} dt } \\]\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{0.004} \\int_{0}^{0.004} 8 (1 - \\cos(1000\\pi t)) dt } \\]\n\nNow, integrate term by term:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{0.004} 8 (1 - \\cos(1000\\pi t)) dt = 8 \\left[ t - \\frac{\\sin(1000\\pi t)}{1000\\pi} \\right]_{0}^{0.004} \\]\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\nAt t = 0.004 s:\n\n\\[ 8 \\left[ 0.004 - \\frac{\\sin(1000\\pi \\times 0.004)}{1000\\pi} \\right] = 8 \\left[ 0.004 - \\frac{\\sin(4\\pi)}{1000\\pi} \\right] = 8 \\left[ 0.004 - 0 \\right] = 8 \\times 0.004 = 0.032 \\]\n\nAt t = 0:\n\n\\[ 8 \\left[ 0 - 0 \\right] = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the integral is 0.032.\n\nNow, plug back into the RMS formula:\n\n\\[ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{0.032}{0.004} } = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\] amperes\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a sine wave, and the RMS value of a sine wave is \\( \\frac{I_{peak}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\) A.\n\nTherefore, the effective (RMS) value of the current waveform is \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\) amperes.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"three periodic current waveforms,\" which makes me think that there might be more to this problem. Perhaps there are multiple waves, and I need to find the RMS value of their combination.\n\nHowever, based on the image provided, there's only one sine wave shown. If there were multiple waves, I would need to find the total RMS value by adding the RMS values of each wave in quadrature, assuming they are out of phase.\n\nFor example, if there were two sine waves with the same frequency but different phases, the total RMS current would be:\n\n\\[ I_{total,rms} = \\sqrt{I_{1,rms}^2 + I_{2,rms}^2 + 2 I_{1,rms} I_{2,rms} \\cos(\\phi)} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\phi \\) is the phase difference between the two waves.\n\nBut again, from the image provided, it seems like there's only one sine wave.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to show multiple waves, but only one is visible in the image.
