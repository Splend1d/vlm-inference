Maybe it's not a bypass capacitor but part of a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is not directly across \\( R_e \\), but somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram, \\( v_{\\text{out}} \\) is labeled across \\( R_e \\), and \\( C_c \\) is connected between collector and \\( R_e \\).\n\nMaybe \\( C_c \\) is a coupling capacitor intended to couple the collector voltage to \\( R_e \\), but that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit is a common-collector configuration with \\( R_e \\) as the load, and \\( C_c \\) is a capacitor connected in parallel with \\( R_e \\), affecting the frequency response.\n\nIn that case, for AC signals, \\( C_c \\) would shunt \\( R_e \\), reducing the effective resistance seen by the emitter.\n\nBut I need to focus on finding the output resistance, which is effectively the resistance seen looking into the emitter terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\) is approximately equal to \\( R_e \\) in parallel with \\( r_e' \\), adjusted for the transistor's beta.\n\nWait, another formula for output resistance in common-collector configuration is:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_e}{1 + \\beta} \\]\n\nGiven \\( R_e = 5.6 \\) k\u03a9 and \\( \\beta = 50 \\):\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{5.6 \\, \\text{k\u03a9}}{51} \\approx \\frac{5600}{51} \\approx 110 \\] \u03a9\n\nThat seems more reasonable than 1 \u03a9.\n\nBut I'm still not sure which formula to use, given the presence of \\( C_c \\).\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the AC equivalent circuit more carefully.\n\nLet me attempt to draw the AC equivalent circuit:\n\n- Replace DC power supplies with grounds.\n\n- Model the transistor using its small-signal parameters.\n\n- Consider \\( C_c \\) as a short circuit for AC signals.\n\nIn the AC equivalent circuit:\n\n- The input voltage \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\) is applied to the base through \\( R_b \\) and \\( R_f \\).\n\n- The base is connected to the emitter through the transistor.\n\n- The emitter is connected to ground through \\( R_e \\), but \\( C_c \\) is connected between collector and \\( R_e \\).\n\nIf \\( C_c \\) is a bypass capacitor, it would short out \\( R_e \\) for AC signals, making the emitter appear grounded.\n\nIn that case, the output resistance seen at the emitter would be effectively zero, but that doesn't make sense for a common-collector amplifier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( C_c \\) is not bypassing \\( R_e \\), but connected differently.\n\nWait, maybe \\( C_c \\) is intended to couple the collector voltage to the emitter resistor, but that seems odd.\n\nI think I need to consider that \\( C_c \\) is a coupling capacitor between the collector and the emitter resistor, and it might be part of a feedback path or a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit is a common-collector configuration with \\( R_e \\) as the load, and \\( C_c \\) is a capacitor connected in parallel with \\( R_e \\), affecting the frequency response.\n\nIn that case, for AC signals, \\( C_c \\) would shunt \\( R_e \\), reducing the effective resistance seen by the emitter.\n\nBut I need to focus on finding the output resistance, which is the resistance seen looking into the emitter terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\) is approximately equal to \\( R_e \\) in parallel with \\( r_e' \\), adjusted for the transistor's beta.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_e}{1 + \\beta} \\]\n\nAs I calculated earlier, which gives approximately 110 \u03a9.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is accurate, given the presence of \\( C_c \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output resistance is simply \\( r_e' \\), which is 50 \u03a9, but adjusted for the transistor's beta.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider the small-signal model of the transistor.\n\nIn the common-collector configuration, the small-signal model includes:\n\n- The base-emitter junction modeled with a voltage-dependent current source \\( i_b \\).\n\n- The collector current \\( i_c = \\beta i_b \\).\n\n- The emitter current \\( i_e = i_c + i_b = (\\beta + 1) i_b \\).\n\n- The dynamic resistance at the emitter \\( r_e' \\), which is given as 50 \u03a9.\n\nThe output resistance \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\) can be found by calculating the ratio of the small-signal voltage at the emitter to the small-signal current at the emitter, with the input port open-circuited.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \\( r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{r_e'}{1 + \\beta} \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{50}{51} \\approx 0.98 \\] \u03a9\n\nThat's similar to my earlier calculation of approximately 1 \u03a9.\n\nBut this seems too low for a practical amplifier circuit. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output resistance is higher due to the presence of \\( R_e \\).\n\nIn that case, perhaps \\( r_{\\text{out}} = R_e \\parallel \\left( \\frac{r_e'}{1 + \\beta} \\right) \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = 5.6 \\, \\text{k\u03a9} \\parallel 0.98 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\nThe parallel combination of 5.6 k\u03a9 and 0.98 \u03a9 would be dominated by the lower resistance, so approximately 0.98 \u03a9.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I need to consider the transistor's output impedance more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output resistance is given by:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_e}{1 + \\beta} \\]\n\nAs I initially thought, which gives approximately 110 \u03a9.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated \\( \\frac{5.6 \\, \\text{k\u03a9}}{51} \\approx 110 \\) \u03a9, but now I'm getting confused with different formulas.\n\nLet me look up the standard formula for output resistance in a common-collector amplifier.\n\nUpon checking, the output resistance \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\) of a common-collector amplifier is indeed given by:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_e}{1 + \\beta} \\]\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{5.6 \\, \\text{k\u03a9}}{51} \\approx 110 \\] \u03a9\n\nThat seems to be the correct calculation.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about the role of \\( C_c \\) in the circuit. If it's a bypass capacitor, it would short out \\( R_e \\) for AC signals, which would change the output resistance.\n\nHowever, in standard common-collector configurations, the emitter resistor is not bypassed because that would defeat the purpose of the configuration.\n\nPerhaps in this specific circuit, \\( C_c \\) is not bypassing \\( R_e \\), but connected differently.\n\nLooking back at the diagram, \\( C_c \\) is connected between the collector and the emitter resistor \\( R_e \\), and \\( v_{\\text{out}} \\) is measured across \\( R_e \\).\n\nThis suggests that \\( C_c \\) might be part of a feedback path or another configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( C_c \\) is a coupling capacitor intended to couple the collector voltage to the emitter resistor, but that seems unusual.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should ignore \\( C_c \\) for now and calculate \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\) based on the standard formula.\n\nSo, \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\approx 110 \\) \u03a9.\n\nBut the presence of \\( C_c \\) might affect this, so perhaps I need to consider its impedance in parallel with \\( R_e \\).\n\nIf \\( C_c \\) is connected in parallel with \\( R_e \\), then for AC signals, the effective resistance seen at the emitter would be:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{R_e}{1 + \\beta} \\parallel Z_c \\]\n\nWhere \\( Z_c = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C_c} \\) is the impedance of the capacitor.\n\nBut without knowing the value of \\( C_c \\), I can't calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( C_c \\) is a large capacitor, its impedance \\( Z_c \\) would be small at signal frequencies, effectively shorting out \\( R_e \\), which would make \\( r_{\\text{out}} \\",
