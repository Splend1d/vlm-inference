                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the steady-state voltage, v_c(t), for the circuit shown in Figure 1. The options are given, but I want to understand how to get to the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the circuit. There's a current source i(t) = cos([2t/3] + \u03c0/4) A, which is connected in parallel with a 2\u03a9 resistor and a 1F capacitor in series. The voltage across the capacitor is v_c(t), which is what we need to find.\n\nOkay, so to find the steady-state response, I think I should use phasors because it's a sinusoidal steady-state problem. Phasors can simplify the analysis by converting the time-domain signals into complex numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to find the angular frequency, \u03c9, of the input current. From the given current expression, i(t) = cos([2t/3] + \u03c0/4), I can see that \u03c9 = 2/3 radians per second.\n\nNext, I need to find the impedance of the components in the circuit. The 2\u03a9 resistor has an impedance of 2\u03a9. The 1F capacitor has an impedance of 1/(j\u03c9C), where j is the imaginary unit. So, Z_C = 1/(j\u03c9C) = 1/(j*(2/3)*1) = 3/(2j) = -j*(3/2) \u03a9.\n\nSince the resistor and capacitor are in series, their impedances add up. So, the total impedance of the RC series combination is Z_total = Z_R + Z_C = 2 - j*(3/2).\n\nNow, the current source is in parallel with this RC combination. In parallel circuits, the voltage across each component is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.\n\nWait a minute, actually, since the current source is in parallel with the RC combination, the voltage across the capacitor, v_c(t), is the same as the voltage across the RC combination.\n\nBut first, I need to find the voltage phasor, V_c, corresponding to v_c(t).\n\nTo find V_c, I can use the relationship between current and voltage in the frequency domain for the RC combination.\n\nThe admittance Y of the RC combination is 1/Z_total = 1/(2 - j*(3/2)).\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find the voltage across the RC combination using the current division principle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the concept of impedance in parallel.\n\nThe admittance Y of the circuit is equal to the current phasor I divided by the voltage phasor V.\n\nSince the current source is in parallel with the RC combination, the total admittance seen by the current source is Y_total = Y_source || Y_RC.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should use Norton's theorem to simplify the circuit.\n\nNorton's theorem states that any linear bilateral circuit can be reduced to an equivalent current source in parallel with an admittance.\n\nIn this case, the RC combination can be considered as the network, and the current source is already there.\n\nWait, no, actually, the current source is in parallel with the RC combination, so perhaps I can find the total admittance seen by the current source and then find the voltage phasor.\n\nThe admittance of the RC combination is Y_RC = 1/Z_total = 1/(2 - j*(3/2)).\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nFirst, find the complex conjugate of the denominator: (2 + j*(3/2)).\n\nThen, Y_RC = [1/(2 - j*(3/2))] * [(2 + j*(3/2))/(2 + j*(3/2))] = (2 + j*(3/2))/(4 + (3/2)^2) = (2 + j*(3/2))/(4 + 9/4) = (2 + j*(3/2))/(25/4) = (8/25 + j*(6/25)) S.\n\nSo, Y_RC = (8/25 + j*(6/25)) S.\n\nThe current source is i(t) = cos([2t/3] + \u03c0/4), so the phasor I = \u2220([2t/3] + \u03c0/4).\n\nWait, actually, the phasor representation of i(t) is I = \u2220(\u03c9t + \u03c6), but since it's a cosine function, the phasor is I = |I|\u2220\u03c6, where |I| is the amplitude of the current.\n\nWait, no. For a general sinusoidal function of the form i(t) = I_m cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6), the phasor current is I = (I_m / \u221a2)\u2220\u03c6.\n\nBut in this problem, the amplitude is 1 A, so I_m = 1 A.\n\nTherefore, I = (1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4) A.\n\nNow, the total admittance Y_total is just Y_RC since the current source is in parallel with the RC combination.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the total admittance seen by the current source is Y_total = Y_RC.\n\nBut I think I need to consider that the current source is in parallel with the RC combination, so the voltage phasor V = I / Y_total.\n\nWait, no. In parallel circuits, V = I / Y_total.\n\nSo, V = I / Y_RC.\n\nWe have I = (1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4) A and Y_RC = (8/25 + j*(6/25)) S.\n\nTherefore, V = [(1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4)] / [(8/25 + j*(6/25))].\n\nTo divide phasors, we can convert them to rectangular form and then divide.\n\nSo, V = [(1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4)] / [(8/25 + j*(6/25))].\n\nFirst, convert I to rectangular form: I = (1/\u221a2)*cos(\u03c0/4) + j*(1/\u221a2)*sin(\u03c0/4) = (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + j*(1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = (1/2) + j*(1/2).\n\nSo, I = 0.5 + j*0.5 A.\n\nY_RC = 8/25 + j*(6/25) S.\n\nTherefore, V = (0.5 + j*0.5) / (8/25 + j*(6/25)).\n\nTo divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\nThe complex conjugate of the denominator is (8/25 - j*(6/25)).\n\nSo, V = [(0.5 + j*0.5) * (8/25 - j*(6/25))] / [(8/25 + j*(6/25)) * (8/25 - j*(6/25))].\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n\n(0.5)(8/25) + (0.5)(6/25)j + (0.5)(8/25)j - (0.5)(6/25)j^2.\n\nSince j^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n(0.5)(8/25) + (0.5)(6/25)j + (0.5)(8/25)j - (0.5)(6/25)(-1) = (0.5)(8/25) + (0.5)(6/25)j + (0.5)(8/25)j + (0.5)(6/25) = (0.5)(8/25 + 6/25) + j*(0.5)(6/25 + 8/25) = (0.5)(14/25) + j*(0.5)(14/25) = (7/25) + j*(7/25).\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n(8/25)^2 + (6/25)^2 = (64/625) + (36/625) = (100/625) = (4/25).\n\nTherefore, V = (7/25 + j*(7/25)) / (4/25) = [(7/25)/(4/25)] + j*[(7/25)/(4/25)] = (7/4) + j*(7/4).\n\nSo, V = 1.75 + j*1.75 V.\n\nNow, to convert this back to polar form, we have:\n\nMagnitude |V| = sqrt((1.75)^2 + (1.75)^2) = sqrt(3.0625 + 3.0625) = sqrt(6.125) \u2248 2.47487 V.\n\nAngle \u03b8 = arctan(1.75 / 1.75) = arctan(1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nTherefore, V \u2248 2.47487\u2220(\u03c0/4) V.\n\nNow, to find the time-domain expression v_c(t), we need to convert this phasor back to a sinusoidal function.\n\nSo, v_c(t) = |V| * cos(\u03c9t + \u03b8) = 2.47487 * cos((2/3)t + \u03c0/4).\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options directly. Maybe I made a calculation error along the way.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the impedance of the capacitor: Z_C = 1/(j\u03c9C) = 1/(j*(2/3)*1) = 1/(2j/3) = 3/(2j) = -j*(3/2). That seems correct.\n\nTotal impedance of RC series: Z_total = 2 - j*(3/2). Correct.\n\nAdmittance Y_RC = 1/Z_total = 1/(2 - j*(3/2)).\n\nI calculated Y_RC = (8/25 + j*(6/25)) S. Let's verify:\n\n1/(2 - j*(3/2)) = (2 + j*(3/2)) / [(2)^2 + (3/2)^2] = (2 + j*(3/2)) / (4 + 9/4) = (2 + j*(3/2)) / (25/4) = (8/25 + j*(6/25)). Correct.\n\nPhasor current I = (1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4). Correct.\n\nVoltage phasor V = I / Y_RC = (0.5 + j*0.5) / (8/25 + j*(6/25)).\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nV = [(0.5 + j*0.5)(8/25 - j*(6/25))] / [(8/25 + j*(6/25))(8/25 - j*(6/25))].\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n(0.5)(8/25) + (0.5)(6/25)j + (0.5)(8/25)j - (0.5)(6/25)j^2 = (4/25) + (3/25)j + (4/25)j + (3/25) = (7/25) + j*(7/25).\n\nDenominator: (8/25)^2 + (6/25)^2 = (64/625) + (36/625) = (100/625) = (4/25).\n\nSo, V = (7/25 + j*(7/25)) / (4/25) = (7/4) + j*(7/4). Correct.\n\nNow, converting to polar form:\n\n|V| = sqrt((7/4)^2 + (7/4)^2) = sqrt(49/16 + 49/16) = sqrt(98/16) = sqrt(49/8) = (7)/sqrt(8) \u2248 2.47487 V.\n\nAngle \u03b8 = arctan(7/4 / 7/4) = arctan(1) = \u03c0/4 radians.\n\nSo, v_c(t) = |V| * cos(\u03c9t + \u03b8) = (7/sqrt(8)) * cos((2/3)t + \u03c0/4).\n\nBut 7/sqrt(8) is approximately 2.47487, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none of them have a magnitude close to 2.47487. The closest is option C: \u221a2 cos[(2/3)t], which is approximately 1.4142 cos((2/3)t), but that's different from my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the steady-state response more carefully. Perhaps I should use the concept of impedance division or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using the voltage divider rule in the frequency domain.\n\nWait, but it's a parallel configuration, not a series one. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the current divider rule. The current through the RC combination is I_RC = V * Y_RC, and the current through the capacitor is I_C = V * j\u03c9C.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the total current and then find the voltage.\n\nWait, no. The current source is in parallel with the RC combination, so the voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the RC combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should find the Th\u00e9venin equivalent seen by the capacitor.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating things.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should use the formula for the admittance of the parallel combination.\n\nThe admittance Y_total = Y_source + Y_RC.\n\nBut in this case, the current source is ideal, so perhaps I need to consider only Y_RC.\n\nWait, no. In parallel circuits, the total admittance is the sum of the admittances of the branches.\n\nBut since there's only one branch (the RC combination), Y_total = Y_RC.\n\nThen, the voltage phasor V = I / Y_total = I / Y_RC.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, and I got V = (7/4) + j*(7/4).\n\nBut perhaps I need to express this in terms of known values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the magnitude and phase angle separately.\n\nLet me try to find the magnitude of V in terms of known constants.\n\nWe have |V| = sqrt((7/4)^2 + (7/4)^2) = sqrt(2*(49/16)) = sqrt(98/16) = sqrt(49/8) = (7)/sqrt(8).\n\nNow, sqrt(8) = sqrt(4*2) = 2*sqrt(2), so |V| = 7/(2*sqrt(2)) = (7*sqrt(2))/4 \u2248 2.47487 V.\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nMaybe I need to rationalize the denominator.\n\nWait, (7)/sqrt(8) = (7*sqrt(8))/8 = (7*2*sqrt(2))/8 = (14*sqrt(2))/8 = (7*sqrt(2))/4.\n\nSo, |V| = (7*sqrt(2))/4.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option C is \u221a2 cos[(2/3)t], which has a magnitude of \u221a2 \u2248 1.4142, which is less than my calculated |V| of approximately 2.47487.\n\nOption A is \u221a2 cos[(1/3)t], which has the same magnitude as option C but a different frequency.\n\nOption B is \u221a3 cos[(2/3)t], which has a magnitude of \u221a3 \u2248 1.73205, still less than my calculation.\n\nOption D is \u221a3 cos[(4/3)t], which also has a magnitude of \u221a3 \u2248 1.73205.\n\nSo, none of the options match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the amplitude of the current source phasor.\n\nLet me double-check the phasor representation of the current source.\n\nGiven i(t) = cos([2t/3] + \u03c0/4), the phasor I = (1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4), since the amplitude is 1 A.\n\nBut perhaps the amplitude is not 1 A, but something else.\n\nWait, no, the problem states i(t) = cos([2t/3] + \u03c0/4) A, so the amplitude is indeed 1 A.\n\nWait, but in phasor notation, for a general sinusoidal function i(t) = I_m cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6), the phasor I = (I_m / \u221a2)\u2220\u03c6, assuming the function is given in terms of cosine.\n\nSo, I = (1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4) A.\n\nAlternatively, if the function were given in terms of sine, the phase angle would be different.\n\nBut in this case, it's cosine, so the phase angle is \u03c0/4.\n\nWait, but cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6) corresponds to a phasor I = (I_m / \u221a2)\u2220\u03c6.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of Y_RC.\n\nLet me recalculate Y_RC = 1/Z_total = 1/(2 - j*(3/2)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate: (2 + j*(3/2))/(4 + (3/2)^2) = (2 + j*(3/2))/(4 + 9/4) = (2 + j*(3/2))/(25/4) = (8/25 + j*(6/25)) S.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, V = I / Y_RC = [(1/\u221a2)\u2220(\u03c0/4)] / [(8/25 + j*(6/25))].\n\nConvert to rectangular form: I = (1/\u221a2)*cos(\u03c0/4) + j*(1/\u221a2)*sin(\u03c0/4) = (1/2) + j*(1/2).\n\nThen, V = (0.5 + j*0.5) / (8/25 + j*(6/25)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate"
