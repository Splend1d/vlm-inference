                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a series RLC circuit with an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor in series, and there's a voltage source connected in parallel with the capacitor. The initial conditions are given: the initial current through the inductor is 5 A, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is 50 V. We need to find the voltage across the capacitor, \\(v_c(t)\\), for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit configuration. From the description, it seems like the circuit is initially at rest with the capacitor charged to 50 V and the inductor carrying 5 A. Then, at time \\(t = 0\\), a voltage source of 50 V is connected in parallel with the capacitor, and we need to find how \\(v_c(t)\\) behaves afterward.\n\nWait a minute, the description mentions a series RLC circuit, but then it says the voltage source is connected in parallel with the capacitor. That sounds a bit confusing. Maybe I should visualize the circuit. Let's see:\n\n- In Fig. 1, there's a series RLC circuit with an inductor \\(L = 4\\) H, a resistor \\(R = 10\\) \u03a9, and a capacitor \\(C = 0.005\\) F, with initial conditions \\(i_L(0) = 5\\) A and \\(v_C(0) = 50\\) V.\n\n- In Fig. 2, there's a current source of \\(5\\) A connected in parallel with the capacitor, and a voltage source of \\(50\\) V also connected in some part of the circuit.\n\nI think the problem is to find \\(v_c(t)\\) after the voltage source is connected in parallel with the capacitor, assuming that before \\(t = 0\\), the circuit was in the series RLC configuration with the given initial conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps at \\(t = 0\\), the voltage source is connected in parallel with the capacitor, changing the circuit configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the voltage source was already present, and the current source is added at \\(t = 0\\). I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it shows two figures. Fig. 1 is a series RLC circuit with initial conditions, and Fig. 2 seems to be a different configuration with a current source and a voltage source connected in some way.\n\nAssuming that Fig. 1 is the initial circuit, and at \\(t = 0\\), Fig. 2 represents some change to the circuit, perhaps by adding a current source or modifying the connections.\n\nGiven that, I need to find \\(v_c(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\), considering the new configuration.\n\nLet me try to analyze the circuit step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the components from Fig. 1:\n\n- Inductor \\(L = 4\\) H\n\n- Resistor \\(R = 10\\) \u03a9\n\n- Capacitor \\(C = 0.005\\) F\n\n- Initial conditions: \\(i_L(0) = 5\\) A, \\(v_C(0) = 50\\) V\n\nIn a series RLC circuit, the differential equation governing the circuit is:\n\n\\[L \\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} q = e(t)\\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the charge on the capacitor, and \\(e(t)\\) is the voltage source.\n\nHowever, in Fig. 1, there is no voltage source mentioned, only initial conditions. So, perhaps before \\(t = 0\\), the circuit is just the series RLC with initial conditions.\n\nThen, at \\(t = 0\\), something changes, and we need to find \\(v_c(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nLooking at Fig. 2, it shows a current source of \\(5\\) A in parallel with the capacitor and an inductor, and a voltage source of \\(50\\) V.\n\nWait, in Fig. 2, the configuration seems different. Maybe Fig. 2 is the circuit after \\(t = 0\\).\n\nLet me try to interpret Fig. 2:\n\n- A current source of \\(5\\) A in parallel with the capacitor and inductor.\n\n- A voltage source of \\(50\\) V is also present.\n\nBut this seems confusing. Maybe I need to look at the circuit diagrams more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about finding \\(v_c(t)\\) in the circuit of Fig. 1 for \\(t > 0\\), given the initial conditions, and the options provided are for a different circuit configuration, like in Fig. 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find \\(v_c(t)\\) in Fig. 1 for \\(t > 0\\), and the options include a different configuration or perhaps a mistake.\n\nGiven that, let's focus on Fig. 1 first and find \\(v_c(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\) in that circuit.\n\nSo, in Fig. 1, we have a series RLC circuit with \\(L = 4\\) H, \\(R = 10\\) \u03a9, \\(C = 0.005\\) F, initial conditions \\(i_L(0) = 5\\) A and \\(v_C(0) = 50\\) V.\n\nAssuming that the circuit is initially at rest except for the initial conditions, we can write the differential equation for the series RLC circuit.\n\nThe differential equation for the series RLC circuit is:\n\n\\[L \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\]\n\nwhere \\(i\\) is the current through the circuit.\n\nGiven that, we can solve for \\(i(t)\\), and then find \\(v_c(t)\\) using the relationship:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int i(t) dt + v_c(0)\\]\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it says \"the circuit of image 1\", and then asks to find \\(v_c(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\), with options provided.\n\nHowever, the options seem to suggest a sinusoidal function, which might indicate that there is a forcing function or that the circuit is underdamped.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there is a voltage source present in the circuit, or perhaps the current source in Fig. 2 is affecting the circuit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the voltage source is part of the initial conditions.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that in Fig. 1, there is a series RLC circuit with initial conditions, and at \\(t = 0\\), a voltage source is connected in parallel with the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn that case, the circuit changes at \\(t = 0\\), and we need to find \\(v_c(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nSo, for \\(t > 0\\), the circuit consists of the inductor \\(L = 4\\) H, the capacitor \\(C = 0.005\\) F, and a voltage source of \\(50\\) V connected in parallel with the capacitor.\n\nAdditionally, there is a current source of \\(5\\) A in Fig. 2, which might be affecting the circuit.\n\nWait, in Fig. 2, there is a current source of \\(5\\) A connected in parallel with the capacitor and the inductor.\n\nThis seems like a parallel connection between the inductor and the capacitor, with the current source and the voltage source in the loop.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the current source is in parallel with the capacitor and the inductor, and the voltage source is in series with them.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I can write the loop equations to find \\(v_c(t)\\).\n\nLet me try to write the equations for the circuit in Fig. 2.\n\nAssuming that the inductor and the capacitor are in parallel, and the current source is also in parallel with them, and the voltage source is in series with this parallel combination.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to consider the circuit elements and their connections more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply about finding \\(v_c(t)\\) in the circuit of Fig. 1 for \\(t > 0\\), and the options provided are for that scenario.\n\nGiven that, let's try to solve for \\(v_c(t)\\) in the series RLC circuit of Fig. 1.\n\nIn a series RLC circuit, the differential equation for the current \\(i(t)\\) is:\n\n\\[L \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\]\n\nGiven \\(L = 4\\) H, \\(R = 10\\) \u03a9, and \\(C = 0.005\\) F, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[4 \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + 10 \\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{0.005} i = 0\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[4 \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + 10 \\frac{di}{dt} + 200 i = 0\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[2 \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + 5 \\frac{di}{dt} + 100 i = 0\\]\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n\\[2m^2 + 5m + 100 = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[m = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 800}}{4} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-775}}{4}\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{-5}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{775}}{4} j = -1.25 \\pm 5.32 j\\]\n\nThus, the general solution for \\(i(t)\\) is:\n\n\\[i(t) = e^{-1.25t} (A \\cos(5.32t) + B \\sin(5.32t))\\]\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions to find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nFirst initial condition: \\(i_L(0) = 5\\) A.\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\):\n\n\\[i(0) = e^{0} (A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0)) = A = 5\\]\n\nSo, \\(A = 5\\).\n\nNext, we need the derivative of \\(i(t)\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{di}{dt} = -1.25 e^{-1.25t} (A \\cos(5.32t) + B \\sin(5.32t)) + e^{-1.25t} (-5.32 A \\sin(5.32t) + 5.32 B \\cos(5.32t))\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{di}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = -1.25(5) + 5.32 B = -6.25 + 5.32 B\\]\n\nBut I need to find the initial derivative of the current. Wait, I need to find \\(\\frac{di}{dt}(0)\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find \\(v_c(t)\\) directly.\n\nRecall that in a series RLC circuit, \\(v_c(t)\\) can be found using:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = V_c(0) e^{-\\frac{R}{2L}t} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega_d\\) is the damped angular frequency, and \\(\\phi\\) is the phase angle.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can use this formula to find \\(v_c(t)\\).\n\nFirst, find \\(\\omega_d\\):\n\n\\[\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{LC} - \\left(\\frac{R}{2L}\\right)^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(4)(0.005)} - \\left(\\frac{10}{2 \\times 4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.02} - \\left(\\frac{10}{8}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{50 - 1.5625} = \\sqrt{48.4375} \\approx 6.96\\ \\text{rad/s}\\]\n\nNow, the general solution for \\(v_c(t)\\) is:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = V_c(0) e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha = \\frac{R}{2L} = \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25\\) s\\(^{-1}\\)\n\nGiven that \\(V_c(0) = 50\\) V, and assuming \\(\\phi = 0\\) for simplicity, we have:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = 50 e^{-1.25t} \\cos(6.96t)\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the provided options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the formula for \\(v_c(t)\\). Let me check.\n\nIn a series RLC circuit, the voltage across the capacitor is indeed given by:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = V_c(0) e^{-\\alpha t} \\cos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha = \\frac{R}{2L}\\), \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{LC} - \\alpha^2}\\), and \\(\\phi\\) depends on the initial conditions.\n\nGiven that, my calculation for \\(\\omega_d\\) seems correct.\n\nHowever, the options provided are in the form:\n\n\\[v_c(t) = 70.7 \\cos(20t - 45^\\circ) \\text{ u(t) V}\\]\n\nThis doesn't match my result. Maybe there's something wrong with my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit configuration changes at \\(t = 0\\), and I need to consider the new configuration shown in Fig. 2.\n\nLet me try to analyze Fig. 2.\n\nIn Fig. 2, there is a current source of \\(5\\) A in parallel with the capacitor and inductor, and a voltage source of \\(50\\) V is also present.\n\nThis seems like a parallel RLC circuit with a current source and a voltage source.\n\nIn a parallel RLC circuit, the admittance is the sum of the admittances of the individual components.\n\nLet me try to write the loop equations for Fig. 2.\n\nLet's assume that the inductor and capacitor are in parallel, and the current source is also in parallel with them, and the voltage source is in series with this parallel combination.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the current source is providing a constant current of \\(5\\) A into the parallel combination of the inductor and capacitor, and the voltage source is in series with this parallel combination.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I can write the loop equation considering the voltage across the parallel combination.\n\nLet me denote the voltage across the capacitor and inductor as \\(v(t)\\).\n\nThen, the current through the inductor is:\n\n\\[i_L(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int v(t) dt + i_L(0)\\]\n\nThe current through the capacitor is:\n\n\\[i_C(t) = C \\frac{dv}{dt}\\]\n\nThe total current through the parallel combination is:\n\n\\[i(t) = i_L(t) + i_C(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int v(t) dt + i_L(0) + C \\frac{dv}{dt}\\]\n\nGiven that there is a current source of \\(5\\) A in parallel, this total current should be equal to \\(5\\) A:\n\n\\[i(t) = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{L} \\int v(t) dt + i_L(0) + C \\frac{dv}{dt} = 5\\]\n\nAdditionally, there is a voltage source of \\(50\\) V in series with this parallel combination. So, the voltage across the parallel combination is equal to the voltage source minus any voltage drop across the resistor or other elements.\n\nWait, in Fig. 2, there is a voltage source connected in parallel with the capacitor and inductor, and a current source in parallel with them.\n\nThis is still confusing. Maybe I need to consider the nodal analysis.\n\nLet me try nodal analysis.\n\nLet's assume that the top node is at voltage \\(v(t)\\), and the bottom node is ground.\n\nThen, the current through the inductor is:\n\n\\[i_L(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int v(t) dt + i_L(0)\\]\n\nThe current through the capacitor is:\n\n\\[i_C(t) = C \\frac{dv}{dt}\\]\n\nThe current through the voltage source is:\n\n\\[i_{vs} = \\frac{v(t) - 50}{R}\\]\n\nAnd the current source is providing \\(5\\) A into the node.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff's current law at the top node:\n\n\\[i_L(t) + i_C(t) + i_{vs} = 5\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{L} \\int v(t) dt + i_L(0) + C \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{v(t) - 50}{R} = 5\\]\n\nPlugging in the values \\(L = 4\\) H, \\(C = 0.005\\) F, \\(R = 10\\) \u03a9, \\(i_L(0) = 5\\) A:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{4} \\int v(t) dt + 5 + 0.005 \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{v(t) - 50}{10} = 5\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{4} \\int v(t) dt + 5 + 0.005 \\frac{dv}{dt} + 0.1 v(t) - 5 = 5\\]\n\nThe \\(+5\\) and \\(-5\\) cancel out:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{4} \\int v(t) dt + 0.005 \\frac{dv}{dt} + 0.1 v(t) = 5\\]\n\nThis is a first-order integro-differential equation, which seems complicated to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take the derivative of both sides to eliminate the integral.\n\nTaking the derivative:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{4} v(t) + 0.005 \\frac{d^"
