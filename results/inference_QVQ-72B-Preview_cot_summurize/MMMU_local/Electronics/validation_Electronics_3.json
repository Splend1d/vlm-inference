                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It's about a series RL circuit with a unit ramp voltage source applied, and I need to find the voltage across the resistor, \\(v_R(t)\\), given that the initial condition for the inductor is zero. The values given are \\(R = 1\\,\\Omega\\), \\(L = 0.1\\,\\text{H}\\), and the voltage source is a unit ramp function, which is \\(v(t) = t\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the behavior of a series RL circuit. In a series RL circuit, the voltage across the resistor and the inductor are related to the total voltage by Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). So, the sum of the voltages around the loop is zero:\n\n\\[v(t) = v_R(t) + v_L(t)\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_L(t) = L \\frac{di}{dt}\\), and \\(v_R(t) = i R\\).\n\nGiven that the voltage source is a unit ramp function, \\(v(t) = t\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\), and with zero initial conditions, I can set up the differential equation for the circuit.\n\nSo, substituting the expressions for \\(v_R(t)\\) and \\(v_L(t)\\) into KVL:\n\n\\[t = R i(t) + L \\frac{di}{dt}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values \\(R = 1\\,\\Omega\\) and \\(L = 0.1\\,\\text{H}\\):\n\n\\[t = i(t) + 0.1 \\frac{di}{dt}\\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve for \\(i(t)\\), I can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[0.1 \\frac{di}{dt} + i = t\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 0.1 to make it easier:\n\n\\[\\frac{di}{dt} + 10i = 10t\\]\n\nNow, this is a standard first-order linear ODE. I can solve it using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is \\(e^{\\int 10\\, dt} = e^{10t}\\).\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor:\n\n\\[e^{10t} \\frac{di}{dt} + 10 e^{10t} i = 10t e^{10t}\\]\n\nThe left side is the derivative of \\(i e^{10t}\\) with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt}(i e^{10t}) = 10t e^{10t}\\]\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\n\\[i e^{10t} = \\int 10t e^{10t}\\, dt + C\\]\n\nTo solve the integral on the right, I can use integration by parts. Let's set \\(u = t\\), \\(dv = 10 e^{10t}\\, dt\\), so \\(du = dt\\) and \\(v = e^{10t}\\).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: \\(\\int u\\, dv = u v - \\int v\\, du\\):\n\n\\[\\int 10t e^{10t}\\, dt = t e^{10t} - \\int e^{10t}\\, dt = t e^{10t} - \\frac{1}{10} e^{10t} + C_1\\]\n\nSo, plugging this back into the equation:\n\n\\[i e^{10t} = t e^{10t} - \\frac{1}{10} e^{10t} + C\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(e^{10t}\\):\n\n\\[i(t) = t - \\frac{1}{10} + C e^{-10t}\\]\n\nNow, I need to apply the initial condition to find \\(C\\). At \\(t = 0\\), assuming the circuit is at rest, so \\(i(0) = 0\\):\n\n\\[0 = 0 - \\frac{1}{10} + C e^{0} \\implies C = \\frac{1}{10}\\]\n\nTherefore, the current \\(i(t)\\) is:\n\n\\[i(t) = t - \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} e^{-10t}\\]\n\nNow, recall that \\(v_R(t) = i R\\). Since \\(R = 1\\,\\Omega\\), \\(v_R(t) = i(t)\\):\n\n\\[v_R(t) = t - \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} e^{-10t}\\]\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\(t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-20t} - 1)\\, \\text{V}\\)\n\nB. \\(t + \\frac{1}{20}(e^{-10t} - 1)\\, \\text{V}\\)\n\nC. \\(t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1)\\, \\text{V}\\)\n\nD. \\(t - \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1)\\, \\text{V}\\)\n\nMy expression for \\(v_R(t)\\) is:\n\n\\[v_R(t) = t - \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} e^{-10t}\\]\n\nI can rearrange this to match one of the options:\n\n\\[v_R(t) = t + \\frac{1}{10} e^{-10t} - \\frac{1}{10}\\]\n\nFactor out \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) from the last two terms:\n\n\\[v_R(t) = t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1)\\]\n\nWhich matches option C:\n\nC. \\(t + \\frac{1}{10}(e^{-10t} - 1)\\, \\text{V}\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if there's any possibility of a mistake. The differential equation was set up correctly based on KVL. The integrating factor method was applied properly, and the integration by parts seems correct. The initial condition was applied correctly, and the final expression matches option C.\n\nSo, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
