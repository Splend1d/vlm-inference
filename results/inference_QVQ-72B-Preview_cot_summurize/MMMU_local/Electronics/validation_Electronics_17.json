                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three circuits in Figure 1, parts (a), (b), and (c), and for each of them, after t=0, they become source-free. That means there are no independent sources like batteries or current sources acting after t=0. We need to find the expression for voltage v across a specific component in each circuit for t > 0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening in each circuit before and after t=0.\n\nStarting with Figure 1(a):\n\n- There's a 12V battery connected to a series combination of a 6\u03a9 resistor, a switch, a 4\u03a9 resistor, and a 2H inductor.\n\n- At t=0, the switch is opened, making the circuit source-free.\n\nWait, actually, in part (a), there's a 12V battery present even after t=0, unless specified otherwise. Hmm, the problem says \"after t=0, each of the circuits in Figure (b) of <image 1> is source-free.\" It seems like there might be a confusion in the question prompt. Maybe it's referring only to Figure (b), but the user wrote \"each of the circuits in Figure (b)\", which is a bit confusing.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote: \"each of the circuits in Figure (b) of <image 1> is source-free after t=0.\" But the figures are labeled as (a), (b), and (c). Perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find v for each case in parts (a), (b), and (c) after t=0, assuming the circuits become source-free at that point.\n\nLet me look at each part individually.\n\n**Figure 1(a):**\n\n- At t=0-, the circuit includes a 12V battery, a 6\u03a9 resistor, a switch, a 4\u03a9 resistor, and a 2H inductor.\n\n- When the switch is opened at t=0, the circuit becomes source-free if the battery is removed.\n\nBut the problem says \"after t=0, each of the circuits in Figure (b) of <image 1> is source-free.\" Wait, Figure (b) is separate from (a), so perhaps only (b) is source-free after t=0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to analyze each circuit separately after t=0, assuming the switch action makes them source-free.\n\nThis is a bit unclear, but I'll proceed by assuming that after t=0, the circuits are source-free, meaning no independent voltage or current sources are present.\n\nLet's start with Figure 1(b):\n\n**Figure 1(b):**\n\n- At t=0-, there's a 100V battery, a 30\u03a9 resistor, a switch, a 20\u03a9 resistor, a 4\u03a9 resistor, and a 5H inductor.\n\n- At t=0, the switch is opened, making the circuit source-free.\n\nSo, after t=0, the circuit consists of the inductor, the resistors, and the initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\nFirst, I need to find the initial conditions, i.e., the current through the inductor and the voltage across the capacitors at t=0+.\n\nBut in this circuit, there's no capacitor; only an inductor is present.\n\nWait, the problem mentions finding v for t > 0, so I need to find the voltage across the specified component.\n\nLooking at Figure 1(b), the voltage v is across the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nSo, I need to find v(t) for t > 0 in this source-free RL circuit.\n\nIn a source-free RL circuit, the voltage across the resistor can be found using the formula:\n\nv(t) = -L * (di/dt) / R\n\nBut since the circuit is source-free, the current through the inductor will decay exponentially.\n\nFirst, I need to find the time constant \u03c4 = L / R_total.\n\nIn Figure 1(b), after t=0, the circuit is:\n\n- 30\u03a9 resistor in series with 20\u03a9 and 4\u03a9 resistors, and a 5H inductor.\n\nWait, but the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nLet me redraw the circuit after t=0.\n\nAfter the switch is opened, the 100V source is disconnected, and the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and both are in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram:\n\n- The 30\u03a9 resistor is in series with the switch.\n\n- The switch is in series with the 20\u03a9 resistor and the 5H inductor.\n\n- The 4\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with the inductor.\n\nSo, when the switch is opened at t=0, the circuit consists of the inductor in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that combination in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nBut actually, since the switch is open, the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors are in series, and the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, but that parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to analyze the circuit more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor as a parallel combination, and then in series with the other resistors.\n\nFirst, find the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor.\n\nAt t=0-, the current through the inductor is determined by the circuit before the switch is opened.\n\nAt t=0-, the switch is closed, and the circuit includes the 100V source, 30\u03a9 resistor, switch, 20\u03a9 resistor, and 5H inductor, with the 4\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the inductor.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find the initial current through the inductor before the switch is opened.\n\nAt t=0-, the switch is closed, and the circuit is in steady state.\n\nIn steady state, the inductor acts like a short circuit.\n\nSo, the current through the inductor at t=0- is:\n\nFirst, find the total resistance seen by the 100V source.\n\nThe 30\u03a9 resistor is in series with the switch, which is closed, then in series with the 20\u03a9 resistor, and the inductor acts like a short, so it's in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nWait, the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance seen by the 100V source is:\n\nR_eq = 30\u03a9 + (20\u03a9 + (4\u03a9 || inductor))\n\nAt t=0-, inductor acts as a short circuit, so 4\u03a9 || 0\u03a9 = 0\u03a9.\n\nTherefore, R_eq = 30\u03a9 + 20\u03a9 + 0\u03a9 = 50\u03a9.\n\nSo, the current from the 100V source is I_total = 100V / 50\u03a9 = 2A.\n\nThis current splits into the inductor (which acts as a short) and the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nSince the inductor is a short, all 2A flow through it, and no current through the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nWait, but in parallel, the voltage is the same across both branches.\n\nSo, voltage across inductor and 4\u03a9 resistor is V = I * R = 2A * 0\u03a9 = 0V.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the 100V source is dropping all its voltage across the 30\u03a9 and 20\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, no:\n\nThe 30\u03a9 and 20\u03a9 resistors are in series, total 50\u03a9, and the inductor and 4\u03a9 resistor are in parallel, but inductor is a short, so effectively, the current path is through 30\u03a9, then 20\u03a9, and then the inductor short, with 4\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the inductor.\n\nSo, the 50\u03a9 resistance sees 100V, so total current is 2A.\n\nThis 2A flows through the inductor (since it's a short), and no current through the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nTherefore, at t=0-, the current through the inductor is 2A.\n\nNow, at t=0+, when the switch is opened, the circuit becomes source-free.\n\nThe inductor, which had 2A flowing through it, will try to maintain this current, and the circuit will have the inductor in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that combination in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, more precisely, the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the equivalent circuit after t=0 is:\n\n- Inductor (5H) in parallel with 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\n- That parallel combination in series with (20\u03a9 + 30\u03a9 = 50\u03a9).\n\nSo, the total resistance seen by the inductor and 4\u03a9 resistor in parallel is:\n\nFirst, find the equivalent resistance of 4\u03a9 and 5H inductor in parallel.\n\nThe impedance of the inductor is Ls = 5s, where s is the Laplace variable.\n\nSo, the parallel combination is:\n\nZ_parallel = (4 * (5s)) / (4 + 5s) = (20s) / (4 + 5s)\n\nThen, this is in series with 50\u03a9, so the total impedance is:\n\nZ_total = Z_parallel + 50 = (20s)/(4 + 5s) + 50\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Thevenin equivalent seen by the inductor.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the standard first-order circuit approach.\n\nIn a source-free RL circuit, the current through the inductor decays exponentially:\n\ni(t) = i(0+) * e^(-t/\u03c4)\n\nWhere \u03c4 = L / R_total\n\nHere, i(0+) is the initial current through the inductor at t=0+, which is the same as at t=0-, which is 2A.\n\nNow, I need to find R_total seen by the inductor.\n\nIn this circuit, after t=0, the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nTo find R_total seen by the inductor, I need to look back into the circuit from the inductor's terminals.\n\nSo, from the inductor's perspective:\n\n- The 4\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with it.\n\n- Then, in series with the combination of 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, actually, the 4\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with the inductor, and that parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the voltage across the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor is the same, and that voltage is also the voltage across the series combination of 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nTherefore, the current through the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor must satisfy the voltage drop across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should use mesh analysis or nodal analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the time constant \u03c4 = L / R_total, where R_total is the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor when all other inductors are open-circuited.\n\nIn this case, since the inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors, which are in series.\n\nSo, to find R_total seen by the inductor:\n\n- Looking back into the circuit from the inductor's terminals, the 4\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with the inductor.\n\n- Then, in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\n- The inductor is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\n- That parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor is:\n\nR_total = (4 || Z_inductor) + 50\n\nBut Z_inductor = L / s, in Laplace domain.\n\nWait, in DC steady state before t=0, the inductor acts as a short circuit, which is 0\u03a9.\n\nBut after t=0, when the circuit is source-free, the inductor has an initial current, and its impedance is Ls in Laplace domain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor in parallel, and then in series with 50\u03a9.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor is:\n\nR_total = [4 || (Ls)] + 50\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor are in parallel, and that combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the voltage across the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor is the same, and that voltage is also the voltage across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors in series.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor is equal to the voltage across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nLet me denote the current through the inductor as i_L(t), and the current through the 4\u03a9 resistor as i_4(t).\n\nSince they are in parallel, v = 4 * i_4(t) = 50 * i_L(t)\n\nWait, no:\n\nThe voltage across both is the same, so:\n\nv = 4 * i_4(t) = L * di_L(t)/dt\n\nAlso, the current through the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors is i_L(t), since they are in series with the parallel combination.\n\nWait, no:\n\nThe current through the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors is the sum of the currents through the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nWait, no:\n\nActually, the current through the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors is the current through the parallel combination of inductor and 4\u03a9 resistor.\n\nSo, i_total = i_L(t) + i_4(t)\n\nAnd this i_total flows through the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors in series.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors is v = 50 * i_total = 50 * (i_L(t) + i_4(t))\n\nBut also, v = 4 * i_4(t) = L * di_L(t)/dt\n\nSo, we have:\n\n4 * i_4(t) = L * di_L(t)/dt\n\nAnd\n\nv = 50 * (i_L(t) + i_4(t)) = 4 * i_4(t)\n\nTherefore, 50 * (i_L(t) + i_4(t)) = 4 * i_4(t)\n\nSimplify:\n\n50 i_L(t) + 50 i_4(t) = 4 i_4(t)\n\nSo, 50 i_L(t) = 4 i_4(t) - 50 i_4(t) = -46 i_4(t)\n\nTherefore, i_L(t) = (-46/50) i_4(t) = -0.92 i_4(t)\n\nNow, from the first equation:\n\n4 * i_4(t) = L * di_L(t)/dt\n\nBut i_L(t) = -0.92 i_4(t)\n\nSo, di_L(t)/dt = d(-0.92 i_4(t))/dt = -0.92 di_4(t)/dt\n\nTherefore:\n\n4 * i_4(t) = L * (-0.92 di_4(t)/dt)\n\nSo, 4 i_4(t) = -0.92 L di_4(t)/dt\n\nThen, di_4(t)/dt = - (4 / (0.92 L)) i_4(t)\n\nSo, this is a first-order differential equation:\n\ndi_4(t)/dt + (4 / (0.92 L)) i_4(t) = 0\n\nThis is of the form:\n\ndi_4(t)/dt + (1/\u03c4) i_4(t) = 0\n\nWhere \u03c4 = time constant = L / R_total\n\nFrom the equation, 1/\u03c4 = 4 / (0.92 L)\n\nTherefore, \u03c4 = (0.92 L) / 4 = 0.23 L\n\nBut \u03c4 should be L / R_total\n\nSo, R_total = L / \u03c4 = L / (0.23 L) = 1 / 0.23 \u2248 4.3478\u03a9\n\nWait, but this seems off because earlier I thought R_total should be around 50\u03a9 plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in relating i_L and i_4.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can consider the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor in parallel, and that parallel combination in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor is:\n\nR_total = R_th seen from the inductor's terminals, with all independent sources set to zero.\n\nIn this case, with the inductor in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor, and that parallel combination in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, R_total = 4 || Z_inductor + 50\n\nBut Z_inductor = L / s, in Laplace domain.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should use the concept of equivalent resistance for parallel elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor are in parallel, and that parallel combination is in series with the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nSo, the voltage across the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor is the same, and that voltage is also the voltage across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors in series.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor and the 4\u03a9 resistor is equal to the voltage across the 20\u03a9 and 30\u03a9 resistors.\n\nLet me denote the voltage as v(t).\n\nThen, v(t) = 4 * i_4(t) = L * di_L(t)/dt\n\nAlso, v(t) = 50 * i_total(t), where i_total(t) = i_L(t) + i"
