                    "text": "So I've got this circuit problem here, and I need to find the current I1 in terms of amps, and it should be expressed as a complex number. Okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on AC circuits, but I remember that in AC steady-state analysis, we use phasors and complex impedances to represent circuit elements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit. There's a voltage source given by 100 cos(377t) V. That's a cosine wave with an amplitude of 100 volts and an angular frequency of 377 radians per second. The circuit consists of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and there are two currents labeled I1 and I2.\n\nLooking at the circuit diagram, it seems like there's a voltage source connected to point a, and then from there, there's a path through a capacitor to ground, and another path through a resistor to ground. There's also an inductor and another resistor in parallel with the capacitor and the first resistor.\n\nWait, actually, I need to look at the circuit diagram again to make sure I understand the connections. There are two meshes here, with currents I1 and I2 flowing through them.\n\nLet me try to describe the circuit:\n\n- There's a voltage source of 100 cos(377t) V connected between points a and b.\n\n- From point a, there's a path through a 10 \u03bcF capacitor to ground.\n\n- There's also a path from point a through a 100 \u03a9 resistor to ground.\n\n- Additionally, there's a 1 H inductor in series with another 100 \u03a9 resistor connected between points a and b.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the circuit diagram more carefully. Let's assume that point a is connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source and point b to the negative terminal.\n\nFrom point a, there is a path through a 10 \u03bcF capacitor directly to point b, which is ground. There is also a path through a 100 \u03a9 resistor directly to point b. Additionally, there is a path through a 1 H inductor and another 100 \u03a9 resistor in series back to point b.\n\nSo, the circuit consists of a voltage source in series with a capacitor, a resistor, and an inductor and resistor in parallel.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider it as a parallel circuit where the voltage source is connected across all the branches.\n\nLet me try to write the mesh equations for this circuit.\n\nFirst, I need to assign voltages and currents properly. Since it's an AC circuit, I should use phasor notation.\n\nThe voltage source is 100 cos(377t) V. In phasor notation, that would be 100\u22200\u00b0 V, right?\n\nNow, let's find the impedances of each component.\n\n- The resistor has an impedance of R = 100 \u03a9.\n\n- The capacitor has an impedance of Z_C = 1/(j\u03c9C), where \u03c9 is the angular frequency, C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven \u03c9 = 377 rad/s and C = 10 \u03bcF = 10 \u00d7 10^-6 F.\n\nSo, Z_C = 1/(j \u00d7 377 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10^-6) = 1/(j \u00d7 3.77 \u00d7 10^-3) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1 / (j \u00d7 0.00377) = 1
