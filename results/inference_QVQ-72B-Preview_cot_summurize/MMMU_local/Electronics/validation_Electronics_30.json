The input voltage is given as 100 millivolts at 0 degrees, and I need to find the phase of the output voltage, V_out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit. From the diagram, it looks like there are four identical stages in series, each consisting of a 0.5 microfarad capacitor in parallel with a 10 kilohm resistor. The angular frequency is given as \u03c9 = 100 radians per second.\n\nI think the best approach is to model each stage as a complex impedance and then propagate the voltage through each stage one by one.\n\nLet's start by finding the impedance of each RC parallel combination.\n\nFor a capacitor, the impedance is Z_C = 1/(j\u03c9C), where j is the imaginary unit, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, and C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven C = 0.5 \u03bcF = 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 F, and \u03c9 = 100 rad/s,\n\nZ_C = 1/(j \u00d7 100 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10^-6) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10^6 F\u207b\u00b9)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's calculate it properly.\n\nZ_C = 1/(j\u03c9C) = 1/(j \u00d7 100 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10^-6) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u03bcF\u207b\u00b9) = 1/(j \u00d7 50 \u00d7 10^6 F\u207b\u00b9)\n\nActually, 0.5 \u03bcF is 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 F, so \u03c9C = 100 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 = 0.5 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.00005 S (Siemens, since it's in units of 1/\u03a9).\n\nSo, Z_C = 1/(j \u00d7 0.00005) = -j \u00d7 20000 \u03a9.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check the units.\n\n\u03c9C = 100 rad/s \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcF = 100 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 = 0.5 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.00005 S (Siemens).\n\nSo, Z_C = 1/(j\u03c9C) = 1/(j \u00d7 0.00005) = -j \u00d7 20000 \u03a9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Z_C = -j20,000 \u03a9.\n\nNow, the resistor has Z_R = 10 k\u03a9 = 10,000 \u03a9.\n\nSince they are in parallel, the total impedance for one stage is:\n\nZ_stage = Z_R || Z_C = (Z_R + Z_C)/(Z_R \u00d7 Z_C) = (10,000 - j20,000)/(10,000 \u00d7 10,000) = (10,000 - j20,000)/100,000,000\n\nWait, that's not the correct formula for parallel impedances.\n\nThe correct formula for two impedances in parallel is:\n\nZ_parallel = (Z1 \u00d7 Z2)/(Z1 + Z2)\n\nSo, Z_stage = (10,000 + (-j20,000))/(10,000 \u00d7 (-j20,000))/(10,000 - j20,000)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's recall the correct formula:\n\nZ_parallel = (Z_R \u00d7 Z_C)/(Z_R + Z_C)\n\nGiven Z_R = 10,000 \u03a9 and Z_C = -j20,000 \u03a9,\n\nZ_stage = (10,000 \u00d7 (-j20,000))/(10,000 - j20,000)\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 10,000 \u00d7 (-j20,000) = -j200,000,000 \u03a9\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 10,000 - j20,000 \u03a9\n\nSo, Z_stage = -j200,000,000 / (10,000 - j20,000)\n\nTo simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nZ_stage = [-j200,000,000 \u00d7 (10,000 + j20,000)] / [(10,000)^2 + (20,000)^2]\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: (10,000)^2 + (20,000)^2 = 100,000,000 + 400,000,000 = 500,000,000 \u03a9\u00b2\n\nNow, the numerator: -j200,000,000 \u00d7 (10,000 + j20,000)\n\nLet's distribute:\n\n= (-j200,000,000 \u00d7 10,000) + (-j200,000,000 \u00d7 j20,000)\n\n= (-j2,000,000,000) + (-j \u00d7 j \u00d7 200,000,000 \u00d7 20,000)\n\nRecall that j \u00d7 j = -1, so:\n\n= -j2,000,000,000 + (200,000,000 \u00d7 20,000)\n\n= -j2,000,000,000 + 4,000,000,000\n\nSo, Z_stage = (4,000,000,000 - j2,000,000,000) / 500,000,000\n\nNow, divide both real and imaginary parts by 500,000,000:\n\n= (4,000,000,000 / 500,000,000) - j(2,000,000,000 / 500,000,000)\n\n= 8 - j4 \u03a9\n\nSo, the impedance of one stage is 8 - j4 \u03a9.\n\nNow, since there are four such stages in series, the total impedance is:\n\nZ_total = 4 \u00d7 Z_stage = 4 \u00d7 (8 - j4) = 32 - j16 \u03a9\n\nNow, the voltage divider formula can be used to find V_out in terms of V_in:\n\nV_out = V_in \u00d7 (Z_load)/(Z_total + Z_load)\n\nBut in this case, if the last stage is connected directly to V_out, and assuming no load is connected beyond that, perhaps V_out is just across the last stage.\n\nWait, the diagram isn't provided, but from the description, it seems like it's a ladder network with four stages in series, and V_out is taken across the last stage.\n\nAssuming that, then V_out would be V_in multiplied by the voltage divider ratio for the last stage, considering the previous stages as part of the total impedance.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to consider the entire network as a voltage divider, with Z_total in series with V_in.\n\nWait, no, in a ladder network, each stage affects the previous one, so it's not just a simple series connection.\n\nAlternatively, since all stages are identical, perhaps there's a pattern or a recursive relationship that can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the transfer function of one stage and then raise it to the fourth power, assuming the stages are identical and connected in series.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the voltage gain of one stage, then apply it four times.\n\nThe voltage gain A_v for one RC parallel combination is:\n\nA_v = V_out / V_in = Z_parallel / (Z_parallel + Z)\n\nWait, I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, in a ladder network, each stage can be modeled, and the overall transfer function can be found by multiplying the transfer functions of each stage, assuming they are independent, which they are not due to loading effects.\n\nBut for now, let's consider each stage individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the concept of chain matrices or ABCD parameters to model each stage and then multiply them together to get the overall transfer function.\n\nHowever, that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the input impedance seen by V_in and then find V_out accordingly.\n\nBut I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the entire ladder network.\n\nEach stage consists of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, and these stages are connected in series.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find the total impedance of the network and then find V_out using the voltage divider formula.\n\nFrom earlier, I calculated Z_total = 32 - j16 \u03a9 for four stages.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate, as each stage may load the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of driving point impedance for a ladder network.\n\nFor a ladder network with identical stages, the total impedance can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the total impedance of a ladder network.\n\nIf Z is the impedance of one stage, then the total impedance Z_total for n stages is:\n\nZ_total = Z + Z_total / (Z + Z_total)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship.\n\nBut in this case, since all stages are identical, perhaps there's a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of continued fractions or some iterative approach.\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a low-pass filter and find its transfer function.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe I should proceed with the earlier calculation and see if it makes sense.\n\nAssuming that Z_total = 32 - j16 \u03a9 for four stages, then the voltage gain A_v = V_out / V_in = Z_total / (Z_total + R_source)\n\nBut I don't know the source resistance R_source. Assuming it's zero, then A_v = Z_total / Z_total = 1, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps V_out is taken across the last stage, so V_out = V_in \u00d7 (Z_stage)^4 / (Z_total + Z_stage)^4\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a voltage divider with Z_total in series with V_in, and V_out is across Z_stage.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Th\u00e9venin equivalence at each stage.\n\nBut I need to find a simpler way.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should consider using phasors and complex impedances to model the circuit.\n\nLet me try to find the transfer function of one stage and then apply it four times, assuming no loading effects.\n\nFor one stage:\n\nV_out1 = V_in \u00d7 Z_R / (Z_R + Z_C)\n\nGiven Z_R = 10,000 \u03a9 and Z_C = -j20,000 \u03a9,\n\nV_out1 = V_in \u00d7 (10,000) / (10,000 - j20,000)\n\nTo simplify, let's compute the magnitude and phase of the denominator.\n\nFirst, find the magnitude of the denominator:\n\n|10,000 - j20,000| = sqrt(10,000^2 + (-20,000)^2) = sqrt(100,000,000 + 400,000,000) = sqrt(500,000,000) = 22,360.68 \u03a9\n\nThe angle of the denominator is tan\u207b\u00b9(-20,000 / 10,000) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-2) \u2248 -63.43\u00b0\n\nSo, V_out1 = V_in \u00d7 (10,000 / 22,360.68) \u2220 (0\u00b0 - (-63.43\u00b0)) = V_in \u00d7 0.4472 \u2220 63.43\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the voltage gain for one stage is 0.4472, and the phase shift is 63.43\u00b0.\n\nSince there are four identical stages in series, the total voltage gain is (0.4472)^4 = 0.0417\n\nAnd the total phase shift is 4 \u00d7 63.43\u00b0 = 253.72\u00b0\n\nHowever, since phase angles are periodic with 360\u00b0, 253.72\u00b0 is the same as 253.72\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = -106.28\u00b0\n\nBut since the question asks for the phase of V_out, and V_in is at 0\u00b0, the phase difference is -106.28\u00b0, which can also be expressed as +253.72\u00b0.\n\nBut typically, phase differences are expressed within -180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0.\n\nSo, the phase of V_out is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0 relative to V_in.\n\nBut I need to check if this approach is valid, considering that each stage may load the previous one.\n\nIn reality, each stage affects the others due to the parallel connections.\n\nTherefore, the assumption of independent stages may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire network as a single impedance and find the transfer function accordingly.\n\nLet me try to find the input impedance seen by V_in.\n\nFor a ladder network with identical stages, the input impedance Z_in can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet Z be the impedance of one stage, then:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z_in)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship that can be solved for Z_in.\n\nRearranging:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z_in)\n\nMultiply both sides by (Z + Z_in):\n\nZ_in (Z + Z_in) = Z (Z + Z_in) + Z\n\nExpand:\n\nZ_in Z + Z_in^2 = Z^2 + Z Z_in + Z\n\nSimplify:\n\nZ_in^2 = Z^2 + Z\n\nSo, Z_in^2 = Z^2 + Z\n\nTherefore, Z_in = sqrt(Z^2 + Z)\n\nBut this doesn't seem right, as Z is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the concept of continued fractions to find Z_in.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the input impedance of a ladder network with n identical stages.\n\nThe general formula for the input impedance Z_in of a ladder network with n identical stages is:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + ... (Z + Z / (Z + Z))...))\n\nThis is a continued fraction.\n\nFor large n, this can be approximated, but for n=4, it's manageable.\n\nLet me denote Z_stage = Z, then:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + Z)))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost fraction:\n\nZ1 = Z + Z\n\nZ2 = Z + Z / Z1 = Z + Z / (Z + Z) = Z + Z / (2Z) = Z + 0.5Z = 1.5Z\n\nZ3 = Z + Z / Z2 = Z + Z / 1.5Z = Z + (2/3)Z = (5/3)Z\n\nZ4 = Z + Z / Z3 = Z + Z / ((5/3)Z) = Z + (3/5)Z = (8/5)Z\n\nSo, Z_in = (8/5)Z\n\nBut this assumes Z is real, which it's not in this case, since Z includes a capacitive reactance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps this approach isn't accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of chain parameters or ABCD matrices to model each stage and then multiply them together to get the overall transfer function.\n\nHowever, that might be beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach of considering each stage independently and multiplying their transfer functions.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that each stage introduces a phase shift of approximately 63.43\u00b0, and with four stages, the total phase shift is 253.72\u00b0, which is equivalent to -106.28\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the phase of V_out relative to V_in is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0.\n\nBut to confirm this, I need to verify if the assumption of independent stages is valid.\n\nGiven that each stage is loaded by the next stage, this assumption may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a high-pass filter and find its phase response.\n\nFor a high-pass filter, the phase shift approaches 90\u00b0 at high frequencies and 0\u00b0 at low frequencies.\n\nGiven that \u03c9 = 100 rad/s, and the time constant \u03c4 = RC = (10,000 \u03a9)(0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 F) = 5 \u00d7 10^-3 s, then the cutoff frequency \u03c9_c = 1/\u03c4 = 200 rad/s.\n\nSince \u03c9 = 100 rad/s < \u03c9_c = 200 rad/s, the circuit is operating in the transition region.\n\nFor a single RC high-pass filter, the phase shift is \u03c6 = tan\u207b\u00b9(-\u03c9\u03c4) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-0.5) \u2248 -26.57\u00b0\n\nBut in this case, there are four stages, so the total phase shift would be approximately 4 \u00d7 (-26.57\u00b0) = -106.28\u00b0, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the phase of V_out is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0 relative to V_in.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options"

j4 \u03a9.\n\nNow, since there are four such stages in series, the total impedance is:\n\nZ_total = 4 \u00d7 Z_stage = 4 \u00d7 (8 - j4) = 32 - j16 \u03a9\n\nNow, the voltage divider formula can be used to find V_out in terms of V_in:\n\nV_out = V_in \u00d7 (Z_load)/(Z_total + Z_load)\n\nBut in this case, if the last stage is connected directly to V_out, and assuming no load is connected beyond that, perhaps V_out is just across the last stage.\n\nWait, the diagram isn't provided, but from the description, it seems like it's a ladder network with four stages in series, and V_out is taken across the last stage.\n\nAssuming that, then V_out would be V_in multiplied by the voltage divider ratio for the last stage, considering the previous stages as part of the total impedance.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to consider the entire network as a voltage divider, with Z_total in series with V_in.\n\nWait, no, in a ladder network, each stage affects the previous one, so it's not just a simple series connection.\n\nAlternatively, since all stages are identical, perhaps there's a pattern or a recursive relationship that can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the transfer function of one stage and then raise it to the fourth power, assuming the stages are identical and connected in series.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the voltage gain of one stage, then apply it four times.\n\nThe voltage gain A_v for one RC parallel combination is:\n\nA_v = V_out / V_in = Z_parallel / (Z_parallel + Z)\n\nWait, I need to be careful here.\n\nActually, in a ladder network, each stage can be modeled, and the overall transfer function can be found by multiplying the transfer functions of each stage, assuming they are independent, which they are not due to loading effects.\n\nBut for now, let's consider each stage individually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the concept of chain matrices or ABCD parameters to model each stage and then multiply them together to get the overall transfer function.\n\nHowever, that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the input impedance seen by V_in and then find V_out accordingly.\n\nBut I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the entire ladder network.\n\nEach stage consists of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor, and these stages are connected in series.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can find the total impedance of the network and then find V_out using the voltage divider formula.\n\nFrom earlier, I calculated Z_total = 32 - j16 \u03a9 for four stages.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate, as each stage may load the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of driving point impedance for a ladder network.\n\nFor a ladder network with identical stages, the total impedance can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the total impedance of a ladder network.\n\nIf Z is the impedance of one stage, then the total impedance Z_total for n stages is:\n\nZ_total = Z + Z_total / (Z + Z_total)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship.\n\nBut in this case, since all stages are identical, perhaps there's a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of continued fractions or some iterative approach.\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a low-pass filter and find its transfer function.\n\nBut given the time constraints, maybe I should proceed with the earlier calculation and see if it makes sense.\n\nAssuming that Z_total = 32 - j16 \u03a9 for four stages, then the voltage gain A_v = V_out / V_in = Z_total / (Z_total + R_source)\n\nBut I don't know the source resistance R_source. Assuming it's zero, then A_v = Z_total / Z_total = 1, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps V_out is taken across the last stage, so V_out = V_in \u00d7 (Z_stage)^4 / (Z_total + Z_stage)^4\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a voltage divider with Z_total in series with V_in, and V_out is across Z_stage.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Th\u00e9venin equivalence at each stage.\n\nBut I need to find a simpler way.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I should consider using phasors and complex impedances to model the circuit.\n\nLet me try to find the transfer function of one stage and then apply it four times, assuming no loading effects.\n\nFor one stage:\n\nV_out1 = V_in \u00d7 Z_R / (Z_R + Z_C)\n\nGiven Z_R = 10,000 \u03a9 and Z_C = -j20,000 \u03a9,\n\nV_out1 = V_in \u00d7 (10,000) / (10,000 - j20,000)\n\nTo simplify, let's compute the magnitude and phase of the denominator.\n\nFirst, find the magnitude of the denominator:\n\n|10,000 - j20,000| = sqrt(10,000^2 + (-20,000)^2) = sqrt(100,000,000 + 400,000,000) = sqrt(500,000,000) = 22,360.68 \u03a9\n\nThe angle of the denominator is tan\u207b\u00b9(-20,000 / 10,000) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-2) \u2248 -63.43\u00b0\n\nSo, V_out1 = V_in \u00d7 (10,000 / 22,360.68) \u2220 (0\u00b0 - (-63.43\u00b0)) = V_in \u00d7 0.4472 \u2220 63.43\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the voltage gain for one stage is 0.4472, and the phase shift is 63.43\u00b0.\n\nSince there are four identical stages in series, the total voltage gain is (0.4472)^4 = 0.0417\n\nAnd the total phase shift is 4 \u00d7 63.43\u00b0 = 253.72\u00b0\n\nHowever, since phase angles are periodic with 360\u00b0, 253.72\u00b0 is the same as 253.72\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = -106.28\u00b0\n\nBut since the question asks for the phase of V_out, and V_in is at 0\u00b0, the phase difference is -106.28\u00b0, which can also be expressed as +253.72\u00b0.\n\nBut typically, phase differences are expressed within -180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0.\n\nSo, the phase of V_out is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0 relative to V_in.\n\nBut I need to check if this approach is valid, considering that each stage may load the previous one.\n\nIn reality, each stage affects the others due to the parallel connections.\n\nTherefore, the assumption of independent stages may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire network as a single impedance and find the transfer function accordingly.\n\nLet me try to find the input impedance seen by V_in.\n\nFor a ladder network with identical stages, the input impedance Z_in can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet Z be the impedance of one stage, then:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z_in)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship that can be solved for Z_in.\n\nRearranging:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z_in)\n\nMultiply both sides by (Z + Z_in):\n\nZ_in (Z + Z_in) = Z (Z + Z_in) + Z\n\nExpand:\n\nZ_in Z + Z_in^2 = Z^2 + Z Z_in + Z\n\nSimplify:\n\nZ_in^2 = Z^2 + Z\n\nSo, Z_in^2 = Z^2 + Z\n\nTherefore, Z_in = sqrt(Z^2 + Z)\n\nBut this doesn't seem right, as Z is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the concept of continued fractions to find Z_in.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the input impedance of a ladder network with n identical stages.\n\nThe general formula for the input impedance Z_in of a ladder network with n identical stages is:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + ... (Z + Z / (Z + Z))...))\n\nThis is a continued fraction.\n\nFor large n, this can be approximated, but for n=4, it's manageable.\n\nLet me denote Z_stage = Z, then:\n\nZ_in = Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + Z / (Z + Z)))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost fraction:\n\nZ1 = Z + Z\n\nZ2 = Z + Z / Z1 = Z + Z / (Z + Z) = Z + Z / (2Z) = Z + 0.5Z = 1.5Z\n\nZ3 = Z + Z / Z2 = Z + Z / 1.5Z = Z + (2/3)Z = (5/3)Z\n\nZ4 = Z + Z / Z3 = Z + Z / ((5/3)Z) = Z + (3/5)Z = (8/5)Z\n\nSo, Z_in = (8/5)Z\n\nBut this assumes Z is real, which it's not in this case, since Z includes a capacitive reactance.\n\nGiven that, perhaps this approach isn't accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of chain parameters or ABCD matrices to model each stage and then multiply them together to get the overall transfer function.\n\nHowever, that might be beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach of considering each stage independently and multiplying their transfer functions.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that each stage introduces a phase shift of approximately 63.43\u00b0, and with four stages, the total phase shift is 253.72\u00b0, which is equivalent to -106.28\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the phase of V_out relative to V_in is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0.\n\nBut to confirm this, I need to verify if the assumption of independent stages is valid.\n\nGiven that each stage is loaded by the next stage, this assumption may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the network as a high-pass filter and find its phase response.\n\nFor a high-pass filter, the phase shift approaches 90\u00b0 at high frequencies and 0\u00b0 at low frequencies.\n\nGiven that \u03c9 = 100 rad/s, and the time constant \u03c4 = RC = (10,000 \u03a9)(0.5 \u00d7 10^-6 F) = 5 \u00d7 10^-3 s, then the cutoff frequency \u03c9_c = 1/\u03c4 = 200 rad/s.\n\nSince \u03c9 = 100 rad/s < \u03c9_c = 200 rad/s, the circuit is operating in the transition region.\n\nFor a single RC high-pass filter, the phase shift is \u03c6 = tan\u207b\u00b9(-\u03c9\u03c4) = tan\u207b\u00b9(-0.5) \u2248 -26.57\u00b0\n\nBut in this case, there are four stages, so the total phase shift would be approximately 4 \u00d7 (-26.57\u00b0) = -106.28\u00b0, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the phase of V_out is -106.28\u00b0 or +253.72\u00b0 relative to V_in.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options",
