                    "text": "So I'm trying to find the amplitude of the phasor voltage \\( V_C \\) in this circuit. Let's see, it's an AC circuit with two voltage sources and three impedances connected in a loop. The voltages are given in phasor form, and the impedances have their magnitudes and angles specified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit configuration. There are two voltage sources: one is 100 V at 0 degrees, and the other is 50 V at 90 degrees. These are connected in a loop with impedances \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\), which have values of 5 ohms at 0 degrees, 10 ohms at 36.9 degrees, and 20 ohms at 53.1 degrees, respectively.\n\nI need to find the voltage across \\( Z_3 \\), which is \\( V_C \\). To do that, I can use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltages around any closed loop is zero.\n\nBut since we're dealing with phasors, I need to handle complex numbers. Let's first convert the impedances and voltages into their complex forms.\n\nStarting with the impedances:\n\n- \\( Z_1 = 5 \\angle 0^\\circ = 5 + j0 \\) ohms\n\n- \\( Z_2 = 10 \\angle 36.9^\\circ \\). To find the rectangular form, I can use:\n\n\\[\nZ_2 = 10 \\cos(36.9^\\circ) + j \\cdot 10 \\sin(36.9^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nI know that \\( \\cos(36.9^\\circ) = 0.8 \\) and \\( \\sin(36.9^\\circ) = 0.6 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nZ_2 = 10 \\times 0.8 + j \\times 10 \\times 0.6 = 8 + j6 \\text{ ohms}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( Z_3 = 20 \\angle 53.1^\\circ \\). Again, using cosine and sine:\n\n\\[\nZ_3 = 20 \\cos(53.1^\\circ) + j \\cdot 20 \\sin(53.1^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nKnowing that \\( \\cos(53.1^\\circ) = 0.6 \\) and \\( \\sin(53.1^\\circ) = 0.8 \\):\n\n\\[\nZ_3 = 20 \\times 0.6 + j \\times 20 \\times 0.8 = 12 + j16 \\text{ ohms}\n\\]\n\nNow, the voltage sources:\n\n- \\( V_1 = 100 \\angle 0^\\circ = 100 + j0 \\) V\n\n- \\( V_2 = 50 \\angle 90^\\circ = 0 + j50 \\) V\n\nNext, I need to apply KVL around the loop. But first, I should define the direction of the currents through each component. From the diagram, it seems like there are currents \\( I_1 \\), \\( I_2 \\), and \\( I_3 \\) flowing through \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\), respectively.\n\nWait, actually, in the diagram, there are current arrows labeled \\( I_1 \\), \\( I_2 \\), and \\( I_3 \\) flowing through \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\), respectively. So, it looks like there are three separate paths, but in reality, it's a loop with a common node \\( n_1 \\).\n\nLet me try to visualize the circuit again. There are two voltage sources connected in a loop with three impedances. Maybe it's a Wheatstone bridge or something similar, but according to the description, it's a loop.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use mesh analysis. Since it's a single loop, mesh analysis simplifies to just applying KVL around the loop.\n\nLet's assume a clockwise current \\( I \\) around the loop and apply KVL:\n\n\\[\n\\sum V = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - V_C - V_{Z2} - V_{Z1} = 0\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the voltages across the impedances depend on the current direction. Since I assumed clockwise current, the voltage drops across \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\) would be in the direction of the current.\n\nBut looking back at the diagram, it seems that \\( I_1 \\), \\( I_2 \\), and \\( I_3 \\) are defined in certain directions. Maybe I need to consider nodal analysis instead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use superposition, considering each voltage source separately and then summing their effects.\n\nLet me try the superposition method. First, I'll consider the 100 V source acting alone, with the 50 V source set to zero (short-circuit since it's a voltage source).\n\nSo, with only the 100 V source:\n\nThe circuit becomes a single loop with \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\) in series.\n\nThe total impedance is:\n\n\\[\nZ_{\\text{total}} = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 = (5 + j0) + (8 + j6) + (12 + j16) = 25 + j22 \\text{ ohms}\n\\]\n\nThe current \\( I \\) due to the 100 V source is:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{V_1}{Z_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{100 + j0}{25 + j22}\n\\]\n\nTo divide complex numbers, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100 + j0)(25 - j22)}{(25 + j22)(25 - j22)} = \\frac{2500 - j2200 + j2200 - j^2 2200}{25^2 + 22^2} = \\frac{2500 + 2200}{625 + 484} = \\frac{4700}{1109} \\approx 4.235 \\text{ A}\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100)(25) + (100)(22)j + (0)(25)j + (0)(-22)j^2}{25^2 + 22^2} = \\frac{2500 + 2200j + 0j + 0}{625 + 484} = \\frac{2500 + 2200j}{1109} \\approx 2.255 + j1.983 \\text{ A}\n\\]\n\nOops, I forgot that j^2 is -1, but in this case, there was no j^2 term in the numerator. My bad.\n\nSo, \\( I \\approx 2.255 + j1.983 \\) A.\n\nNow, the voltage across \\( Z_3 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV_C = I \\times Z_3 = (2.255 + j1.983)(12 + j16)\n\\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n(2.255)(12) = 27.06 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(2.255)(16) = 36.08 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1.983)(12) = 23.796 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1.983)(16) = 31.728 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nNow, assemble the complex number:\n\n\\[\nV_C = (27.06 + 23.796) + j(36.08 + 31.728) = 50.856 + j67.808 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nTo find the amplitude, I need the magnitude of this phasor:\n\n\\[\n|V_C| = \\sqrt{(50.856)^2 + (67.808)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{2586.24 + 4597.12} \\approx \\sqrt{7183.36} \\approx 84.75 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that's the contribution from the 100 V source.\n\nNow, let's consider the 50 V source acting alone, with the 100 V source set to zero (short-circuit).\n\nSo, the circuit now has the 50 V source connected in series with \\( Z_2 \\) and \\( Z_3 \\), but wait, looking back at the diagram, the 50 V source is connected in parallel with \\( Z_2 \\) and \\( Z_3 \\).\n\nWait, actually, in the diagram, the 50 V source is connected in parallel with \\( Z_2 \\) and \\( Z_3 \\), but I need to be careful here.\n\nPerhaps superposition isn't the easiest way to go. Maybe I should stick with mesh analysis.\n\nLet me try mesh analysis again.\n\nAssuming a clockwise current \\( I \\) around the loop, the KVL equation would be:\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - V_{Z1} - V_{Z2} - V_{Z3} = 0\n\\]\n\nExpressed in terms of complex impedances:\n\n\\[\n100 + j0 + 0 + j50 - (I \\times Z_1 + I \\times Z_2 + I \\times Z_3) = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, no. The voltage drops across the impedances are in phase with the current, so:\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - I \\times Z_1 - I \\times Z_2 - I \\times Z_3 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut actually, the voltage across each impedance is \\( I \\times Z \\), assuming current flows through them in the direction of the loop.\n\nWait, in mesh analysis, the voltage drops across each impedance are in the direction of the mesh current.\n\nSo, for a single mesh, the KVL equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum V_{\\text{sources}} - \\sum V_{\\text{drops}} = 0\n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - I \\times (Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n100 + j0 + 0 + j50 - I \\times (5 + j0 + 8 + j6 + 12 + j16) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n100 + j50 - I \\times (25 + j22) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{100 + j50}{25 + j22}\n\\]\n\nAgain, to divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100 + j50)(25 - j22)}{(25 + j22)(25 - j22)} = \\frac{2500 - j2200 + j50 \\times 25 - j50 \\times j22}{625 + 484} = \\frac{2500 - j2200 + j1250 + 1100}{1109} = \\frac{3600 + j(-2200 + 1250)}{1109} = \\frac{3600 - j950}{1109} \\approx 3.246 - j0.856 \\text{ A}\n\\]\n\nNow, the voltage across \\( Z_3 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV_C = I \\times Z_3 = (3.246 - j0.856)(12 + j16)\n\\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n(3.246)(12) = 38.952 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3.246)(16) = 51.936 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(-0.856)(12) = -10.272 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(-0.856)(16) = -13.696 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nAssemble the complex number:\n\n\\[\nV_C = (38.952 - 10.272) + j(51.936 - 13.696) = 28.68 + j38.24 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nThe magnitude is:\n\n\\[\n|V_C| = \\sqrt{(28.68)^2 + (38.24)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{823.0464 + 1460.89} \\approx \\sqrt{2283.9364} \\approx 47.79 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the total \\( V_C \\), I need to add the contributions from both sources.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that superposition might not be straightforward here because of the parallel connections. Maybe I should consider the total current and then find \\( V_C \\) directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use nodal analysis.\n\nLet me try nodal analysis.\n\nDefine node \\( n_1 \\) as the common node between \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\). Let's assume the bottom node is ground.\n\nSo, the voltage at node \\( n_1 \\) is \\( V_n \\), and we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum I_{\\text{into node}} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe currents through each impedance are:\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\frac{V_1 - V_n}{Z_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI_2 = \\frac{V_n - V_2}{Z_2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI_3 = \\frac{V_n}{Z_3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the nodal equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_1 - V_n}{Z_1} + \\frac{V_n - V_2}{Z_2} + \\frac{V_n}{Z_3} = 0\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - V_n}{5 + j0} + \\frac{V_n - 50 \\angle 90^\\circ}{8 + j6} + \\frac{V_n}{12 + j16} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis seems complicated to solve directly. Maybe I can express all voltages in complex form.\n\nFirst, express \\( V_n \\) as \\( A + jB \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are real numbers.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - A - jB}{5} + \\frac{(A + jB) - 0 - j50}{8 + j6} + \\frac{A + jB}{12 + j16} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - A - jB}{5} = 20 - 0.2A - 0.2jB\n\\]\n\nSecond term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + j(B - 50)}{8 + j6}\n\\]\n\nThird term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + jB}{12 + j16}\n\\]\n\nThis still looks messy.

The voltage drops across the impedances are in phase with the current, so:\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - I \\times Z_1 - I \\times Z_2 - I \\times Z_3 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut actually, the voltage across each impedance is \\( I \\times Z \\), assuming current flows through them in the direction of the loop.\n\nWait, in mesh analysis, the voltage drops across each impedance are in the direction of the mesh current.\n\nSo, for a single mesh, the KVL equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum V_{\\text{sources}} - \\sum V_{\\text{drops}} = 0\n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\[\nV_1 + V_2 - I \\times (Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n100 + j0 + 0 + j50 - I \\times (5 + j0 + 8 + j6 + 12 + j16) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n100 + j50 - I \\times (25 + j22) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{100 + j50}{25 + j22}\n\\]\n\nAgain, to divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[\nI = \\frac{(100 + j50)(25 - j22)}{(25 + j22)(25 - j22)} = \\frac{2500 - j2200 + j50 \\times 25 - j50 \\times j22}{625 + 484} = \\frac{2500 - j2200 + j1250 + 1100}{1109} = \\frac{3600 + j(-2200 + 1250)}{1109} = \\frac{3600 - j950}{1109} \\approx 3.246 - j0.856 \\text{ A}\n\\]\n\nNow, the voltage across \\( Z_3 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nV_C = I \\times Z_3 = (3.246 - j0.856)(12 + j16)\n\\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n(3.246)(12) = 38.952 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(3.246)(16) = 51.936 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(-0.856)(12) = -10.272 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(-0.856)(16) = -13.696 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nAssemble the complex number:\n\n\\[\nV_C = (38.952 - 10.272) + j(51.936 - 13.696) = 28.68 + j38.24 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nThe magnitude is:\n\n\\[\n|V_C| = \\sqrt{(28.68)^2 + (38.24)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{823.0464 + 1460.89} \\approx \\sqrt{2283.9364} \\approx 47.79 \\text{ V}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the total \\( V_C \\), I need to add the contributions from both sources.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that superposition might not be straightforward here because of the parallel connections. Maybe I should consider the total current and then find \\( V_C \\) directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use nodal analysis.\n\nLet me try nodal analysis.\n\nDefine node \\( n_1 \\) as the common node between \\( Z_1 \\), \\( Z_2 \\), and \\( Z_3 \\). Let's assume the bottom node is ground.\n\nSo, the voltage at node \\( n_1 \\) is \\( V_n \\), and we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum I_{\\text{into node}} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe currents through each impedance are:\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\frac{V_1 - V_n}{Z_1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI_2 = \\frac{V_n - V_2}{Z_2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI_3 = \\frac{V_n}{Z_3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the nodal equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_1 - V_n}{Z_1} + \\frac{V_n - V_2}{Z_2} + \\frac{V_n}{Z_3} = 0\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - V_n}{5 + j0} + \\frac{V_n - 50 \\angle 90^\\circ}{8 + j6} + \\frac{V_n}{12 + j16} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis seems complicated to solve directly. Maybe I can express all voltages in complex form.\n\nFirst, express \\( V_n \\) as \\( A + jB \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are real numbers.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - A - jB}{5} + \\frac{(A + jB) - 0 - j50}{8 + j6} + \\frac{A + jB}{12 + j16} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 - A - jB}{5} = 20 - 0.2A - 0.2jB\n\\]\n\nSecond term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + j(B - 50)}{8 + j6}\n\\]\n\nThird term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A + jB}{12 + j16}\n\\]\n\nThis still looks messy. Maybe I can combine the real and imaginary parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the admittance approach.\n\nLet me find the admittances \\( Y_1 = 1/Z_1 \\), \\( Y_2 = 1/Z_2 \\), and \\( Y_3 = 1/Z_3 \\).\n\nFirst,\n\n\\[\nY_1 = \\frac{1}{5 + j0} = 0.2 - j0 \\text{ mhos}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nY_2 = \\frac{1}{8 + j6} = \\frac{8 - j6}{8^2 + 6^2} = \\frac{8 - j6}{100} = 0.08 - j0.06 \\text{ mhos}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nY_3 = \\frac{1}{12 + j16} = \\frac{12 - j16}{12^2 + 16^2} = \\frac{12 - j16}{400} = 0.03 - j0.04 \\text{ mhos}\n\\]\n\nNow, the nodal equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3)V_n - Y_1 V_1 - Y_2 V_2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nV_n = \\frac{Y_1 V_1 + Y_2 V_2}{Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( Y_1 + Y_2 + Y_3 \\):\n\n\\[\n0.2 - j0 + 0.08 - j0.06 + 0.03 - j0.04 = 0.31 - j0.1 \\text{ mhos}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( Y_1 V_1 + Y_2 V_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0.2 - j0)(100 + j0) + (0.08 - j0.06)(0 + j50) = (20 + j0) + (0 - j4 + j0.06 \\times 50) = 20 - j4 + j3 = 20",
