                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. I need to find the Fourier series of a given waveform and then find the sum of the first four terms of that series at t = 2. Alright, let's start by understanding the waveform.\n\nLooking at the graph, it's a function f(t) plotted against time t. The scale on the t-axis goes from -5 to 5, and f(t) ranges from -1 to 1. There's a step-like behavior here, with some flat parts and sharp turns. Since it's a periodic function, I assume it repeats outside the shown interval.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the period of the function. From the graph, it looks like the pattern repeats every 6 units of time. Let's confirm that. Starting from t = 0:\n\n- From t = 0 to t = 1, f(t) increases linearly from 0 to 1.\n\n- From t = 1 to t = 3, f(t) is flat at 1.\n\n- From t = 3 to t = 4, f(t) decreases linearly from 1 to 0.\n\n- From t = 4 to t = 5, f(t) decreases linearly from 0 to -1.\n\nThen, it seems to continue decreasing from t = 5 to t = 6, but since the graph only goes up to t = 5, I'll assume it repeats every 6 units.\n\nWait, but looking closer, at t = -1, f(t) is at -1, and it increases to t = 0, f(t) = 0. So from t = -1 to t = 0, f(t) increases from -1 to 0. And then from t = 0 to t = 1, it increases from 0 to 1. So it's symmetric in some way.\n\nActually, the function seems to be periodic with period 6, extending it beyond t = 5 would just repeat the pattern.\n\nNow, to find the Fourier series, I need to express f(t) as a sum of sines and cosines. For a general periodic function with period T, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = a0 + \u03a3 [an cos(n\u03c9t) + bn sin(n\u03c9t)]\n\nwhere \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T, and n is an integer starting from 1.\n\nFirst, I need to find the coefficients a0, an, and bn.\n\na0 is the average value of the function over one period. So,\n\na0 = (1/T) \u222b f(t) dt from 0 to T.\n\nBut since the function is odd or even? Looking at the graph, f(t) is an odd function because f(-t) = -f(t). For example, f(1) = 1, f(-1) = -1, and so on.\n\nWait, is it odd? Let's check:\n\n- At t = 0, f(0) = 0\n\n- At t = 1, f(1) = 1\n\n- At t = -1, f(-1) = -1\n\n- At t = 2, f(2) = 1\n\n- At t = -2, f(-2) = -1\n\n- At t = 3, f(3) = 1\n\n- At t = -3, f(-3) = -1\n\nYes, it seems f(t) = -f(-t), so it's an odd function.\n\nFor odd functions, a0 = 0 and an = 0, because cos is even and the product of odd and even is odd, which integrates to zero over a symmetric interval.\n\nSo, for this odd function, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 bn sin(n\u03c9t)\n\nNow, I need to find bn.\n\nbn = (2/T) \u222b f(t) sin(n\u03c9t) dt from 0 to T.\n\nGiven T = 6, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/6 = \u03c0/3, so n\u03c9 = n\u03c0/3.\n\nNow, let's set up the integral for bn.\n\nbn = (2/6) \u222b f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 6.\n\nBut since f(t) is defined piecewise, I need to split the integral over the intervals where f(t) is linear.\n\nSo, bn = (1/3) [\u222b from 0 to 1 of f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 1 to 3 of f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 3 to 4 of f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 4 to 5 of f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 5 to 6 of f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt]\n\nWait, but the function beyond t = 5 isn't shown, but since it's periodic with period 6, f(t) from t = 5 to t = 6 is the same as from t = -1 to t = 0.\n\nLooking back at the graph:\n\n- From t = -1 to t = 0, f(t) increases from -1 to 0.\n\n- From t = 0 to t = 1, f(t) increases from 0 to 1.\n\n- From t = 1 to t = 3, f(t) is flat at 1.\n\n- From t = 3 to t = 4, f(t) decreases from 1 to 0.\n\n- From t = 4 to t = 5, f(t) decreases from 0 to -1.\n\n- From t = 5 to t = 6, f(t) decreases from -1 to -2, but looking at the graph, it seems to go down to -1 again. Maybe it's -1 to -2, but I'm not sure. Assuming it repeats every 6 units, from t = 5 to t = 6, f(t) should be the same as from t = -1 to t = 0, which is increasing from -1 to 0.\n\nWait, but the graph only goes up to t = 5, and f(t) is extending down to -1 at t = 5, and presumably continues to -2 at t = 6, but that doesn't make sense if it's periodic with period 6. Maybe I misread the graph.\n\nLooking again, at t = 5, f(t) is at -1, and it seems to be continuing downward, but since it's periodic with period 6, t = 6 should be the same as t = 0, which is 0. So from t = 5 to t = 6, f(t) should increase from -1 to 0.\n\nTherefore, the function is:\n\n- From t = -1 to t = 0: f(t) = t + 1 (since at t = -1, f = -1 +1 = 0, and at t = 0, f = 0 +1 =1)\n\n- From t = 0 to t = 1: f(t) = t (from 0 to 1)\n\n- From t = 1 to t = 3: f(t) =1 (flat)\n\n- From t = 3 to t = 4: f(t) = -t +7 (at t=3, f=1; at t=4, f=0)\n\n- From t = 4 to t = 5: f(t) = -t +5 (at t=4, f=0; at t=5, f=-1)\n\n- From t = 5 to t = 6: f(t) = t -5 (from -1 to 0)\n\nWait, but t = 6 should be the same as t = 0, which is 0, but according to this, f(t) = t -5 at t=6 is f=1, which should be f=0. So my equation is wrong.\n\nLet me recast the function definitions:\n\n- For t from -1 to 0: f(t) = t +1\n\n- For t from 0 to 1: f(t) = t\n\n- For t from 1 to 3: f(t) =1\n\n- For t from 3 to 4: f(t) = -t +7\n\n- For t from 4 to 5: f(t) = -t +5\n\n- For t from 5 to 6: f(t) = t -5\n\nBut at t=6, f(t) =6-5=1, which should be equal to f(0)=0, which is inconsistent. Therefore, the periodicity might be different, or perhaps the function isn't perfectly periodic in the drawn interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is defined over one period from t=0 to t=6, and repeats outside that interval.\n\nGiven that, let's assume the function is:\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nAnd it repeats every 6 units.\n\nNow, at t=6, f(t)=6-5=1, which should equal f(0)=0, but it's not. So perhaps the function is not perfectly periodic, or there's an error in the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is:\n\n- From t=-1 to t=0: f(t)=t+1\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nBut again, f(6)=1 \u2260 f(0)=0, which suggests it's not strictly periodic with period 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is defined over one period from t=0 to t=6, and outside that, it repeats, but with f(t+6)=f(t), meaning f(6)=f(0)=0.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the last segment from t=5 to t=6 is f(t)=t-5, and f(6)=1, which doesn't match f(0)=0, so perhaps the function isn't continuous, and that's acceptable for Fourier series as long as we handle the discontinuities correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is defined over one period from t=-3 to t=3, and repeats every 6 units.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the function as defined from t=-3 to t=3, and then periodic with period 6.\n\nLooking at the graph, from t=-3 to t=3:\n\n- From t=-3 to t=-1: f(t)=-1\n\n- From t=-1 to t=0: f(t)=t+1\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\nAnd then from t=3 to t=5:\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nBut again, f(6)=1 \u2260 f(0)=0, which suggests a discontinuity at t=0 and t=6.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the function is odd and periodic with period 6, and the discontinuities are handled by the Fourier series.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with T=6, and calculate bn for the given f(t).\n\nSo, bn = (2/6) \u222b f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 6.\n\nBut since f(t) is piecewise, I need to split the integral into parts where f(t) is linear.\n\nGiven the function definitions:\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nSo,\n\nbn = (1/3) [ \u222b from 0 to 1 of t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 1 to 3 of 1 sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 3 to 4 of (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 4 to 5 of (-t+5) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 5 to 6 of (t-5) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt ]\n\nThis looks complicated, but I can calculate each integral separately.\n\nFirst, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\nLet me set u = n\u03c0t/3, so du/dt = n\u03c0/3.\n\nThen t = (3u)/(n\u03c0)\n\nSo dt = 3/(n\u03c0) du\n\nTherefore, \u222b t sin(u) dt = \u222b (3u)/(n\u03c0) sin(u) * 3/(n\u03c0) du = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) \u222b u sin(u) du\n\nNow, \u222b u sin(u) du = -u cos(u) + sin(u) + c\n\nSo, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ -u cos(u) + sin(u) ] + c\n\nSubstituting back u = n\u03c0t/3:\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the substitution.\n\nLet me try integrating t sin(n\u03c0t/3) directly.\n\nLet me set v = n\u03c0t/3, so dv/dt = n\u03c0/3.\n\nThen t = (3v)/(n\u03c0)\n\nAnd dt = 3/(n\u03c0) dv\n\nSo \u222b t sin(v) dt = \u222b (3v)/(n\u03c0) sin(v) * 3/(n\u03c0) dv = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) \u222b v sin(v) dv\n\nNow, \u222b v sin(v) dv = -v cos(v) + sin(v) + c\n\nSo, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ -v cos(v) + sin(v) ] + c\n\nSubstituting back v = n\u03c0t/3:\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, evaluating from t=0 to t=1:\n\nAt t=1:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ -1 cos(n\u03c0/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0/3) ]\n\nAt t=0:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ 0 - 0 ] = 0\n\nSo, the integral from 0 to 1 is:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ - cos(n\u03c0/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0/3) ]\n\nSimilarly, the next integral is from t=1 to t=3 of 1 sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\n\u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + c\n\nEvaluating from t=1 to t=3:\n\nAt t=3: -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0) = -(3/n\u03c0) (-1)^n\n\nAt t=1: -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0/3) = -(3/n\u03c0) (1/2)\n\nSo, the integral is:\n\n-(3/n\u03c0) [ -(-1)^n - (1/2) ] = (3/n\u03c0) [ (1/2) + (-1)^n ]\n\nNext, integral from t=3 to t=4 of (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\nLet's expand:\n\n\u222b (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = -\u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + 7 \u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt\n\nWe already have \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from above.\n\nSo, -\u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = - [ (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] ]\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ]\n\nAnd 7 \u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = 7 * -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3) = -(21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\nSo, combined:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0t/3) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\nNow, evaluating from t=3 to t=4:\n\nAt t=4:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) *4 cos(4n\u03c0/3) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(4n\u03c0/3) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(4n\u03c0/3)\n\nAt t=3:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) *3 cos(n\u03c0) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0"

So from t = 5 to t = 6, f(t) should increase from -1 to 0.\n\nTherefore, the function is:\n\n- From t = -1 to t = 0: f(t) = t + 1 (since at t = -1, f = -1 +1 = 0, and at t = 0, f = 0 +1 =1)\n\n- From t = 0 to t = 1: f(t) = t (from 0 to 1)\n\n- From t = 1 to t = 3: f(t) =1 (flat)\n\n- From t = 3 to t = 4: f(t) = -t +7 (at t=3, f=1; at t=4, f=0)\n\n- From t = 4 to t = 5: f(t) = -t +5 (at t=4, f=0; at t=5, f=-1)\n\n- From t = 5 to t = 6: f(t) = t -5 (from -1 to 0)\n\nWait, but t = 6 should be the same as t = 0, which is 0, but according to this, f(t) = t -5 at t=6 is f=1, which should be f=0. So my equation is wrong.\n\nLet me recast the function definitions:\n\n- For t from -1 to 0: f(t) = t +1\n\n- For t from 0 to 1: f(t) = t\n\n- For t from 1 to 3: f(t) =1\n\n- For t from 3 to 4: f(t) = -t +7\n\n- For t from 4 to 5: f(t) = -t +5\n\n- For t from 5 to 6: f(t) = t -5\n\nBut at t=6, f(t) =6-5=1, which should be equal to f(0)=0, which is inconsistent. Therefore, the periodicity might be different, or perhaps the function isn't perfectly periodic in the drawn interval.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is defined over one period from t=0 to t=6, and repeats outside that interval.\n\nGiven that, let's assume the function is:\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nAnd it repeats every 6 units.\n\nNow, at t=6, f(t)=6-5=1, which should equal f(0)=0, but it's not. So perhaps the function is not perfectly periodic, or there's an error in the definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is:\n\n- From t=-1 to t=0: f(t)=t+1\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nBut again, f(6)=1 \u2260 f(0)=0, which suggests it's not strictly periodic with period 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is defined over one period from t=0 to t=6, and outside that, it repeats, but with f(t+6)=f(t), meaning f(6)=f(0)=0.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the last segment from t=5 to t=6 is f(t)=t-5, and f(6)=1, which doesn't match f(0)=0, so perhaps the function isn't continuous, and that's acceptable for Fourier series as long as we handle the discontinuities correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is defined over one period from t=-3 to t=3, and repeats every 6 units.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider the function as defined from t=-3 to t=3, and then periodic with period 6.\n\nLooking at the graph, from t=-3 to t=3:\n\n- From t=-3 to t=-1: f(t)=-1\n\n- From t=-1 to t=0: f(t)=t+1\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\nAnd then from t=3 to t=5:\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nBut again, f(6)=1 \u2260 f(0)=0, which suggests a discontinuity at t=0 and t=6.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the function is odd and periodic with period 6, and the discontinuities are handled by the Fourier series.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with T=6, and calculate bn for the given f(t).\n\nSo, bn = (2/6) \u222b f(t) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from 0 to 6.\n\nBut since f(t) is piecewise, I need to split the integral into parts where f(t) is linear.\n\nGiven the function definitions:\n\n- From t=0 to t=1: f(t)=t\n\n- From t=1 to t=3: f(t)=1\n\n- From t=3 to t=4: f(t)=-t+7\n\n- From t=4 to t=5: f(t)=-t+5\n\n- From t=5 to t=6: f(t)=t-5\n\nSo,\n\nbn = (1/3) [ \u222b from 0 to 1 of t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 1 to 3 of 1 sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 3 to 4 of (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 4 to 5 of (-t+5) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + \u222b from 5 to 6 of (t-5) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt ]\n\nThis looks complicated, but I can calculate each integral separately.\n\nFirst, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\nLet me set u = n\u03c0t/3, so du/dt = n\u03c0/3.\n\nThen t = (3u)/(n\u03c0)\n\nSo dt = 3/(n\u03c0) du\n\nTherefore, \u222b t sin(u) dt = \u222b (3u)/(n\u03c0) sin(u) * 3/(n\u03c0) du = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) \u222b u sin(u) du\n\nNow, \u222b u sin(u) du = -u cos(u) + sin(u) + c\n\nSo, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ -u cos(u) + sin(u) ] + c\n\nSubstituting back u = n\u03c0t/3:\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the substitution.\n\nLet me try integrating t sin(n\u03c0t/3) directly.\n\nLet me set v = n\u03c0t/3, so dv/dt = n\u03c0/3.\n\nThen t = (3v)/(n\u03c0)\n\nAnd dt = 3/(n\u03c0) dv\n\nSo \u222b t sin(v) dt = \u222b (3v)/(n\u03c0) sin(v) * 3/(n\u03c0) dv = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) \u222b v sin(v) dv\n\nNow, \u222b v sin(v) dv = -v cos(v) + sin(v) + c\n\nSo, \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ -v cos(v) + sin(v) ] + c\n\nSubstituting back v = n\u03c0t/3:\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) [ - (n\u03c0t/3) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] + c\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, evaluating from t=0 to t=1:\n\nAt t=1:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ -1 cos(n\u03c0/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0/3) ]\n\nAt t=0:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ 0 - 0 ] = 0\n\nSo, the integral from 0 to 1 is:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ - cos(n\u03c0/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0/3) ]\n\nSimilarly, the next integral is from t=1 to t=3 of 1 sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\n\u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3) + c\n\nEvaluating from t=1 to t=3:\n\nAt t=3: -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0) = -(3/n\u03c0) (-1)^n\n\nAt t=1: -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0/3) = -(3/n\u03c0) (1/2)\n\nSo, the integral is:\n\n-(3/n\u03c0) [ -(-1)^n - (1/2) ] = (3/n\u03c0) [ (1/2) + (-1)^n ]\n\nNext, integral from t=3 to t=4 of (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt.\n\nLet's expand:\n\n\u222b (-t+7) sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = -\u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt + 7 \u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt\n\nWe already have \u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt from above.\n\nSo, -\u222b t sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = - [ (3)/(n\u03c0) [ -t cos(n\u03c0t/3) + (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] ]\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) [ t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ]\n\nAnd 7 \u222b sin(n\u03c0t/3) dt = 7 * -(3/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3) = -(21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\nSo, combined:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) [ t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (3/n\u03c0) sin(n\u03c0t/3) ] - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\n= (3)/(n\u03c0) t cos(n\u03c0t/3) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0t/3) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0t/3)\n\nNow, evaluating from t=3 to t=4:\n\nAt t=4:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) *4 cos(4n\u03c0/3) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(4n\u03c0/3) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(4n\u03c0/3)\n\nAt t=3:\n\n(3)/(n\u03c0) *3 cos(n\u03c0) - (9)/(n\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0) - (21/n\u03c0) cos(n\u03c0",
