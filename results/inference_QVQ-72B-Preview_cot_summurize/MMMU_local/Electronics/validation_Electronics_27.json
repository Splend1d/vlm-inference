There are some components like capacitors and inductors in the load, and I need to find the phase of \\( I_{cC} \\). The frequency is 60 Hz, C is 5 \u03bcF, and L is 0.56 H. The voltage \\( \\vec{V}_{an} \\) is 390\u222030\u00b0 V rms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the circuit. It's a three-phase balanced system, meaning all three phases have the same voltage magnitude and are 120\u00b0 apart in phase. The load is Y-connected, which means the neutral points are connected together.\n\nLooking at the load, each phase seems to have a capacitor and an inductor in series. So, for phase C, it's C and L in series, and I need to find the current through that path, \\( I_{cC} \\).\n\nGiven that it's a balanced three-phase system, the line voltages are equal in magnitude and 120\u00b0 apart. Since \\( \\vec{V}_{an} \\) is given as 390\u222030\u00b0 V rms, I can determine the phase voltages.\n\nIn a Y-connected load, the phase voltage is equal to the line voltage divided by \u221a3. So, \\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = \\frac{\\vec{V}_{cA}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\nWait, actually, in a Y connection, the phase voltage is equal to the line voltage divided by \u221a3, but I need to be careful with the phase angles.\n\nLet me recall that in a three-phase system, the phase voltages are:\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_a = \\vec{V}_{an} \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_b = \\vec{V}_{an} \\angle -120\u00b0 \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_c = \\vec{V}_{an} \\angle 120\u00b0 \\)\n\nGiven that \\( \\vec{V}_{an} = 390 \\angle 30\u00b0 \\) V rms, then:\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_a = 390 \\angle 30\u00b0 \\) V\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_b = 390 \\angle -90\u00b0 \\) V\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_c = 390 \\angle 150\u00b0 \\) V\n\nBut wait, in a Y connection, the phase voltages are relative to the neutral point N, not directly to each other.\n\nActually, in a Y connection, the phase voltages are:\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{aN} = \\vec{V}_{an} \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{bN} = \\vec{V}_{an} \\angle -120\u00b0 \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = \\vec{V}_{an} \\angle 120\u00b0 \\)\n\nGiven that, \\( \\vec{V}_{an} = 390 \\angle 30\u00b0 \\) V rms, so:\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{aN} = 390 \\angle 30\u00b0 \\) V\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{bN} = 390 \\angle -90\u00b0 \\) V\n\n\\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = 390 \\angle 150\u00b0 \\) V\n\nNow, for phase C, the load consists of a capacitor and an inductor in series. So, the impedance of the load for phase C is:\n\n\\( Z_c = jX_L - jX_C \\)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\( X_L = 2\\pi f L \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C} \\)\n\nGiven f = 60 Hz, C = 5 \u03bcF, L = 0.56 H.\n\nFirst, calculate X_L:\n\n\\( X_L = 2\\pi \\times 60 \\times 0.56 \\)\n\n\\( X_L = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 0.56 \\)\n\n\\( X_L = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 33.6 \\)\n\n\\( X_L = 213.57 \\) \u03a9\n\nNext, calculate X_C:\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{0.00188496} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = 525.25 \\) \u03a9\n\nNow, the impedance Z_c is:\n\n\\( Z_c = j213.57 - j525.25 = -j311.68 \\) \u03a9\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, X_L:\n\n\\( X_L = 2\\pi f L = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 0.56 \\)\n\n\\( X_L = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 33.6 \\)\n\n\\( X_L = 213.57 \\) \u03a9\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nX_C:\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 60 \\times 5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = \\frac{1}{0.00188496} \\)\n\n\\( X_C = 525.25 \\) \u03a9\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, Z_c = jX_L - jX_C = j213.57 - j525.25 = -j311.68 \u03a9\n\nWait, no. It should be Z_c = jX_L + (-jX_C) = j213.57 - j525.25 = -j311.68 \u03a9\n\nYes, that's correct. The impedance is purely capacitive in this case, since the inductive reactance is less than the capacitive reactance.\n\nNow, the current in phase C is:\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = \\frac{\\vec{V}_{cN}}{Z_c} \\)\n\nGiven that \\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = 390 \\angle 150\u00b0 \\) V, and \\( Z_c = -j311.68 \\) \u03a9\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = \\frac{390 \\angle 150\u00b0}{-j311.68} \\)\n\nTo divide complex numbers, I can convert the denominator to polar form.\n\nFirst, -j311.68 is purely imaginary negative, so its angle is -90\u00b0 and magnitude is 311.68 \u03a9.\n\nThus,\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = 390 \\angle 150\u00b0 \\times \\frac{1}{311.68 \\angle -90\u00b0} \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = 390 / 311.68 \\angle 150\u00b0 - (-90\u00b0) \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = 1.251 \\angle 240\u00b0 \\) A\n\nWait, let me check the division again.\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = \\frac{390}{311.68} \\angle 150\u00b0 - (-90\u00b0) \\)\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = 1.251 \\angle 240\u00b0 \\) A\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is to find the phase of \\( I_{cC} \\), which I assume is the current from phase C to point C in the load.\n\nGiven that the load is Y-connected, and I've calculated the phase current \\( \\vec{I}_c \\), which should be the current from phase C to neutral N.\n\nBut in the diagram, point C is connected to the capacitor and inductor, so perhaps \\( I_{cC} \\) is the current through the capacitor.\n\nWait, looking back at the diagram, it shows a Y-connected load with points A, B, and C connected to capacitors and inductors, and all connected to a common point N.\n\nGiven that, \\( I_{cC} \\) might be the current from phase C to point C in the load, which would be the same as \\( \\vec{I}_c \\) that I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( I_{cC} \\) is the current through the capacitor in phase C.\n\nI need to clarify that.\n\nLooking at the diagram again, it shows a Y-connected load with each phase having a capacitor and inductor in series, and the currents are labeled \\( I_{aA} \\), \\( I_{bB} \\), and \\( I_{cC} \\).\n\nGiven that, \\( I_{cC} \\) is likely the current through the capacitor in phase C, which is the same as the phase current \\( \\vec{I}_c \\) since it's a series connection.\n\nTherefore, \\( I_{cC} = \\vec{I}_c = 1.251 \\angle 240\u00b0 \\) A\n\nSo, the phase of \\( I_{cC} \\) is 240\u00b0.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the phase in numerical form, and specifies \"Answer the angular degree in numerical form.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering the standard electrical engineering convention, 240\u00b0 is a valid answer.\n\nHowever, sometimes phases are expressed in the range of -180\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, so 240\u00b0 can also be expressed as -120\u00b0.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there's a need to adjust the phase angle.\n\nGiven that \\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = 390 \\angle 150\u00b0 \\) V and \\( Z_c = -j311.68 \\) \u03a9, then:\n\n\\( \\vec{I}_c = \\frac{390}{311.68} \\angle 150\u00b0 - (-90\u00b0) = 1.251 \\angle 240\u00b0 \\) A\n\nAlternatively, in radians:\n\nBut since the frequency is in Hz, and angles are in degrees, 240\u00b0 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the phase of \\( I_{cC} \\) is 240\u00b0.\n\nBut to ensure, perhaps I should check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, \\( \\vec{V}_{an} = 390 \\angle 30\u00b0 \\) V rms\n\nFor phase C, \\( \\vec{V}_{cN} = \\vec{V}_{an} \\angle 150\u00b0 \\)\n\nImpedance \\( Z_c = -j311.68 \\) \u03a9\n\nCurrent \\( \\vec{I}_c = \\frac{390 \\angle 150\u00b0}{-j311.68} = 1.251 \\angle 240\u00b0 \\) A\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the line voltage, but since it's a Y-connected load, the phase voltage is indeed \\( \\vec{V}_{cN} \\).\n\nTherefore, the phase of \\( I_{cC} \\) is 240\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{240^\\circ} \\]"
