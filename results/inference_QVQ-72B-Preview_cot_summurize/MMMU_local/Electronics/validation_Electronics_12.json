Let's see what I'm given:\n\n- V_CC = 24 V\n\n- R_B = 960 k\u03a9\n\n- R_C = 7 k\u03a9\n\n- \u03b2 = 80\n\n- And leakage is negligible.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some basic transistor concepts. The transistor is probably in a common emitter configuration, given the standard symbols in the figure. The base is connected to V_CC through resistor R_B, and the collector is connected to V_CC through resistor R_C, with the emitter being the common connection.\n\nI think I should start by finding the base current, I_B. Since the base is connected to V_CC through R_B, the base current can be calculated using Ohm's law:\n\nI_B = V_CC / R_B\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nI_B = 24 V / 960 k\u03a9 = 24 / 960,000 A = 0.000025 A = 25 \u03bcA\n\nBut wait, transistors have a current gain \u03b2, which is the ratio of collector current to base current. So, I_C = \u03b2 * I_B\n\nGiven \u03b2 = 80, I_C = 80 * 25 \u03bcA = 2000 \u03bcA = 2 mA\n\nNow, the collector voltage, V_C, can be found by considering the voltage drop across R_C:\n\nV_C = V_CC - I_C * R_C = 24 V - 2 mA * 7 k\u03a9 = 24 - 14 = 10 V\n\nFinally, V_CE is the voltage between collector and emitter, which should be V_C - V_E. But since the emitter is connected to ground (assuming), V_E = 0 V, so V_CE = V_C = 10 V\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. In a common emitter configuration with the emitter grounded, yes, V_CE would indeed be equal to V_C when V_E is zero.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for V_CE in terms of the other parameters to verify.\n\nAlso, I should consider if the transistor is in saturation or not, but given the values, it seems like it's operating in the active region.\n\nLet me see: for a transistor to be in the active region, V_CE should be greater than 0 V, and less than V_CC.\n\nGiven that V_CE = 10 V, which is between 0 and 24 V, it seems to be in the active region.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if V_BE is within the typical range. Assuming silicon transistor, V_BE is around 0.7 V.\n\nHowever, since leakage is negligible, I can ignore any leakage currents.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the transistor's characteristics, but since it's a simple circuit, the above calculation seems sufficient.\n\nI think my answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ V}} \\]"
