                    "text": "So I'm looking at this problem, and there are three different circuits shown in Figure 1, labeled (a), (b), and (c). The task is to find the voltage \"v\" in part (c) just after the switches are thrown. I need to focus on part (c), but I should probably understand all three parts to get the context.\n\nStarting with part (a):\n\nThere's a 12V battery connected to a circuit that includes a 6\u03a9 resistor, a 4\u03a9 resistor, and a 2H inductor. There's a switch that's being thrown at t=0. The circuit is a series circuit with the battery, resistors, and inductor. I need to analyze what happens when the switch is thrown.\n\nIn part (b):\n\nThere's a 100V battery connected to a circuit with a 30\u03a9 resistor, a 5H inductor, a 20\u03a9 resistor, and a 4\u03a9 resistor. Again, there's a switch being thrown at t=0. This circuit seems more complex with multiple components in parallel and series.\n\nIn part (c):\n\nThere's a 5A current source connected to a circuit with a 20\u03a9 resistor, a 10\u03a9 resistor, and an 8H inductor. There are two switches here as well, both being thrown at t=0. The arrangement looks like the current source is in parallel with the resistors and the inductor.\n\nThe question is asking for the voltage \"v\" in part (c) just after the switches are thrown.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles of circuit analysis, especially regarding inductors and how they behave when a switch is thrown.\n\nInductors oppose changes in current. When a switch is closed, the current through an inductor cannot change instantly; it takes time, depending on the inductance and the voltage applied.\n\nIn part (a), at t=0+, just after the switch is thrown, the inductor acts like an open circuit because the current through it is zero initially. So, the circuit effectively has the 6\u03a9 and 4\u03a9 resistors in series, and the voltage across the inductor is equal to the battery voltage, which is 12V.\n\nIn part (b), similarly, at t=0+, the inductor acts like an open circuit. The circuit has a 30\u03a9 resistor in parallel with a series combination of the inductor and the 20\u03a9 and 4\u03a9 resistors. But since the inductor is acting like an open circuit, there's no current through the inductor branch. So, only the 30\u03a9 resistor is in parallel with the battery.\n\nIn part (c), there's a current source providing 5A. The switches are being thrown at t=0, and I need to find the voltage \"v\" just after that.\n\nLooking at part (c):\n\n- There's a 5A current source.\n\n- Two resistors: 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9.\n\n- An 8H inductor.\n\nThe current source is connected in parallel with the resistors and the inductor.\n\nWhen the switches are thrown at t=0, I need to determine the voltage across the inductor and the resistors immediately afterward.\n\nFirst, recall that in a DC steady state, an inductor acts like a short circuit because it allows DC current to pass through without any resistance. However, at the instant of switching, the voltage across the inductor can be significant due to the change in current.\n\nBut in this case, there's a current source providing a constant 5A. So, regardless of the switching, the current through the circuit remains 5A.\n\nWait, but the switches are being thrown at t=0, which might change the configuration of the circuit.\n\nLooking closely at part (c):\n\n- Before t=0, the switches are in one position.\n\n- At t=0, the switches are thrown to another position.\n\nI need to find the voltage \"v\" just after t=0.\n\nAssuming that before t=0, the circuit was in a steady state, and at t=0, the switches change position, potentially changing the path of the current.\n\nBut since it's a current source, the current remains constant at 5A.\n\nSo, the voltage across the components would adjust accordingly.\n\nIn part (c), the current source is in parallel with the resistors and the inductor.\n\nSince it's a parallel connection, the voltage across each component is the same, equal to the voltage across the current source.\n\nTherefore, v is the voltage across the current source.\n\nGiven that the current through the current source is 5A, and it's in parallel with the combination of resistors and inductor, I need to find the voltage v that satisfies the current through each component.\n\nBut since it's a parallel connection, the voltage across each component is the same.\n\nSo, v is the same across the 20\u03a9 resistor, the 10\u03a9 resistor, and the 8H inductor.\n\nWait, but the inductor has a voltage across it that depends on the rate of change of current, which is dv/dt = L * di/dt.\n\nBut in this case, the current source is providing a constant current of 5A, so di/dt is zero.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor is zero.\n\nSo, the voltage v must be such that the voltage across the inductor is zero, and the voltages across the resistors are consistent with the current through them.\n\nGiven that the current is 5A, and the resistors are in parallel with the inductor, the voltage across each resistor would be:\n\nFor 20\u03a9 resistor: v = i * R = 5A * 20\u03a9 = 100V\n\nFor 10\u03a9 resistor: v = 5A * 10\u03a9 = 50V\n\nBut since they are in parallel with the inductor and the current source, the voltage v must be the same across all of them.\n\nHowever, there's a contradiction here because 100V and 50V are different voltages.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the circuit configuration.\n\nLooking back at part (c):\n\n- The current source is in parallel with the combination of resistors and inductor.\n\n- The switches are being thrown at t=0.\n\nPerhaps the switches are connecting or disconnecting certain components at t=0.\n\nAssuming that before t=0, the circuit was in a steady state, and at t=0, the switches change position, potentially connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the current source.\n\nWait, looking at part (c):\n\n- There's a 5A current source.\n\n- Two resistors: 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9.\n\n- An 8H inductor.\n\n- Two switches being thrown at t=0.\n\nFrom the diagram, it seems that the switches are in series with the 3\u03a9 resistor, and when the switches are thrown, the 3\u03a9 resistor is connected in parallel with the current source.\n\nSo, after t=0, the circuit includes the 5A current source in parallel with the 3\u03a9 resistor, the 20\u03a9 resistor, the 10\u03a9 resistor, and the 8H inductor.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to redraw the circuit after the switches are thrown.\n\nAssuming that before t=0, the 3\u03a9 resistor is not connected, and at t=0, the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the other components.\n\nSo, after t=0, the circuit has:\n\n- A 5A current source.\n\n- Resistors: 20\u03a9, 10\u03a9, and 3\u03a9 in parallel.\n\n- An 8H inductor in parallel with them.\n\nSince it's a parallel connection, the voltage across all components is the same, equal to v.\n\nGiven that the current source provides 5A, and it's in parallel with the resistors and the inductor, I can calculate the total current through the resistors and the inductor.\n\nBut since the inductor is in parallel, and assuming the current through the inductor is zero (because di/dt is zero, as the current source is providing a constant current), then the total current through the resistors must be 5A.\n\nNow, the resistors are in parallel, so the voltage across each is v, and their currents add up to 5A.\n\nThe currents through each resistor are:\n\n- For 20\u03a9: i1 = v / 20\n\n- For 10\u03a9: i2 = v / 10\n\n- For 3\u03a9: i3 = v / 3\n\nThe sum of these currents should equal the current from the source:\n\ni1 + i2 + i3 = 5A\n\nSo:\n\nv / 20 + v / 10 + v / 3 = 5\n\nTo solve for v, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 60:\n\n(3v + 6v + 20v) / 60 = 5\n\n(3v + 6v + 20v) = 29v\n\n29v / 60 = 5\n\n29v = 5 * 60\n\n29v = 300\n\nv = 300 / 29\n\nv \u2248 10.34 V\n\nBut wait, this seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm considering the inductor correctly.\n\nEarlier, I assumed that since the current source is providing a constant current, di/dt is zero, so the voltage across the inductor is zero.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the resistors and the inductor should be the same, which is v.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the initial conditions more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the concept of equivalent resistance or admittance.\n\nSince the resistors are in parallel with each other and with the inductor and the current source, the total admittance is the sum of the admittances of each component.\n\nThe admittance of a resistor is 1/R, and for an inductor, it's 1/(j\u03c9L), where j is the imaginary unit and \u03c9 is the angular frequency.\n\nBut in DC circuits, the admittance of an inductor is zero because it acts like an open circuit.\n\nWait, but in AC circuits, inductors have reactance, but in DC, they have zero admittance.\n\nSo, the total admittance is:\n\n1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 + 0 = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3\n\nCalculate that:\n\n1/20 = 3/60\n\n1/10 = 6/60\n\n1/3 \u2248 20/60\n\nTotal admittance \u2248 (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60 S (Siemens)\n\nTherefore, the total current I = V * Y, where Y is the total admittance.\n\nBut in this case, the current source is providing 5A, so:\n\n5 = V * (29/60)\n\nTherefore, V = 5 / (29/60) = 5 * (60/29) = 300/29 \u2248 10.34 V\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if this is correct because it seems too straightforward, and I'm not considering the inductor's behavior during the switching transient.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the inductor's voltage more carefully.\n\nAt t=0+, just after the switches are thrown, the current through the inductor cannot change instantly. Before t=0, assuming the switches are open, the current through the inductor is zero.\n\nTherefore, at t=0+, the current through the inductor is still zero.\n\nSo, the total current provided by the current source is 5A, and the current through the inductor is zero, meaning that the current through the resistors must be 5A.\n\nGiven that the resistors are in parallel, their voltages are equal, and their currents add up to 5A.\n\nSo, v = i * R for each resistor.\n\nSum of currents: v/20 + v/10 + v/3 = 5\n\nWhich again leads to v = 300/29 \u2248 10.34 V\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the 3\u03a9 resistor being connected in parallel after t=0, but in the diagram, it seems that the 3\u03a9 resistor is connected in parallel with the other components only after the switches are thrown.\n\nTherefore, before t=0, the circuit consists of the 5A current source in parallel with the 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9 resistors and the 8H inductor.\n\nAt t=0, the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the rest.\n\nBefore t=0, the current through the 20\u03a9 resistor is 5A * (20/(20+10)) = 5A * (2/3) = 10/3 A\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor is 5A * (10/(20+10)) = 5A * (1/3) = 5/3 A\n\nVoltage across both resistors is:\n\nFor 20\u03a9: v = (10/3) A * 20\u03a9 = 200/3 V \u2248 66.67 V\n\nFor 10\u03a9: v = (5/3) A * 10\u03a9 = 50/3 V \u2248 16.67 V\n\nBut since they are in parallel, their voltages should be the same, which they are not. This suggests I've made a mistake in calculating the currents.\n\nWait, in a parallel circuit with a current source, the current divides inversely proportional to the resistances.\n\nTotal resistance before t=0:\n\nR_total = (20 * 10)/(20 + 10) = 200/30 = 20/3 \u03a9\n\nTherefore, total voltage V = I * R_total = 5A * (20/3) \u03a9 = 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V\n\nThen, current through 20\u03a9: I1 = V / 20 = (100/3)/20 = 100/60 = 5/3 A\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9: I2 = V / 10 = (100/3)/10 = 100/30 = 10/3 A\n\nTotal current: I1 + I2 = 5/3 + 10/3 = 15/3 = 5A, which checks out.\n\nSo, before t=0, the voltage across the resistors and the inductor is 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V\n\nAt t=0, the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel.\n\nNow, the total resistance changes.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of 20\u03a9, 10\u03a9, and 3\u03a9 in parallel is:\n\n1/R_total = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 = (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60\n\nTherefore, R_total = 60/29 \u03a9 \u2248 2.07 \u03a9\n\nThe voltage across the parallel combination is V = I * R_total = 5A * (60/29) \u03a9 = 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V\n\nAgain, this is the same value I calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the voltage was 300/29 V, but now I'm getting 300/29 V again. Maybe I made a mistake in the admittance approach.\n\nLet me recalculate using the admittance method.\n\nTotal admittance Y = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 = (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60 S\n\nCurrent I = V * Y => V = I / Y = 5 / (29/60) = 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V\n\nSame result.\n\nBut I'm still confused because before t=0, the voltage was 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V, and after t=0, it drops to 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nWell, when the 3\u03a9 resistor is added in parallel, the total resistance decreases, so the voltage across the resistors decreases, assuming the current source remains constant.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the voltage drops from approximately 33.33 V to approximately 10.34 V when the 3\u03a9 resistor is added.\n\nBut the question is to find v just after t=0, which is 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the inductor's behavior.\n\nThe inductor is in parallel with the resistors and the current source.\n\nBefore t=0, the voltage across the inductor is 100/3 V.\n\nAt t=0, when the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor, the total resistance changes, and the voltage across the components changes.\n\nBut the voltage across the inductor cannot change instantly because that would require an infinite current, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor remains at 100/3 V immediately after t=0.\n\nWait, no. The voltage across an inductor can change instantly if there's a voltage source connected in parallel.\n\nBut in this case, there's a current source in parallel with the resistors and the inductor.\n\nGiven that the current source is providing a constant current, the voltage across the inductor can change, but the current through it cannot change instantly.\n\nSo, at t=0+, just after the switches are thrown, the current through the inductor is still zero (since it couldn't have changed instantly).\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor is equal to the voltage across the resistors, which we've calculated as 300/29 V.\n\nBut according to the inductor's voltage equation:\n\nv_L = L * di/dt\n\nSince di/dt is zero (because the current through the inductor is zero and remains zero), v_L should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor is zero at t=0+.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the voltage across the resistors as 300/29 V.\n\nThis seems contradictory because the voltage across the inductor and the resistors should be the same since they are in parallel.\n\nIf v_L is zero, then the voltage across the resistors should also be zero, which doesn't make sense because the current source is providing 5A.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the circuit differently.\n\nLet me try to analyze the circuit step by step.\n\nBefore"

they have zero admittance.\n\nSo, the total admittance is:\n\n1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 + 0 = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3\n\nCalculate that:\n\n1/20 = 3/60\n\n1/10 = 6/60\n\n1/3 \u2248 20/60\n\nTotal admittance \u2248 (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60 S (Siemens)\n\nTherefore, the total current I = V * Y, where Y is the total admittance.\n\nBut in this case, the current source is providing 5A, so:\n\n5 = V * (29/60)\n\nTherefore, V = 5 / (29/60) = 5 * (60/29) = 300/29 \u2248 10.34 V\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if this is correct because it seems too straightforward, and I'm not considering the inductor's behavior during the switching transient.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the inductor's voltage more carefully.\n\nAt t=0+, just after the switches are thrown, the current through the inductor cannot change instantly. Before t=0, assuming the switches are open, the current through the inductor is zero.\n\nTherefore, at t=0+, the current through the inductor is still zero.\n\nSo, the total current provided by the current source is 5A, and the current through the inductor is zero, meaning that the current through the resistors must be 5A.\n\nGiven that the resistors are in parallel, their voltages are equal, and their currents add up to 5A.\n\nSo, v = i * R for each resistor.\n\nSum of currents: v/20 + v/10 + v/3 = 5\n\nWhich again leads to v = 300/29 \u2248 10.34 V\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the 3\u03a9 resistor being connected in parallel after t=0, but in the diagram, it seems that the 3\u03a9 resistor is connected in parallel with the other components only after the switches are thrown.\n\nTherefore, before t=0, the circuit consists of the 5A current source in parallel with the 20\u03a9 and 10\u03a9 resistors and the 8H inductor.\n\nAt t=0, the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel with the rest.\n\nBefore t=0, the current through the 20\u03a9 resistor is 5A * (20/(20+10)) = 5A * (2/3) = 10/3 A\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9 resistor is 5A * (10/(20+10)) = 5A * (1/3) = 5/3 A\n\nVoltage across both resistors is:\n\nFor 20\u03a9: v = (10/3) A * 20\u03a9 = 200/3 V \u2248 66.67 V\n\nFor 10\u03a9: v = (5/3) A * 10\u03a9 = 50/3 V \u2248 16.67 V\n\nBut since they are in parallel, their voltages should be the same, which they are not. This suggests I've made a mistake in calculating the currents.\n\nWait, in a parallel circuit with a current source, the current divides inversely proportional to the resistances.\n\nTotal resistance before t=0:\n\nR_total = (20 * 10)/(20 + 10) = 200/30 = 20/3 \u03a9\n\nTherefore, total voltage V = I * R_total = 5A * (20/3) \u03a9 = 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V\n\nThen, current through 20\u03a9: I1 = V / 20 = (100/3)/20 = 100/60 = 5/3 A\n\nCurrent through 10\u03a9: I2 = V / 10 = (100/3)/10 = 100/30 = 10/3 A\n\nTotal current: I1 + I2 = 5/3 + 10/3 = 15/3 = 5A, which checks out.\n\nSo, before t=0, the voltage across the resistors and the inductor is 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V\n\nAt t=0, the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor in parallel.\n\nNow, the total resistance changes.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of 20\u03a9, 10\u03a9, and 3\u03a9 in parallel is:\n\n1/R_total = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 = (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60\n\nTherefore, R_total = 60/29 \u03a9 \u2248 2.07 \u03a9\n\nThe voltage across the parallel combination is V = I * R_total = 5A * (60/29) \u03a9 = 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V\n\nAgain, this is the same value I calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the voltage was 300/29 V, but now I'm getting 300/29 V again. Maybe I made a mistake in the admittance approach.\n\nLet me recalculate using the admittance method.\n\nTotal admittance Y = 1/20 + 1/10 + 1/3 = (3 + 6 + 20)/60 = 29/60 S\n\nCurrent I = V * Y => V = I / Y = 5 / (29/60) = 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V\n\nSame result.\n\nBut I'm still confused because before t=0, the voltage was 100/3 V \u2248 33.33 V, and after t=0, it drops to 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nWell, when the 3\u03a9 resistor is added in parallel, the total resistance decreases, so the voltage across the resistors decreases, assuming the current source remains constant.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the voltage drops from approximately 33.33 V to approximately 10.34 V when the 3\u03a9 resistor is added.\n\nBut the question is to find v just after t=0, which is 300/29 V \u2248 10.34 V.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the inductor's behavior.\n\nThe inductor is in parallel with the resistors and the current source.\n\nBefore t=0, the voltage across the inductor is 100/3 V.\n\nAt t=0, when the switches close, connecting the 3\u03a9 resistor, the total resistance changes, and the voltage across the components changes.\n\nBut the voltage across the inductor cannot change instantly because that would require an infinite current, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor remains at 100/3 V immediately after t=0.\n\nWait, no. The voltage across an inductor can change instantly if there's a voltage source connected in parallel.\n\nBut in this case, there's a current source in parallel with the resistors and the inductor.\n\nGiven that the current source is providing a constant current, the voltage across the inductor can change, but the current through it cannot change instantly.\n\nSo, at t=0+, just after the switches are thrown, the current through the inductor is still zero (since it couldn't have changed instantly).\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor is equal to the voltage across the resistors, which we've calculated as 300/29 V.\n\nBut according to the inductor's voltage equation:\n\nv_L = L * di/dt\n\nSince di/dt is zero (because the current through the inductor is zero and remains zero), v_L should be zero.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the inductor is zero at t=0+.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the voltage across the resistors as 300/29 V.\n\nThis seems contradictory because the voltage across the inductor and the resistors should be the same since they are in parallel.\n\nIf v_L is zero, then the voltage across the resistors should also be zero, which doesn't make sense because the current source is providing 5A.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the circuit differently.\n\nLet me try to analyze the circuit step by step.\n\nBefore",
