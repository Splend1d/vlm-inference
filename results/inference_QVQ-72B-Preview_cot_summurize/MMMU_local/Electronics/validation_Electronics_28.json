                    "text": "So I've got this circuit problem here, and I need to find the voltage \\(v_2\\). Let's see what we've got in the circuit. There's a voltage source of 25 cos 250t volts, a current source of 8 amperes, some resistors, a capacitor, and an inductor. The circuit is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the components and how they're connected. There's a 5-ohm resistor connected in series with a 60V battery and an 80mH inductor. There's also a 200\u03bcF capacitor connected in parallel with a 15-ohm resistor. Additionally, there's an 8A current source connected in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nSince there are both DC and AC sources, I need to consider the behavior of the circuit in the frequency domain, probably using phasors for the AC part and solving for the DC steady-state separately.\n\nLet me start by finding the impedance of the capacitor and the inductor at the given frequency.\n\nThe angular frequency \\(\\omega\\) is 250 rad/s.\n\nThe impedance of the capacitor \\(Z_C\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{j\\omega C}\\), where \\(C = 200 \\mu F = 200 \\times 10^{-6} F\\).\n\nSo, \\(Z_C = \\frac{1}{j \\times 250 \\times 200 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{1}{j \\times 0.05} = -j20\\) ohms.\n\nThe impedance of the inductor \\(Z_L\\) is \\(j\\omega L\\), where \\(L = 80 mH = 80 \\times 10^{-3} H\\).\n\nSo, \\(Z_L = j \\times 250 \\times 80 \\times 10^{-3} = j20\\) ohms.\n\nNow, looking at the circuit:\n\n- The 5-ohm resistor is in series with the 60V battery and the 80mH inductor.\n\n- The 200\u03bcF capacitor is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor.\n\n- The 8A current source is also in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nI need to find \\(v_2\\), which is the voltage across the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nSince the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor are in parallel, their voltages are the same. Similarly, the current source is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, so it's providing a current of 8A through that path.\n\nWait a minute, actually, if the current source is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, it means that the current through the resistor is 8A, assuming no other paths for the current.\n\nBut let's verify that.\n\nIf the current source is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, then indeed, the current through the resistor is 8A.\n\nTherefore, the DC component of \\(v_2\\) is \\(15 \\times 8 = 120V\\).\n\nBut wait, there's also an AC component due to the voltage source.\n\nI need to consider both DC and AC components.\n\nLet me separate the analysis into DC and AC parts.\n\nFirst, DC analysis:\n\n- The 5-ohm resistor is in series with the 60V battery and the 80mH inductor.\n\n- The inductor acts as a short circuit for DC, so the equivalent resistance is 5 ohms.\n\n- Therefore, the DC current through the 5-ohm resistor is \\(\\frac{60V}{5\\Omega} = 12A\\).\n\n- The voltage across the 5-ohm resistor is \\(5 \\times 12 = 60V\\).\n\n- The voltage across the inductor is 0V DC.\n\n- The capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor are in parallel, and the current source is providing 8A through the 15-ohm resistor.\n\n- Therefore, \\(v_2_{DC} = 15 \\times 8 = 120V\\).\n\nNow, AC analysis:\n\n- The voltage source is 25 cos 250t V, which corresponds to a phasor of \\(25 \\angle 0^\\circ\\) V.\n\n- I need to find the voltage \\(v_2\\) in the AC steady-state.\n\nLet me redraw the circuit considering only the AC components.\n\nIgnoring the DC sources (60V battery and 8A current source), since they won't affect the AC analysis.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- A 25V source in series with a 5-ohm resistor and an 80mH inductor.\n\n- In parallel with them, a 200\u03bcF capacitor and a 15-ohm resistor in parallel.\n\nWait, but the 8A current source is still present in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nActually, in AC analysis, the current source remains as is.\n\nSo, the AC circuit consists of:\n\n- 25V source in series with 5 ohms and 80mH inductor.\n\n- In parallel with that, a 200\u03bcF capacitor in parallel with a 15-ohm resistor and an 8A current source.\n\nNow, I need to find the total current through the parallel combination and then find \\(v_2\\).\n\nLet me first find the impedance of each branch.\n\nFirst branch: 5 ohms in series with \\(Z_L = j20\\) ohms.\n\nSo, impedance of first branch \\(Z_1 = 5 + j20\\) ohms.\n\nSecond branch: \\(Z_C = -j20\\) ohms in parallel with 15 ohms.\n\nSo, equivalent impedance of second branch \\(Z_2 = \\frac{(-j20) \\times 15}{-j20 + 15} = \\frac{-j300}{15 - j20}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, \\(15 - j20\\).\n\nTo find the magnitude: \\(\\sqrt{15^2 + (-20)^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 400} = \\sqrt{625} = 25\\).\n\nAngle: \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-20}{15}\\right) = -53.13^\\circ\\).\n\nSo, \\(15 - j20 = 25 \\angle -53.13^\\circ\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(Z_2 = \\frac{-j300}{25 \\angle -53.13^\\circ} = \\frac{-j300}{25} \\angle (90^\\circ - (-53.13^\\circ)) = \\frac{-j300}{25} \\angle 143.13^\\circ\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, dividing complex numbers, we subtract the angles.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{-j300}{25 \\angle -53.13^\\circ} = \\frac{300}{25} \\angle (270^\\circ - (-53.13^\\circ)) = 12 \\angle 323.13^\\circ\\).\n\nConverting back to rectangular form:\n\n\\(12 \\cos 323.13^\\circ + j12 \\sin 323.13^\\circ\\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\(\\cos 323.13^\\circ \\approx 0.682\\), \\(\\sin 323.13^\\circ \\approx -0.731\\).\n\nSo, \\(Z_2 \\approx 12 \\times 0.682 - j12 \\times 0.731 \\approx 8.184 - j8.772\\) ohms.\n\nNow, the total impedance seen by the voltage source is the parallel combination of \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\).\n\nFirst, find \\(Z_1 = 5 + j20\\), \\(Z_2 \\approx 8.184 - j8.772\\).\n\nThe equivalent impedance \\(Z_{eq} = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}\\).\n\nFirst, calculate \\(Z_1 + Z_2 = (5 + 8.184) + j(20 - 8.772) = 13.184 + j11.228\\) ohms.\n\nThen, \\(Z_1 Z_2 = (5 + j20)(8.184 - j8.772) = 5 \\times 8.184 + 5 \\times (-8.772j) + j20 \\times 8.184 + j20 \\times (-j8.772)\\)\n\nWait, let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(5 \\times 8.184 = 40.92\\)\n\n\\(5 \\times (-8.772j) = -43.86j\\)\n\n\\(j20 \\times 8.184 = 163.68j\\)\n\n\\(j20 \\times (-j8.772) = -20 \\times 8.772 = -175.44\\)\n\nSo, \\(Z_1 Z_2 = 40.92 - 175.44 + j(-43.86 + 163.68) = -134.52 + j119.82\\)\n\nNow, \\(Z_{eq} = \\frac{-134.52 + j119.82}{13.184 + j11.228}\\)\n\nTo divide complex numbers, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\nSo, \\(Z_{eq} = \\frac{(-134.52 + j119.82)(13.184 - j11.228)}{13.184^2 + 11.228^2}\\)\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator: \\(13.184^2 + 11.228^2 = 173.8 + 126.0 = 299.8\\)\n\nNow, the numerator:\n\n\\((-134.52)(13.184) + (-134.52)(-11.228j) + j119.82(13.184) + j119.82(-11.228j)\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\(-134.52 \\times 13.184 \\approx -1764.2\\)\n\n\\(-134.52 \\times (-11.228j) = 1511.4j\\)\n\n\\(j119.82 \\times 13.184 = 1574.2j\\)\n\n\\(j119.82 \\times (-11.228j) = -1344.2\\)\n\nSo, numerator \\(= -1764.2 - 1344.2 + j(1511.4 + 1574.2) = -3108.4 + j3085.6\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(Z_{eq} = \\frac{-3108.4 + j3085.6}{299.8} \\approx -10.37 + j10.3\\)\n\nSo, \\(Z_{eq} \\approx -10.37 + j10.3\\) ohms.\n\nNow, the total current \\(I_{total}\\) from the voltage source is \\(V_{source}/Z_{eq}\\).\n\nGiven \\(V_{source} = 25 \\angle 0^\\circ\\) V.\n\nSo, \\(I_{total} = \\frac{25}{-10.37 + j10.3}\\)\n\nFirst, find the magnitude of \\(Z_{eq}\\):\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(-10.37)^2 + 10.3^2} = \\sqrt{107.5 + 106.0} = \\sqrt{213.5} \\approx 14.61\\) ohms.\n\nAngle of \\(Z_{eq}\\): \\(\\tan^{-1}(\\frac{10.3}{-10.37}) = \\tan^{-1}(-0.993) \\approx -45^\\circ\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(I_{total} = \\frac{25}{14.61 \\angle -45^\\circ} \\approx 1.71 \\angle 45^\\circ\\) A.\n\nNow, to find the current through the parallel branch containing the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nThe impedance of this parallel combination is \\(Z_2 \\approx 8.184 - j8.772\\) ohms.\n\nTherefore, the current through this branch is \\(I_{branch2} = V_{branch2}/Z_2\\).\n\nBut \\(V_{branch2}\\) is the voltage across the parallel combination, which is the same as the voltage across the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nWait, actually, in the AC analysis, the voltage across the parallel combination is the same as the voltage across the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nBut I need to find \\(v_2\\), which is the voltage across the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nSo, \\(v_2 = I_{branch2} \\times 15\\).\n\nBut I need to find \\(I_{branch2}\\).\n\nAlternatively, since the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor are in parallel, their voltages are equal, and the current through them is the sum of the currents through each.\n\nWait, no. In parallel branches, the voltage is the same, and the total current is the sum of the individual branch currents.\n\nBut in this case, I have a current source in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, which complicates things.\n\nActually, the current source is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, so the current through the resistor is equal to the current source value, assuming no other paths.\n\nBut in AC analysis, the current source remains at 8A, which is its DC value.\n\nWait, no. The current source is specified as 8A, which is likely its RMS value, so in phasor notation, it's 8A at 0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, in the AC analysis, the current through the 15-ohm resistor is 8A at 0 degrees.\n\nBut that can't be right because in AC analysis, we consider the impedances and phasors.\n\nI think I need to reconsider this.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn the AC analysis, the current source is still present, and it's in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nTherefore, the current through the 15-ohm resistor is 8A, but this is the DC component.\n\nIn AC, the current source provides an AC current, but since it's specified as 8A, which is likely its RMS value, I need to convert it to a phasor.\n\nAssuming it's a DC current source, in AC analysis, it remains as 8A at 0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the total current through the parallel branch is the sum of the currents through the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor.\n\nWait, but the current source is in parallel with the 15-ohm resistor, so the current through the resistor is the current source value minus any current through the capacitor.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should use nodal analysis.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet's consider the node where the capacitor and the 15-ohm resistor are connected.\n\nLet me define the nodes.\n\nAssuming the circuit is as in Figure 1, which I can't see, but based on the description.\n\nLet me assume that the voltage source is connected in series with the 5-ohm resistor and the inductor, and then connected to the parallel combination of the capacitor, the 15-ohm resistor, and the 8A current source.\n\nWait, I need a better approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use superposition, considering the DC and AC components separately, and then combine them.\n\nI already did the DC analysis and found that \\(v_2_{DC} = 120V\\).\n\nNow, for the AC analysis, I need to find \\(v_2_{AC}\\), and then the total \\(v_2 = v_2_{DC} + v_2_{AC}\\).\n\nIn the AC analysis, the DC sources are considered as shorts or opens, depending on the component.\n\nSpecifically, the 60V battery becomes a short circuit, and the 8A current source remains as is.\n\nSo, in AC analysis, the circuit consists of:\n\n- 25V source in series with 5 ohms and 80mH inductor.\n\n- In parallel with that, a 200\u03bcF capacitor in parallel with a 15-ohm resistor and an 8A current source.\n\nNow, I need to find the voltage across the parallel combination, which is \\(v_2_{AC}\\).\n\nLet me try to find the total current from the voltage source and then find the voltage across the parallel combination.\n\nFirst, find the total impedance seen by the voltage source.\n\nAs I did earlier, \\(Z_{eq} \\approx -10.37 + j10.3\\) ohms.\n\nTherefore, the total current from the voltage source is \\(I_{total} = \\frac{25}{-10.37 + j10.3} \\approx 1.71 \\angle 45^\\circ\\) A.\n\nNow, the current through the parallel branch is the total current minus the current through the series branch.\n\nWait, but the parallel branch includes the current source, which is fixed at 8A.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should use mesh analysis.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume two meshes: one for the series combination of 5 ohms and the inductor, and another for the parallel combination.\n\nBut with the current source in the parallel branch, it's still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the parallel combination as a single impedance and find the current through it.\n\nLet me"
