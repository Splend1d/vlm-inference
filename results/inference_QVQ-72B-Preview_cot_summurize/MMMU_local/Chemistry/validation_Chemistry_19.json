First things first, I should probably recall what an optical isomer is. Optical isomers are stereoisomers that differ in the way they rotate plane-polarized light.

A chiral center is a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups. Each chiral center can exist in two configurations, typically labeled as D and L or R and S, which are mirror images.\n\nLooking at the structure of isoleucine:\n\n<image 1>\n\nI can see that there are two carbon atoms that might be chiral centers. Let's look closely at each one.\n\nThe first carbon atom is connected to:\n\n- A carboxyl group (COO-)\n\n- An amino group (H3N+)\n\n- A hydrogen atom (H)\n\n- Another carbon atom\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, the structure seems to be:\n\nNH3+\u2014CH\u2014COO-\n\n|\n\nH\n\n|\n\nCH\u2014CH3\n\n|\n\nCH2\u2014CH3\n\nSo, the central carbon atom is bonded to:\n\n1.

H\n\n2. CH3\n\n3. CH2\u2014CH3\n\nWait, that's only three groups. So, it's not a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, isoleucine has only one chiral center, which is the alpha carbon connected to NH3+, COO-, H, and the side chain CH\u2014CH3.\n\nNow, generally, each chiral center can exist in two forms, so for one chiral center, there should be 2^1 = 2 optical isomers.\n\nBut wait, I seem to recall that some amino acids have more than one chiral center, but in this case, it's just one.\n\nHowever, I've heard that some amino acids have more than two optical isomers due to additional chiral centers or other factors.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if isoleucine has only one chiral center.\n\nLet me redraw the structure to make sure:\n\nH3N+\u2014C\u2014COO-\n\n|\n\nH\n\n|\n\nC\u2014CH3\n\n|\n\nCH2\u2014CH3\n\nYes, that's the structure of isoleucine.
