                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this phase diagram with five points labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The x-axis is temperature in degrees Celsius, and the y-axis is pressure in atmospheres. There are two curves intersecting at a point, which I believe is the triple point where all three phases\u2014solid, liquid, and gas\u2014coexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each region of the diagram represents. Typically, in a phase diagram, the areas enclosed by the curves represent the regions where a single phase exists, and the lines themselves represent the conditions under which two phases coexist.\n\nPoint A is where one of the curves starts on the temperature axis. Maybe that's the melting point at zero pressure, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this.\n\nPoint B is located in the region above the triple point, between the two curves. Point C is above both curves, point D is on one of the curves, and point E is below both curves.\n\nI need to determine at which point the substance is solely in the solid phase at equilibrium.\n\nLet me recall what the different regions in a phase diagram represent. Generally:\n\n- The area below the melting curve represents the solid phase.\n\n- The area above the vapor pressure curve represents the liquid phase.\n\n- The area above the critical point is the supercritical fluid.\n\nBut in this diagram, it seems simplified, with only two curves intersecting at the triple point.\n\nWait, actually, in a typical phase diagram for water, for example, you have the solid-liquid curve and the liquid-vapor curve, meeting at the triple point.\n\nSo, the region below the solid-liquid curve is solid, above the liquid-vapor curve is liquid, and between them is liquid and vapor coexisting.\n\nBut in this diagram, it looks like there's only one curve starting from the origin, going up and to the right, and another curve coming down from the top left.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally.\n\nThere's a curve starting from the origin, probably the melting curve, which increases with pressure. Then another curve coming down from the top left, possibly the vapor pressure curve.\n\nSo, point A is on the temperature axis, maybe the melting point at zero pressure.\n\nPoint B is in the region where pressure is high and temperature is moderate, between the two curves.\n\nPoint C is at high pressure and high temperature, above both curves.\n\nPoint D is on the curve, probably the vapor pressure curve.\n\nPoint E is at low pressure and moderate temperature, below both curves.\n\nI need to find where the substance is solely in the solid phase.\n\nIn the phase diagram for water, the solid phase exists at lower temperatures and higher pressures.\n\nWait, for water, increasing pressure can lead to melting at very high pressures, but generally, the solid phase is stable at lower temperatures and higher pressures.\n\nBut I need to be careful; for most substances, the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase, so increasing pressure favors the solid phase. However, for water, it's the opposite near ambient conditions because ice is less dense than liquid water.\n\nBut maybe in this diagram, the curves are generic, not specifically for water.\n\nAssuming it's a generic substance where the solid phase is more dense than the liquid phase, increasing pressure would favor the solid phase.\n\nSo, the solid phase would be stable at lower temperatures and higher pressures.\n\nLooking at the points:\n\nPoint A is at zero pressure and some temperature.\n\nPoint B is at higher pressure and moderate temperature, between the two curves.\n\nPoint C is at high pressure and high temperature, above both curves.\n\nPoint D is on the curve, probably the vapor pressure curve.\n\nPoint E is at low pressure and moderate temperature, below both curves.\n\nIf the solid phase is stable at lower temperatures and higher pressures, then point E is at lower pressure, so less likely to be solid.\n\nPoint A is at zero pressure, so probably not solid.\n\nPoint B is at higher pressure but between the curves, which might be where two phases coexist.\n\nPoint C is at high pressure and high temperature, which might be where the substance is a supercritical fluid or something else.\n\nPoint D is on the curve, which is probably the vapor pressure curve, indicating liquid and vapor coexistence.\n\nSo, none of these seem to be solely in the solid phase.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the diagram.\n\nLet me look again.\n\nIn the diagram, there's a curve starting from the origin, going up and to the right, and another curve coming down from the top left, meeting at a triple point.\n\nSo, the region below the solid-liquid curve is solid, above it is liquid.\n\nThe curve coming down from the top left might be the liquid-vapor curve.\n\nSo, below the solid-liquid curve is solid, above the liquid-vapor curve is liquid, and between them is the two-phase region of liquid and vapor coexisting.\n\nSo, point A is on the temperature axis, where pressure is zero. Depending on the substance, it could be the sublimation point.\n\nPoint B is above the triple point, between the two curves, which might be in the two-phase region of liquid and vapor.\n\nPoint C is above both curves, which might be the supercritical region where only the fluid phase exists.\n\nPoint D is on the liquid-vapor curve, indicating two-phase coexistence.\n\nPoint E is below both curves, which might be the solid phase.\n\nWait, but if the solid-liquid curve is the one starting from the origin and going up and to the right, then below that curve is the solid phase.\n\nSo, point E is below both curves, which means it's below the solid-liquid curve, so it should be solid.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nIn a typical phase diagram:\n\n- Below the solid-liquid curve: solid\n\n- Between the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor curves: liquid\n\n- Above the liquid-vapor curve: vapor (or supercritical fluid if above the critical point)\n\nSo, point E is below both curves, meaning below the solid-liquid curve, so it should be solely in the solid phase.\n\nPoint A is on the temperature axis, where pressure is zero, which might be the sublimation point, so it's where solid and vapor coexist.\n\nPoint B is between the two curves, which is the two-phase region of liquid and vapor.\n\nPoint C is above both curves, which might be the supercritical region where only the fluid phase exists, or it could be vapor.\n\nPoint D is on the liquid-vapor curve, indicating two-phase coexistence.\n\nPoint E is below both curves, so it should be solely in the solid phase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"solely in the solid phase at equilibrium.\" So, point E is in the solid phase region.\n\nHence, the answer is E.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
