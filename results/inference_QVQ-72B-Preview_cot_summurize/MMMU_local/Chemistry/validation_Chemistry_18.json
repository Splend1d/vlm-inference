                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, the experiment is about determining the mass percent of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) in eggshells by reacting it with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and measuring the pressure of the gas produced, which is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). They have a calibration graph that plots the pressure of gas produced against the mass of CaCO\u2083, and they've got data for an eggshell sample.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the chemical reaction here. CaCO\u2083 reacts with HCl to produce CO\u2082, calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082), and water. The balanced chemical equation is:\n\nCaCO\u2083(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 CO\u2082(g) + CaCl\u2082(aq) + H\u2082O(l)\n\nFrom this equation, one mole of CaCO\u2083 produces one mole of CO\u2082.\n\nNow, the calibration graph shows a linear relationship between the mass of CaCO\u2083 and the pressure of CO\u2082 produced. By analyzing this graph, I can find the slope, which should help me relate the pressure increase to the mass of CaCO\u2083.\n\nLooking at the graph:\n\n- At a mass of 0.05 g CaCO\u2083, the pressure is approximately 0.03 atm.\n\n- At 0.10 g, it's about 0.04 atm.\n\n- At 0.15 g, around 0.07 atm.\n\n- At 0.20 g, approximately 0.10 atm.\n\nSo, the slope (\u0394P/\u0394mass) is roughly (0.10 - 0.03)/(0.20 - 0.05) = 0.07 / 0.15 \u2248 0.467 atm/g.\n\nWait, but I should calculate the slope properly using two points. Let's pick two points for accuracy.\n\nTake (0.05 g, 0.03 atm) and (0.20 g, 0.10 atm).\n\nSlope = (0.10 - 0.03)/(0.20 - 0.05) = 0.07 / 0.15 = 0.4666... atm/g.\n\nSo, for every gram of CaCO\u2083, the pressure increases by approximately 0.467 atm.\n\nNow, for the eggshell sample:\n\nMass of eggshell sample = 0.200 g\n\nPressure prior to reaction = 0.800 atm\n\nPressure after completion of reaction = 0.870 atm\n\nSo, the pressure increase due to the reaction is 0.870 atm - 0.800 atm = 0.070 atm.\n\nAssuming that the only gas produced is CO\u2082, and that the volume and temperature are constant (since the reaction vessel is rigid and the pressure is measured at the same temperature), the pressure increase is directly proportional to the amount of CO\u2082 produced.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 1 mol CaCO\u2083 produces 1 mol CO\u2082.\n\nSo, the number of moles of CO\u2082 produced is equal to the number of moles of CaCO\u2083 in the eggshell.\n\nNow, the pressure of CO\u2082 is 0.070 atm.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law: PV = nRT\n\nSince volume (V) and temperature (T) are constant, P \u221d n\n\nTherefore, n = k * P, where k = V/(RT)\n\nBut since we're dealing with the pressure increase, which is proportional to the number of moles, we can use the pressure increase to find the number of moles of CO\u2082, and hence the number of moles of CaCO\u2083.\n\nBut, in this case, the calibration graph already relates the pressure increase to the mass of CaCO\u2083.\n\nFrom the calibration graph, a mass of 0.20 g CaCO\u2083 produces a pressure of 0.10 atm.\n\nSo, for a pressure increase of 0.070 atm, the mass of CaCO\u2083 can be found using the proportion:\n\n(0.20 g / 0.10 atm) = (x g / 0.070 atm)\n\nSo, x = (0.20 g * 0.070 atm) / 0.10 atm = 0.014 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of CaCO\u2083 in the 0.200 g eggshell sample is 0.014 g.\n\nTo find the mass percent of CaCO\u2083 in the eggshell, we use:\n\nMass percent = (mass of CaCO\u2083 / mass of eggshell) * 100% = (0.014 g / 0.200 g) * 100% = 7.0%\n\nSo, the eggshell is 7.0% CaCO\u2083 by mass.\n\nNow, moving on to the question about increasing the rate of the reaction:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Using 2.0 M CH\u2083COOH(aq) instead of 2.0 M HCl(aq)\n\nB. Cooling the HCl(aq) to a lower temperature than in the original experiment\n\nC. Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel\n\nD. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment\n\nI need to determine which of these modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the rate of a chemical reaction can be influenced by several factors:\n\n1. Concentration of reactants: Higher concentration generally leads to higher reaction rates.\n\n2. Temperature: Higher temperatures usually increase reaction rates.\n\n3. Surface area: Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant can increase the reaction rate.\n\n4. Nature of the reactants: Some reactants react faster than others due to their intrinsic properties.\n\n5. Presence of catalysts: Catalysts can increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Using 2.0 M CH\u2083COOH(aq) instead of 2.0 M HCl(aq)\n\nCH\u2083COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid, meaning it ionizes only partially in solution. On the other hand, HCl is a strong acid, which completely ionizes in solution to provide more hydrogen ions (H\u207a), which are the active species in the reaction with CaCO\u2083.\n\nSo, even though both solutions are 2.0 M, the HCl solution will have a much higher concentration of H\u207a ions, leading to a faster reaction rate. Therefore, switching to CH\u2083COOH would actually decrease the reaction rate compared to HCl.\n\nB. Cooling the HCl(aq) to a lower temperature than in the original experiment\n\nCooling the solution would decrease the temperature, which generally slows down chemical reactions. This is because lower temperatures reduce the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to fewer effective collisions between reactants.\n\nTherefore, this option would also decrease the reaction rate.\n\nC. Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel\n\nReducing the volume of the reaction vessel, assuming the amounts of reactants remain the same, would increase the concentrations of the reactants. Since concentration and pressure are related (in a sealed vessel), increasing the pressure could potentially increase the reaction rate.\n\nHowever, in this specific reaction, CaCO\u2083 is a solid, and HCl is in solution. Increasing the pressure might not directly affect the concentrations of solids or solutions, but in a sealed vessel, increasing the pressure could potentially affect the equilibrium or the reaction rate if it affects the concentration of gaseous products or reactants.\n\nBut in this case, since CO\u2082 is being produced as a gas, increasing the pressure might actually shift the equilibrium to favor reactants (le Chatelier's principle), potentially decreasing the yield of CO\u2082. However, the rate of reaction might still be affected by the concentration of H\u207a ions.\n\nThis option seems a bit unclear without more specific information about how the volume reduction affects the concentrations.\n\nD. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment\n\nBy grinding the eggshells into finer powder, we increase the surface area of the CaCO\u2083 particles. Increased surface area allows for more reactant particles to be exposed to the acid, leading to more simultaneous reactions and thus a higher reaction rate.\n\nThis is a common way to increase the rate of reactions involving solids.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems like the most straightforward way to increase the reaction rate significantly.\n\nBut let's think again about option C. If we reduce the volume of the reaction vessel, assuming the amounts of reactants are constant, the concentrations would increase. For HCl, a higher concentration would lead to a higher reaction rate, as more H\u207a ions are available to react with CaCO\u2083.\n\nHowever, in a sealed vessel, increasing the pressure might also affect the equilibrium of the reaction, possibly shifting it to consume more reactants or produce more products, depending on the gas laws.\n\nBut, in terms of reaction rate, increasing the concentration of HCl by reducing the volume would likely increase the reaction rate.\n\nComparing options C and D:\n\n- Reducing the volume increases the concentration of HCl, leading to a higher reaction rate.\n\n- Increasing the surface area of CaCO\u2083 by using finer powder also increases the reaction rate.\n\nBetween these two, which one would have a larger effect?\n\nIt depends on the extent to which the volume is reduced and how much finer the powder is.\n\nHowever, in general, significantly increasing the surface area can have a substantial impact on the reaction rate, especially for reactions involving solids.\n\nMoreover, since the reaction is between a solid (CaCO\u2083) and an aqueous solution (HCl), the surface area of the solid is a critical factor in determining the reaction rate.\n\nTherefore, I would posit that option D, using more finely powdered eggshells, would have a more pronounced effect on increasing the reaction rate compared to simply reducing the volume of the reaction vessel.\n\nAdditionally, reducing the volume might have other effects, such as increasing the pressure, which could potentially slow down the reaction if it shifts the equilibrium to favor reactants, as per le Chatelier's principle.\n\nGiven this, option D seems like the best choice for increasing the reaction rate the most.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A decreases the reaction rate.\n\n- Option B decreases the reaction rate.\n\n- Option C might increase or decrease the reaction rate, depending on the specifics, but could potentially increase it by increasing HCl concentration.\n\n- Option D increases the reaction rate by increasing the surface area of the solid reactant.\n\nTherefore, the modification that will increase the rate of the reaction the most is option D: using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
