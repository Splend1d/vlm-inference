There are two solutions, A and B, and I need to find out the mass of calcium hydroxide that was dissolved to make Solution A. The problem gives me the concentration and volume of Solution A and some information about Solution B, but it seems like the main focus is on finding the mass of calcium hydroxide in Solution A.\n\nFirst, let's look at Solution A. It's a calcium hydroxide solution with a concentration of 0.350 M and a volume of 500. mL. I remember that molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution. So, if I have 0.350 moles of calcium hydroxide per liter of solution, I can calculate the number of moles in 500 mL.\n\nWait, but the volume is given in milliliters, and molarity is in moles per liter. So, I need to convert the volume from milliliters to liters. I know that 1 L is equal to 1000 mL, so 500 mL is 0.500 L.\n\nNow, using the formula for molarity:\n\nM = moles / liters\n\nI can rearrange this to find moles:\n\nmoles = M \u00d7 liters\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nmoles = 0.350 M \u00d7 0.500 L = 0.175 moles\n\nSo, there are 0.175 moles of calcium hydroxide in Solution A.\n\nNext, I need to find the mass of calcium hydroxide. To do that, I'll use the molar mass of calcium hydroxide, which is given as 74.093 g/mol.\n\nI can set up the calculation as follows:\n\nmass = moles \u00d7 molar mass\n\nmass = 0.175 moles \u00d7 74.093 g/mol\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.175 by 74.093.\n\nWell, 0.175 \u00d7 70 = 12.25\n\n0.175 \u00d7 4.093 = let's see, 0.175 \u00d7 4 = 0.7\n\n0.175 \u00d7 0.093 = approximately 0.01635\n\nSo, total mass \u2248 12.25 + 0.7 + 0.01635 = 12.96635 g\n\nRounding to three decimal places, that's 12.966 g.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the number of significant figures to use in the answer. The given values are 0.350 M (three decimal places) and 500. mL (three decimal places), and the molar mass is given to five decimal places. So, for consistency, I should carry my answer to at least three decimal places, which is 12.966 g.\n\nHowever, I should consider the uncertainty in the molar mass and the measurements. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with that.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions Solution B, but it's not clear how that relates to Solution A. Solution B has a volume of 300. mL and an unknown concentration. Maybe it's part of a dilution or something, but the question specifically asks for the mass of calcium hydroxide in Solution A.\n\nPerhaps the connection between Solutions A and B isn't necessary for this particular question, or maybe it's part of a larger problem that isn't fully presented here.\n\nIn any case, based on the information given, the mass of calcium hydroxide in Solution A is approximately 12.966 grams.\n\nJust to double-check my calculations:\n\nFirst, converted 500 mL to liters: 500 / 1000 = 0.500 L\n\nThen, moles = M \u00d7 L = 0.350 \u00d7 0.500 = 0.175 moles\n\nMass = moles \u00d7 molar mass = 0.175 \u00d7 74.093 \u2248 12.966 g\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 12.966 grams of calcium hydroxide were dissolved to make Solution A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12.966\\ \\text{g}} \\]"
