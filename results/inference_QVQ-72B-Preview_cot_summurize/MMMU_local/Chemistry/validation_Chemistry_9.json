                    "text": "So I have this question about the addition of bromine to propene, and I need to figure out if the orientation of the product is Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov. The reaction is shown with propene reacting with bromine and water to form a bromohydrin, which has an OH group and a Br atom on adjacent carbon atoms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Markovnikov and non-Markovnikov orientations mean in the context of addition reactions to alkenes. Markovnikov's rule states that when an asymmetrical molecule adds to an alkene, the positive part of the reagent adds to the carbon with more hydrogen atoms (or less substituted carbon). Conversely, non-Markovnikov orientation would have the positive part adding to the carbon with fewer hydrogen atoms (or more substituted carbon).\n\nIn the given reaction, propene (CH3CH=CH2) is reacting with bromine and water to form CH3CHBrCH2OH. So, the bromine is attached to the middle carbon, and the OH group is on the end carbon.\n\nWait a minute, the product shown here is CH3CHBrCH2OH, which seems to have the bromine on the middle carbon and the OH on the end carbon. But according to Markovnikov's rule, if bromine is adding in a Markovnikov fashion, bromine should attach to the more substituted carbon, which in propene is the middle carbon. So, bromine adds to the middle carbon, and water adds with the OH group going to the less substituted carbon, which is the end carbon.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like the bromine is on the middle carbon, and the OH is on the end carbon, which aligns with Markovnikov's rule.\n\nBut the question mentions that when an unsymmetrical alkene like propene is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the major product has the bromine atom bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom. That sounds like non-Markovnikov addition, because the bromine is going to the less substituted carbon.\n\nSo, there seems to be a contradiction here. The initial reaction shows a Markovnikov addition, but the description about NBS says that bromine adds to the less substituted carbon, which would be non-Markovnikov.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction conditions affect the orientation. Perhaps with NBS in DMSO, the addition follows a different mechanism that leads to non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nLet me think about the mechanism of bromination of alkenes. Typically, bromine adds to alkenes via an electrophilic addition mechanism. In the presence of water, it can form a bromohydrin via an anti-Markovnikov addition, but that's usually catalyzed by peroxides or other conditions.\n\nBut in this case, the reaction is with NBS, which is used for allylic bromination. NBS reacts with alkenes to brominate the allylic position, which is the carbon adjacent to the double bond.\n\nSo, perhaps the mechanism here is different from direct addition of bromine to the double bond.\n\nLet me recall how NBS reacts with alkenes. NBS is primarily used for selective bromination at allylic positions, often through a radical mechanism, especially in the presence of light or peroxides.\n\nIn the reaction with NBS, the bromine is introduced at the allylic position, which is the carbon adjacent to the double bond. In propene, there are two allylic positions, but depending on the conditions, one may be favored over the other.\n\nBut the description says that the bromine is bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom, which in propene would be the methyl carbon, not the middle carbon.\n\nWait, in propene, the carbons are: methyl (less substituted) and methylene (more substituted). If bromine is bonding to the less highly substituted carbon, that would be the methyl carbon.\n\nBut in the initial reaction, the product shown has bromine on the middle carbon, which is the more substituted carbon, and OH on the end carbon.\n\nSo, there's a confusion here. Maybe the reaction with NBS gives a different product than the direct addition of bromine and water.\n\nPerhaps the reaction with NBS in aqueous DMSO proceeds via a different mechanism, leading to a different orientation of bromine addition.\n\nLet me consider the mechanism of NBS bromination in aqueous DMSO. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent that can stabilize radicals, so it might favor a radical mechanism.\n\nIn a radical bromination, the bromine atom abstracts a hydrogen from the allylic position, forming an allylic radical. Then, NBS reacts with the radical to introduce bromine at that position.\n\nIn propene, the allylic positions are the methyl carbon and the middle carbon. The methyl carbon is primary, and the middle carbon is secondary. Radicals can be stabilized by hyperconjugation, so the secondary radical might be more stable and thus favored.\n\nBut the description says that bromine is bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom, which would be the methyl carbon, the primary carbon.\n\nThis seems contradictory. If the secondary radical is more stable, why would the bromine prefer to go to the primary carbon?\n\nMaybe in the presence of DMSO and water, the reaction proceeds via a different pathway that directs the bromine to the primary carbon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction involves initial epoxidation or another pathway that leads to bromine ending up on the primary carbon.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a direct radical bromination. Perhaps there's a different mechanism involved.\n\nLet me consider the reagents again: NBS and aqueous DMSO. NBS is N-bromosuccinimide, which is a source of bromine atoms. DMSO is dimethyl sulfoxide, which is a strong solvent that can participate in reactions.\n\nPerhaps in aqueous DMSO, there's a pathway where bromine is generated in situ and then adds to the alkene in a non-Markovnikov fashion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a bromination followed by hydration, but under conditions that favor non-Markovnikov addition.\n\nI need to think differently. Maybe look up how NBS reacts with alkenes in aqueous DMSO.\n\nUpon a quick search in my mind, I recall that NBS can be used for selective bromination of allylic positions, often via radical mechanisms. However, in polar solvents like DMSO, the mechanism might shift towards a more polar pathway.\n\nPerhaps in aqueous DMSO, there's a polar mechanism that leads to bromine adding to the less substituted carbon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an initial bromination at the double bond, followed by a rearrangement or another step that ultimately places the bromine on the primary carbon.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at an example or recall a similar reaction.\n\nI remember that in the allylic bromination with NBS, the bromine typically goes to the allylic position, which is the carbon adjacent to the double bond. In propene, there are two allylic positions: the methyl carbon and the middle carbon.\n\nIf the bromine is going to the less substituted carbon, that would be the methyl carbon.\n\nBut in the initial reaction, the product shown has bromine on the middle carbon and OH on the end carbon, which seems to be a Markovnikov addition.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Markovnikov addition of bromine and water to propene, forming the bromohydrin with bromine on the middle carbon and OH on the end carbon.\n\nThen, the question mentions that with NBS in aqueous DMSO, the major product has bromine on the less substituted carbon, which would be the methyl carbon.\n\nSo, these are two different reactions and products.\n\nThe question is asking about the orientation of the product when using NBS in aqueous DMSO, and whether that is Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov.\n\nGiven that bromine is bonding to the less substituted carbon atom in this case, which is the primary carbon, that would be non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nIn Markovnikov's rule, the positive part (bromine in this case) would bond to the more substituted carbon.\n\nTherefore, if bromine is bonding to the less substituted carbon, it's a non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the context of NBS bromination, especially in polar solvents like DMSO, it's possible that the reaction proceeds via a different mechanism that favors bromination at the primary carbon.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of water might influence the reaction pathway, perhaps leading to hydration followed by bromination or vice versa.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that the bromine is ending up on the less substituted carbon, which is non-Markovnikov.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
