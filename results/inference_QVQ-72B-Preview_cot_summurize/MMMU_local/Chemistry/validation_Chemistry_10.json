                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this electrochemical cell diagram and a table of standard reduction potentials. The cell has a zinc electrode in 1.0 M Zn\u00b2\u207a solution and a silver electrode in 1.0 M Ag\u207a solution, connected by a salt bridge and a voltmeter. The table gives the half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials:\n\nAg\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s) with E\u00b0 = +0.80 V\n\nZn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s) with E\u00b0 = \u22120.76 V\n\nThe question is asking for the net ionic equation for the overall reaction that occurs as the cell operates. I need to find the spontaneous reaction that happens when the cell is operating.\n\nFirst, I should identify which half-reaction is the oxidation and which is the reduction. In a galvanic cell, the anode is where oxidation occurs, and the cathode is where reduction occurs. The overall cell potential (E\u00b0cell) is the difference between the cathode and anode potentials.\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials:\n\nE\u00b0(Ag\u207a/Ag) = +0.80 V\n\nE\u00b0(Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn) = \u22120.76 V\n\nSince Ag\u207a has a higher reduction potential, it will be reduced at the cathode, and Zn\u00b2\u207a will be reduced at the anode, but wait\u2014actually, no. The reduction potential indicates the tendency to be reduced. So, Ag\u207a has a stronger tendency to be reduced to Ag(s) than Zn\u00b2\u207a does to be reduced to Zn(s).\n\nBut in reality, the cell will spontaenously run in the direction where the overall cell potential is positive. So, the cathode should have the higher reduction potential, and the anode should have the lower reduction potential.\n\nTherefore, Ag\u207a will be reduced at the cathode:\n\nAg\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s)\n\nAnd Zn will be oxidized at the anode:\n\nZn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b\n\nTo find the overall cell reaction, I need to combine these half-reactions. First, balance the electrons in the half-reactions.\n\nThe cathode reaction is:\n\nAg\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s)\n\nThe anode reaction is:\n\nZn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b\n\nTo balance the electrons, I can multiply the cathode reaction by 2:\n\n2 Ag\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b \u2192 2 Ag(s)\n\nNow, add the anode reaction:\n\nZn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b\n\nSo, combining them:\n\n2 Ag\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b + Zn(s) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2 e\u207b\n\nCancel out the electrons:\n\n2 Ag\u207a(aq) + Zn(s) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq)\n\nSo, the net ionic equation should be:\n\n2 Ag\u207a(aq) + Zn(s) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq)\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) \u2192 Ag\u00b2\u207a(aq) + Zn(s)\n\nB. Ag\u207a(aq) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 3 e\u207b \u2192 AgZn(s)\n\nC. Ag\u207a(aq) + Zn(s) \u2192 Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + e\u207b\n\nD. 2 Ag\u207a(aq) + Zn(s) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq)\n\nOption D matches the equation I derived. Let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: This seems to suggest that silver is oxidized and zinc is reduced, which is the opposite of what should happen.\n\nOption B: This has zinc ions reacting with silver ions and electrons, which isn't consistent with the cell described.\n\nOption C: This shows a single Ag\u207a reacting with Zn to form Ag and Zn\u00b2\u207a, but the electrons aren't balanced. It shows one electron being produced, but for Ag\u207a to be reduced to Ag, it needs one electron, and Zn to Zn\u00b2\u207a requires two electrons. So, the electron balance is off.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct net ionic equation for the overall reaction in the cell.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the cell potential calculation.\n\nE\u00b0cell = E\u00b0(cathode) - E\u00b0(anode) = +0.80 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.56 V\n\nSince E\u00b0cell is positive, the reaction is spontaneous in the direction written, which is option D.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
