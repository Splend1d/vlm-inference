                    "text": "So I've got this titration curve here, and it's showing the pH changes as a strong acid is added to sodium oxalate. The curve has two distinct drops, which suggests that there are two equivalence points, labeled as E and F. The volumes where these drops occur are marked as G and H on the x-axis, which represents the volume of strong acid added.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's happening during this titration. Sodium oxalate (Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084) is a salt of a weak diprotic acid, oxalic acid (H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084). It means that oxalate ion (C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b) can accept protons stepwise to form hydrogen oxalate ion (HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b) and then oxalic acid (H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084).\n\nSo, when we add a strong acid like HCl to sodium oxalate, the chloride ions (Cl\u207b) are just spectator ions, and the protons (H\u207a) from HCl will react with the oxalate ions (C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b).\n\nThe reaction can be thought of in two steps:\n\n1. C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b + H\u207a \u21cc HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b\n\n2. HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b + H\u207a \u21cc H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084\n\nEach of these reactions corresponds to one of the drops in the titration curve. The first equivalence point (E) would be when all the C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b have been converted to HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b, and the second equivalence point (F) would be when all the HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b have been converted to H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the predominant species in solution at point E. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 and HCl\n\nWell, Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 is the original substance, and HCl is being added. At the first equivalence point, all the C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b should have reacted with H\u207a to form HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b. So, there shouldn't be any remaining Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 or HCl at the equivalence point because they've reacted completely.\n\nB. Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b\n\nThis seems plausible. Na\u207a and Cl\u207b are spectator ions, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b is the product of the first reaction. At the first equivalence point, the concentration of HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b should be at its highest before the second equivalence point where it starts to decrease as it reacts further to form H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084.\n\nC. C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b and H\u207a\n\nNo, at the first equivalence point, all C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b should have reacted with H\u207a to form HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b. So, there shouldn't be any C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b or excess H\u207a left.\n\nD. Na\u207a, H\u207a, and C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n\nAgain, at the first equivalence point, all C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b should have reacted with H\u207a to form HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b, so there shouldn't be any C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b or excess H\u207a left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nThe reaction between Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 and HCl is:\n\nNa\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 + HCl \u2192 NaCl + NaHC\u2082O\u2084\n\nSo, at the first equivalence point, the moles of HCl added equal the moles of Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 present, and the products are NaCl and NaHC\u2082O\u2084.\n\nTherefore, in solution, we have Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b from NaHC\u2082O\u2084.\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be any remaining C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b or H\u207a.\n\nNo, because at the first equivalence point, all C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b have reacted with H\u207a to form HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b. So, no C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b or H\u207a should be left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
