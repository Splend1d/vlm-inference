So, we have a Lewis structure here that shows a metal ion with a 2+ charge, represented as [M\u00b2\u207a], and a nonmetal ion with a 2\u2212 charge, represented as [X\u00b2\u207b]. These ions are combined to form a compound, as indicated by the brackets and the overall charge of zero.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what elements M and X could be. The problem states that they are from the third period of the periodic table. Let's recall that the third period includes elements from sodium (Na) to argon (Ar).\n\nGiven that M is a metal ion with a 2+ charge, I should look at the metals in the third period that can form a 2+ ion. The metals in the third period are sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), and silicon (Si). However, sodium typically forms a 1+ ion, magnesium forms a 2+ ion, aluminum forms a 3+ ion, and silicon is a semiconductor that usually forms covalent bonds. So, magnesium (Mg) seems like a likely candidate for M, as it commonly forms the Mg\u00b2\u207a ion.\n\nNext, for X, which is a nonmetal ion with a 2\u2212 charge, I should look at the nonmetals in the third period that can form a 2\u2212 ion. The nonmetals in the third period include phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl). Phosphorus typically forms a 3\u2212 ion (P\u00b3\u207b), sulfur forms a 2\u2212 ion (S\u00b2\u207b), and chlorine forms a 1\u2212 ion (Cl\u207b). So, sulfur (S) seems like a likely candidate for X, as it matches the 2\u2212 charge shown in the Lewis structure.\n\nTo confirm this, let's think about the compound formation. If M is Mg\u00b2\u207a and X is S\u00b2\u207b, combining one Mg\u00b2\u207a and one S\u00b2\u207b would result in a neutral compound, MgS. This makes sense because the charges balance each other out: +2 and -2 equal zero.\n\nAlternatively, if X were to be P\u00b3\u207b, to balance with Mg\u00b2\u207a, we would need two Mg\u00b2\u207a ions to balance one P\u00b3\u207b ion, resulting in Mg\u2082P. However, that doesn't align with the given Lewis structure, which shows only one M\u00b2\u207a and one X\u00b2\u207b ion. Therefore, S\u00b2\u207b is a better fit.\n\nAnother possibility for X could be O\u00b2\u207b, but oxygen is in the second period, not the third. So, sulfur is indeed the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the formula of the compound is MgS.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this with the Lewis structures. The Lewis structure for Mg\u00b2\u207a would be just Mg, since it loses its two valence electrons. The Lewis structure for S\u00b2\u207b would be [S] with eight valence electrons, following the octet rule.\n\nIn the given image, it's likely that M is represented by a central atom with no valence electrons (like Mg\u00b2\u207a), and X has eight valence electrons (like S\u00b2\u207b). So, yes, MgS seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other combinations possible. For example, if M were aluminum (Al), which forms Al\u00b3\u207a, but that doesn't match the M\u00b2\u207a in the diagram. Similarly, if X were chlorine (Cl), which forms Cl\u207b, but that doesn't match the X\u00b2\u207b in the diagram.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible combination based on the given Lewis structure and the elements from the third period is MgS.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{MgS}} \\]"
