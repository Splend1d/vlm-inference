                    "text": "Let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. I have a particle of mass \\( m \\) moving in two dimensions under the potential \\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\). I need to find the energy spectrum of this system. The options provided are:\n\nA. \\( E = (3n_x + 2n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nB. \\( E = (2n_x + 3n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nC. \\( E = (n_x + 3n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nD. \\( E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given potential. It's a function of both \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\), which suggests that the problem might be separable in polar coordinates. However, the presence of \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) \\) indicates that the potential isn't radially symmetric, which complicates things a bit.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, for systems with central potentials (i.e., potentials that depend only on \\( r \\)), the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be separated into radial and angular parts. But here, the potential depends on both \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\), so separation of variables might not be straightforward.\n\nLet me try to simplify the potential. The given potential is:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nI can factor out \\( \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\):\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 (1 + 3 \\cos^2(\\theta)) \\)\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\), I can rewrite the potential as:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\left(1 + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\right) \\)\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\( 1 + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} = 1 + \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cos(2\\theta) = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cos(2\\theta) \\)\n\nSo, the potential becomes:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\left(\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cos(2\\theta)\\right) = \\frac{5}{4} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{4} k r^2 \\cos(2\\theta) \\)\n\nThis looks like a combination of a radial potential and an angular-dependent term. This resembles a perturbed harmonic oscillator potential.\n\nSince the potential has terms involving \\( r^2 \\) and \\( \\cos(2\\theta) \\), I might consider separating the variables and treating the angular part as a perturbation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the unperturbed Hamiltonian with only the radial term:\n\n\\( V_0(r) = \\frac{5}{4} k r^2 \\)\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{m}} \\). The energy levels for a simple harmonic oscillator are:\n\n\\( E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega \\)\n\nWhere \\( n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots \\)\n\nBut since we're in two dimensions, the angular momentum quantum number \\( m_l \\) also comes into play. However, in polar coordinates, the angular part is usually separated, but here, the potential depends on \\( \\theta \\), which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can transform to Cartesian coordinates to see if the potential can be expressed in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which might make separation easier.\n\nLet's express \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\)\n\n\\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\)\n\nBut substituting these into the potential might not simplify things immediately. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can treat the angular-dependent term as a perturbation to the radial potential. In that case, I can use perturbation theory to find the energy levels.\n\nThe perturbation \\( V_1 \\) is:\n\n\\( V_1 = \\frac{3}{4} k r^2 \\cos(2\\theta) \\)\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, \\( \\cos(2\\theta) = \\cos^2(\\theta) - \\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2} \\), but this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the angular part in terms of ladder operators or use the fact that \\( \\cos(2\\theta) \\) corresponds to \\( m = 0 \\) and \\( m = \\pm 2 \\) in some sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the potential in terms of \\( r^2 \\) and \\( \\theta \\), and recall that in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian for a particle in two dimensions is:\n\n\\( H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right) + V(r, \\theta) \\)\n\nGiven the complexity of the potential, solving this directly seems challenging. Maybe I should look for separability or use perturbation theory.\n\nLet's try perturbation theory. The unperturbed Hamiltonian \\( H_0 \\) corresponds to the radial potential \\( V_0(r) = \\frac{5}{4} k r^2 \\), which is a simple harmonic oscillator with frequency \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{m}} \\).\n\nThe energy levels for this oscillator are:\n\n\\( E_n^{(0)} = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega \\), where \\( n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots \\)\n\nIn two dimensions, the angular momentum quantum number \\( m_l \\) also affects the energy levels, but for a pure harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on \\( n \\).\n\nNow, the perturbation \\( V_1 = \\frac{3}{4} k r^2 \\cos(2\\theta) \\). To find the first-order correction to the energy, I need to compute the matrix element \\( \\langle n, m_l | V_1 | n, m_l \\rangle \\).\n\nHowever, this seems complicated because \\( V_1 \\) depends on \\( \\theta \\), and the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are products of radial and angular parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( V_1 \\) in terms of spherical harmonics or some other basis that is compatible with the unperturbed eigenfunctions.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me look back at the original potential:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nI can rewrite this as:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 (1 + 3 \\cos^2(\\theta)) \\)\n\nThis looks similar to a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with an additional angular-dependent term.\n\nIn two dimensions, a standard harmonic oscillator potential is \\( V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\), which has energy levels \\( E = (n + 1) \\hbar \\omega \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut in this case, the potential is modified by the \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) \\) term, which suggests that the angular part is affecting the energy levels.\n\nPerhaps I can think of this as a combination of two oscillators, one in the \\( x \\)-direction and one in the \\( y \\)-direction, with different frequencies.\n\nLet's express the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n\n\\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\)\n\n\\( \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) \\left( \\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \\right) \\)\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n\\( \\frac{3}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} = \\frac{3}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the potential becomes:\n\n\\( V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k \\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 \\)\n\nThis is interesting. The potential can be expressed as:\n\n\\( V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 \\)\n\nThis is a separable potential in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which means I can treat the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-motions independently.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is then:\n\n\\( H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 \\)\n\nThis can be separated into two independent Hamiltonians:\n\n\\( H_x = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + 2 k x^2 \\)\n\n\\( H_y = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 \\)\n\nEach of these is a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies.\n\nThe energy levels for \\( H_x \\) are:\n\n\\( E_{n_x}^{(x)} = \\left( n_x + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_x \\), where \\( \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 k}{m}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( H_y \\):\n\n\\( E_{n_y}^{(y)} = \\left( n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_y \\), where \\( \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k/2}{m}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nTherefore, the total energy is the sum of the energies in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions:\n\n\\( E = E_{n_x}^{(x)} + E_{n_y}^{(y)} = \\left( n_x + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_x + \\left( n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_y \\)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( \\omega_x \\) and \\( \\omega_y \\):\n\n\\( E = \\left( n_x + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} + \\left( n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nThis seems quite different from the options provided. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the frequencies.\n\nLet me double-check the frequencies.\n\nFor a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the frequency is \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\), where \\( k \\) is the force constant.\n\nIn the \\( x \\)-direction, the potential is \\( 2 k x^2 \\), so the force constant is \\( 2 k \\), hence \\( \\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k}{m}} \\).\n\nWait, earlier I mistakenly wrote \\( \\omega_x = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\), which was incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, for the \\( y \\)-direction, the potential is \\( \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 \\), so \\( \\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k/2}{m}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\).\n\nSo, correcting that, the total energy is:\n\n\\( E = \\left( n_x + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_x + \\left( n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega_y = \\left( n_x + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k}{m}} + \\left( n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe there's a better way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of normal modes or some other transformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can define new coordinates such that the potential becomes a sum of two identical oscillators.\n\nLet me consider the following transformation:\n\nLet \\( q_1 = x \\) and \\( q_2 = y \\), then the potential is:\n\n\\( V = 2 k q_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k q_2^2 \\)\n\nThis is already diagonal in these coordinates, but the frequencies are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rotate the coordinate system to make the frequencies equal.\n\nLet me try a rotation by an angle \\( \\phi \\):\n\n\\( x' = x \\cos \\phi + y \\sin \\phi \\)\n\n\\( y' = -x \\sin \\phi + y \\cos \\phi \\)\n\nThen, express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\), and substitute back into the potential.\n\nHowever, this seems time-consuming, and maybe there's a simpler approach.\n\nLet me look back at the original potential in polar coordinates:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nPerhaps I can consider this as a radial potential modified by the angular term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can treat this as a perturbation to the standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator has a potential \\( V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\), with energy levels \\( E = (n + 1) \\hbar \\omega \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut in this case, the potential is modified by the \\( \\cos^2(\\theta) \\) term, which introduces an angular dependence.\n\nPerhaps I can use perturbation theory to find the energy levels, considering the \\( \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\) term as a perturbation.\n\nIn that case, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is:\n\n\\( H_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\)\n\nThe eigenfunctions of \\( H_0 \\) are:\n\n\\( \\psi_{n, m} = R_{n}(r) \\Theta_{m}(\\theta) \\)\n\nWhere \\( R_{n}(r) \\) is the radial part and \\( \\Theta_{m}(\\theta) \\) is the angular part, with \\( m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots \\)\n\nThe energy levels are:\n\n\\( E_{n, m}^{(0)} = \\left( 2n + |m| + 1 \\right) \\hbar \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\)\n\nNow, the perturbation \\( V_1 = \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nTo find the first-order correction to the energy, I need to compute:\n\n\\( E_{n, m}^{(1)} = \\langle n, m | V_1 | n, m \\rangle \\)\n\nThis requires integrating over the unperturbed eigenfunctions.\n\nThis seems quite involved, and I'm not sure if it's the best approach given the time constraints.\n\nMaybe there's a smarter way to look at this.\n\nLet me consider the potential again:\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nI can factor out \\( \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 \\):\n\n\\( V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 ("
