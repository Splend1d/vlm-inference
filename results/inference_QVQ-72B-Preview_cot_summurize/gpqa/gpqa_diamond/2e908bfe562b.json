                    "text": "So I'm trying to find the scalar potential \\(v\\) and the vector potential \\(\\vec{a}\\) for a moving point charge \\(q\\) with a trajectory \\(\\vec{s}(t)\\). The field is observed at a point \\(\\vec{r}\\) at time \\(t\\), and there's a vector \\(\\vec{d}\\) from the point where the field was generated at an earlier time \\(t_r\\) to the observation point \\(\\vec{r}\\). The charge has a velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) at the field generating instant \\(t_r\\), and we're given that \\(t > t_r\\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge. I remember that in electrodynamics, for a time-varying charge distribution, the potentials are given in terms of the retarded time, which accounts for the finite speed of light.\n\nThe retarded time \\(t_r\\) is defined such that the time it takes for the field to travel from the source to the observer is accounted for. Mathematically, \\(t_r = t - \\frac{r}{c}\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the source to the observer, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nBut in this problem, it seems like \\(\\vec{d}\\) is the vector from the field generating point to the observation point, so \\(d = |\\vec{d}|\\). The retarded time should be related to this distance \\(d\\), considering the charge's motion.\n\nI need to express the potentials in terms of \\(d\\), \\(\\vec{d}\\), and \\(\\vec{v}\\).\n\nLet me look up the general expressions for the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\nI recall that the scalar potential \\(v\\) is given by:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_q(t_r)|}\\]\n\nAnd the vector potential \\(\\vec{a}\\) is:\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}(t_r)}{4\\pi |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_q(t_r)|}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\vec{r}_q(t_r)\\) is the position of the charge at the retarded time \\(t_r\\), and \\(\\vec{v}(t_r)\\) is its velocity at that time.\n\nBut in this problem, \\(\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_q(t_r)\\), so \\(d = |\\vec{d}|\\).\n\nSo, the scalar potential becomes:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 d}\\]\n\nAnd the vector potential is:\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi d}\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options directly. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nI think I need to consider the Lorentz gauge condition, which relates the scalar and vector potentials in a specific way. The Lorentz gauge is:\n\n\\[\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{a} + \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = 0\\]\n\nBut perhaps in this problem, we're dealing with the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, which are the exact solutions for the potentials of a moving point charge.\n\nLet me recall the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 d_r}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi d_r}\\]\n\nWhere \\(d_r = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_q(t_r)|\\), which is \\(d\\) in this notation.\n\nBut none of the options directly match this. Maybe there's a different form.\n\nOption C has:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} v(\\vec{r}, t)\\]\n\nThis seems similar to the static case, but in the static case, the potentials are:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}) = 0\\]\n\nBut here, for a moving charge, \\(\\vec{a}\\) should not be zero. So, option C seems incomplete.\n\nOption B has:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}^2}{c^2} v(\\vec{r}, t)\\]\n\nThis also doesn't seem right, because \\(\\vec{a}\\) should be proportional to \\(\\vec{v}\\), not \\(\\vec{v}^2\\).\n\nOption D has:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\nThis looks similar to the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, but I need to confirm.\n\nI recall that the denominator in the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials involves the distance and the charge's velocity. Specifically, it includes a factor related to the retarded time and the charge's motion.\n\nLet me think about the denominator \\(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\). This resembles the denominator in the potentials for a moving charge, which often includes a term involving the charge's velocity and the direction to the observer.\n\nIn the standard Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is \\(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c\\), which is similar to \\(d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\) if we factor out \\(c\\):\n\n\\[d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} = c (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)\\]\n\nSo, option D can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 c (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi c (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}\\]\n\nThis looks more like the standard form of the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, where the denominator includes \\(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c\\).\n\nBut in the standard Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator is \\(d (1 - \\vec{v}/c \\cdot \\hat{d})\\), where \\(\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d\\) is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the observer.\n\nSo, \\(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c = d (1 - \\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)\\), which matches the standard form.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be correct, but let's check option A as well.\n\nOption A has:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\nThis is similar to option D but has a plus sign instead of a minus sign in the denominator.\n\nIn the standard Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potentials, the denominator includes \\(d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c\\), not \\(d c + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}\\).\n\nSo, option A seems incorrect because of the plus sign.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice.\n\nTo summarize, the scalar potential \\(v\\) and the vector potential \\(\\vec{a}\\) at time \\(t\\) and position \\(\\vec{r}\\) are given by:\n\n\\[v(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q c}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{a}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}\\]\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
