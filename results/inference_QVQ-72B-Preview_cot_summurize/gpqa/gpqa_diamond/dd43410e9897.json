                    "text": "So I have this problem about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state, and I need to find the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$. The system is in the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, which represents the coupled angular momentum state. I need to ignore spin for this problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this state means. The quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. So, both electrons are in p orbitals ($l=1$), and their combined angular momentum is $l=2$ with a z-component of $m=-1$.\n\nTo find the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, I need to find the probability that $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$ simultaneously.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when dealing with coupled angular momenta, the total state can be expressed in terms of the individual angular momenta or in terms of the coupled angular momenta. Here, we have a coupled state specified by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$.\n\nBut to find the probabilities of individual measurements, it's often helpful to express the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis, where each particle's angular momentum is specified separately.\n\nSo, I should express the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ in terms of the basis states where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are both specified with their own $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$.\n\nThe coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ can be expanded in terms of the uncoupled basis states $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe general expansion is:\n\n$$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle$$\n\nIn this problem, $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. So, we need to find all possible combinations of $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, where $m_1$ can be $-1, 0, 1$ and similarly for $m_2$.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = 0$\n\n2. $m_1 = 0$, $m_2 = -1$\n\n3. $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = -2$ but $m_2$ can only be $-1, 0, 1$, so this is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, only the first two combinations are possible.\n\nNow, I need to find the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for these combinations.\n\nFrom angular momentum coupling, we know that:\n\n$$|1, -1; 1, 0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2, -1\\rangle - |0, -1\\rangle)$$\n\n$$|1, 0; 1, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2, -1\\rangle + |0, -1\\rangle)$$\n\nBut in this problem, we are only dealing with $l = 2$ and $m = -1$, so the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ corresponds to the $l=2$, $m=-1$ component.\n\nWait, actually, I need to be careful. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients relate the coupled states to the uncoupled states.\n\nFor $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, coupling to $l = 2$, $m = -1$, the coefficients are:\n\n$$|1, -1; 1, 0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2, -1\\rangle - |0, -1\\rangle)$$\n\n$$|1, 0; 1, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2, -1\\rangle + |0, -1\\rangle)$$\n\nBut since we are only considering $l = 2$, $m = -1$, we can focus on the $|2, -1\\rangle$ component.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the specific Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, $m = -1$.\n\nFrom standard tables or derivations, we have:\n\n$$|1,1;2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,-1;1,0\\rangle + |1,0;1,-1\\rangle)$$\n\nIs that correct? Let me verify.\n\nActually, I think I need to recall the general formula for coupling two angular momenta.\n\nThe general formula for coupling two angular momenta $l_1$ and $l_2$ to get $l$ is:\n\n$$|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2\\rangle = \\sum_{l} \\langle l_1 m_1 l_2 m_2 | l m \\rangle |l, m\\rangle$$\n\nIn this case, $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $m = -1$, and $l = 2$.\n\nSo, we need to find the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 1 m_1 1 m_2 | 2 -1 \\rangle$ for the allowed $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\nFrom standard angular momentum coupling, we have:\n\n$$\\langle 1, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\n$$\\langle 1, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nTherefore, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$|1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,-1;1,0\\rangle + |1,0;1,-1\\rangle)$$\n\nNow, to find the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$, we need to consider the component of the state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nHowever, from the possible combinations earlier, $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, but $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ would require $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which contradicts $m = -1$. Therefore, the state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is not present in the $m = -1$ subspace.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nIf $m_1 + m_2 = -1$, and $m_1$ and $m_2$ can each be $-1$, $0$, or $1$, then the only possible combinations are:\n\n1. $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = 0$\n\n2. $m_1 = 0$, $m_2 = -1$\n\nThe combination $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ would give $m = -2$, which doesn't match $m = -1$, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, in the state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, there is no component where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, since that would require $m = -2$, which is inconsistent with the given $m = -1$.\n\nHence, the joint probability is zero.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using the properties of angular momentum coupling.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the individual probabilities and see if they are independent.\n\nFirst, the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\\hbar$ given that the total state is $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of measuring $L_{2z} = -\\hbar$.\n\nBut since the measurements are simultaneous, we need the joint probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the density matrix formalism, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nGiven that, I think the initial conclusion is correct: since the state with both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is not present in the $m = -1$ subspace, the joint probability is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
