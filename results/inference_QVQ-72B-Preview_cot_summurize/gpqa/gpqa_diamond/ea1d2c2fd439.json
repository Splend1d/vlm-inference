                    "text": "So I have this problem here about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four different sequences of reactions provided, and I need to figure out which one would lead to the highest yield of the desired product. I'm not super experienced with organic synthesis, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the target molecule is. It's called 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. From the name, I can see that it's derived from benzene with some substitutions. Let me try to draw its structure to get a better idea.\n\nStarting with benzene, there's a bromo group at the 3-position and a nitro group at the 5-position. Additionally, there's an acetyl group (from ethan-1-one) attached to the ring. So, the structure should have substitutions at positions 3 and 5, and an acetyl group somewhere. Wait, the name suggests that the acetyl group is attached to the ring at the 1-position, but I need to confirm that.\n\nActually, the name 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one suggests that the acetyl group is attached to the ring, specifically at the 1-position of the ethan-1-one moiety. So, the structure would be:\n\n```\n\nBr\n\n|\n\nC6H4 - C\n\n|\n\nNO2       O\n\n|\n\nC - CH3\n\n```\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me double-check. The name indicates that the ethan-1-one part is attached to the phenyl ring at the 1-position, and it's ketone, so the oxygen is bonded to the carbon that's also bonded to the methyl group.\n\nSo, more accurately:\n\n```\n\nBr\n\n|\n\nC6H3 - NO2\n\n|\n\nC(=O)-CH3\n\n```\n\nOkay, so the ring has bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5, and the acetyl group is attached to the ring, probably at position 1. Now, I need to think about how to introduce these groups step by step starting from benzene.\n\nLooking at the options, there are several reagents listed, and they correspond to different types of reactions:\n\n1. HNO3/H2SO4: This is nitration of benzene, which introduces a nitro group.\n\n2. Fe/HCl: This is likely for reducing a nitro group to an amine, or perhaps for some other reduction.\n\n3. CH3COCl/AlCl3: This is Friedel-Crafts acylation, which introduces an acyl group (like acetyl) to the benzene ring.\n\n4. Br2/FeBr3: This is bromination of benzene, introducing a bromo group.\n\n5. NaNO2/HCl: This is for diazotization, which is used to convert an amine to a diazonium salt.\n\n6. H3PO2: This is a reducing agent, possibly used for reducing diazonium salts to phenols.\n\n7. HNO3/H2SO4 again: Another nitration step.\n\nNow, I need to think about the order in which I should introduce these groups to minimize side reactions and maximize yield.\n\nFirst, considering that nitration, bromination, and Friedel-Crafts acylation all compete for positions on the benzene ring, I need to choose the order in a way that the desired substitutions end up at the correct positions.\n\nLet me consider the directing effects of each substituent:\n\n- Nitro group (-NO2): meta director, deactivator\n\n- Bromo group (-Br): ortho-para director, deactivator\n\n- Acetyl group (-COCH3): meta director, deactivator\n\nSo, introducing a nitro group will direct subsequent substitutions to the meta positions relative to it. Similarly, the bromo and acetyl groups will have their own directing effects.\n\nI need to place the bromo group at position 3 and the nitro group at position 5, with the acetyl group at position 1.\n\nLet me consider option A:\n\nA. i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n\nStep i: Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.\n\nStep ii: Reduce the nitro group to an amine using Fe/HCl.\n\nStep iii: Acylate the amine to introduce the acetyl group.\n\nWait, that seems off. If I reduce the nitro group to an amine and then acylate, I might get an amide rather than the desired ketone. Maybe I need to introduce the acetyl group directly onto the benzene ring via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nOption B:\n\nB. i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n\nStep i: Acylate benzene with acetyl chloride and AlCl3 to get acetophenone.\n\nStep ii: Brominate acetophenone to get 1-bromoacetophenone.\n\nWait, but bromination of acetophenone could occur at multiple positions depending on the conditions. Acetophenone has the acetyl group, which is meta directing, so bromination might occur at positions meta to the acetyl group.\n\nBut I need the bromo group at position 3 and nitro at position 5, with the acetyl group at position 1. This seems complicated.\n\nOption C:\n\nC. i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4\n\nStep i: Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.\n\nStep ii: Reduce nitrobenzene to aniline using Fe/HCl.\n\nStep iii: Diazotize aniline with NaNO2/HCl to get the diazonium salt.\n\nStep iv: Reduce the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to get phenol.\n\nStep v: Brominate phenol to get 2-bromophenol or 4-bromophenol.\n\nStep vi: Acylate the phenol with CH3COCl/AlCl3 to get the acetyl derivative.\n\nStep vii: Nitrate again to introduce another nitro group.\n\nThis seems like a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if this leads directly to the desired product.\n\nOption D:\n\nD. i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2\n\nStep i: Brominate benzene to get bromobenzene.\n\nStep ii: Nitrate bromobenzene to get 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene or 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n\nStep iii: Acylate the nitrobenzene derivative with CH3COCl/AlCl3 to introduce the acetyl group.\n\nStep iv: Nitrate again to introduce another nitro group.\n\nStep v: Reduce the nitro group using Fe/HCl.\n\nStep vi: Diazotize the amine with NaNO2/HCl.\n\nStep vii: Reduce the diazonium salt with H3PO2 to get the desired phenol.\n\nThis also seems involved, and I'm not sure about the positioning of the substituents.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps starting with benzene, introducing the acetyl group first to get acetophenone, then brominating to get 3-bromoacetophenone, and finally nitrating to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n\nWait, but in option B, it's suggested to acylate first, then brominate, then nitrate. But I need to ensure that the nitro group is placed at position 5 relative to the acetyl group at position 1.\n\nLet me draw the structure step by step for option B:\n\nStep i: Acetylate benzene to get acetophenone:\n\n```\n\n||\n\nC6H5 - C - CH3\n\n||\n\nO\n\n```\n\nStep ii: Brominate acetophenone. The acetyl group is meta directing, so bromination would occur at positions 3 and 5. To get the bromo group at position 3, I need to control the bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\nStep iii: Nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The bromo group is ortho-para directing, and the acetyl group is meta directing. The directing effects might compete, but generally, the bromo group is stronger, so nitration might occur at positions ortho and para to the bromo group. In 3-bromoacetophenone, the positions would be:\n\n- Position 2: ortho to bromo\n\n- Position 5: para to bromo\n\n- Position 4: unaffected by bromo, but meta to acetyl\n\nSo, nitration might give a mixture of 2-nitro and 5-nitro derivatives. To get the 5-nitro isomer, I might need to control the conditions to favor nitration at position 5.\n\nStep iv: Repeat nitration to introduce another nitro group. Now, with both bromo and nitro groups already present, the directing effects could lead to nitration at specific positions.\n\nThis seems complicated, and I'm not sure about the yields at each step.\n\nMaybe I should consider introducing the nitro groups first, then the bromo group, and finally the acetyl group.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.\n\n2. Nitrate nitrobenzene to get dinitrobenzene (1,3-dinitrobenzene or 1,4-dinitrobenzene).\n\n3. Brominate dinitrobenzene to get the desired bromo derivative.\n\n4. Acylate the bromonitrobenzene to introduce the acetyl group.\n\nBut I need the acetyl group directly attached to the ring, not to the nitro or bromo groups.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with nitration to get nitrobenzene, then brominating to get bromonitrobenzene, and finally acylating to introduce the acetyl group.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the acetyl group is introduced at the correct position relative to the bromo and nitro groups.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start by introducing the acetyl group first, then brominating, and finally nitrating.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\n1. Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to get acetophenone.\n\n2. Brominate acetophenone to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3. Nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's see:\n\nStep 1: Acetophenone\n\n```\n\n||\n\nC6H5 - C - CH3\n\n||\n\nO\n\n```\n\nStep 2: Bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone\n\n```\n\nBr\n\n|\n\nC6H4 - C - CH3\n\n|\n\nO\n\n```\n\nStep 3: Nitration to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone\n\n```\n\nBr\n\n|\n\nC6H3 - NO2 - C - CH3\n\n|\n\nO\n\n```\n\nYes, this matches the target molecule.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B seems to follow this sequence:\n\ni) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation to get acetophenone)\n\nii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination to get 3-bromoacetophenone)\n\niii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone)\n\nWait, but in option B, it continues with more steps: reduction, nitration, diazotization, etc. But according to my reasoning, only three steps are needed: acylation, bromination, and nitration.\n\nSo, perhaps the other steps are unnecessary for this target molecule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different sequence that could lead to the same product with higher yield.\n\nLet me consider starting with bromination:\n\n1. Brominate benzene to get bromobenzene.\n\n2. Nitrate bromobenzene to get 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene or 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n\n3. Acylate the nitrobenzene derivative to introduce the acetyl group.\n\nBut in this case, the acetyl group might not end up in the desired position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with nitration:\n\n1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.\n\n2. Acylate nitrobenzene to introduce the acetyl group.\n\n3. Brominate the acetylnitrobenzene derivative.\n\nBut again, the positioning might not be correct.\n\nI think the initial approach of acylation, then bromination, then nitration is the most straightforward.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B matches this sequence, at least for the first three steps. The subsequent steps seem unnecessary for the target molecule, so perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target molecule is being over-synthesized in the options, and I need to choose the one that stops at the correct point.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be on the right track initially, but continues with unnecessary steps.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence should be:\n\n1. Acylation of benzene to get acetophenone.\n\n2. Bromination of acetophenone to get 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3. Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone to get 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n\nThis should be the most straightforward and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nSo, among the given options, option B is the one that starts with this sequence, even though it continues with additional steps.\n\nTherefore, option B would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, beginning with benzene, provided that the synthesis is stopped after the third step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
