I need to find the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) in the given Lagrangian and determine whether the theory is renormalizable based on that.\n\nFirst, the Lagrangian is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2} [\\gamma_{\\mu}, \\gamma_{\\nu}]\\).\n\nI know that in quantum field theory, each field and coupling constant has a mass dimension, and the total dimension of the Lagrangian density should be [mass]^4 in 4 dimensions to have the action dimensionless, since the action is integrated over 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\nFirst, let's recall the dimensions of the fields involved:\n\n- \\(\\psi\\) is a Dirac spinor field, and it has dimension [mass]^(3/2).\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^{\\dagger} \\gamma^{0}\\), so it has the same dimension as \\(\\psi\\), which is [mass]^(3/2).\n\n- \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, which has dimension [mass]^2 because it's derived from the derivative of the vector potential \\(A_{\\mu}\\), which has dimension [mass]^1.\n\nNow, let's look at the Lagrangian term:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the dimension of \\(\\kappa\\). To do that, I'll set up an equation where the total dimension of the Lagrangian is [mass]^4.\n\nFirst, let's find the dimension of each part:\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\psi\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\): This is a combination of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless since they are matrices without any units. So, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n\n- \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\): [mass]^2\n\n- \\(\\kappa\\): We need to find this.\n\nSo, the dimension of the Lagrangian term is:\n\n\\[\n[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}}] = [\\kappa] \\times [\\bar{\\psi}] \\times [\\psi] \\times [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] \\times [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}}] = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2} = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{4}\n\\]\n\nBut the Lagrangian density should have dimension [mass]^4, so:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{4} = [mass]^{4}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] = [mass]^{0}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that would mean \\(\\kappa\\) is dimensionless. But none of the options say that. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nIs \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) really dimensionless? Let's verify.\n\nGiven that \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2} [\\gamma_{\\mu}, \\gamma_{\\nu}]\\), and gamma matrices are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless. So, yes, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is dimensionless.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, the definition of \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) might include factors that could carry dimensions, but in standard QFT, gamma matrices are indeed dimensionless.\n\nSo, with that in mind, my previous calculation suggests \\(\\kappa\\) is dimensionless. But the options all suggest \\(\\kappa\\) has some mass dimension, either -1 or 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider the spacetime dimensions. In 4 dimensions, as I assumed, the Lagrangian density should have dimension [mass]^4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in natural units where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\), dimensions are often expressed in terms of mass or energy.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the fermion fields' dimensions more carefully.\n\nIn 4 dimensions, the dimension of \\(\\psi\\) is indeed [mass]^(3/2), and \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) has the same dimension.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the dimension of \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). Let's double-check that.\n\nThe electromagnetic field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is defined as \\(\\partial^{\\mu} A^{\\nu} - \\partial^{\\nu} A^{\\mu}\\). In natural units, \\(\\partial\\) has dimension [mass], and \\(A_{\\mu}\\) has dimension [mass]^(-1), since it's a vector potential.\n\nWait, actually, in QED, the vector potential \\(A_{\\mu}\\) has dimension [mass]^1 because the gauge coupling \\(e\\) has dimension [mass]^(-1/2), and in the interaction term \\(e \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^{\\mu} \\psi A_{\\mu}\\), the dimensions should match.\n\nLet me verify the dimension of \\(A_{\\mu}\\):\n\nIn the QED Lagrangian, the kinetic term for the photon is \\(-\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}\\), and \\(F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu} - \\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\partial\\) has dimension [mass], and \\(F_{\\mu\\nu}\\) should have dimension [mass]^2, then:\n\n\\[\n[F_{\\mu\\nu}] = [\\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}] = [mass] \\times [mass]^1 = [mass]^2\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(A_{\\mu}\\) has dimension [mass]^1.\n\nThen, \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has dimension [mass]^2, which confirms my earlier assumption.\n\nNow, going back to the interaction Lagrangian:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nWith:\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\psi\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\): dimensionless\n\n- \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\): [mass]^2\n\n- \\(\\kappa\\): to be determined\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}}] = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^2 = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^4\n\\]\n\nAnd since the Lagrangian density should have dimension [mass]^4, we have:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] \\times [mass]^4 = [mass]^4 \\implies [\\kappa] = [mass]^0\n\\]\n\nAgain, this suggests \\(\\kappa\\) is dimensionless. But the options all involve \\(\\kappa\\) having a mass dimension of either -1 or 1.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in assuming the dimension of the fermion fields. Maybe in this context, their dimensions are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interaction is non-renormalizable, and the dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) needs to be adjusted to compensate for the higher dimension of the interaction term.\n\nWait, perhaps the interaction term is not dimensionless, and there's an implicit factor I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the units more carefully. In natural units where \\(\\hbar = c = 1\\), mass and energy have the same units.\n\nIn this setup, spacetime has dimensions of [length]^4, and the action \\(S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}\\) should be dimensionless.\n\nTherefore, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) should have dimensions [mass]^4.\n\nGiven that, and my previous calculation leading to \\([\\kappa] = [mass]^0\\), but the options suggest otherwise, maybe there's an error in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interaction term includes derivatives that I haven't accounted for.\n\nLooking back at the Lagrangian:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nI need to expand \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) to see if there are derivative terms involved.\n\nRecall that \\(F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial^{\\mu} A^{\\nu} - \\partial^{\\nu} A^{\\mu}\\), so it involves first derivatives of the vector potential.\n\nIn natural units, \\(\\partial\\) has dimension [mass], and \\(A_{\\mu}\\) has dimension [mass]^1, so \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has dimension [mass]^2, as previously stated.\n\nBut perhaps the presence of derivatives affects the overall dimension.\n\nWait, no. The dimension of \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is [mass]^2, and it's already included in the Lagrangian term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fermion bilinear \\(\\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi\\) has a different dimension than I thought.\n\nLet me consider the Dirac gamma matrices more carefully. In 4 dimensions, the gamma matrices are 4x4 matrices and are dimensionless. The combination \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless, as it's a product of gamma matrices.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi\\) has the same dimension as \\(\\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\), which is [mass]^3.\n\nMultiplying by \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) ([mass]^2), the total dimension is [mass]^5.\n\nBut the Lagrangian density should be [mass]^4, so:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] \\times [mass]^5 = [mass]^4 \\implies [\\kappa] = [mass]^{-1}\n\\]\n\nAh, that makes sense. I must have made a mistake earlier in adding the dimensions.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi\\) has dimension [mass]^3\n\n- \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has dimension [mass]^2\n\n- Therefore, their product has dimension [mass]^5\n\n- The Lagrangian density should be [mass]^4, so:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] \\times [mass]^5 = [mass]^4 \\implies [\\kappa] = [mass]^{-1}\n\\]\n\nSo, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\nNow, regarding renormalizability, a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions in 4 dimensions.\n\nIn this case, \\([\\kappa] = [mass]^{-1}\\), which is negative, so the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A:\n\nA. The mass dimension \\([\\kappa]_M = -1\\). The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, let me summarize:\n\n- \\(\\psi\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\): [mass]^(3/2)\n\n- \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\): dimensionless\n\n- \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\): [mass]^2\n\n- \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{int}}\\): [mass]^4\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n[\\kappa] \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^{3/2} \\times [mass]^2 = [\\kappa] \\times [mass]^5 = [mass]^4 \\implies [\\kappa] = [mass]^{-1}\n\\]\n\nAnd since the coupling constant has negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{A}"
