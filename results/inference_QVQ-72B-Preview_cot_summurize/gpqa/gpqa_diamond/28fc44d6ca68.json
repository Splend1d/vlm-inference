                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about nuclear physics and relativity, which can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, we have an atomic nucleus with mass M at rest. Its rest-mass energy is given as 300 GeV, which makes sense because energy and mass are related through Einstein's famous equation, E=mc\u00b2. So, 300 GeV corresponds to the mass energy of the nucleus.\n\nThis nucleus undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So, if we denote the rest mass of the less massive fragment as m, then the more massive one is 2m. Their total rest mass is m + 2m = 3m, and this is equal to 99% of M. So, we can write:\n\n3m = 0.99M\n\nFrom this, we can solve for m:\n\nm = 0.99M / 3\n\nm = 0.33M\n\nSo, the less massive fragment has a rest mass of 0.33M, and the more massive one has 0.66M.\n\nNow, since mass is being converted into energy during the fission process, there's a mass defect, which is the difference between the initial mass and the final mass. This mass defect is converted into energy, which appears as kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\nThe initial mass is M, and the final total rest mass is 0.99M. So, the mass defect \u0394m is:\n\n\u0394m = M - 0.99M = 0.01M\n\nThis mass defect corresponds to energy \u0394E = \u0394m * c\u00b2.\n\nNow, this energy \u0394E is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. We need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and then find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the non-relativistic approximation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conservation of momentum. Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. Let\u2019s denote the momenta of the two fragments as p1 and p2, and their velocities as v1 and v2.\n\nSo, p1 + p2 = 0\n\nBut p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), accounting for relativistic effects.\n\nHowever, dealing with relativistic momenta directly might be complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in nuclear fissions, the kinetic energy released is primarily due to the mass defect, and the fragments share this energy based on their masses.\n\nBut let's approach this more systematically.\n\nThe total energy before and after must be conserved. The initial energy is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, which is 300 GeV.\n\nAfter fission, the energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies.\n\nSo:\n\nInitial energy: E_initial = 300 GeV\n\nFinal energy: E_final = E1 + E2 = (rest energy of fragment 1) + (kinetic energy of fragment 1) + (rest energy of fragment 2) + (kinetic energy of fragment 2)\n\nBut since energy is conserved:\n\nE_initial = E_final\n\n300 GeV = (rest energy of fragment 1) + T1 + (rest energy of fragment 2) + T2\n\nWe know the rest energies of the fragments:\n\nRest energy of fragment 1: 2m * c\u00b2\n\nRest energy of fragment 2: m * c\u00b2\n\nWait, but we have m in terms of M.\n\nWait, earlier I found m = 0.33M, so 2m = 0.66M.\n\nBut in terms of energy:\n\nRest energy of fragment 1: 2m * c\u00b2 = 0.66M * c\u00b2\n\nRest energy of fragment 2: m * c\u00b2 = 0.33M * c\u00b2\n\nTotal rest energy after fission: 0.66M * c\u00b2 + 0.33M * c\u00b2 = 0.99M * c\u00b2\n\nBut initially, E_initial = M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of both fragments should be:\n\nT_total = E_initial - total rest energy after = M * c\u00b2 - 0.99M * c\u00b2 = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nBut we know that 0.01M * c\u00b2 = \u0394E = mass defect energy\n\nNow, this total kinetic energy T_total needs to be divided between the two fragments.\n\nTo find how the kinetic energy is divided, we can use the fact that the fragments move in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the kinetic energies as T1 and T2 for the more and less massive fragments, respectively.\n\nUsing conservation of momentum:\n\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momenta must add up to zero:\n\np1 + p2 = 0\n\nSo, p1 = -p2\n\nIn relativistic terms, momentum p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE = \u221a(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nFor fragment 1:\n\nE1 = \u221a(p1\u00b2c\u00b2 + (2m)\u00b2c\u2074) = \u221a(p1\u00b2c\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nSimilarly for fragment 2:\n\nE2 = \u221a(p2\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074) = \u221a(p2\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nBut since p1 = -p2, and energy is conserved:\n\nE1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV\n\nAlso, E1 = T1 + 2mc\u00b2\n\nE2 = T2 + mc\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 + 2mc\u00b2 + T2 + mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nBut T1 + T2 = \u0394E = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 + T2 = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nAnd T1 + T2 + 3mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nBut 3mc\u00b2 = 0.99M * c\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 + T2 + 0.99M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nBut T1 + T2 = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nSo, 0.01M * c\u00b2 + 0.99M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nWhich checks out, since M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.\n\nFor fragment 1:\n\nE1 = \u03b31 * 2mc\u00b2\n\np1 = \u03b31 * 2m * v1\n\nSimilarly for fragment 2:\n\nE2 = \u03b32 * mc\u00b2\n\np2 = \u03b32 * m * v2\n\nAnd since p1 + p2 = 0, we have p2 = -p1\n\nAlso, energy is conserved:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nNow, since p1 = -p2, and assuming they move along the same axis, we can write:\n\n\u03b31 * 2m * v1 = \u03b32 * m * v2\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in relativistic physics, the kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of the gamma factor:\n\nT = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2\n\nSo, for fragment 1:\n\nT1 = (\u03b31 - 1) * 2mc\u00b2\n\nFor fragment 2:\n\nT2 = (\u03b32 - 1) * mc\u00b2\n\nAnd we have T1 + T2 = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nAlso, since momentum is conserved, and p = \u03b3mv, and p1 + p2 = 0, we can relate \u03b31 and \u03b32 through their velocities.\n\nBut this seems too involved. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the non-relativistic approximation first, and then see how it differs from the relativistic calculation.\n\nIn the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by:\n\nT = (p\u00b2)/(2m)\n\nAnd momentum is conserved: p1 + p2 = 0\n\nSo, p2 = -p1\n\nThen, total kinetic energy:\n\nT_total = T1 + T2 = (p1\u00b2)/(2*(2m)) + (p1\u00b2)/(2m) = (p1\u00b2)/(4m) + (p1\u00b2)/(2m) = (p1\u00b2)(1/4m + 1/2m) = (p1\u00b2)(3/4m)\n\nBut T_total = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\n(p1\u00b2)(3/4m) = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nSolving for p1:\n\np1\u00b2 = (0.01M * c\u00b2) * (4m/3) = (0.04M * c\u00b2 * m)/3\n\nBut m = 0.33M, as found earlier.\n\nWait, m = 0.33M, but let's keep it in terms of M for generality.\n\nNow, in non-relativistic approximation, T1 = (p1\u00b2)/(4m)\n\nBut from above, T_total = (p1\u00b2)(3/4m) = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 = (4/3) * T_total / 3 = (4/9) * 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nWait, no. Let's recast this.\n\nFrom p1\u00b2 = (0.01M * c\u00b2) * (4m/3)\n\nThen, T1 = (p1\u00b2)/(4m) = [(0.01M * c\u00b2) * (4m/3)] / (4m) = (0.01M * c\u00b2)/3\n\nSimilarly, T2 = (p1\u00b2)/(2m) = [(0.01M * c\u00b2) * (4m/3)] / (2m) = (0.01M * c\u00b2)/1.5\n\nSo, T1 = (0.01M * c\u00b2)/3\n\nT2 = (0.01M * c\u00b2)/1.5\n\nBut T1 + T2 should equal 0.01M * c\u00b2:\n\n(0.01M * c\u00b2)/3 + (0.01M * c\u00b2)/1.5 = (0.01M * c\u00b2)(1/3 + 2/3) = (0.01M * c\u00b2)(1) = 0.01M * c\u00b2\n\nGood, it checks out.\n\nNow, what is M * c\u00b2? It's 300 GeV, as given.\n\nSo, T1 = (0.01 * 300 GeV)/3 = (3 GeV)/3 = 1 GeV\n\nT2 = (0.01 * 300 GeV)/1.5 = (3 GeV)/1.5 = 2 GeV\n\nSo, in the non-relativistic approximation, T1 is 1 GeV.\n\nNow, we need to find the correct relativistic value of T1 and compare it to this 1 GeV.\n\nTo find the relativistic value, we need to use the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total energy of fragment 1 as E1 = \u03b31 * 2mc\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, E2 = \u03b32 * mc\u00b2\n\nAnd E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nAlso, p1 + p2 = 0\n\nAnd T1 + T2 = 0.01M * c\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nNow, in relativistic terms, E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, and T = (\u03b3 - 1)mc\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 = (\u03b31 - 1) * 2mc\u00b2\n\nT2 = (\u03b32 - 1) * mc\u00b2\n\nAnd T1 + T2 = (\u03b31 - 1)*2mc\u00b2 + (\u03b32 - 1)*mc\u00b2 = (2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3)mc\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nAlso, E1 + E2 = \u03b31*2mc\u00b2 + \u03b32*mc\u00b2 = (2\u03b31 + \u03b32)mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) (2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3)mc\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\n2) (2\u03b31 + \u03b32)mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n2\u03b31 + \u03b32 = 300 / mc\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3 = 3 / mc\u00b2\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(2\u03b31 + \u03b32) - (2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3) = 300/mc\u00b2 - 3/mc\u00b2\n\n3 = 297/mc\u00b2\n\nSo, mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV\n\nBut m = 0.33M, and M*c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, so m*c\u00b2 = 0.33*300 = 99 GeV\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Earlier calculation gave mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV, but m should be 0.33M, which is 99 GeV. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 = 300 / mc\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 1: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3 = 3 / mc\u00b2\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n3 = (300 - 3)/mc\u00b2\n\nWait, no. Let's do it properly.\n\nEquation 2: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 = 300 / mc\u00b2\n\nEquation 1: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3 = 3 / mc\u00b2\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(2\u03b31 + \u03b32) - (2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3) = (300 / mc\u00b2) - (3 / mc\u00b2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3 = (297 / mc\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV\n\nBut m = 0.33M, and M*c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, so m*c\u00b2 should be 0.33*300 = 99 GeV, not 297 GeV. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an algebraic error.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the equations.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 = 300 / mc\u00b2\n\nFrom equation 1: 2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3 = 3 / mc\u00b2\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(2\u03b31 + \u03b32) - (2\u03b31 + \u03b32 - 3) = (300 / mc\u00b2) - (3 / mc\u00b2)\n\nThis is correct: 3 = (297 / mc\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV\n\nBut m = 0.33M, and M*c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, so m*c\u00b2 should be 0.33*300 = 99 GeV. There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to reconsider the relationship between m and M.\n\nEarlier, I set m = 0.33M, but maybe that's not accurate.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the beginning.\n\nWe have m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M\n\nTherefore, m = 0.33M\n\nSo, m*c\u00b2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\nBut from the equations above, mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV, which doesn't make sense because that would imply M = m + 2m = 3m, but M*c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, and m*c\u00b2 = 297 GeV would mean M = 297 / 99 * m, which is inconsistent.\n\nThere must be an error in the approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the relativistic addition of energies and momenta more carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nIn relativistic physics, for two particles moving in opposite directions with equal momenta (since total momentum is zero), we can relate their energies and momenta.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nE1 = energy of fragment 1\n\nE2 = energy of fragment 2\n\np1 = momentum of fragment 1\n\np2 = momentum of fragment 2\n\nGiven that p1 + p2 = 0\n\nAnd E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nAlso, T1 + T2 = \u0394E = 0.01M*c\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nNow, in relativistic terms, E = \u221a(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nFor fragment 1:\n\nE1 = \u221a(p1\u00b2c\u00b2 + (2m)\u00b2c\u2074) = c * \u221a(p1\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2c\u00b2)\n\nFor fragment 2:\n\nE2 = \u221a(p2\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074) = c * \u221a(p2\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u00b2)\n\nBut p2 = -p1, so p2\u00b2 = p1\u00b2\n\nNow, since E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, we have:\n\nc * [\u221a(p1\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2c\u00b2) + \u221a(p1\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u00b2)] = 300 GeV\n\nAlso, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nBut T1 = E1 - 2mc\u00b2\n\nT2 = E2 - mc\u00b2\n\nSo, T1 + T2 = E1 + E2 - 3mc\u00b2 = 300 GeV - 3mc\u00b2 = 3 GeV\n\nTherefore, 300 GeV - 3mc\u00b2 = 3 GeV \u21d2 3mc\u00b2 = 297 GeV \u21d2 mc\u00b2 = 99 GeV\n\nWait, that's consistent with m = 0.3"
