                    "text": "I have this compound with the formula C9H11NO2, and I need to identify it from the given options based on its IR and 1H NMR data. The options are:\n\nA. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nB. 3-Ethoxybenzamide\n\nC. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nD. 4-Aminophenyl propionate\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the IR and NMR data are telling me about the molecule's structure.\n\nLooking at the IR spectrum:\n\n- There are medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n- There's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nI recall that IR spectroscopy helps identify functional groups based on the vibrations of bonds. Specifically:\n\n- The bands around 3400 cm\u207b\u00b9 are typically associated with N-H stretching vibrations, which are common in amines or amides.\n\n- The band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, amide, or ketone.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a methyl group, and the triplet suggests it's coupled to two protons, probably an ethyl group.\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons could indicate an amino group (NH2) or perhaps an OH group, but given the IR data, it's likely an amino group.\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet for two protons, likely the methylene group of an ethyl group coupled to the methyl group.\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons, suggesting aromatic protons with some coupling.\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet for two protons, also likely aromatic.\n\nSo, from the NMR data, there's an ethyl group (methyl at 1.20 ppm and methylene at 4.5 ppm), an amino group (4.0 ppm), and two sets of aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm).\n\nNow, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\nThis compound has the structure:\n\n- An ethyl group connected to a carboxylate, which is connected to a benzene ring with an amino group para to the carboxylate.\n\nSo, its formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.\n\nLooking at its structure:\n\n- There should be an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-), which corresponds to the NMR signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm.\n\n- There's an amino group (NH2), which should give a broad signal around 4.0 ppm.\n\n- There are two aromatic protons ortho to each other (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), and the other protons are on the benzene ring.\n\n- The carbonyl group from the ester should show up in the IR around 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\n- The amino group should show N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nThis seems to align well with the spectral data provided.\n\nOption B: 3-Ethoxybenzamide\n\nThis compound has an ethoxy group on the benzene ring and an amide group.\n\nIts formula would be C9H11NO2 as well.\n\nLooking at its structure:\n\n- There's an ethoxy group (CH3-CH2-O-), which would have methyl and methylene protons, but the NMR data shows an ethyl group connected to a quartet and triplet, suggesting it's part of an ethyl group rather than an ethoxy.\n\n- The amide group would have a carbonyl at around 1650-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 in IR, but the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is more typical for an ester.\n\n- The N-H of the amide might show up around 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9, which seems to be present in the IR data.\n\nHowever, the NMR data suggests an ethyl group rather than an ethoxy group, so this might not be the correct option.\n\nOption C: N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThis compound has a formamide group connected to a benzene ring substituted with an ethoxy group.\n\nFormula: C9H11NO2.\n\nStructure:\n\n- Ethoxy group (CH3-CH2-O-), similar to option B, but again, the NMR shows an ethyl group connected with a quartet and triplet, suggesting it's part of an ethyl group bound to nitrogen or carbon.\n\n- Formamide group would have a carbonyl around 1680 cm\u207b\u00b9 in IR, which could match the 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 band, but it's a bit high for a formamide.\n\n- The amino group is secondary, but the NMR shows a broad signal at 4.0 ppm, which could be the NH of the amide.\n\nBut again, the ethoxy group would expect an oxygen between ethyl and benzene, which doesn't match the NMR data suggesting an ethyl group directly bound.\n\nOption D: 4-Aminophenyl propionate\n\nThis compound has a phenyl ring with an amino group para to a propionate group.\n\nFormula: C10H13NO2, which doesn't match the given formula of C9H11NO2.\n\nWait, C10H13NO2 has one more carbon and two more hydrogens than C9H11NO2, so this can't be the correct option.\n\nTherefore, option D is eliminated based on the molecular formula.\n\nNow, between options A, B, and C, option A seems the most plausible.\n\nLet's double-check option A: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nStructure:\n\n- Ethyl group: CH3-CH2-\n\n- Carboxylate connected to ethyl: O-CO-O-CH2-CH3\n\n- Benzene ring with amino group para to the carboxylate: Ph-NH2\n\nSo, the NMR would show:\n\n- Methyl protons of ethyl: triplet at around 1.20 ppm\n\n- Methylene protons of ethyl: quartet at around 4.5 ppm\n\n- Amino protons: broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm\n\n- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, likely ortho to each other\n\nThe IR would show:\n\n- N-H stretches around 3400 and 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\n- C=O stretch of the ester around 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\nThis matches perfectly with the given spectral data.\n\nOption B: 3-Ethoxybenzamide\n\nStructure:\n\n- Benzene ring with ethoxy at ortho position and amide at another position.\n\nThe NMR would show:\n\n- Methyl protons: triplet\n\n- Methylene protons: quartet\n\n- NH proton of amide: likely around 7-9 ppm, not at 4.0 ppm\n\n- Aromatic protons: multiple signals depending on substitution\n\nBut in the given NMR, the broad signal is at 4.0 ppm, which is more typical for an amino group (NH2) rather than an amide NH, which is usually more deshielded.\n\nOption C: N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nStructure:\n\n- Benzene ring with ethoxy at para position, connected via amide to a formyl group.\n\nNMR would likely show:\n\n- Methyl protons: triplet\n\n- Methylene protons: quartet\n\n- NH proton of amide: around 7-9 ppm\n\n- Formyl proton: around 8-9 ppm\n\nAgain, the broad signal at 4.0 ppm doesn't match the expected amide NH or formyl proton positions.\n\nTherefore, option A: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the most likely structure for the given compound based on the spectral data provided.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider the degrees of unsaturation.\n\nFor C9H11NO2:\n\nCalculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD):\n\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*9 + 2 - 11)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5\n\nWait, that can't be right. IHD should be an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the hydrogens. Let's recalculate.\n\nGiven formula: C9H11NO2\n\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2*9 + 2 - 11)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\nThat's odd; perhaps nitrogen affects the calculation.\n\nFor compounds with nitrogen, the general formula is IHD = (2C + 2 + N - H)/2\n\nSo, IHD = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11)/2 = (10)/2 = 5\n\nThat makes sense. So, IHD = 5, meaning there are 5 rings or double bonds.\n\nIn option A: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\n- Benzene ring: 4 rings or double bonds (3 double bonds and 1 ring)\n\n- Esters have one double bond (C=O)\n\n- Amino group: no additional double bonds\n\nTotal double bonds or rings: 4 (benzene) + 1 (ester) = 5, which matches the IHD.\n\nOption B: 3-Ethoxybenzamide\n\n- Benzene ring: 4 double bonds or rings\n\n- Amide has one double bond (C=O)\n\nTotal: 5, which also matches IHD.\n\nOption C: N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\n- Benzene ring: 4 double bonds or rings\n\n- Formamide has one double bond (C=O)\n\nTotal: 5, matches IHD.\n\nOption D: 4-Aminophenyl propionate\n\nFormula: C10H13NO2\n\nIHD = (2*10 + 2 + 1 - 13)/2 = (20 + 2 + 1 - 13)/2 = (10)/2 = 5\n\nSo, all options except D match the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\nWait, but option D is C10H13NO2, which doesn't match the given formula C9H11NO2.\n\nTherefore, option D is eliminated based on molecular formula mismatch.\n\nBetween A, B, and C:\n\n- Option A: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\n\n- Option B: 3-Ethoxybenzamide\n\n- Option C: N-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nLooking back at the NMR data:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl methyl\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): amino group\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): ethyl methylene\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons\n\nOption A has an amino group, which matches the broad signal at 4.0 ppm.\n\nOption B has an ethoxy group, which would have methoxy protons, but the NMR shows an ethyl group connected with a quartet and triplet, suggesting it's part of an ethyl group bound to nitrogen or carbon, not oxygen.\n\nOption C also has an ethoxy group, similar to option B, with the same issue.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most fitting based on the NMR data.\n\nAdditionally, the IR data shows a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is consistent with an ester carbonyl, as in option A.\n\nOption B and C have amides, which typically show carbonyl stretches around 1650-1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, but esters are usually around 1720-1740 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nGiven that, option A is the best choice.\n\nTo further confirm, let's consider the aromatic protons.\n\nIn option A, the benzene ring has an amino group para to the carboxylate, so the aromatic protons would be two doublets at positions ortho to each other, which matches the NMR data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nIn option B, with the ethoxy group and amide, the substitution pattern would be different, leading to different coupling patterns in the NMR.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, the substitution pattern would not match the observed NMR data.\n\nTherefore, based on the spectral data provided, the compound is most likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
