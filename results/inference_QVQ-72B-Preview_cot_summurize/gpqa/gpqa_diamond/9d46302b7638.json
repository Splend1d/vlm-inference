                    "text": "So I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Both planets have the same albedo, and I'm given masses, radii, the star's properties, and some Doppler shift data. It seems a bit overwhelming at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what equilibrium temperature means for a planet. I think it's the temperature a planet reaches due to the balance between the energy it receives from the star and the energy it radiates back into space. There's a standard formula for that, which is:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( T \\) is the equilibrium temperature,\n\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the planet to the star.\n\nBut wait, this formula assumes the planet is a blackbody, meaning it absorbs all the incident radiation. However, the problem states that both planets have the same albedo. Albedo is the fraction of incident light that's reflected back into space. So, if the planet isn't a blackbody, I need to adjust the formula to account for that.\n\nI think the general formula for equilibrium temperature, considering albedo, is:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, this term will be the same for both.\n\nI need to find the ratio of \\( T_1 \\) to \\( T_2 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D_1^2}}{\\frac{(1 - A) L}{16 \\pi \\sigma D_2^2}} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_1^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSo, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances, raised to the power of 1/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the orbital distances of both planets. The problem mentions that both planets are in circular orbits and that their masses and radii are given. Additionally, there's information about Doppler shifts induced in the star's spectral lines.\n\nIt says that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5 in the same line.\n\nI recall that the Doppler shift can be used to measure the radial velocity of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The formula for the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P \\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit,\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit,\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period,\n\n- \\( e \\) is the eccentricity of the orbit.\n\nBut since both planets are in circular orbits, \\( e = 0 \\), which simplifies things.\n\nThe Doppler shift is related to the radial velocity \\( K \\) by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v}{c} \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( \\Delta \\lambda \\) is the Doppler shift,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the radial velocity,\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the line.\n\nGiven that the shifts are up to 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5 at 6300 \u00c5, these are the maximum shifts, corresponding to the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\).\n\nSo, for Planet1:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{v_1}{c} \\times 6300 \\]\n\nSimilarly for Planet2:\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{v_2}{c} \\times 6300 \\]\n\nGiven the shifts are 0.03 \u00c5 and 0.04 \u00c5, respectively:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{0.03}{6300} c \\]\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{0.04}{6300} c \\]\n\nBut actually, no. The formula is \\( \\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v}{c} \\lambda \\), so:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} c \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{0.03}{6300} \\times c \\]\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{0.04}{6300} \\times c \\]\n\nNow, I need to relate these radial velocities to the orbital parameters of the planets.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) for a star due to a planet is also given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut since \\( e = 0 \\), and orbits are circular, this simplifies.\n\nWait, actually, for circular orbits, the radial velocity amplitude is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut I have another formula:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\times \\sqrt{G M_* / P} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( M_p \\) is the planet's mass,\n\n- \\( M_* \\) is the star's mass,\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period,\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the correct relation.\n\nUpon checking, for a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut also, \\( a = \\left( \\frac{G (M_* + M_p)}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\)\n\nHowever, for a star much more massive than the planet, \\( M_* \\gg M_p \\), which is the case here (star is 1.5 solar masses, planets are a few Earth masses), we can approximate:\n\n\\[ a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_*}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for a planet orbiting a star, the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a (1 - e^2)} } \\]\n\nAgain, since \\( e = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a} } \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the best approach.\n\nMaybe I should consider the fact that the Doppler shift gives me the radial velocity, which is related to the orbital parameters, and from there, I can find the orbital distances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis.\n\nKepler's third law states:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (M_* + M_p)} a^3 \\]\n\nAgain, for \\( M_* \\gg M_p \\), this approximates to:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M_*} a^3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_*}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\)\n\nBut I don't know the orbital periods of the planets, so this might not be directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can relate the radial velocity to the orbital period.\n\nI recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the orbital period and the masses via:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a} } \\]\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nPerhaps I need to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( P \\) and \\( M_* \\), and then relate it to \\( K \\).\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ a = \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nPlugging this into the expression for \\( K \\):\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a} } = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{ \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} } } \\]\n\nThis looks messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me look up the standard formula for \\( K \\) in terms of orbital parameters.\n\nUpon checking, the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\left( \\frac{G M_*}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nActually, the standard formula for \\( K \\) is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a} } \\]\n\nBut this seems to involve both \\( a \\) and \\( P \\), which I don't know.\n\nMaybe I need to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( K \\), \\( M_* \\), and \\( M_p \\).\n\nFrom the expression above:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{ \\frac{G M_*}{a} } \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ K^2 = \\left( \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{G M_*}{K^2} \\left( \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\right)^2 = \\frac{G M_p^2 \\sin^2 i}{M_* K^2} \\]\n\nHmm, but I don't know \\( \\sin i \\), the inclination angle.\n\nThis is a problem because without knowing the inclination, I can't directly determine \\( a \\) from \\( K \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Doppler shift gives me \\( K \\), and then relate \\( a \\) to \\( P \\) via Kepler's third law.\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( P \\), this seems tricky.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can find a relationship between \\( K \\) and \\( P \\) using Kepler's laws.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (M_* + M_p)} a^3 \\]\n\nAnd from the radial velocity formula:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut I still have \\( a \\) and \\( P \\) as unknowns.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me consider the fact that both planets are detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods.\n\nThe transit method allows us to measure the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, and the radial velocity method gives information about the planet's mass.\n\nBut in this problem, the radii and masses are already given.\n\nPerhaps I can use the radial velocity data to find the orbital distances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the Doppler shift corresponds to the radial velocity, which is related to the orbital velocity.\n\nThe radial velocity \\( K \\) is the projection of the orbital velocity \\( v \\) along the line of sight:\n\n\\[ K = v \\sin i \\]\n\nBut again, I don't know \\( i \\).\n\nThis is a common issue in exoplanet observations; the inclination is usually unknown, and we only have \\( K \\), which is proportional to \\( \\sin i \\).\n\nTo proceed, perhaps I need to find a way to eliminate \\( \\sin i \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the transit data to find \\( \\sin i \\), but I don't have information about the transit depths or durations.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that both planets are detected using both the transit and radial velocity methods.\n\nIn transit observations, the planet blocks a certain fraction of the star's light, and from that, we can infer the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.\n\nThe transit depth \\( \\delta \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\delta = \\left( \\frac{R_p}{R_*} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\( R_p \\) is the planet's radius and \\( R_* \\) is the star's radius.\n\nBut in this problem, the radii are given, so perhaps I can use this to find \\( \\sin i \\).\n\nWait, actually, in transit observations, the condition for a transit to occur is that the impact parameter \\( b \\) is less than the stellar radius, i.e., \\( b < R_* \\).\n\nThe impact parameter is given by:\n\n\\[ b = a \\cos i \\]\n\nSo, for a transit to occur, \\( a \\cos i < R_* \\), which implies:\n\n\\[ \\cos i < \\frac{R_*}{a} \\]\n\nBut I still have \\( a \\) as an unknown.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the fact that both planets are detected using radial velocity measurements, and their masses can be derived from those measurements.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\left( \\frac{G M_*}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( i \\), this doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that both planets are detected in transit, which means that their orbits are aligned with our line of sight, so \\( i \\) is close to 90 degrees.\n\nIn that case, \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\), which might simplify things.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I can assume that, especially since the problem doesn't specify the inclination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of \\( \\sin i \\) and see if it cancels out in the ratio.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( K \\), \\( M_p \\), and \\( M_* \\):\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{G M_p \\sin i}{M_* K} \\]\n\nBut I still have \\( \\sin i \\), which is unknown.\n\nThis isn't helping.\n\nMaybe I need to find another relationship involving \\( a \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)} } \\]\n\nAgain, for \\( M_* \\gg M_p \\), this approximates to:\n\n\\[ P \\approx 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G M_*} } \\]\n\nBut I still have two unknowns, \\( a \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the fact that both planets have the same albedo, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSo, if I can find the ratio of their orbital distances \\( D_2 / D_1 \\), I can find the temperature ratio.\n\nNow, how can I find \\( D_2 / D_1 \\)?\n\nPerhaps I can relate the orbital distances to the radial velocity measurements.\n\nFrom the radial velocity formula:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut again, I have \\( a \\) and \\( P \\) as unknowns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the orbital period \\( P \\) is related to the semi-major axis \\( a \\) via Kepler's third law.\n\nBut without knowing \\( P \\), this seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( K \\), \\( M_p \\), and \\( M_* \\), and then relate it to \\( P \\).\n\nFrom the radial velocity formula:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)} } \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P \\) into the radial velocity equation:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)} } } = \\frac{a \\sin i}{\\sqrt{ \\frac{a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)} } } = \\sin i \\sqrt{ \\frac{G (M_* + M_p)}{a} } \\]\n\nThis seems complicated.
