                    "text": "Let's tackle this physics problem. So, we have a stationary pion (\u03c0\u207a) decaying into a muon (\u03bc\u207a) and a neutrino (\u03bd). The rest masses are given: \u03c0\u207a is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and \u03bc\u207a is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. We need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are provided, so we can check which one matches our calculations.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principles of energy and momentum conservation in particle decays. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must add up to zero, meaning they move in opposite directions.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. This energy must be conserved and shared between the muon and the neutrino.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( m_{\\pi} = 139.6 \\) MeV/c\u00b2 (rest mass of \u03c0\u207a)\n\n- \\( m_{\\mu} = 105.7 \\) MeV/c\u00b2 (rest mass of \u03bc\u207a)\n\n- \\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\) MeV/c\u00b2 (rest mass of \u03bd, assuming it's negligible)\n\n- \\( E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \\) MeV (total energy of the stationary \u03c0\u207a)\n\n- \\( E_{\\mu} \\) = rest mass of muon plus its kinetic energy\n\n- \\( E_{\\nu} \\) = rest mass of neutrino plus its kinetic energy, but since its mass is negligible, \\( E_{\\nu} \\approx p_{\\nu} c \\)\n\nIn relativistic terms, the energy of a particle is given by:\n\n\\[ E = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( E \\) is the total energy\n\n- \\( p \\) is the momentum\n\n- \\( m \\) is the rest mass\n\nGiven that the pion is stationary, its momentum is zero, and its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV.\n\nFor the muon:\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p_{\\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for the neutrino:\n\n\\[ E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{p_{\\nu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\nu}^2 c^4} } \\approx p_{\\nu} c \\] (since \\( m_{\\nu} \\) is negligible)\n\nGiven that the total momentum is zero, we have:\n\n\\[ \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} \\) in magnitude, but in opposite directions.\n\nAlso, the total energy must be conserved:\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n\\[ 139.6 = \\sqrt{p_{\\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} + p_{\\nu} c \\]\n\nBut since \\( p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ 139.6 = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2 c^4} + p c \\]\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for a two-body decay, the energies of the decay products can be determined using the invariant mass formalism. In the center-of-mass frame, which is the rest frame of the pion in this case, the energies of the decay products can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ E_1 = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_1^2 - m_2^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} \\]\n\n\\[ E_2 = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_2^2 - m_1^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( m_{\\pi} \\) is the mass of the pion\n\n- \\( m_1 \\) is the mass of the first daughter particle (muon)\n\n- \\( m_2 \\) is the mass of the second daughter particle (neutrino)\n\nGiven that \\( m_2 \\approx 0 \\), we can plug in the values.\n\nFirst, for the muon:\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 - m_{\\nu}^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} } \\approx \\frac{(139.6)^2 + (105.7)^2 - 0}{2 \\times 139.6} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the squares:\n\n\\( 139.6^2 = 19464.16 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\n\\( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} \\approx \\frac{19464.16 + 11172.49 - 0}{2 \\times 139.6} } = \\frac{30636.65}{279.2} } \\approx 109.7 MeV \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the total energy available is only 139.6 MeV, and the muon can't have more energy than that. I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nOh, I see. The formula should be:\n\n\\[ E_1 = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_1^2 - m_2^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} \\]\n\nBut I think I might have messed up the masses here. Let me check a standard reference or derive it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the general energy-momentum conservation equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \\) MeV\n\n- \\( E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p_{\\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} \\)\n\n- \\( E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{p_{\\nu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\nu}^2 c^4} } \\approx p_{\\nu} c \\) (since \\( m_{\\nu} \\) is negligible)\n\nAnd since total momentum is zero:\n\n\\[ \\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} \\) in magnitude.\n\nAlso, energy conservation:\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} \\) and \\( E_{\\nu} = p c \\):\n\n\\[ 139.6 = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2 c^4} + p c \\]\n\nLet\u2019s factor out \\( c^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 139.6 = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2 c^4} + p c = c \\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2 c^2} + p c \\]\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe I can make an approximation or find a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in two-body decays, the kinetic energy of the daughter particles can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}^2 - m_{\\mu}^2 - m_{\\nu}^2)^2 - 4 m_{\\mu}^2 m_{\\nu}^2}{4 m_{\\pi}} \\]\n\nBut since \\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\), this simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think differently.\n\nI know that the kinetic energy of a particle is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = E - m c^2 \\]\n\nSo, for the muon:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu} c^2 \\]\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu} c^2 \\approx E_{\\nu} \\] (since \\( m_{\\nu} \\) is negligible)\n\nBut I still need to find \\( E_{\\mu} \\) and \\( E_{\\nu} \\).\n\nMaybe I should use the invariant mass relation for the decay.\n\nIn the rest frame of the pion, the invariant mass squared is:\n\n\\[ m_{\\pi}^2 = m_{\\mu}^2 + m_{\\nu}^2 - 2 m_{\\mu} m_{\\nu} \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a two-body decay, the energies of the daughter particles are fixed in the rest frame of the parent particle.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 - m_{\\nu}^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} \\]\n\nAgain, with \\( m_{\\nu} \\approx 0 \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2}{2 m_{\\pi}} } = \\frac{139.6^2 + 105.7^2}{2 \\times 139.6} } \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( 139.6^2 = 19464.16 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\n\\( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\frac{19464.16 + 11172.49}{2 \\times 139.6} } = \\frac{30636.65}{279.2} } \\approx 109.7 MeV \\]\n\nBut this can't be right because the total energy available is only 139.6 MeV, and the muon can't have more energy than that. There must be an error in this approach.\n\nMaybe I need to use a different formula. Let's try conservation of energy and momentum directly.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} \\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ \\vec{p}_{\\mu} = -\\vec{p}_{\\nu} \\]\n\nAlso, for the muon:\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu}^2 = p_{\\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 \\]\n\nAnd for the neutrino:\n\n\\[ E_{\\nu}^2 = p_{\\nu}^2 c^2 + m_{\\nu}^2 c^4 } \\approx p_{\\nu}^2 c^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( m_{\\nu} \\) is negligible.\n\nGiven that \\( p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} \\), let's denote \\( p = p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu} \\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} + p c \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi}^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 + 2 p c \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} + p^2 c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi}^2 = 2 p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 + 2 p c \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} \\]\n\nThis seems too complicated to solve directly. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of \\( p \\), and solve for \\( p \\).\n\nFrom the energy equation:\n\n\\[ E_{\\pi} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} + p c \\]\n\nLet\u2019s isolate the square root:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} = E_{\\pi} - p c \\]\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n\\[ p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 = (E_{\\pi} - p c)^2 = E_{\\pi}^2 - 2 E_{\\pi} p c + p^2 c^2 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( p^2 c^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 = E_{\\pi}^2 - 2 E_{\\pi} p c \\]\n\nSolve for \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ 2 E_{\\pi} p c = E_{\\pi}^2 - m_{\\mu}^2 c^4 \\]\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{E_{\\pi}^2 - m_{\\mu}^2 c^4}{2 E_{\\pi} c} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} \\times c \\]\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n\\( 139.6^2 = 19464.16 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\n\\( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \\) MeV\u00b2\n\nDifference:\n\n19464.16 - 11172.49 = 8291.67 MeV\u00b2\n\nNow, divide by \\( 2 \\times 139.6 \\):\n\n2 \u00d7 139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{8291.67}{279.2} \\times c \\approx 29.7 \\times c \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( p \\approx 29.7 \\) MeV/c\n\nNow, find \\( E_{\\mu} \\):\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\\mu}^2 c^4} } = \\sqrt{(29.7)^2 c^4 + (105.7)^2 c^4} } = c \\sqrt{29.7^2 + 105.7^2} \\]\n\nCalculate under the square root:\n\n29.7\u00b2 = 882.09 MeV\u00b2\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 11172.49 MeV\u00b2\n\nSum: 882.09 + 11172.49 = 12054.58 MeV\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = c \\times \\sqrt{12054.58} \\approx c \\times 109.79 MeV \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( E_{\\mu} \\approx 109.79 \\) MeV\n\nThen, the kinetic energy of the muon is:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu} c^2 = 109.79 - 105.7 = 4.09 \\) MeV\n\nSimilarly, for the neutrino:\n\n\\[ E_{\\nu} = E_{\\pi} - E_{\\mu} = 139.6 - 109.79 = 29.81 \\) MeV\n\nAnd since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\nu} \\approx E_{\\nu} = 29.81 \\) MeV\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close to our calculations.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's check the units and make sure no calculation errors were made.\n\nFirst, confirming the momentum calculation:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{E_{\\pi}^2 - m_{\\mu}^2 c^4}{2 E_{\\pi} c} \\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{19464.16 - 11172.49}{2 \\times 139.6} \\times c = \\frac{8291.67}{279.2} \\times c \\approx 29.7 \\) MeV/c\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\times c \\approx \\sqrt{882.09 + 11172.49} \\times c = \\sqrt{12054.58} \\times c \\approx 109.79 \\) MeV\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ KE_{\\mu} = 109.79 - 105.7 = 4.09 \\) MeV\n\nFor the neutrino:\n\n\\[ E_{\\nu} = 139.6 - 109.79 = 29.81 \\) MeV\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ KE_{\\nu} \\approx 29.81 \\) MeV\n\nTherefore, the closest option is C. 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}"
