                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a mixture of different solutions, and we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The solutions given are:\n\n1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)\n\n2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)\n\n3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)\n\nFirst, I need to find the total volume of the solution after mixing these together. Since they're all liquids, I can just add the volumes:\n\nTotal volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total moles of each type of ion or molecule present in the solution.\n\nLet's start with acetic acid (CH3COOH). It's a weak acid, so it partially dissociates into H+ and CH3COO- ions. However, since it's weak, I need to consider its dissociation equilibrium.\n\nBut before that, let's look at the strong acids and bases because they will completely dissociate.\n\nHydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.\n\nBarium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate into Ba2+ and 2 OH- ions.\n\nSince both HCl and Ba(OH)2 are strong electrolytes, they will completely ionize in solution.\n\nNow, acetic acid is weak, so its dissociation is partial, and I'll need to account for that.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of each substance before mixing:\n\n1. Moles of CH3COOH:\n\nMoles = molarity \u00d7 volume (in liters)\n\nMoles CH3COOH = 0.1 M \u00d7 0.500 L = 0.05 moles\n\n2. Moles of HCl:\n\nMoles HCl = 0.2 M \u00d7 0.400 L = 0.08 moles\n\n3. Moles of Ba(OH)2:\n\nMoles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M \u00d7 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n\nNow, when these are mixed, the strong acid (HCl) and the strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react with each other.\n\nThe reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 is:\n\n2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2 H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, 2 moles of HCl react with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2.\n\nGiven that we have 0.08 moles of HCl and 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, let's determine which is limiting.\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry:\n\n0.08 moles HCl require 0.08 / 2 = 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2\n\nSince we have 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which is more than required, Ba(OH)2 is in excess.\n\nSo, moles of Ba(OH)2 reacted = 0.04 moles\n\nMoles of Ba(OH)2 remaining = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 moles\n\nNow, after this reaction, we have:\n\n- Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles (unchanged, since it doesn't react with HCl directly)\n\n- Moles of HCl: 0 moles (fully reacted)\n\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.05 mooles (remaining after reaction)\n\nNow, acetic acid can react with hydroxide ions from Ba(OH)2 to form acetate and water:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O\n\nThis is a 1:1 reaction.\n\nWe have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2.\n\nEach mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, so total moles of OH- = 0.05 \u00d7 2 = 0.1 moles\n\nSince we have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH and 0.1 moles of OH-, CH3COOH is the limiting reagent for this reaction.\n\nSo, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving:\n\nMoles of OH- remaining = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles\n\nAdditionally, 0.05 moles of CH3COO- are produced from the reaction.\n\nNow, we have in the solution:\n\n- 0.05 moles of CH3COO-\n\n- 0.05 moles of OH-\n\n- 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 (since it's still present, as only the hydroxide ions reacted)\n\nWait a minute, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH-, so the remaining 0.05 moles of Ba(OH)2 will provide 0.05 moles of Ba2+ and 0.1 moles of OH-. But earlier, we already used up 0.05 moles of OH- in reacting with CH3COOH, so the remaining OH- is indeed 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nSo, in the solution:\n\n- Ba2+: 0.05 moles\n\n- OH-: 0.05 moles\n\n- CH3COO-: 0.05 mooles\n\nNow, we need to find the pH of this solution.\n\nGiven that we have OH- ions and CH3COO- ions, which can form a buffer system with acetic acid, but since we have OH- present, it will dominate the pH.\n\nTherefore, the pH will be determined by the concentration of OH- ions.\n\nFirst, find the total concentration of OH- ions.\n\nTotal moles of OH- = 0.05 moles (from Ba(OH)2)\n\nTotal volume = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nTherefore, [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\nNow, to find the pOH:\n\npOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.04167) \u2248 1.38\n\nSince pH + pOH = 14 in water at 25\u00b0C:\n\npH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 8.68\n\nB. 12.62\n\nC. 1.38\n\nD. 8.92\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 12.62.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirming the stoichiometry of the reactions:\n\n- HCl and Ba(OH)2 react in a 2:1 ratio. With 0.08 moles HCl and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, HCl is limiting for this reaction, so 0.04 moles Ba(OH)2 react, leaving 0.05 moles Ba(OH)2.\n\n- Then, CH3COOH reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2. CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, and OH- is 0.1 moles, so CH3COOH is limiting; it uses up 0.05 moles OH-, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nSo, total OH- remaining is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L, giving [OH-] = 0.04167 M.\n\npOH = -log(0.04167) \u2248 1.38\n\npH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nSeems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that in a solution containing both a weak acid and its conjugate base, the pH can be influenced by the buffer capacity. But in this case, since there's a significant amount of strong base present, the OH- ions will dominate the pH.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the equilibrium of acetic acid dissociation:\n\nCH3COOH \u21cc H+ + CH3COO-\n\nBut since we have excess OH-, the H+ ions would be neutralized immediately by OH- to form water, so the pH should indeed be determined primarily by the concentration of OH- ions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 12.62.\n\nWait, but option C is 1.38, which is the pOH, not the pH. So, it's important to make sure that the student doesn't mistakenly choose pOH instead of pH.\n\nAlso, option A is 8.68, which might correspond to the calculation if acetic acid were the dominant factor, but given the excess OH-, that's unlikely.\n\nOption D is 8.92, which doesn't seem to align with the calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 12.62.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
