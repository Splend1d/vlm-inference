                    "text": "So I have this problem about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine on different substituted benzenes. I need to arrange these substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. The substances are:\n\n1. C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n3. C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n\n4. C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n\n6. C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\nFirst, I need to recall how substituents affect the orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. There are two main types of directing effects: ortho-para directors and meta directors.\n\nOrtho-para directors are groups that release electrons through resonance or inductive effects, directing the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions relative to the substituent.\n\nMeta directors are groups that withdraw electrons through resonance or inductive effects, directing the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n\nLet me list the substituents and their directing effects:\n\n1. CH3 (Methyl): +I (inductive), +R (resonance), ortho-para director.\n\n2. COOC2H5 (Ethoxycarbonyl): -I, -R, meta director.\n\n3. Cl (Chlorine): +I, -R, meta director.\n\n4. NO2 (Nitro): -I, -R, meta director.\n\n5. C2H5 (Ethyl): +I, +R, ortho-para director.\n\n6. COOH (Carboxylic acid): -I, -R, meta director.\n\nWait a minute, I think I need to be more precise. Actually, chlorine is often considered a weak ortho-para director because, despite its electronegativity, it can donate electrons through its lone pairs via resonance.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Chlorine has a +I effect (electron withdrawal via induction) but a +R effect (electron donation via resonance) because of its lone pairs that can conjugate with the benzene ring.\n\nIn practice, chlorine is a weak ortho-para director because the +R effect outweighs the -I effect somewhat.\n\nSimilarly, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is often considered a meta director because of its -I and -R effects, but there might be some exceptions or nuances I should consider.\n\nAlso, the ethyl group (C2H5) is similar to methyl in that it's an alkyl group and should be an ortho-para director due to its +I and +R effects.\n\nNow, the problem is about bromination, which is an electrophilic substitution reaction. Assuming only one monobromo derivative is formed in each case, and we have an excess of bromine, we need to consider the regioselectivity of bromination.\n\nThe weight fraction of the para-isomer would depend on the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nFor ortho-para directors, we expect higher yields of para-isomers relative to meta directors.\n\nBut since the problem asks for increasing order of the weight fraction of the para-isomer, I need to arrange them from the one with the least para-isomer to the one with the most.\n\nWait, no. It says \"increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer,\" so from the lowest to the highest para-isomer yield.\n\nSo, meta directors would have lower para-isomer yields compared to ortho-para directors.\n\nBut among meta directors, do they all have the same para-isomer yield? Probably not, because the strength of the meta directing effect might vary.\n\nSimilarly, among ortho-para directors, the yield of para-isomer might vary based on the strength of the directing effect.\n\nI need to consider the relative strengths of these effects.\n\nLet me recall:\n\n- Strong ortho-para directors: -OH, -NH2, -alkyl groups like -CH3, -C2H5.\n\n- Weak ortho-para directors: -Halides like -Cl.\n\n- Neutral: -H.\n\n- Weak meta directors: -CO-, -SO2-, -NO2.\n\nWait, but according to some sources, chlorine is considered a weak ortho-para director, while nitro (-NO2) is a strong meta director.\n\nSo, in terms of para-isomer yield:\n\n- Strong ortho-para directors will give higher para-isomer yields.\n\n- Weak ortho-para directors will give lower para-isomer yields but still higher than meta directors.\n\n- Meta directors will give the lowest para-isomer yields.\n\nSo, among the given options:\n\n- Strong ortho-para directors: -CH3, -C2H5.\n\n- Weak ortho-para director: -Cl.\n\n- Meta directors: -COOC2H5, -NO2, -COOH.\n\nBut wait, chlorine is sometimes considered a weak ortho-para director, but in some contexts, it's treated as a meta director.\n\nI need to be careful here.\n\nLet me look up the directing effects of these substituents.\n\nUpon checking:\n\n- Methyl (-CH3): strong ortho-para director.\n\n- Ethyl (-C2H5): strong ortho-para director.\n\n- Chlorine (-Cl): weak ortho-para director.\n\n- Nitro (-NO2): strong meta director.\n\n- Carboxylic acid (-COOH): strong meta director.\n\n- Ethoxycarbonyl (-COOC2H5): strong meta director.\n\nSo, based on this, the ortho-para directors should have higher para-isomer yields, followed by the weak ortho-para directors, and then the meta directors.\n\nTherefore, the order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield should be:\n\n1. Meta directors: -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5.\n\n2. Weak ortho-para director: -Cl.\n\n3. Strong ortho-para directors: -CH3, -C2H5.\n\nBut the problem asks for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, so from the lowest to the highest.\n\nWait, no, it's increasing order, meaning from the one with the least para-isomer to the one with the most.\n\nSo, meta directors should be on the left, and ortho-para directors on the right.\n\nAmong meta directors, do they differ in their para-isomer yields?\n\nProbably, with stronger meta directors giving lower para-isomer yields.\n\nSimilarly, among ortho-para directors, stronger directors should give higher para-isomer yields.\n\nSo, among meta directors:\n\n-NO2 is a very strong meta director, so it should give a very low para-isomer yield.\n\n-COOH is also a strong meta director, but perhaps not as strong as -NO2.\n\n-COOC2H5 is another strong meta director, similar to -COOH.\n\nBut I need to see which one has the lowest para-isomer yield.\n\nI think -NO2 is the strongest meta director, so it should give the lowest para-isomer yield, followed by -COOH and -COOC2H5.\n\nSimilarly, among ortho-para directors:\n\n-CH3 and -C2H5 are both strong ortho-para directors, but perhaps -C2H5 is slightly stronger due to the longer alkyl chain.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nAlso, chlorine is a weak ortho-para director, so it should give a lower para-isomer yield compared to -CH3 and -C2H5.\n\nTherefore, the order should be:\n\nFirst, meta directors: -NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5.\n\nThen, weak ortho-para director: -Cl.\n\nThen, strong ortho-para directors: -C2H5 < -CH3.\n\nWait, but I need to arrange them in increasing order of para-isomer yield.\n\nSo, starting from the lowest para-isomer yield to the highest.\n\nGiven that, -NO2 should be first, then -COOH, then -COOC2H5, then -Cl, then -C2H5, and finally -CH3.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nB. 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nC. 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nI need to match my reasoning with these options.\n\nLet me assign the numbers to the substituents:\n\n1. C6H5-CH3 \u2192 -CH3\n\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5 \u2192 -COOC2H5\n\n3. C6H5-Cl \u2192 -Cl\n\n4. C6H5-NO2 \u2192 -NO2\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5 \u2192 -C2H5\n\n6. C6H5-COOH \u2192 -COOH\n\nBased on my earlier reasoning:\n\n-NO2 (4) should have the lowest para-isomer yield.\n\nThen -COOH (6), then -COOC2H5 (2).\n\nThen -Cl (3), then -C2H5 (5), and finally -CH3 (1).\n\nSo, the order should be 4<6<2<3<5<1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nB. 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nC. 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nNone of these match exactly with 4<6<2<3<5<1.\n\nOption D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which is close but has 1 before 5, whereas according to my reasoning, 5 should come before 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider the order between -C2H5 and -CH3.\n\nIs -C2H5 a stronger ortho-para director than -CH3?\n\nI think -CH3 is slightly stronger than -C2H5 because it's smaller and can donate electrons more effectively via hyperconjugation.\n\nWait, actually, alkyl groups in general are ortho-para directors, and their directing effect increases slightly with the size of the alkyl group due to hyperconjugation.\n\nSo, -C2H5 might be a slightly stronger ortho-para director than -CH3.\n\nTherefore, -C2H5 should give a higher para-isomer yield than -CH3.\n\nSo, in the order, -C2H5 (5) should come before -CH3 (1).\n\nTherefore, the correct order should be 4<6<2<3<5<1.\n\nBut option D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which has 1 before 5, which is incorrect based on my reasoning.\n\nOption C is 4<2<6<3<1<5, which also doesn't match.\n\nOption A is 6<2<4<5<1<3, which has 6 before 4, but according to my reasoning, 4 should be before 6.\n\nOption B is 3<5<1<6<2<4, which doesn't seem to follow the logic.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that -Cl is a weak ortho-para director, but still stronger than meta directors.\n\nSo, -Cl should come before -C2H5 and -CH3, but after all the meta directors.\n\nTherefore, the correct order should be meta directors first, then weak ortho-para director, then strong ortho-para directors.\n\nSo, 4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5) < 1 (CH3).\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this.\n\nOption D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which has 1 before 5, which is incorrect.\n\nOption C is 4<2<6<3<1<5, which has 1 before 5, again incorrect.\n\nOption A is 6<2<4<5<1<3, which has 4 after 2 and 6, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B is 3<5<1<6<2<4, which starts with 3 (Cl), which is not a meta director.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the directing effects again.\n\n-NO2 is a strong meta director, so it should give the least para-isomer.\n\n-COOH and -COOC2H5 are both meta directors, but -NO2 is stronger, so -NO2 should have less para-isomer than -COOH and -COOC2H5.\n\n-Cl is a weak ortho-para director, so it should give more para-isomer than meta directors but less than strong ortho-para directors like -CH3 and -C2H5.\n\nBetween -CH3 and -C2H5, -C2H5 might give slightly more para-isomer due to its larger size and hyperconjugation effects.\n\nTherefore, the order should be:\n\n4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 5 (C2H5) < 1 (CH3).\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nB. 3<5<1<6<2<4\n\nC. 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3\n\nOption C is 4<2<6<3<1<5, which has 1 before 5, which is incorrect based on my reasoning.\n\nOption D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which has 1 before 5, again incorrect.\n\nOption A is 6<2<4<5<1<3, which has 4 after 2 and 6, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B is 3<5<1<6<2<4, which starts with 3 (Cl), which is not a meta director.\n\nThis suggests that none of the options perfectly match my reasoning.\n\nPerhaps there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet me check the directing effects again.\n\n-NO2: strong meta director.\n\n-COOH: strong meta director.\n\n-COOC2H5: strong meta director.\n\n-Cl: weak ortho-para director.\n\n-C2H5: strong ortho-para director.\n\n-CH3: strong ortho-para director.\n\nSo, the order should be meta directors first, then weak ortho-para director, then strong ortho-para directors.\n\nTherefore, 4<6<2<3<5<1.\n\nLooking at option D: 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nThis has 1 before 5, which contradicts my earlier thought that -C2H5 should give higher para-isomer yield than -CH3.\n\nPerhaps I need to verify which one between -C2H5 and -CH3 is a stronger ortho-para director.\n\nUpon checking, methyl (-CH3) is generally considered a stronger ortho-para director than ethyl (-C2H5) because of its smaller size and better hyperconjugation.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nAlkyl groups are all ortho-para directors, and their directing effect can vary based on their size and structure.\n\nGenerally, smaller alkyl groups like methyl are stronger directors than larger ones like ethyl.\n\nTherefore, -CH3 is a stronger ortho-para director than -C2H5.\n\nTherefore, -CH3 should give a higher para-isomer yield than -C2H5.\n\nTherefore, the correct order should be 4<6<2<3<5<1, but with -CH3 (1) having higher para-isomer yield than -C2H5 (5).\n\nBut option D is 4<6<2<1<5<3, which has -CH3 (1) before -C2H5 (5), which would be incorrect based on this reasoning.\n\nOption C is 4<2<6<3<1<5, which also has -CH3 (1) before -C2H5 (5).\n\nOption A is 6<2<4<5<1<3, which has -C2H5 (5) before -CH3 (1), which would be correct if -C2H5 gives higher para-isomer yield than -CH3, but according to this new information, -CH3 should be after -C2H5.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the answer is option D: 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nWait, but according to my corrected understanding, -CH3 should give higher para-isomer yield than -C2H5, so -CH3 should come after -C2H5 in the increasing order.\n\nBut option D has -CH3 before -C2H5, which would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between -CH3 and -C2H5 is not significant enough to distinguish in this context.\n\nPerhaps the answer is C: 4<2<6<3<1<5.\n\nBut this has -CH3 before -C2H5, which might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact order between -CH3 and -C2H5 isn't critical, and the main point is to separate meta directors from ortho-para directors.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is D: 4<6<2<1<5<3.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about the relative positions of -CH3 and -C2H5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C: 4<2<6<3<1<5.\n\nBut I need to choose the closest option based on my understanding.\n\nGiven the uncertainty between -CH3 and -C2H5, I might go with option C, assuming that -CH3 comes after -C2H5 in para-isomer yield.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 4<2<6<3<1<5"
