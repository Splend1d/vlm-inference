                    "text": "So I have this chemistry problem here. It says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH\u2082 in condensed ammonia solvent, and I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are in this reaction. The options are 3, 2, 4, or 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on in this reaction. 1-bromobenzene-2-d sounds like a substituted benzene ring with a bromine atom and a deuterium atom in specific positions. The numbering suggests that the bromine is at position 1 and the deuterium at position 2.\n\nNow, NaNH\u2082 is sodium amide, which is a strong base and a nucleophile. In condensed ammonia solvent, which is likely liquid ammonia, this base can deprotonate or displacesubstituents on organic molecules.\n\nI need to recall what type of reaction might occur here. Since there's a bromine atom present, which is a good leaving group, and NaNH\u2082 is a nucleophile, this could be a nucleophilic substitution reaction, perhaps an Sn2 reaction, where the nucleophile attacks the benzene ring and displaces the bromine.\n\nBut wait, benzene rings typically undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions rather than nucleophilic substitutions. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe this is an aromatic nucleophilic substitution, which can happen under certain conditions, especially with activated aromatic systems or specific leaving groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base can deprotonate the benzene ring, leading to the formation of an aryl anion, which could then react with an electrophile.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look up some information about reactions of bromobenzene derivatives with strong bases like NaNH\u2082.\n\nAfter some research, I find that bromobenzene can undergo deprotonation by strong bases like NaNH\u2082 to form phenyl lithium or similar organometallic compounds, but that seems more common with iodobenzene or chlorobenzene, especially when activated by electron-donating groups.\n\nWait, maybe the deuterium atom is significant here. Since it's a heavier isotope of hydrogen, it might affect the reactivity slightly, but probably not significantly enough to change the overall reaction pathway.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possibility of both the bromine and the deuterium being potential sites for nucleophilic attack or deprotonation.\n\nLet me try to draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d to visualize this better.\n\nStarting with benzene, which has the molecular formula C\u2086H\u2086. Position 1 has a bromine atom, and position 2 has a deuterium atom. So the molecule is:\n\nBr-C\u2086H\u2084-CD\u2082H\u2083\n\nWait, no, more precisely, it's bromobenzene with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. So the structure would be:\n\nBr-C\u2086H\u2084-CD\u2082H\u2083\n\nBut actually, since deuterium is just an isotope of hydrogen, it should react similarly to hydrogen in most cases.\n\nNow, when NaNH\u2082 is added, it's a strong base and nucleophile. It might deprotonate one of the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring or attack the bromine as a leaving group.\n\nConsidering that bromine is a good leaving group, perhaps it can be displaced by the nucleophile.\n\nSo, if NaNH\u2082 attacks the bromine, it could displace it, forming an amino group, leading to an aniline derivative.\n\nAlternatively, if it deprotonates the benzene ring, it could form a benzene anion, which could then react with another electrophile, but in this case, there isn't an obvious electrophile present besides the bromine.\n\nWait, maybe it's a elimination reaction, but that seems unlikely with bromobenzene.\n\nLet me consider the mechanism step by step.\n\nFirst, NaNH\u2082 in liquid ammonia can generate a strong base that can deprotonate the benzene ring. The benzene ring has hydrogen atoms that are relatively acidic compared to alkanes, especially if there are electron-withdrawing groups like bromine present.\n\nSo, if the base deprotonates the benzene ring adjacent to the bromine, forming a benzene anion, which is resonance-stabilized, and then the bromine could be eliminated, forming a carbocation, which could be stabilized by resonance.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a simpler pathway.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nucleophile attacks the bromine directly, displacing it and forming an amino group on the benzene ring.\n\nThat sounds more straightforward. So, the nucleophile attacks the bromine, forming aniline or something similar.\n\nLet me write that out.\n\nStarting with bromobenzene, treatment with NaNH\u2082 in NH\u2083 can lead to the replacement of the bromine by an amino group, forming aniline.\n\nBut in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which has a deuterium at position 2.\n\nSo, if the nucleophile attacks the bromine, replacing it with an amino group, the product would be 2-deuteroaniline, or something similar.\n\nBut I need to consider if the deuterium affects the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base can deuterate the amino group or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about whether the deuterium will stay in place or if it will be exchanged during the reaction.\n\nGiven that deuterium is just an isotope of hydrogen, it should behave similarly in most chemical reactions, except for kinetic isotope effects, which might affect reaction rates but not the products.\n\nSo, assuming that the deuterium remains in place, and the nucleophile attacks the bromine, replacing it with an amino group, the product would be 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nBut the question mentions \"possible organic products,\" implying there might be more than one.\n\nIs there a possibility of another product forming?\n\nPerhaps the base could deprotonate the deuterium at position 2, leading to a different product.\n\nBut deuterium is less easily removed than protium due to the kinetic isotope effect, so it's less likely to be deprotonated compared to the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base could deprotonate one of the other positions on the benzene ring, leading to a different product.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple sites where the base can deprotonate the benzene ring.\n\nIn bromobenzene, the bromine activates the positions ortho and para to it, making those positions more susceptible to deprotonation.\n\nSo, in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2.\n\nThe positions available for deprotonation are positions 3, 4, 5, and 6, assuming position 2 is deuterated.\n\nIf the base deprotonates position 3, forming a benzene anion, which could then react with the bromine, perhaps leading to a different product.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates position 3, forming a benzene anion, which then eliminates the bromine, forming phenylacetylene or something similar.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe I should look for similar reactions or consult a textbook on organic chemistry.\n\nAfter some research, I find that bromobenzene can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SnAr) with strong nucleophiles like ammonia or amines in the presence of a strong base.\n\nIn this case, NaNH\u2082 is a strong base and nucleophile, so it could attack the bromine, replacing it with an amino group.\n\nGiven that, the reaction of bromobenzene with NaNH\u2082 in NH\u2083 would likely produce aniline.\n\nBut in this problem, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which has a deuterium at position 2.\n\nSo, if the nucleophile attacks the bromine, replacing it with an amino group, the product should be 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of possible organic products.\n\nIs there a possibility of more than one product?\n\nPerhaps the base could deuterate the amino group during the reaction, leading to a different product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a possibility of elimination reactions forming different products.\n\nWait, perhaps the deuterium at position 2 could be exchanged with protium from the solvent during the reaction, leading to a mixture of products.\n\nBut in liquid ammonia, which is anhydrous, there shouldn't be much protium available for exchange.\n\nMoreover, deuterium is less likely to be exchanged under basic conditions due to its lower reactivity.\n\nSo, probably, the deuterium remains in place.\n\nTherefore, the main product should be 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nBut the question mentions \"possible organic products,\" suggesting there might be more than one.\n\nIs there a possibility of regioisomers forming?\n\nIn bromobenzene, the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2.\n\nIf the nucleophile attacks the bromine, replacing it with an amino group, the product is 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nAlternatively, if the nucleophile attacks elsewhere, perhaps at the deuterium, but that seems unlikely because deuterium is less reactive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base could deprotonate the amino group after it's formed, leading to an anion that could be protonated back to the amino group.\n\nBut that seems like it would lead back to the same product.\n\nI'm still leaning towards only one major organic product, which is 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nBut the question suggests there might be more than one product.\n\nPerhaps there's a possibility of elimination reactions forming different products.\n\nFor example, if the base deprotonates the benzene ring adjacent to the bromine, forming a benzene anion, which then eliminates the bromine to form a carbocation, which could rearrange or form a different product.\n\nBut that seems less likely under these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base could deprotonate the deuterium at position 2, forming a benzene anion, which could then react with the bromine to form a different product.\n\nBut again, deuterium is less easily removed than protium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base could deprotonate one of the other positions on the benzene ring, leading to a different product.\n\nBut given the directing effects of the bromine, it's more likely to deprotonate positions ortho or para to the bromine.\n\nSo, positions 3 and 5 are ortho to the bromine, and position 4 is para.\n\nIf the base deprotonates position 3, forming a benzene anion, which then reacts with the bromine, perhaps leading to a different product.\n\nBut this seems convoluted, and I'm not sure about the exact mechanism.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the reaction could proceed via different pathways, leading to different products.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deuterium could be incorporated differently in the final product.\n\nWait, perhaps the base could deuterate the amino group during the reaction, leading to a different isotopologue.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as deuterium is already present in the starting material.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a possibility of hydrogen-deuterium exchange during the reaction, leading to different positions being deuterated.\n\nBut again, in anhydrous ammonia, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven all this, I still think that the main product is 2-deuteroaniline.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible organic product in this reaction.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
