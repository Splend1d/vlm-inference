                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about hydrogen atom transitions. It says that the |3,0,0\u27e9 state decays to the |1,0,0\u27e9 state via two dipole transitions, and I need to identify the correct transition route and its corresponding probability from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about atomic transitions in the hydrogen atom. The states are labeled by quantum numbers: n (principal quantum number), l (angular momentum quantum number), and m (magnetic quantum number). Dipole transitions follow certain selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, these rules are:\n\n1. \u0394l = \u00b11 (angular momentum changes by one unit)\n\n2. \u0394m = 0, \u00b11 (magnetic quantum number can stay the same or change by one unit)\n\nSo, starting from |3,0,0\u27e9, which is the n=3, l=0, m=0 state, I need to find which states it can transition to in one step, following these selection rules.\n\nGiven that l=0, the only possible change in l is to l=1 (since \u0394l = +1), because l cannot decrease below 0. So, the next state must have l=1.\n\nNow, for m, since m=0, \u0394m can be 0, +1, or -1. So, m can change to +1, -1, or stay at 0.\n\nTherefore, from |3,0,0\u27e9, possible intermediate states are |3,1,1\u27e9, |3,1,0\u27e9, and |3,1,-1\u27e9.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the decay is via two dipole transitions, ending at |1,0,0\u27e9. So, the first transition is from |3,0,0\u27e9 to some |3,1,m\u27e9 or |2,1,m\u27e9, and then from there to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nLooking at the options, they suggest transitions through |2,1,m\u27e9 states rather than |3,1,m\u27e9. That seems odd at first, but maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's correct. I need to check.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of transitioning from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9. According to the selection rules, n can change by any amount in electric dipole transitions, but typically, transitions with larger \u0394n are less probable due to energy considerations.\n\nHowever, in the options, they suggest transitioning to |2,1,m\u27e9 states. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nFrom |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9, \u0394n = -1, \u0394l = +1, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n\nThen, from |2,1,m\u27e9, it can transition to |1,0,0\u27e9, with \u0394n = -1, \u0394l = -1, which is also allowed.\n\nSo, the pathway |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,m\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 seems plausible.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3\n\nB. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nC. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3\n\nD. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4\n\nAll options suggest transitioning through |2,1,m\u27e9 states with m=0, -1, or 1, which aligns with the possible \u0394m values.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these transitions is correct and calculate the corresponding probability.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible transitions from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9.\n\nFrom |3,0,0\u27e9, possible transitions are to |2,1,1\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, and |2,1,-1\u27e9, as per the selection rules.\n\nEach of these transitions has a certain probability, which I need to calculate or determine.\n\nThen, from each of these intermediate states, there is a transition to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nSo, the total probability of decaying from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions would be the sum over the probabilities of each possible pathway.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nI recall that in atomic physics, the probability of a dipole transition is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, which involves the electric dipole operator and the wave functions of the initial and final states.\n\nHowever, calculating these matrix elements explicitly can be quite involved, especially without specific formulas or tables.\n\nMaybe I can use some symmetry or selection rule arguments to simplify the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the branching ratios or the relative probabilities of the possible transitions.\n\nLet me think about the first transition: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,m\u27e9.\n\nFrom |3,0,0\u27e9, it can transition to |2,1,1\u27e9, |2,1,0\u27e9, or |2,1,-1\u27e9.\n\nWhat are the relative probabilities of these transitions?\n\nI think that for electric dipole transitions, the relative probabilities depend on the \u0394m values.\n\nSpecifically, transitions with \u0394m = 0 have different probabilities from those with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nIn the context of atomic transitions, the so-called \"selection rules\" not only specify which transitions are allowed but also provide information about their relative probabilities.\n\nI recall that the probability of a dipole transition depends on the square of the matrix element of the dipole moment operator between the initial and final states.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the dipole operator is typically taken as r \u00d7 Y_{1,m}, where Y_{1,m} are the spherical harmonics.\n\nGiven that, the matrix elements for different \u0394m values might have different magnitudes.\n\nIn particular, for \u0394m = 0, the transition is a \"\u03c0\" transition, while for \u0394m = \u00b11, they are \"\u03c3\" transitions.\n\nIn general, for electric dipole transitions, the relative probabilities are such that transitions with \u0394m = 0 are twice as probable as those with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nThis is because the dipole operator has both real and imaginary parts that contribute differently to the matrix elements.\n\nTherefore, if I consider the transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9, there are three possible m values: -1, 0, and 1.\n\nEach of these transitions has a different probability: \u0394m = +1, \u0394m = 0, and \u0394m = -1, respectively.\n\nAccording to the rule I just recalled, transitions with \u0394m = 0 should be twice as probable as those with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nSo, if I denote the probability for \u0394m = +1 or -1 as P, then the probability for \u0394m = 0 would be 2P.\n\nNow, since these are the only possible transitions from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9, the total probability for this first step should be P_total = P + 2P + P = 4P, assuming all three transitions are possible.\n\nBut wait, in the |2,1,m\u27e9 states, m can be -1, 0, or 1, and from each of these, there is a transition to |1,0,0\u27e9.\n\nLet's consider each possible pathway:\n\n1. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\n2. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\n3. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\nEach of these pathways has its own probability, which is the product of the probabilities of the two individual transitions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the branching ratios at each step.\n\nFirst, from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9, the probabilities are P_{m=1} = P, P_{m=0} = 2P, and P_{m=-1} = P, as per the earlier reasoning.\n\nThen, from |2,1,m\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9, what are the probabilities?\n\nSimilarly, from |2,1,m\u27e9, it can transition to |1,0,0\u27e9 with \u0394l = -1, which is allowed, and \u0394m = -m.\n\nSo, for m=1, \u0394m = -1; for m=0, \u0394m = 0; for m=-1, \u0394m = +1.\n\nAgain, using the same relative probabilities, transitions with \u0394m = 0 are twice as probable as those with \u0394m = \u00b11.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities for the second transition would be:\n\n- From |2,1,1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9: P\n\n- From |2,1,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9: 2P\n\n- From |2,1,-1\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9: P\n\nNow, the total probability for each pathway is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Pathway |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: P_first = P, P_second = P \u2192 total P = P * P = P\u00b2\n\n2. Pathway |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: P_first = 2P, P_second = 2P \u2192 total P = (2P) * (2P) = 4P\u00b2\n\n3. Pathway |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: P_first = P, P_second = P \u2192 total P = P * P = P\u00b2\n\nNow, assuming that these are the only possible pathways, the total probability for decaying from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 via two dipole transitions would be P_total = P\u00b2 + 4P\u00b2 + P\u00b2 = 6P\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, I had P_total for the first step as 4P, which might correspond to P_total = P + 2P + P = 4P, which could be related to the individual transition probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to normalize these probabilities.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose that the probability for each \u0394m transition is proportional to some factor.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, transition probabilities are often expressed using the formula:\n\nP \u221d |<final|H'|initial>|\u00b2,\n\nwhere H' is the perturbation Hamiltonian, in this case, the electric dipole operator.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can calculate the relative probabilities by considering the squares of the matrix elements.\n\nLet me attempt to calculate the matrix elements for the transitions.\n\nFirst, from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9.\n\nThe electric dipole operator in spherical coordinates is typically taken as r \u00d7 Y_{1,m}, where Y_{1,m} are the spherical harmonics.\n\nTherefore, the matrix element is <2,1,m| r \u00d7 Y_{1,m} |3,0,0>.\n\nHowever, calculating this explicitly would require knowledge of the radial wave functions and the angular parts.\n\nThis seems quite involved without specific formulas or tables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which relates matrix elements of tensor operators like the dipole operator.\n\nThe Wigner-Eckart theorem states that <j' m'|T^{(k)}_q|j m> = <j' m'|<j'||T^{(k)}||j'><j m|k q; j' m'>,\n\nwhere <j'||T^{(k)}||j'> is the reduced matrix element and <j m|k q; j' m'> is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\nFor electric dipole transitions, k=1.\n\nThis might simplify the calculation, but I'm not sure if I can handle it without more advanced tools.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the total probability of decaying from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 via any pathway.\n\nSince there are three possible pathways, each with its own probability, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each pathway.\n\nAssuming that each pathway is independent, the total probability is just the sum of the individual pathway probabilities.\n\nGiven that, and considering the relative probabilities I estimated earlier, perhaps I can express the total probability in terms of a single variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the branching ratios for these transitions.\n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the relative probabilities of electric dipole transitions are well-known and can be found in standard textbooks.\n\nFor example, the relative probabilities for transitions with \u0394m = 0 and \u0394m = \u00b11 are in the ratio 2:1, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can use this ratio to find the correct probability.\n\nLet me try to set up the problem using this ratio.\n\nSuppose that the probability for a transition with \u0394m = \u00b11 is P, then the probability for \u0394m = 0 is 2P.\n\nThen, for the first transition from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9:\n\n- P_{m=1} = P\n\n- P_{m=0} = 2P\n\n- P_{m=-1} = P\n\nSimilarly, for the second transition from |2,1,m\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9:\n\n- P_{m=1} = P (since \u0394m = -1)\n\n- P_{m=0} = 2P (since \u0394m = 0)\n\n- P_{m=-1} = P (since \u0394m = +1)\n\nThen, the total probability for each pathway is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions:\n\n1. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: P * P = P\u00b2\n\n2. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: 2P * 2P = 4P\u00b2\n\n3. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9: P * P = P\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the total probability is P_total = P\u00b2 + 4P\u00b2 + P\u00b2 = 6P\u00b2.\n\nBut I need to find the probability of decaying via any of these pathways, which should be the sum of the probabilities of each pathway.\n\nHowever, I don't know the value of P yet.\n\nPerhaps I can normalize the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the branching ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of oscillator strengths or transition probabilities in atomic units.\n\nIn atomic units, the transition probability per unit time is proportional to f / \u03bb\u00b2, where f is the oscillator strength and \u03bb is the wavelength of the transition.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the Einstein coefficients for spontaneous emission.\n\nThe Einstein A coefficient for a transition is proportional to |<final|H'|initial>|\u00b2.\n\nAgain, without specific values, this might not help directly.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the time-dependent perturbation theory approach.\n\nIn time-dependent perturbation theory, the probability amplitude for a transition after time t is proportional to the matrix element of the perturbation times the time integral of the perturbation.\n\nHowever, this seems too involved for this problem.\n\nPerhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the total probability of decaying from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9 via any pathway.\n\nSince there are three pathways, each with its own probability, and assuming they are mutually exclusive, the total probability is the sum of the individual pathway probabilities.\n\nGiven that, and using the earlier expressions, P_total = P\u00b2 + 4P\u00b2 + P\u00b2 = 6P\u00b2.\n\nBut I need to find the value of P in terms of some known quantity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the branching ratios at each step.\n\nAt the first step, from |3,0,0\u27e9 to |2,1,m\u27e9, the branching ratios are P_{m=1} = P, P_{m=0} = 2P, P_{m=-1} = P, with total P_total_first = 4P.\n\nSimilarly, at the second step, from |2,1,m\u27e9 to |1,0,0\u27e9, the branching ratios are P_{m=1} = P, P_{m=0} = 2P, P_{m=-1} = P, with total P_total_second = 4P.\n\nWait, this seems circular.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the total probability for the first transition is 1, and then find P accordingly.\n\nIf P_total_first = P + 2P + P = 4P = 1, then P = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, P = 1/4.\n\nThen, the total probability for the entire decay process is P_total = P\u00b2 + 4P\u00b2 + P\u00b2 = 6P\u00b2 = 6*(1/4)\u00b2 = 6*(1/16) = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nBut none of the options give 3/8.\n\nOption A has 2/3, option B has 1/4, option C has 1/3, and option D has 1/4.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nLet me try a different method.\n\nMaybe I can consider the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the angular momentum coupling.\n\nWhen coupling l=0 to l=1, the possible m values are m = m_l + m_s, where m_l can be -1, 0, or 1 for l=1.\n\nSince m_s = 0 for s=1/2 in the hydrogen atom, but perhaps I need to consider the total angular momentum including spin.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that this is the non-relativistic theory, so we can ignore spin-orbit coupling.\n\nTherefore, the total angular momentum is approximately L + S, but in the LS coupling scheme, for the hydrogen atom, usually, we consider only L and ignore S for electric dipole transitions.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can treat this as a pure L transition, ignoring spin.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the branching ratios can be determined based on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=0 to L=1.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling L=0 and L=1 to give L=1 are:\n\n- <1 0; 1 m|1 m> = 1 for m = -1, 0, 1\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, coupling L=0 and L=1"
