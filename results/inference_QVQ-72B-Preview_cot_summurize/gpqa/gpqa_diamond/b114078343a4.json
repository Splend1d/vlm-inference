                    "text": "So I have this problem about finding the expectation value of the electron's spin along the y-direction, S_y, given that the electron is in a spin state (3i, 4). I need to choose from four options: A. 12*hbar/25, B. 25*hbar/2, C. -25*hbar/2, D. -12*hbar/25.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic quantum mechanics related to spin. For an electron, the spin angular momentum is described by the spin operators S_x, S_y, and S_z, which correspond to the components of spin along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. The eigenvalues of these operators are \u00b1\u0127/2 for an electron, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nBut in this problem, I'm dealing with a state that seems to be given in terms of complex numbers, specifically (3i, 4). I suspect that this represents the state vector in some spin basis, probably the z-basis. However, it's a bit confusing because typically, spin states for an electron are represented as two-component spinors, like (a, b), where a and b are complex numbers, and the normalization condition |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 must be satisfied.\n\nLet me check if (3i, 4) is normalized. The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (3)^2 + (4)^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. So, the state is not normalized; it needs to be normalized to use it in expectation value calculations. Therefore, the normalized state should be (3i/5, 4/5).\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of S_y, I need to compute <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8>, where |\u03c8> is the state vector and S_y is the spin operator along the y-direction.\n\nI remember that the spin operators for an electron are given by the Pauli matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. Specifically, S_y is (\u0127/2) times the Pauli-Y matrix, which is:\n\n\u03c3_y = \n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\n0 & -i \\\\\n\ni & 0\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nSo, S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value is:\n\n<\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\nFirst, I need to compute <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>. Given that |\u03c8> = (3i/5, 4/5), the conjugate transpose <\u03c8| is ( -3i/5, 4/5 ).\n\nNow, compute <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>:\n\n<\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = ( -3i/5, 4/5 ) \n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\n0 & -i \\\\\n\ni & 0\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\n3i/5 \\\\\n\n4/5\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n= ( -3i/5 )( -i )(4/5 ) + ( 4/5 )( i )(3i/5 )\n\n= (3i/5)(4i/5) + (4/5)(3i/5)\n\n= (12i\u00b2/25) + (12i/25)\n\nBut i\u00b2 = -1, so 12i\u00b2/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n-12/25 + 12i/25\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the matrix multiplication.\n\n<\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = ( -3i/5, 4/5 ) \u03c3_y (3i/5, 4/5)\n\n\u03c3_y applied to (3i/5, 4/5) is:\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\n0 & -i \\\\\n\ni & 0\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\n3i/5 \\\\\n\n4/5\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\n-i(4/5) \\\\\n\ni(3i/5)\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\n-4i/5 \\\\\n\ni(3i/5) = i^2 (3/5) = -3/5\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\nSo, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = ( -3i/5, 4/5 ) \\begin{pmatrix}\n\n-4i/5 \\\\\n\n-3/5\n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n= (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)\n\n= (12i\u00b2/25) + (-12/25)\n\nAgain, since i\u00b2 = -1, this is:\n\n12*(-1)/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nWait, but there's a mistake here. Let's carefully compute the dot product:\n\n<\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\nFirst, compute (-3i/5)*(-4i/5):\n\n(-3i)(-4i) = 12i\u00b2 = 12*(-1) = -12\n\nDivided by 25: -12/25\n\nThen, (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25\n\nSo, total: -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nTherefore, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = -24/25\n\nNow, the expectation value is:\n\n< S_y > = (\u0127/2) * (-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nSo, the expectation value of S_y is -12\u0127/25, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about the normalization. I normalized the state to (3i/5, 4/5), and the norm is |3i/5|^2 + |4/5|^2 = (9/25) + (16/25) = 25/25 = 1, which is correct.\n\nAlso, checking the matrix multiplication again:\n\n\u03c3_y applied to (3i/5, 4/5) gives (-4i/5, -3/5), and then the dot product with (-3i/5, 4/5) is indeed (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i\u00b2/25) - (12/25) = (-12/25) - (12/25) = -24/25.\n\nTherefore, < S_y > = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. -12*hbar/25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D. -\\dfrac{12\\hbar}{25}}\\]"
