                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about identifying two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 from their 1H NMR spectrum. The spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene. I need to figure out which two compounds are present in the mixture.\n\nFirst, since both compounds have the same molecular formula, C10H14, and they're aromatic, they must be isomers of each other. The NMR spectrum is giving me information about the protons in these molecules.\n\nLet's start by understanding what the NMR signals represent. The two singlets at around 6.7 ppm are likely from the aromatic protons, and the three singlets at around 2.2 ppm are probably from the methyl groups or the ethyl groups.\n\nSince all the aromatic protons are giving singlets, that suggests that in each compound, the aromatic protons are equivalent to each other, meaning they have the same chemical environment.\n\nSimilarly, the methyl or ethyl protons are also giving singlets, which means they are equivalent in their respective compounds.\n\nNow, looking at the ratios:\n\n- For the aromatic region: two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since there are two compounds, and each has aromatic protons, this makes sense.\n\n- For the alkyl region: three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. This suggests that in the mixture, there are different types of methyl or ethyl protons in these proportions.\n\nGiven that it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, the combined NMR spectrum is the average of the two compounds' spectra.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, let's look at 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in the 1,2,3,5-positions. So, the aromatic ring has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nWait, actually, I need to visualize the structure. Let's think of benzene as having positions 1 through 6.\n\nIf I have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,5, that leaves positions 4 and 6 without methyl groups.\n\nSo, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4 and 6. But since the molecule is symmetric, these two protons should be equivalent, meaning they would give one singlet in the NMR spectrum.\n\nBut according to the problem, there are two singlets in the aromatic region, not one.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't one of the compounds.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the positions. Let me double-check.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,5, leaving 4 and 6 as hydrogen atoms.\n\nYes, so the aromatic protons are at positions 4 and 6. Given the symmetry, these should be equivalent, so one singlet for the aromatic protons.\n\nBut the problem says there are two singlets in the aromatic region, so perhaps this isn't matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes one singlet to the aromatic region.\n\nBut if that's the case, then in the alkyl region, the combined signals should reflect the contributions from both compounds.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSince it's a 1:1 mixture, the NMR spectrum is an average of the two compounds' spectra.\n\nSo, if I have two compounds, each with its own set of NMR signals, in a 1:1 mixture, the total signal intensities would be the sum of the individual signal intensities, each scaled by the mole fraction, which is 0.5 in this case.\n\nBut in practice, if the compounds have distinct signals, we can see separate peaks for each compound.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the aromatic region first.\n\nThe problem states two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. This suggests that each compound has one set of aromatic protons giving a singlet in that region.\n\nNow, looking back at Option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nLet's analyze each compound's NMR spectrum.\n\nFirst, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nAs I thought earlier, the aromatic protons are equivalent, so one singlet for the aromatic protons.\n\nSecond, 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, the two ethyl groups are para to each other.\n\nThe aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6, assuming positions 1 and 4 have the ethyl groups.\n\nGiven the symmetry, these four aromatic protons should be equivalent, so one singlet for the aromatic protons.\n\nBut the problem mentions two singlets in the aromatic region, which would require that each compound has one singlet in the aromatic region.\n\nHowever, in this option, both compounds have one singlet each, so combined, there should be two singlets, which matches the problem's description.\n\nBut wait, the alkyl region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's look at the alkyl protons for each compound.\n\nFor 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThere are four methyl groups, each attached directly to the benzene ring.\n\nThese methyl groups are all equivalent, so one singlet for the methyl protons.\n\nEach methyl group has three protons, so total 12 protons from methyl groups.\n\nFor 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\nThere are two ethyl groups, each consisting of a CH3 and a CH2 group.\n\nGiven the symmetry, both ethyl groups are equivalent.\n\nEach ethyl group has one CH3 and one CH2.\n\nSo, total for two ethyl groups: 2 CH3's and 2 CH2's.\n\nBut are these CH3's and CH2's equivalent?\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, the two ethyl groups are symmetrically placed, so their CH3's should be equivalent, and their CH2's should be equivalent.\n\nTherefore, two distinct types of protons in the alkyl region: CH3 and CH2.\n\nEach type has 6 protons (since 2 CH3's \u00d7 3 protons each = 6, and 2 CH2's \u00d7 2 protons each = 4, but in terms of types, CH3 and CH2 are different).\n\nNow, in the mixture:\n\n- From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 12 methyl protons (one type).\n\n- From 1,4-diethylbenzene: 6 CH3 protons and 4 CH2 protons (two types).\n\nSo, total in the alkyl region:\n\n- Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n- Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n- Methylene protons from diethylbenzene: 4 protons.\n\nSince the problem mentions three singlets in the alkyl region in a 2:1:1 ratio, these three types of protons should correspond to these three signals.\n\nLet's check the ratios:\n\n- Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n- Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n- Methylene protons from diethylbenzene: 4 protons.\n\nThe total number of protons is 12 + 6 + 4 = 22 protons in the alkyl region.\n\nBut the ratio is given as 2:1:1.\n\nLet's see if these numbers fit into a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nFirst, find the least common multiple or a common factor that can scale these proportions.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n- Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n- Methylene protons from diethylbenzene: 4 protons.\n\nIf we consider the ratios:\n\n- 12 : 6 : 4\n\nThis simplifies to 3 : 1 : 1.\n\nBut the problem states the ratio is 2:1:1.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nOption A predicts a 3:1:1 ratio, but the problem states 2:1:1.\n\nTherefore, Option A doesn't match the observed NMR data.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in counting the protons.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the mixture, the compounds are present in a 1:1 ratio, so their contributions need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nLet's recast the numbers.\n\nEach compound is present in equal moles, so for every mole of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, there's one mole of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nFrom 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\n- 12 methyl protons.\n\nFrom 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\n- 6 methyl protons.\n\n- 4 methylene protons.\n\nTotal methyl protons: 12 + 6 = 18 protons.\n\nTotal methylene protons: 4 protons.\n\nSo, the ratios are:\n\n- Methyl protons: 18\n\n- Methylene protons: 4\n\nBut the problem mentions three singlets, which suggests there are three distinct types of protons in the alkyl region.\n\nWait, perhaps the methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene are chemically distinct and appear at different positions in the NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's assume that the methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene appear at one position, those from diethylbenzene at another, and the methylene protons at a third position.\n\nGiven that, the three singlets would correspond to:\n\n1. Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n2. Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n3. Methylene protons from diethylbenzene: 4 protons.\n\nThe ratio is then 12:6:4, which simplifies to 3:1:1, but the problem states 2:1:1.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene overlap in the NMR spectrum, appearing as one signal.\n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio would be different.\n\nBut the problem mentions three distinct singlets in the alkyl region, so likely they are separate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the methylene protons split into more signals due to coupling, but since they are singlets, there's no coupling, meaning they are equivalent.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider another option.\n\nLet's look at Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nIn this compound, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\nSo, the aromatic protons are at positions 3 and 6.\n\nAre these protons equivalent?\n\nLet's see: positions 3 and 6 are meta to each other due to the symmetry.\n\nIn benzene, meta positions are symmetric, so yes, these two protons should be equivalent, giving one singlet in the aromatic region.\n\nSecond, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAs before, the aromatic protons are at positions 4 and 6, which are also equivalent, giving one singlet.\n\nSo, in a 1:1 mixture, we have two singlets in the aromatic region, matching the problem's description.\n\nNow, let's look at the alkyl region.\n\nFor 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nFour equivalent methyl groups, so one singlet for the methyl protons.\n\nEach methyl has three protons, total 12 protons.\n\nFor 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nSimilarly, four equivalent methyl groups, one singlet for the methyl protons, total 12 protons.\n\nSo, in the alkyl region, we have two sets of methyl protons, each contributing 12 protons.\n\nBut the problem mentions three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis doesn't fit because we have only two types of methyl protons here: one from each compound.\n\nUnless there's a difference in chemical shift between the two compounds' methyl protons, which is possible, but the problem indicates three singlets.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps one of the compounds has more than one type of methyl proton.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's double-check the structures.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, are all four methyl groups equivalent?\n\nLet's visualize: positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nPositions 1 and 4 are meta to each other, and positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other.\n\nWait, positions 1 and 4 are actually para to each other, not meta.\n\nI think I need to draw the structure.\n\nLet me sketch benzene:\n\n1   2   3\n\n|   |   |\n\n6 - 4 - 5 - 1\n\n|   |   |\n\n3   5   6\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, methyl groups at 1,2,3,5.\n\nSo, positions 1 and 3 are ortho to each other, positions 2 and 6 are meta to positions 1 and 3.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should look up the symmetry of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nUpon checking, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has a plane of symmetry, and all four methyl groups are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bonds.\n\nTherefore, only one singlet for the methyl protons.\n\nSimilarly, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\nSo, in the mixture, we have two singlets in the alkyl region, one from each compound, each with 12 protons.\n\nBut the problem mentions three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, Option B is not correct.\n\nLet's move on to Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAs before, four equivalent methyl groups, one singlet in the alkyl region, 12 protons.\n\nSecond, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nIn this compound, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nLet's visualize: positions 1 and 4 are para to each other, positions 2 and 3 are meta to positions 1 and 4.\n\nGiven the symmetry, are the methyl groups equivalent?\n\nPositions 1 and 4 are para to each other, and positions 2 and 3 are meta to positions 1 and 4.\n\nBut are positions 1 and 4 equivalent to positions 2 and 3?\n\nIn 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, due to the symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, one singlet for the methyl protons, 12 protons.\n\nSo, in the mixture, we have two singlets in the alkyl region, each with 12 protons.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the problem's description of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, Option C is not correct.\n\nFinally, Option D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAs before, four equivalent methyl groups, one singlet in the alkyl region, 12 protons.\n\nSecond, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nSimilarly, four equivalent methyl groups, one singlet in the alkyl region, 12 protons.\n\nAgain, in the mixture, two singlets in the alkyl region, each with 12 protons.\n\nThis doesn't match the problem's description of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, Option D is not correct.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit the NMR data provided.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet's reconsider Option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the methyl protons from both compounds would appear as separate signals, but perhaps they overlap into one signal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the methylene protons split into more signals due to coupling, but the problem states singlets, so no coupling.\n\nWait, perhaps the methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene are not distinct in the NMR spectrum, and their signals overlap.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the alkyl region, we would have:\n\n- Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n- Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n- Methylene protons from diethylbenzene: 4 protons.\n\nIf the methyl protons from both compounds appear at the same chemical shift, then we would have one signal for methyl protons (12 + 6 = 18 protons) and one for methylene protons (4 protons).\n\nBut the problem mentions three singlets, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene appear at different chemical shifts, and the methylene protons appear at a third position.\n\nIn that case, we have three distinct singlets:\n\n1. Methyl protons from tetramethylbenzene: 12 protons.\n\n2. Methyl protons from diethylbenzene: 6 protons.\n\n3. Methylene protons from di"
