                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. It's been a while since I've done this, but I'll give it a shot. The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I think this is the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9. The operators for observables P and Q are represented by square matrices. So, P and Q are operators, and their corresponding matrices are given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to measure P and then Q. The problem says \"if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P,\" and asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements.\n\nOkay, so it's a sequential measurement problem. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses to one of the eigenstates of that observable, with probabilities given by the square of the coefficients of the eigenstates in the original state.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Then, given that the measurement of P yields 0, I need to find the state after this measurement. Then, I measure Q and find the probability of getting -1.\n\nLet me start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nThe matrix for P is:\n\nP = [0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo,\n\nP - \u03bbI = [0 - \u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0 - \u03bb, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0 - \u03bb]\n\nNow, compute the determinant:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = (0 - \u03bb)[(0 - \u03bb)(0 - \u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)] - (1/\u221a2)[(1/\u221a2)(0 - \u03bb) - (0)(1/\u221a2)] + 0\n\n= -\u03bb[(\u03bb^2 - (1/2)) - (1/\u221a2)[-(\u03bb/\u221a2)]]\n\n= -\u03bb(\u03bb^2 - 1/2) + (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2)\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (1/2)\u03bb\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + \u03bb = 0\n\n\u03bb(-\u03bb^2 + 1) = 0\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11\n\nNow, find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb = 0:\n\n(P - 0*I) v = 0\n\nSo,\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0] v = 0\n\nLet's solve this system.\n\nFrom the first row: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u21d2 v2 = 0\n\nFrom the second row: (1/\u221a2)*v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2)*v1 + (1/\u221a2)*v3 = 0 \u21d2 v1 = -v3\n\nFrom the third row: same as first row.\n\nSo, v2 = 0, and v1 = -v3\n\nLet v3 = t, then v1 = -t\n\nSo, eigenvector for \u03bb = 0 is [-t, 0, t] = t[-1, 0, 1]\n\nNormalize this eigenvector.\n\nThe norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2)[-1, 0, 1] = [-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nNow, for \u03bb = 1:\n\n(P - I) v = 0\n\n[ -1, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, -1 ]\n\nRow reduce this matrix.\n\nFirst row: -v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 = (1/\u221a2)v2\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 - v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0\n\nSubstitute v1 from first row:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)v2 - v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/2)v2 - v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u21d2 (-1/2)v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0\n\nLet v3 = s, then (-1/2)v2 + (1/\u221a2)s = 0 \u21d2 v2 = [ (1/\u221a2)s ] / (1/2) = (2/\u221a2)s = \u221a2 s\n\nFrom v1 = (1/\u221a2)v2 = (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2 s) = s\n\nSo, eigenvector is [s, \u221a2 s, s] = s[1, \u221a2, 1]\n\nNormalize this.\n\nNorm = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\nSo, normalized eigenvector is (1/2)[1, \u221a2, 1]\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -1:\n\n(P - (-1)I) v = 0\n\n[1, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 1 ]\n\nRow reduce.\n\nFirst row: v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 = 0 \u21d2 v1 = -(1/\u221a2)v2\n\nSecond row: (1/\u221a2)v1 + v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0\n\nSubstitute v1:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-(1/\u221a2)v2) + v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u21d2 (-1/2)v2 + v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0 \u21d2 (1/2)v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0\n\nLet v3 = t, then (1/2)v2 + (1/\u221a2)t = 0 \u21d2 v2 = - (1/\u221a2)t / (1/2) = - (2/\u221a2)t = -\u221a2 t\n\nFrom v1 = -(1/\u221a2)v2 = -(1/\u221a2)(-\u221a2 t) = t\n\nSo, eigenvector is [t, -\u221a2 t, t] = t[1, -\u221a2, 1]\n\nNormalize this.\n\nNorm = sqrt(1 + 2 + 1) = sqrt(4) = 2\n\nSo, normalized eigenvector is (1/2)[1, -\u221a2, 1]\n\nNow, the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is [-1, 2, 1]\n\nWait, but in matrix form, it's a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1]\n\n[ 2 ]\n\n[ 1 ]\n\nNow, I need to express |\u03c8\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of P.\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9\n\nWhere |\u03bb=0\u27e9 = [-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\n|\u03bb=1\u27e9 = [1/2, \u221a2/2, 1/2]\n\n|\u03bb=-1\u27e9 = [1/2, -\u221a2/2, 1/2]\n\nNow, find a, b, c.\n\nSo,\n\na[-1/\u221a2] + b[1/2] + c[1/2] = -1\n\na[0] + b[\u221a2/2] + c[-\u221a2/2] = 2\n\na[1/\u221a2] + b[1/2] + c[1/2] = 1\n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + b/2 + c/2 = -1\n\nb\u221a2/2 - c\u221a2/2 = 2\n\na/(\u221a2) + b/2 + c/2 = 1\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = -1\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(b - c)\u221a2/2 = 2\n\nThird equation:\n\na/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = 1\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 1: -a/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = -1\n\nEquation 2: (b - c)\u221a2/2 = 2\n\nEquation 3: a/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = 1\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n(b - c)\u221a2/2 = 2 \u21d2 b - c = 4/(\u221a2) = 2\u221a2\n\nSo, b = c + 2\u221a2\n\nNow, plug this into Equations 1 and 3.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = -1\n\nPlug b = c + 2\u221a2:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + (c + 2\u221a2 + c)/2 = -1\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + (2c + 2\u221a2)/2 = -1\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + c + \u221a2 = -1\n\nNow, from Equation 3:\n\na/(\u221a2) + (b + c)/2 = 1\n\nPlug b = c + 2\u221a2:\n\na/(\u221a2) + (c + 2\u221a2 + c)/2 = 1\n\na/(\u221a2) + (2c + 2\u221a2)/2 = 1\n\na/(\u221a2) + c + \u221a2 = 1\n\nNow, I have:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + c + \u221a2 = -1 ...(1a)\n\na/(\u221a2) + c + \u221a2 = 1 ...(3a)\n\nAdd these two equations:\n\n(-a + a)/(\u221a2) + 2(c + \u221a2) = -1 + 1 \u21d2 0 + 2(c + \u221a2) = 0 \u21d2 c + \u221a2 = 0 \u21d2 c = -\u221a2\n\nNow, plug c back into b = c + 2\u221a2:\n\nb = -\u221a2 + 2\u221a2 = \u221a2\n\nNow, plug c = -\u221a2 and b = \u221a2 into Equation 1a:\n\n- a/(\u221a2) + (-\u221a2) + \u221a2 = -1 \u21d2 - a/(\u221a2) + 0 = -1 \u21d2 - a/(\u221a2) = -1 \u21d2 a = \u221a2\n\nSo, a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2\n\nNow, the state |\u03c8\u27e9 can be written as:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = \u221a2 |\u03bb=0\u27e9 + \u221a2 |\u03bb=1\u27e9 - \u221a2 |\u03bb=-1\u27e9\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nFirst, measure P and get P=0, then measure Q and get Q=-1.\n\nSo, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |\u03bb=0\u27e9, which is [-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nThen, measure Q.\n\nNow, find the matrix for Q:\n\nQ = [1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, -1]\n\nSo, Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, and -1, with corresponding eigenvectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], respectively.\n\nWait, but the matrix Q is:\n\nQ = [1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, -1]\n\nSo, eigenvalues are 1, 0, and -1, with eigenvectors [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1].\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the state is |\u03bb=0\u27e9 = [-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nExpress this in terms of Q's eigenstates.\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03bb=0\u27e9 = a |1\u27e9 + b |0\u27e9 + c |-1\u27e9\n\nWhere |1\u27e9 = [1, 0, 0], |0\u27e9 = [0, 1, 0], |-1\u27e9 = [0, 0, 1]\n\nSo,\n\na[1,0,0] + b[0,1,0] + c[0,0,1] = [-1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2]\n\nSo,\n\na = -1/\u221a2\n\nb = 0\n\nc = 1/\u221a2\n\nNow, the probability of measuring Q=-1 in this state is |c|^2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nSince we've already measured P=0, and the state is |\u03bb=0\u27e9, and then measuring Q=-1 has probability 1/2.\n\nBut let's confirm if there's any other consideration needed.\n\nIn sequential measurements, the probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the conditional probability of Q=-1 given P=0.\n\nBut since the state collapses to |\u03bb=0\u27e9 after measuring P=0, the probability of Q=-1 in that state is indeed 1/2.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 1/2 is one of them.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider the probability of measuring P=0 in the first place.\n\nThe state was |\u03c8\u27e9 = \u221a2 |\u03bb=0\u27e9 + \u221a2 |\u03bb=1\u27e9 - \u221a2 |\u03bb=-1\u27e9\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is |\u221a2|^2 = 2\n\nSimilarly, P=1 is |\u221a2|^2 = 2\n\nP=-1 is |-\u221a2|^2 = 2\n\nBut since the total probability should be 1, but here it's 6, which suggests normalization issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't normalize the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nThe state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1, 2, 1]\n\nIts norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is |\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)[-1, 2, 1]\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I assumed |\u03c8\u27e9 was normalized, which it's not.\n\nSo, correcting that.\n\nSo, |\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)[-1, 2, 1]\n\nNow, express |\u03c8\u27e9 in terms of eigenstates of P.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9\n\nWith a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2\n\nBut these were without normalization. So, with normalization:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1) = a|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9\n\nBut earlier, without normalization, a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2\n\nSo, with normalization:\n\na|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)\n\nBut |\u03bb=0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(-1, 0, 1)\n\n|\u03bb=1\u27e9 = (1/2)(1, \u221a2, 1)\n\n|\u03bb=-1\u27e9 = (1/2)(1, -\u221a2, 1)\n\nWait, earlier I had a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2, but that was without normalization.\n\nActually, with normalization, the coefficients should satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = 1.\n\nGiven that, if a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2, then |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which matches the normalization of |\u03c8\u27e9 being 1/\u221a6.\n\nWait, no. If |\u03c8\u27e9 = a|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9, and |\u03c8\u27e9 is normalized to 1, then |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = 1.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, a = \u221a2, b = \u221a2, c = -\u221a2, which would give |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nBut |\u03c8\u27e9 is actually (1/\u221a6)[-1, 2, 1], so the coefficients should be scaled by 1/\u221a6.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a, b, c such that:\n\na|\u03bb=0\u27e9 + b|\u03bb=1\u27e9 + c|\u03bb=-1\u27e9 = (1/\u221a6)[-1, 2, 1]\n\nWith |\u03bb=0\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)[-1, 0, 1]\n\n|\u03bb=1\u27e9 = (1/2)[1, \u221a2, 1]\n\n|\u03bb=-1\u27e9 = (1/2)[1, -\u221a2, 1]\n\nSo,\n\na*(1/\u221a2)[-1, 0, 1] + b*(1/2)[1, \u221a2, 1] + c*(1/2)[1, -\u221a2, 1] = (1/\u221a6)[-1, 2, 1]\n\nSo,\n\n(-a/\u221a2 + b/2 + c/2, 0 + b\u221a2/2 - c\u221a2/2, a/\u221a2 + b/2 + c/2) = (-1/\u221a6"
