                    "text": "So I've got this unknown compound to identify, and I have some spectral data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's try to piece together what this compound might be based on the given options: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nFirst up, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. I recall that broad peaks around 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 are often associated with O-H stretching, which could indicate the presence of a hydroxyl group, maybe in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But since it's a broad peak, it's likely due to hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or carboxylic acids.\n\nNext, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Let's see, 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 is typically where ketones or esters show their C=O stretching vibrations. 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 could be due to a C=C double bond or perhaps a C=O in a carboxylic acid or an amide. Given that there's already a peak at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is likely a carbonyl, the 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak might be from a C=C double bond.\n\nNow, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which are hydrogens attached to a carbon in a C=C double bond. That suggests there's at least one double bond in the molecule. Additionally, there are several other peaks, but without more detail, it's hard to interpret further.\n\nThe mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Fragmentation in mass spectrometry can give clues about the structure of the molecule. A peak at m/z = 45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3COOH (acetic acid), which has a molecular formula of C2H4O2 and a molar mass of 60 g/mol, but that doesn't directly match m/z = 45. Maybe it's a fragment from the compound losing some other group.\n\nLet me consider the molecular formulas provided:\n\nA. C6H10O2\n\nB. C6H12O2\n\nC. C6H12O\n\nD. C6H10O\n\nFirst, let's look at the hydrogen count. The compound has vinyl hydrogens, which are typically found in alkenes or aromatics. Vinyl hydrogens are sp\u00b2 hybridized and usually appear around 5-6 ppm in 1H NMR spectra.\n\nGiven that there are vinyl hydrogens, the compound must have at least one double bond. So, options C and D have fewer hydrogens compared to options A and B, which might suggest the presence of double bonds.\n\nOption A is C6H10O2. That could be a compound with one double bond and two oxygen atoms, possibly an ester or a ketone with an additional oxygen.\n\nOption B is C6H12O2. This has the same hydrogen count as option D, but D has only one oxygen. Wait, no, option B has two oxygen atoms, while option D has only one.\n\nWait, let's check the options again:\n\nA. C6H10O2\n\nB. C6H12O2\n\nC. C6H12O\n\nD. C6H10O\n\nOption A: C6H10O2 \u2013 likely has one double bond and two oxygen atoms.\n\nOption B: C6H12O2 \u2013 fully saturated with two oxygen atoms.\n\nOption C: C6H12O \u2013 fully saturated with one oxygen atom.\n\nOption D: C6H10O \u2013 has one double bond and one oxygen atom.\n\nGiven that there are vinyl hydrogens, options A and D are possibilities, while options B and C would likely be fully saturated unless there's a ring present.\n\nBut wait, a six-carbon chain can form a ring, like a cyclohexane derivative, which could introduce double bonds without increasing the number of hydrogens.\n\nHowever, considering the presence of vinyl hydrogens, it's more likely that there's a carbon-carbon double bond present.\n\nLet's consider option A: C6H10O2. Possible structures could include esters or acids with a double bond. For example, hex-2-enoic acid (crotonic acid) has the formula C4H6O2, but that's not matching. Wait, no, hex-2-enoic acid would be C6H10O2, actually. Yes, that fits.\n\nOption B: C6H12O2 \u2013 this could be a saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid (C6H12O2), but that doesn't have any double bonds, so it wouldn't have vinyl hydrogens.\n\nOption C: C6H12O \u2013 this could be a primary or secondary alcohol, like 1-hexanol or 2-hexanol, which are fully saturated and thus no double bonds.\n\nOption D: C6H10O \u2013 this could be an alcohol or ketone with one double bond, like pent-1-en-3-ol.\n\nBut let's look back at the FTIR data. There's a broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, which suggests O-H stretching, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group. There are also peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, which could correspond to C=O and C=C stretching, respectively.\n\nIf there's an O-H group, it's likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, we'd expect a C=O stretch around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 and possibly a C-O stretch around 1200-1300 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nHowever, the presence of a C=C double bond suggests it might be an unsaturated carboxylic acid or an alcohol with a double bond.\n\nLet's consider option A: C6H10O2. If it's a hexenoic acid, say hex-2-enoic acid, that would fit the formula C6H10O2, have a C=C double bond and a carboxylic acid group, which would explain the O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut the FTIR also shows a peak at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is likely the C=C stretch.\n\nOption D: C6H10O \u2013 this could be an alcohol with a double bond, like hex-2-en-1-ol, which would have the formula C6H10O. This would have a C=C double bond and an O-H group, explaining the broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 and possibly a C=O stretch if it's a ketone, but since it's an alcohol, it's more likely to have a C-O single bond, which would absorb around 1000-1200 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nWait, but the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, which suggests a C=O group is present. So if it's an alcohol, it might also have a C=O from a ketone group, making it a ketone-alcohol, but that would require more oxygen atoms, which doesn't match the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an ester, which would have a C=O stretch at around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 and a C-O stretch around 1200 cm\u207b\u00b9.\n\nBut esters typically don't have a broad O-H peak unless they're part of a hydrogen-bonded network, which might not be the case.\n\nOption B: C6H12O2 \u2013 this could be a saturated ester, like ethyl butyrate (C6H12O2), which has a C=O stretch at around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 but no O-H group, so the broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 wouldn't be explained.\n\nOption C: C6H12O \u2013 this is likely a primary or secondary alcohol, fully saturated, with no double bonds, so no vinyl hydrogens, which contradicts the NMR data.\n\nGiven all this, option A: C6H10O2 seems the most plausible. It can accommodate a carboxylic acid group and a double bond, explaining all the spectral features:\n\n- Broad O-H peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 from the carboxylic acid.\n\n- C=O stretch at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 from the carboxylic acid.\n\n- C=C stretch at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 from the double bond.\n\n- Vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum.\n\nAdditionally, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Let's see what that could correspond to.\n\nIf the compound is C6H10O2, possible fragments could include:\n\n- Losing CO2 from the carboxylic acid group, which would leave C4H8, but that has a molar mass of 56 g/mol, which doesn't match m/z = 45.\n\n- Alternatively, breaking off a smaller fragment.\n\nWait, perhaps the fragment corresponds to CH3COOH, which has a molar mass of 60 g/mol, but that's higher than m/z = 45.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a fragment from the alkene part.\n\nLet's consider the molecular ion peak. The molecular formula C6H10O2 has a molar mass of about 126 g/mol.\n\nIn the mass spectrum, the base peak or significant peaks can help identify fragments.\n\nIf m/z = 45 is a significant fragment, perhaps it corresponds to CH3CH=O (acetone), which has a molar mass of 58 g/mol, but that's still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a fragment from the carboxylic acid group.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the COOH group fragmenting to give COOH\u207a, which would be m/z = 45.\n\nYes, that makes sense. COOH\u207a has a molar mass of 45 g/mol, which matches m/z = 45.\n\nThis further supports that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.\n\nTherefore, combining all the spectral data:\n\n- FTIR: broad O-H at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9, C=O at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, C=C at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\n- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens\n\n- Mass spectrum: fragment at m/z = 45 (COOH\u207a)\n\nThe most fitting formula among the options is C6H10O2, which corresponds to a hexenoic acid, likely with one double bond and a carboxylic acid group.\n\nThus, the answer is A. C6H10O2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
