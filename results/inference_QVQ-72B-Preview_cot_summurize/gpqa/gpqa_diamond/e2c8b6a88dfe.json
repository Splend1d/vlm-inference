                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy, and we're supposed to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's reference frame. The speed from the ejecta's perspective is 60,000 km/s, and we're told that both the ejecta and the Galaxy can be considered inertial frames, meaning they're moving at constant velocities relative to each other.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what an inertial frame is. In special relativity, an inertial frame is one that moves at a constant velocity relative to another inertial frame. So, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s from its own perspective, that means that in the Galaxy's reference frame, the ejecta is approaching at that speed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that from the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. That means that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is coming towards it at that speed. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving away from it at the same speed.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't make sense because they are moving towards each other. Let me make sure I understand this correctly. If the ejecta sees the Galaxy approaching at 60,000 km/s, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at the same speed. So, both are moving towards each other at 60,000 km/s relative to each other.\n\nNow, I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. This sounds like a problem involving time dilation, which is a concept in special relativity where time passes differently for observers in different inertial frames moving relative to each other.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (the rest frame),\n\n- \\( t_0 \\) is the time measured in the ejecta's frame (the moving frame),\n\n- \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, given by \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\),\n\n- \\( v \\) is the relative velocity between the two frames,\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the values I have. The relative velocity \\( v \\) is 60,000 km/s, which is the same as 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light \\( c \\) is approximately 299,792,458 m/s.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{60,000,000}{299,792,458} \\right)^2 }} \\]\n\nLet me compute the fraction first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{60,000,000}{299,792,458} \\]\n\nThat's approximately:\n\n\\[ \\frac{60,000,000}{299,792,458} \\approx 0.2 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2 }} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{0.96} \\) is approximately 0.98, so:\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx \\frac{1}{0.98} \\approx 1.0204 \\]\n\nSo, the time \\( t \\) in the Galaxy's frame would be:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 = 1.0204 \\times 50 \\text{ s} \\approx 51.02 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nNow, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame would be the velocity multiplied by the time in that frame:\n\n\\[ d = v \\times t = 60,000 \\text{ km/s} \\times 51.02 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ d \\approx 60,000 \\times 51.02 \\]\n\nFirst, 60,000 times 50 is 3,000,000 km.\n\nThen, 60,000 times 1.02 is 61,200 km.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n\\[ d \\approx 3,000,000 + 61,200 = 3,061,200 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2,880,000 km.\n\nB. 3,060,000 km.\n\nC. 3,000,000 km.\n\nD. 2,940,000 km.\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 3,061,200 km, which is closest to option B: 3,060,000 km.\n\nBut wait a minute, I approximated some values along the way. Maybe I should be more precise in my calculations.\n\nLet's redo the calculations with more precision.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\frac{v}{c} \\):\n\n\\[ v = 60,000 \\text{ km/s} = 60,000,000 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ c = 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{60,000,000}{299,792,458} \\approx 0.2001 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2001)^2 }} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.04004001}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.95995999}} \\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{0.95995999} \\) more accurately, it's approximately 0.9797.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\gamma \\approx \\frac{1}{0.9797} \\approx 1.0207 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ t = 1.0207 \\times 50 \\text{ s} \\approx 51.035 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nNow, the distance:\n\n\\[ d = 60,000 \\text{ km/s} \\times 51.035 \\text{ s} = 3,062,100 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nThis is even closer to 3,060,000 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 3,060,000 km.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 3,060,000 \\ \\text{km}} \\]"
