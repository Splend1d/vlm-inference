                    "text": "So I've got this chemistry problem here, and it's a bit involved, but I'll try to work through it step by step. We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, totaling 7.20 grams, and it's heated to 200\u00b0C in the absence of air, producing only a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through three tubes: one with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, another with Ca(OH)2 solution, and a third with red-hot copper. There are some weight changes in tubes 1 and 3, and the second tube doesn't change in weight. Finally, there's some remaining gas C, with a volume of 2.24 liters at STP.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening in each tube.\n\nTube #1 contains Mg(ClO4)2, which is typically used to absorb water vapor. So, this tube is likely capturing any water vapor from the gas mixture. It gains 3.60 g, which I assume is the mass of water absorbed.\n\nTube #2 contains Ca(OH)2 solution, which is commonly used to absorb carbon dioxide. However, it doesn't change in weight, meaning there's no carbon dioxide in the gas mixture or perhaps it's not absorbing anything under the given conditions.\n\nTube #3 contains red-hot copper, which can react with oxygen to form CuO. It gains 0.80 g, which should be the mass of CuO formed, indicating that there was oxygen in the gas mixture.\n\nAfter passing through these tubes, there's a remaining gas C with a volume of 2.24 liters at STP. At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters, so 2.24 liters would be 0.1 moles of gas C.\n\nNow, since it's an equimolar mixture of A and B, and the total mass is 7.20 g, each salt has a mass of 3.60 g. But I don't know their molar masses yet, so I'll need to figure that out.\n\nLet's denote the molar masses of A and B as M_A and M_B, respectively. Since they're present in equal moles, and their total mass is 7.20 g, if their molar masses are the same, that would make each 3.60 g, meaning 1 mole each. But if their molar masses differ, it gets more complicated. For now, I'll assume they have the same molar mass, which might simplify things.\n\nAssuming M_A = M_B = M, then moles of A = moles of B = 7.20 g / (2M) = 3.60 g / M.\n\nBut maybe that's not the case, so I need to consider general moles.\n\nLet\u2019s denote moles of A as n_A and moles of B as n_B. Since it's equimolar, n_A = n_B = n.\n\nTotal mass: m_A + m_B = 7.20 g.\n\nm_A = n * M_A\n\nm_B = n * M_B\n\nSo, n * (M_A + M_B) = 7.20 g.\n\nBut without knowing M_A and M_B, this isn't helpful yet.\n\nLet's look back at the gases produced.\n\nFrom tube #1: 3.60 g of water absorbed. That means there was water vapor in the gas mixture.\n\nFrom tube #3: 0.80 g of CuO formed, indicating oxygen was present.\n\nRemaining gas C: 0.1 moles.\n\nSo, the gases produced upon heating the mixture are:\n\n- Water vapor (H\u2082O)\n\n- Oxygen (O\u2082)\n\n- And another gas C (0.1 moles)\n\nNow, I need to find out what gas C is. It didn't react with Mg(ClO4)2, Ca(OH)2, or red-hot copper, and it's inert enough to be collected at the end.\n\nPossible candidates could be noble gases, nitrogen, or something else that doesn't react with these reagents.\n\nBut since we're dealing with salts A and B, which are likely metal salts, perhaps containing nitrogen or something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's nitrogen gas (N\u2082), which is inert and wouldn't react with the reagents.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of water and oxygen from the data.\n\nTube #1: 3.60 g of H\u2082O.\n\nMolar mass of H\u2082O = 18 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of H\u2082O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 moles.\n\nTube #3: 0.80 g of CuO formed.\n\nMolar mass of CuO = 63.546 (Cu) + 15.9994 (O) \u2248 79.5454 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of O\u2082 that reacted to form CuO:\n\n2 Cu + O\u2082 \u2192 2 CuO.\n\nSo, moles of O\u2082 = moles of CuO / 2 = 0.80 g / 79.5454 g/mol / 2 \u2248 0.005 moles.\n\nWait, that seems off.\n\nWait, the reaction is:\n\n2 Cu + O\u2082 \u2192 2 CuO.\n\nSo, 1 mole O\u2082 reacts with 2 moles Cu to form 2 moles CuO.\n\nSo, moles of O\u2082 = moles of CuO / 2.\n\nBut the mass of CuO is 0.80 g, and molar mass of CuO is approximately 79.55 g/mol.\n\nSo, moles of CuO = 0.80 g / 79.55 g/mol \u2248 0.010 moles.\n\nTherefore, moles of O\u2082 = 0.010 moles / 2 = 0.005 moles.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 0.80 g / 79.5454 / 2, which gives approximately 0.005 moles, but let's confirm the calculation.\n\n0.80 g / 79.5454 g/mol = \u2248 0.010 moles CuO.\n\nThen, moles O\u2082 = 0.010 moles / 2 = 0.005 moles.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, remaining gas C is 0.1 moles.\n\nSo, total moles of gas produced:\n\nH\u2082O: 0.2 moles\n\nO\u2082: 0.005 moles\n\nC: 0.1 moles\n\nTotal moles of gas = 0.2 + 0.005 + 0.1 = 0.305 moles.\n\nBut, since the salts A and B are present in equimolar amounts, and they decompose to produce these gases, I need to see how their decomposition relates to their stoichiometry.\n\nAssuming A and B decompose to produce H\u2082O, O\u2082, and C, and possibly other gases that were absorbed or didn't form.\n\nWait, but tube #2 with Ca(OH)2 didn't change in weight, meaning no CO\u2082 was present, or perhaps it didn't absorb any gas under the conditions.\n\nBut since Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO\u2082, and there was no weight change, I can assume there's no CO\u2082 in the gas mixture.\n\nSo, the gases produced are H\u2082O, O\u2082, and C (0.1 moles).\n\nNow, since A and B are present in equimolar amounts, and their total mass is 7.20 g, each has a mass of 3.60 g.\n\nBut without knowing their molar masses, I can't find the moles directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total moles of gas produced from both A and B and relate that to their stoichiometry.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the total moles of gas produced per mole of A and B.\n\nBut I need more information.\n\nLet me consider that both A and B decompose to produce H\u2082O, O\u2082, and C in some stoichiometric ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is a byproduct of the decomposition, and H\u2082O and O\u2082 come from A and B.\n\nBut I need to find a way to relate the amounts.\n\nLet me consider the total moles of gas produced from both A and B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the moles of gas produced per mole of A as x, y, z for H\u2082O, O\u2082, C respectively.\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nBut since A and B are present in equal moles, and their decomposition products are combined, I need to set up equations based on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total moles of gas produced from both A and B.\n\nGiven that n moles of A produce a certain number of moles of gases, and similarly for B.\n\nBut without knowing the exact decomposition reactions, it's tricky.\n\nMaybe I can consider the total moles of gas produced and relate that to the moles of A and B.\n\nTotal moles of gas: 0.305 moles.\n\nIf A and B are present in equal moles, say n moles each, then total moles from A and B would be n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n moles.\n\nBut this doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total moles of gas produced is related to the moles of A and B in a specific ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the mass of A and B.\n\nEach has 3.60 g.\n\nLet\u2019s denote M_A as the molar mass of A, M_B as the molar mass of B.\n\nSince they're equimolar, and total mass is 7.20 g, each has 3.60 g, so n = 3.60 g / M_A for A, and similarly for B.\n\nBut without knowing M_A and M_B, this is still unclear.\n\nPerhaps I need to look for another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the total mass of gases produced.\n\nMass of H\u2082O: 3.60 g\n\nMass of O\u2082: from 0.005 moles O\u2082, molar mass \u2248 32 g/mol, so mass = 0.005 moles * 32 g/mol = 0.16 g\n\nMass of C: from 0.1 moles, assuming it's a gas at STP, but we don't know its molar mass yet.\n\nTotal mass of gases: 3.60 g + 0.16 g + (0.1 moles * molar mass of C) = 3.76 g + (0.1 * M_C)\n\nBut the original salts had a total mass of 7.20 g.\n\nAssuming no residue is left after decomposition, which the problem states: \"only a mixture of gases was formed.\"\n\nSo, mass of gases should equal the mass of the original salts: 7.20 g.\n\nTherefore:\n\n3.76 g + 0.1 * M_C = 7.20 g\n\n0.1 * M_C = 7.20 g - 3.76 g = 3.44 g\n\nM_C = 3.44 g / 0.1 moles = 34.4 g/mol\n\nSo, gas C has a molar mass of approximately 34.4 g/mol.\n\nNow, what could gas C be?\n\nPossible candidates:\n\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): 28 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen (O\u2082): 32 g/mol\n\n- Chlorine (Cl\u2082): 70.9 g/mol\n\n- Sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082): 64 g/mol\n\n- Ammonia (NH\u2083): 17 g/mol\n\n- Methane (CH\u2084): 16 g/mol\n\n- Hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S): 34 g/mol\n\n- Phosphine (PH\u2083): 34 g/mol\n\nSo, H\u2082S and PH\u2083 have molar masses close to 34 g/mol.\n\nBut the problem states that only 2.24 liters (0.1 moles) of gas C remains, which corresponds to 34.4 g/mol, so it's likely H\u2082S or PH\u2083.\n\nBut let's see which one fits better.\n\nGiven that the salts decompose to produce H\u2082O, O\u2082, and C, and considering that tube #2 with Ca(OH)2 didn't change in weight, meaning no CO\u2082 was present, perhaps the salts don't contain carbon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is H\u2082S, since S is a common element in salts and can form H\u2082S upon decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, PH\u2083 is also possible, but let's see.\n\nLet\u2019s consider H\u2082S for now.\n\nIf C is H\u2082S, then its molar mass is approximately 34 g/mol, which matches our calculation.\n\nNow, let's see the total atoms in salts A and B.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nGiven that A and B are present in equimolar amounts, and their total mass is 7.20 g, each has 3.60 g.\n\nIf I can determine the molecular formulas of A and B, I can find the total number of atoms in one formula unit and then multiply by two (since there are equal moles of A and B).\n\nBut I need to find the formulas first.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that upon decomposition, A and B produce H\u2082O, O\u2082, and H\u2082S.\n\nAssuming that A and B are metal sulfides or something similar that can produce these gases upon decomposition.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible candidates.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we have:\n\n- H\u2082O: 0.2 moles\n\n- O\u2082: 0.005 moles\n\n- H\u2082S: 0.1 moles\n\nTotal moles of gases: 0.2 + 0.005 + 0.1 = 0.305 moles\n\nOriginal salts: 7.20 g total, equimolar amounts of A and B, each 3.60 g.\n\nAssuming A and B decompose to produce these gases, and since they are present in equal moles, perhaps their decomposition produces similar amounts of gases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of moles of gases produced per mole of A and B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote n as the moles of A and B each.\n\nThen, total moles from A: n, from B: n, total: 2n.\n\nBut I don't know n yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the total moles of gases and relate them to the moles of A and B.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the total mass of gases and set up an equation.\n\nTotal mass of gases: 3.60 g (H\u2082O) + 0.16 g (O\u2082) + 3.44 g (H\u2082S) = 7.20 g, which matches the original mass of the salts.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, let's think about the decomposition.\n\nSuppose A decomposes to produce x moles of H\u2082O, y moles of O\u2082, and z moles of H\u2082S per mole of A.\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nSince A and B are present in equal moles, and their decomposition products are combined, the total moles of each gas are:\n\nH\u2082O: 2n * x = 0.2 moles\n\nO\u2082: 2n * y = 0.005 moles\n\nH\u2082S: 2n * z = 0.1 moles\n\nWhere n is the number of moles of each salt A and B.\n\nAssuming A and B decompose similarly, perhaps x, y, z are the same for both, but without more information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A and B are different and decompose differently.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the molar masses.\n\nEach salt has a mass of 3.60 g, and they decompose to produce the gases.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the mass balance.\n\nMass of H\u2082O: 0.2 moles * 18 g/mol = 3.60 g\n\nMass of O\u2082: 0.005 moles * 32 g/mol = 0.16 g\n\nMass of H\u2082S: 0.1 moles * 34 g/mol = 3.4 g\n\nTotal mass of gases: 3.60 + 0.16 + 3.4 = 7.16 g, which is very close to 7.20 g. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding errors in molar masses.\n\nSo, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, perhaps I can consider the ratios of moles of gases produced.\n\nH\u2082O: 0.2 moles\n\nO\u2082: 0.005 moles\n\nH\u2082S: 0.1 moles\n\nRatio: H\u2082O : O\u2082 : H\u2082S = 0.2 : 0.005 : 0.1 = 40 : 1 : 2\n\nThis suggests that for every 40 moles of H\u2082O, there is 1 mole of O\u2082 and 2 moles of H\u2082S.\n\nBut I need to relate this to the moles of A and B.\n\nAssuming A and B are present in equal moles, say n moles each, then total moles from A and B are 2n.\n\nSo, per mole of A and B combined, the gases produced are:\n\nH\u2082O: 0.2 / 2n = 0.1 / n moles per mole of A and B\n\nO\u2082: 0.005 / 2n = 0.0025 / n moles per mole of A and B\n\nH\u2082S: 0.1 / 2n = 0.05 / n moles per mole of A and B\n\nBut without knowing n, this isn't helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that A and B decompose to produce these gases in a specific stoichiometry.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mole of A produces a moles of H\u2082O, b moles of O\u2082, and c moles of H\u2082S.\n\nSimilarly, each mole of B produces d moles of H\u2082O, e moles of O\u2082, and f moles of H\u2082S.\n\nThen, total moles from A and B:\n\nH\u2082O: a*n + d*n = (a + d)*n = 0.2 moles\n\nO\u2082: b*n + e*n = (b + e)*n = 0.005 moles\n\nH\u2082S: c"
