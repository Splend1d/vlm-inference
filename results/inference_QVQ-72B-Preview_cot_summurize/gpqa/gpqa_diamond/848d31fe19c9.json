                    "text": "So I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I need to find the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The total time from the start is 200 minutes, but I need to focus on the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 have passed.\n\nFirst, I recall that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability that a nucleus decays in a certain time interval is given by \\( P(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.\n\nThe problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, for \\( t = 100 \\) minutes, \\( P(100) = 0.32 \\). I can use this to find \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\( e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \\).\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\( -\\lambda \\times 100 = \\ln(0.68) \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, \\( \\ln(0.68) \\) is approximately -0.3867.\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda = \\frac{0.3867}{100} \\approx 0.003867 \\) per minute.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nThis sounds like a conditional probability problem. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is:\n\n\\( P(\\text{decay in next 150} | \\text{no decay in first 50}) \\).\n\nFor exponential decay, the memoryless property states that the remaining time to decay is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. So, the probability of decaying in the next \\( t \\) minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as the probability of decaying in \\( t \\) minutes starting now.\n\nBut wait, actually, the memoryless property of the exponential distribution means that the probability of an event occurring in the next \\( t \\) units of time, given that it hasn't occurred yet, is the same as if you were starting from time zero.\n\nSo, in this case, since 50 minutes have already passed without decay, the remaining probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting now.\n\nSo, I need to calculate \\( P(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) \\), which is \\( 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 150} \\).\n\nPlugging in the value of \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\( P(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-0.003867 \\times 150} \\).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, \\( 0.003867 \\times 150 = 0.58005 \\).\n\nSo, \\( e^{-0.58005} \\approx 0.560 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( P(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.560 = 0.440 \\), or 44%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I found \\( \\lambda \\) using the initial probability:\n\n\\( e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68 \\).\n\nTaking ln on both sides: \\( -100\\lambda = \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.3867 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda = 0.003867 \\) per minute. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( e^{-150\\lambda} = e^{-150 \\times 0.003867} = e^{-0.58005} \\approx 0.560 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(\\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - 0.560 = 0.440 \\), or 44%.\n\nBut the problem says \"the next 150 minutes,\" which starts after 50 minutes have already passed without decay. So, the total time from the start would be 200 minutes, but since the memoryless property applies, it's the same as starting from time zero for the next 150 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nWait, but because of the memoryless property, that should be the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, and then divide by the probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nThe probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is \\( P(50 < t < 200) = P(t < 200) - P(t < 50) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(t < 100) = 0.32 \\), maybe I can find \\( P(t < 50) \\) and \\( P(t < 200) \\).\n\nFirst, I need to find \\( \\lambda \\) again.\n\nWait, I already have \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.003867 \\) per minute.\n\nSo, \\( P(t < 50) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 50} = 1 - e^{-0.003867 \\times 50} = 1 - e^{-0.19335} \\approx 1 - 0.823 = 0.177 \\), or 17.7%.\n\nSimilarly, \\( P(t < 200) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 200} = 1 - e^{-0.7734} \\approx 1 - 0.460 = 0.540 \\), or 54%.\n\nSo, \\( P(50 < t < 200) = P(t < 200) - P(t < 50) = 0.540 - 0.177 = 0.363 \\), or 36.3%.\n\nBut this is the probability without conditioning on the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.\n\nGiven that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is \\( P(50 < t < 200 | t > 50) = \\frac{P(50 < t < 200)}{P(t > 50)} \\).\n\nWe already have \\( P(50 < t < 200) = 0.363 \\).\n\nAnd \\( P(t > 50) = e^{-\\lambda \\times 50} = e^{-0.19335} \\approx 0.823 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(50 < t < 200 | t > 50) = \\frac{0.363}{0.823} \\approx 0.441 \\), or 44.1%.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation of 44%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 44%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 40%\n\nB. 48%\n\nC. 44%\n\nD. 52%\n\nSo, option C. 44% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44\\%} \\]"
