                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \\( m \\), maximum amplitude \\( A \\), and spring constant \\( k \\). We need to find the maximum speed \\( v_{\\text{max}} \\) of the mass, considering relativistic effects.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations for a harmonic oscillator in special relativity. Normally, in classical mechanics, the potential energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), and the total energy is conserved, which would be \\( \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant} \\). But here, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, the classical kinetic energy formula isn't accurate.\n\nIn special relativity, the kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\\[\nK = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2\n\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\n\\]\n\nSo, the total energy of the system should be the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\n\\]\n\nBut wait, in classical harmonic oscillators, the total energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude. Maybe this is still true here, but with a relativistic correction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the Lagrangian approach or the Hamiltonian, but that might be too complicated for this problem.\n\nLet me think differently. At the maximum amplitude \\( A \\), the speed is zero, so all energy is potential:\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\n\\]\n\nAt any other point \\( x \\), the potential energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), and the kinetic energy is \\( (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\n\\]\n\nAt the equilibrium position \\( x = 0 \\), the potential energy is zero, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2\n\n\\]\n\nAt this point, the speed is \\( v_{\\text{max}} \\), so \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( \\gamma \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} - 1 \\right) mc^2\n\n\\]\n\nThis looks a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange it to solve for \\( v_{\\text{max}} \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( \\beta = \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}}{c} \\), so \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\).\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} - 1 \\right) mc^2\n\n\\]\n\nThis seems complicated to solve directly. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic expression for momentum and energy conservation.\n\nIn special relativity, the total energy is:\n\n\\[\nE = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4}\n\n\\]\n\nAnd the momentum is related to velocity by:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v\n\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this directly to the harmonic oscillator.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the Lagrangian of the system. The Lagrangian \\( L \\) is:\n\n\\[\nL = T - V\n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( T \\) is the kinetic energy and \\( V \\) is the potential energy.\n\nIn special relativity, the kinetic energy is \\( (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nL = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 - \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct relativistic Lagrangian for this system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relativistic expression for energy in terms of momentum and potential energy.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for an approximation or a different perspective.\n\nLet me consider the classical expression for the maximum speed in a harmonic oscillator:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{max}} = \\omega A\n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\) is the angular frequency.\n\nBut this is the non-relativistic expression. In special relativity, things get more involved due to velocity-dependent mass increases.\n\nWait, in special relativity, mass is not considered to increase with velocity; it's better to think in terms of relativistic momentum and energy.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the relativistic expression for momentum:\n\n\\[\np = \\gamma m v\n\n\\]\n\nand the energy-momentum relation:\n\n\\[\nE^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\n\n\\]\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to apply this to the harmonic oscillator.\n\nMaybe I should look for an expression that relates the total energy to the velocity and position.\n\nGiven that at \\( x = 0 \\), the energy is purely kinetic, and at \\( x = A \\), it's purely potential, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{kinetic energy at } x = 0 = \\text{potential energy at } x = A\n\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(\\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\n\\]\n\nNow, solving for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}\n\n\\]\n\nBut \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\), where \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}\n\n\\]\n\nThis seems tricky to solve for \\( \\beta \\) directly. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\n\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}\n\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\beta^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} \\right)^2\n\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\beta^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\beta^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} \\right)^2\n\n\\]\n\nThis looks similar to one of the options. Let's see.\n\nOption C is:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{max}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}\n\n\\]\n\nWhich matches exactly with what I have for \\( \\beta \\):\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}\n\n\\]\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides by \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{max}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}\n\n\\]\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other way to interpret this or if there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the relativistic expression for the energy conservation in terms of the relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can express the total energy as:\n\n\\[\nE = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\n\n\\]\n\nAt equilibrium \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} + 0\n\n\\]\n\nAnd at maximum displacement \\( x = A \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\sqrt{0 + m^2 c^4} + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\n\\]\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\n\\]\n\nBut \\( p = \\gamma m v \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(\\gamma m v)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2\n\n\\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated to solve for \\( v \\). Maybe my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that my earlier derivation led me to option C, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, the maximum speed \\( v_{\\text{max}} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nv_{\\text{max}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}\n\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}"
