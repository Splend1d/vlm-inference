                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about an annihilation process: \\( p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-} \\). The antiproton is slowly moving, and the mass of particle A is given as \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A, and there are multiple-choice options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. A proton and an antiproton are annihilating into some particles, specifically two \\( A^{+} \\) and two \\( A^{-} \\). The antiproton is slowly moving, which probably means I can consider it as being at rest or moving at a negligible speed for the purposes of this problem.\n\nGiven that, I should start by considering the conservation of energy and momentum in this process.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( m_p \\) as the mass of the proton,\n\n- \\( m_{\\bar{p}} \\) as the mass of the antiproton,\n\n- \\( m_A \\) as the mass of particle A,\n\n- \\( v \\) as the velocity of particle A.\n\nI know that \\( m_p c^2 \\approx 938.272 \\) MeV and \\( m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.272 \\) MeV, since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton.\n\nThe total energy before the annihilation is the energy of the proton (which is mostly its rest energy since it's at rest) plus the energy of the antiproton (which is its rest energy plus any kinetic energy, but since it's slowly moving, its kinetic energy is negligible).\n\nSo, total initial energy \\( E_{\\text{initial}} \\approx m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.272 \\) MeV + 938.272 MeV = 1876.544 MeV.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into the rest energies and kinetic energies of the four A particles produced.\n\nEach A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c\u00b2, so the rest energy of one A particle is 300 MeV. Therefore, the total rest energy of four A particles is \\( 4 \\times 300 \\) MeV = 1200 MeV.\n\nThe total energy after annihilation is the sum of the rest energies and the kinetic energies of the A particles:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times m_A c^2 + 4 \\times \\text{kinetic energy of one A particle} \\]\n\nBut according to the conservation of energy, \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}} \\), so:\n\n\\[ 1876.544 \\) MeV = \\( 1200 \\) MeV + \\( 4 \\times \\text{kinetic energy per A particle} \\)\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy of the A particles is:\n\n\\[ 1876.544 \\) MeV - \\( 1200 \\) MeV = \\( 676.544 \\) MeV\n\nSince there are four A particles, the average kinetic energy per A particle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{kinetic energy per A particle} = \\frac{676.544 \\) MeV}{4} = \\( 169.136 \\) MeV\n\nNow, I need to relate the kinetic energy of one A particle to its velocity \\( v \\). The kinetic energy \\( T \\) of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\gamma m_A c^2 - m_A c^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ T = m_A c^2 \\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right) \\]\n\nGiven that \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV and \\( T = 169.136 \\) MeV, I can plug these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ 169.136 = 300 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1 \\right) \\]\n\nLet me solve for \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{169.136}{300} + 1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.56372 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1.56372} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\approx 0.639 \\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.408 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.592 \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx c \\sqrt{0.592} \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx c \\times 0.7696 \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx 0.77 c \\]\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77 times the speed of light, which corresponds to option C. 0.77c.\n\nBut wait, I should check if this is accurate enough, considering the approximations I made.\n\nLet me recalculate with more precision.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ 169.136 = 300 \\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma - 1 = \\frac{169.136}{300} = 0.56372 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma = 1.56372 \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 1.56372 \\)\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1.56372} \\approx 0.639 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.408 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\approx 0.592 \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx c \\sqrt{0.592} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator, \\( \\sqrt{0.592} \\approx 0.7694 \\)\n\n\\[ v \\approx 0.7694 c \\]\n\nWhich rounds to approximately 0.77 c.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.77c.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify if there are any other factors I might have missed.\n\nI considered conservation of energy, assuming that the antiproton is at rest or moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible. The proton is at rest, so no kinetic energy there.\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton, which is 1876.544 MeV.\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into the rest energies and kinetic energies of the four A particles.\n\nThe rest energies of the four A particles are 1200 MeV, so the remaining 676.544 MeV is the total kinetic energy of the A particles.\n\nDividing by four gives approximately 169.136 MeV per A particle.\n\nThen, using the relativistic kinetic energy formula, I solved for the velocity and got approximately 0.77c.\n\nThis seems consistent, so I'm confident that the answer is C. 0.77c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 0.77c} \\]"
