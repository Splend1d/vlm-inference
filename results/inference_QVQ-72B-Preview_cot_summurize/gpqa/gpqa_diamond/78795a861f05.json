                    "text": "So I have this problem about quantum states and their energy levels. There are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and they have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is, which of the given energy differences would allow these two energy levels to be clearly resolved?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for energy levels to be \"clearly resolved.\" In quantum mechanics, energy levels can be considered resolved if their energy difference is sufficiently large compared to their linewidths or uncertainties. So, probably, there's some relationship between the energy difference and the uncertainty in energy due to the finite lifetime of the states.\n\nI recall that there's an uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics that relates the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) to the uncertainty in time (\u0394t). The formula is:\n\n\u0394E \u00d7 \u0394t \u2265 h/4\u03c0\n\nWhere h is Planck's constant.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can use this uncertainty principle to find out the minimum energy difference required for resolution based on the lifetimes of the states.\n\nSo, the lifetimes given are \u03c41 = 10^-9 s and \u03c42 = 10^-8 s. These lifetimes correspond to the uncertainties in time for these energy states.\n\nWait a minute, actually, in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state is often related to the inverse of the uncertainty in its energy. Specifically, the uncertainty in energy \u0394E is approximately h/\u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime.\n\nBut in this problem, we have two different states with different lifetimes, and we want to resolve their energy levels based on their energy difference.\n\nI think the key here is to ensure that the energy difference between the two states is larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. That way, the two energy levels are distinct and not overlapping due to their uncertainties.\n\nSo, mathematically, for clear resolution:\n\n\u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2\n\nWhere \u0394E is the energy difference between E1 and E2, \u0394E1 is the uncertainty in E1, and \u0394E2 is the uncertainty in E2.\n\nGiven that \u0394E1 \u2248 h/\u03c41 and \u0394E2 \u2248 h/\u03c42, then:\n\n\u0394E > h/\u03c41 + h/\u03c42\n\nPlugging in the given lifetimes:\n\n\u0394E > h/(10^-9 s) + h/(10^-8 s)\n\nFirst, calculate h/(10^-9 s):\n\nh \u2248 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nSo, h/(10^-9 s) = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s / 10^-9 s = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nSimilarly, h/(10^-8 s) = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s / 10^-8 s = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-26 J\n\nTherefore, \u0394E > 6.626 \u00d7 10^-25 J + 6.626 \u00d7 10^-26 J = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-25 J + 0.6626 \u00d7 10^-25 J = 7.2886 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nNow, to compare this with the given options, which are in eV, I need to convert joules to electron volts.\n\nI know that 1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J\n\nSo, \u0394E > (7.2886 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) \u2248 7.2886 / 1.602 \u00d7 10^-25 / 10^-19 = 7.2886 / 1.602 \u00d7 10^-6 eV \u2248 4.55 eV\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check the calculation.\n\nFirst, calculate 7.2886 \u00d7 10^-25 J divided by 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV:\n\n(7.2886 \u00d7 10^-25) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19) = (7.2886 / 1.602) \u00d7 10^-6 eV \u2248 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 eV\n\nSo, \u0394E > 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 eV\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 10^-4 eV = 0.0001 eV\n\nB. 10^-8 eV = 0.00000001 eV\n\nC. 10^-11 eV = 0.00000000001 eV\n\nD. 10^-9 eV = 0.000000001 eV\n\nWait a second, 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 eV is much larger than any of these options. The largest option is 10^-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, but that's still smaller than 4.55 \u00d7 10^-6 eV.\n\nDoes this mean none of the options satisfy the condition for clear resolution? Or did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nLet me re-examine my steps.\n\nFirst, I used the uncertainty principle: \u0394E \u00d7 \u0394t \u2265 h/4\u03c0\n\nBut I think I might have misapplied it in this context.\n\nPerhaps the uncertainty in energy for a state with lifetime \u03c4 is \u0394E \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u03c4), based on the full width at half maximum of the energy distribution.\n\nAlso, for resolving two energy levels, the condition might be that the energy difference is greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.\n\nSo, \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2\n\nWhere \u0394E1 \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u03c41) and \u0394E2 \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u03c42)\n\nGiven that, let's recalculate with this refinement.\n\nFirst, calculate h/(2\u03c0\u03c41):\n\nh \u2248 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\n2\u03c0 \u2248 6.2832\n\nSo, h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 / 6.2832 \u2248 1.054 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nThen, for \u03c41 = 10^-9 s:\n\n\u0394E1 \u2248 1.054 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s / 10^-9 s = 1.054 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c42 = 10^-8 s:\n\n\u0394E2 \u2248 1.054 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s / 10^-8 s = 1.054 \u00d7 10^-26 J\n\nTherefore, \u0394E > 1.054 \u00d7 10^-25 J + 1.054 \u00d7 10^-26 J = 1.054 \u00d7 10^-25 J + 0.1054 \u00d7 10^-25 J = 1.1594 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nNow, convert to eV:\n\n1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J\n\nSo, \u0394E > (1.1594 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) \u2248 0.724 \u00d7 10^-6 eV = 7.24 \u00d7 10^-7 eV\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 10^-4 eV = 0.0001 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-4 eV\n\nB. 10^-8 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-8 eV\n\nC. 10^-11 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-11 eV\n\nD. 10^-9 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-9 eV\n\nComparing these to the required \u0394E > 7.24 \u00d7 10^-7 eV, we see that option A (1 \u00d7 10^-4 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-4 eV) is larger than 7.24 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, option A should be sufficient to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that other options could also satisfy the condition?\n\nLet's check option D: 10^-9 eV = 1 \u00d7 10^-9 eV\n\nIs 1 \u00d7 10^-9 eV > 7.24 \u00d7 10^-7 eV?\n\nNo, because 10^-9 eV is 0.000000001 eV, which is less than 7.24 \u00d7 10^-7 eV = 0.000000724 eV.\n\nSimilarly, options B and C are even smaller, so they won't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option A: 10^-4 eV.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this conclusion.\n\nPerhaps the condition for resolution isn't just \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, but maybe there's a factor of 2 or something similar involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the uncertainty in energy is different from what I assumed.\n\nLet me consider another approach. In spectroscopy, the resolution condition is often based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spectral lines.\n\nThe FWHM for an energy level is approximately \u0394E \u2248 h/(2\u03c0\u03c4), similar to what I used earlier.\n\nFor two lines to be resolved, their separation should be greater than the sum of their FWHMs.\n\nSo, \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2\n\nWhich aligns with my previous approach.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, the resolution condition might be \u0394E > 2\u0394E1 or something similar, depending on the specific resolution criterion used.\n\nBut assuming the simplest case, \u0394E > \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, and given the calculations above, option A satisfies this condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A: 10^-4 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
