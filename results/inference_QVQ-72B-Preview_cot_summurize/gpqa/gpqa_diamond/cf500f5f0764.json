                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are ~0.69, ~0.83, ~0.75, and ~0.57.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how equilibrium temperature is calculated for planets. I know that the equilibrium temperature depends on the incoming stellar radiation and the planet's ability to reflect or absorb that radiation. The formula for equilibrium temperature is usually given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( T \\) is the equilibrium temperature\n\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the planet to the star\n\nBut since all planets have the same albedo, I think there might be a factor involving albedo here. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, the equilibrium temperature accounting for albedo is:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the albedo. Since all planets have the same albedo, this factor should be the same for all of them. That means the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be independent of \\( L \\), \\( \\sigma \\), and \\( A \\), and will depend only on their distances from the star.\n\nSo, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nBut I need to find the distances in terms of their orbital periods. I recall that for circular orbits, according to Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D^3}{P^2} = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nSo, the distance is proportional to the square root of the period squared, meaning:\n\n\\[ D \\propto P^{2/3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of distances is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nGiven the period ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, let's assign P1 = 1, P2 = 2, P3 = 2.5, P4 = 3.5, P5 = 5.\n\nSo, the ratio of distances is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nNow, plugging this back into the temperature ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{4/3} \\right)^{-1/4} = \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{-1/3} \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this value.\n\nFirst, 2 divided by 3.5 is approximately 0.5714.\n\nThen, the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.\n\nSo, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. ~0.69\n\nB. ~0.83\n\nC. ~0.75\n\nD. ~0.57\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. ~0.83.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the equilibrium temperature formula seems correct, accounting for albedo.\n\nThen, the relationship between distance and period via Kepler's third law is accurate.\n\nThe calculation of the distance ratio:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. According to Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ D \\propto P^{2/3} \\]\n\nSo, the ratio of distances is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nWait, no. If \\( D \\propto P^{2/3} \\), then \\( D \\propto P^{2/3} \\), so the ratio should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I had \\( D \\propto P^{2/3} \\), which is correct, but then I squared it for some reason. Let me correct that.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of distances is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{3.5}{2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nThen, the ratio of temperatures is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSo, calculating \\( \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3} \\):\n\nFirst, 2 divided by 3.5 is approximately 0.5714.\n\nThen, the cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. ~0.83.\n\nWait, but let me verify the steps again to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting with the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nSince albedo is the same for both planets, the ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2^2}{D_4^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \\left( \\frac{P_4}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_4} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nPlugging in P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3.5} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nWhich is approximately 0.83, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. ~0.83.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\sim 0.83} \\]"
