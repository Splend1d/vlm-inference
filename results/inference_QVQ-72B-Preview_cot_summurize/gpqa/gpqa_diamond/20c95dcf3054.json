                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. It's about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space using optical ground-based telescopes. These clouds absorb light from background quasars at a specific wavelength called the Lyman alpha line, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Because of the expansion of the universe, the light from these distant objects is redshifted, meaning the wavelength is stretched as the universe expands.\n\nThe question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are 1.9, 2.4, 3, and 1.2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what redshift means in this context. Redshift (z) is defined as the change in wavelength divided by the rest wavelength. So, z = (\u03bb_observed - \u03bb_rest) / \u03bb_rest. In this case, the rest wavelength is the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms.\n\nOptical telescopes typically operate in the visible light range, which is roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers (nm). Since 1 nm is equal to 10 Angstroms, that means the visible range is from 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.\n\nThe absorption lines from these hydrogen clouds would be redshifted from the original 1216 Angstroms to a longer wavelength that depends on the redshift of the cloud. For the absorption lines to be detectable with optical telescopes, the redshifted wavelength should fall within the visible spectrum.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest redshift z such that:\n\n\u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z) \u2265 4000 \u00c5 (the lower limit of the visible spectrum)\n\nBut also, \u03bb_observed should be less than or equal to 7000 \u00c5, the upper limit of the visible spectrum.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the lower limit of z such that these objects can be detected optically. So, I need to find the smallest z where \u03bb_observed is still within the optical range.\n\nLet me plug in the values.\n\n\u03bb_rest = 1216 \u00c5\n\n\u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z)\n\nI need \u03bb_observed to be between 4000 \u00c5 and 7000 \u00c5.\n\nSo:\n\n4000 \u00c5 \u2264 \u03bb_observed \u2264 7000 \u00c5\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n4000 \u00c5 \u2264 1216 \u00c5 * (1 + z) \u2264 7000 \u00c5\n\nFirst, solve for the lower limit:\n\n4000 / 1216 = 1 + z\n\nCalculate that:\n\n4000 / 1216 \u2248 3.29\n\nSo, 1 + z \u2248 3.29\n\nTherefore, z \u2248 3.29 - 1 = 2.29\n\nNow, solve for the upper limit:\n\n7000 / 1216 \u2248 5.76\n\nSo, 1 + z \u2248 5.76\n\nTherefore, z \u2248 5.76 - 1 = 4.76\n\nBut the question is asking for the lower limit, so z \u2248 2.29.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest one is 2.4.\n\nWait, but 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than to 1.9 or 3. Maybe 2.4 is the answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf z = 2.4, then \u03bb_observed = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 1216 * 3.4 = 4134.4 \u00c5, which is within the optical range of 4000 to 7000 \u00c5.\n\nIf z = 1.9, then \u03bb_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 * 2.9 = 3526.4 \u00c5, which is below 4000 \u00c5, so it would not be detectable optically.\n\nIf z = 2.4, it's just above 4000 \u00c5, so it should be detectable.\n\nBut according to my calculation, z \u2248 2.29 is the exact lower limit, but since 2.4 is higher, it should still be detectable.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider atmospheric absorption or other factors that might affect detectability, but the problem specifies optical ground-based telescopes, so perhaps they're considering the practical limits of detection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard optical window or a specific filter range that telescopes use, and perhaps that's why z=2.4 is chosen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the Lyman alpha line at z=2.4 is at 4134 \u00c5, which is still within the optical range, but maybe there are other considerations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the original wavelength is 1216 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet range, and optical telescopes don't detect UV light directly, so perhaps there's a correction needed for that.\n\nWait, but the absorption would shift the UV line into the optical range, allowing it to be detected via its effect on the spectrum of the background quasar.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the telescope's sensitivity drops off towards the edges of the optical spectrum, so they might have a specific cutoff.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B. 2.4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
