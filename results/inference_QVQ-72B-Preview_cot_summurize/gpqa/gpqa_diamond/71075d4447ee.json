                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this problem about particle decay in a bubble chamber at CERN. The particle X\u2070 decays into Y\u207a and Z\u207b with a proper lifetime of \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"resolution\" means in this context. I think it refers to the ability of the detector to distinguish between two close points, like the decay point of the particle and the interaction point. So, if the particle decays too close to where it was created, it might be hard to see that it actually decayed. Therefore, the resolution should be better than the average decay length of the particle, or at least better than the length at which 30% of decays occur.\n\nI recall that in special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is different from its proper lifetime because of time dilation. The formula for the lifetime in the lab frame is \u03c4 = \u03c4\u2080 / \u03b3, where \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). But actually, for high-energy particles, it's often more convenient to use \u03b2 = v/c and \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2).\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to be careful here. The decay length, or the distance a particle travels before decaying, is given by l = \u03b2c \u03c4\u2080, where \u03b2 is the particle's velocity in units of c, and \u03c4\u2080 is the proper lifetime.\n\nBut first, I need to find out how fast the X\u2070 particle is moving. I know its mass is 3.41 GeV, and the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV. Assuming the particle is produced at rest, which I don't think is the case here, but since it's in a high-energy experiment, it's likely produced with some kinetic energy.\n\nWait, actually, in high-energy experiments, particles are often produced with energies much higher than their rest mass. So, the total energy E is given by E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, where m is the rest mass, and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nGiven that E = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, then \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917.\n\nSo, \u03b3 \u2248 7.917.\n\nNow, \u03b2 = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/(7.917)\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/62.69) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.0159) \u2248 sqrt(0.9841) \u2248 0.992.\n\nSo, \u03b2 \u2248 0.992.\n\nNow, the decay length l = \u03b2 c \u03c4\u2080.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nl = 0.992 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s) \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s) = 0.992 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m = 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m.\n\nSo, the average decay length is approximately 2.37 nanometers.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nI need to relate this to the resolution of the detector.\n\nI think I need to find the distance at which 30% of the particles decay.\n\nThis sounds like a statistics problem involving exponential decay.\n\nThe probability that a particle decays within a distance x is given by P(x) = 1 - e^{-x/l}, where l is the decay length.\n\nI need P(x) = 0.30, so:\n\n0.30 = 1 - e^{-x/l}\n\nThen, e^{-x/l} = 0.70\n\nTaking natural log on both sides:\n\n-x/l = ln(0.70)\n\nSo, x = -l ln(0.70) \u2248 l \u00d7 0.3567\n\nWait, ln(0.70) \u2248 -0.35667\n\nSo, x \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 l\n\nGiven that l \u2248 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m, then x \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 \u2248 0.84 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m \u2248 8.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 m.\n\nSo, the resolution needs to be better than about 8.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 m, which is 0.84 nanometers.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them are close to this value. Option B is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven that l = \u03b2 c \u03c4\u2080 = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 = 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m, which is 0.237 micrometers or 237 nanometers.\n\nThen, for 30% decays, x = -l ln(1 - 0.30) = -l ln(0.70) \u2248 -l \u00d7 (-0.35667) \u2248 0.35667 \u00d7 l.\n\nSo, x \u2248 0.35667 \u00d7 237 nm \u2248 84 nm.\n\nBut still, this is 84 nanometers, which is 8.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 m, and the options are in micrometers or millimeters.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution needed is not based on the decay length but on the uncertainty in the position measurement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be comparable to the average decay length to observe decays.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the distribution of decay lengths and find the resolution that allows observing a certain percentage of decays.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be better than the average decay length divided by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the uncertainty in the particle's position due to its velocity and lifetime.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe uncertainty in position \u0394x is related to the uncertainty in momentum \u0394p, and \u0394x \u0394p \u2265 h/4\u03c0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be better than the distance the particle travels in its lifetime, considering its velocity.\n\nSo, \u0394x \u2264 \u03b2 c \u03c4\u2080.\n\nBut I already calculated that, and it doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the gamma factor in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about the lab frame and the proper frame.\n\nIn the proper frame, the particle lives for \u03c4\u2080, and in the lab frame, it lives for \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, and travels a distance l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier.\n\nLet me recall: time dilation relates the proper time \u03c4\u2080 to the time measured in the lab frame \u03c4 by \u03c4 = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080, where \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - \u03b2\u00b2).\n\nThe distance traveled in the lab frame is l = v \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03c4 = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nSo, l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nGiven E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2, and m = 3.41 GeV, E = 27 GeV, so \u03b3 = E / m = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917.\n\nThen, \u03b2 = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/62.69) \u2248 0.992.\n\nThen, l = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s \u2248 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m = 0.237 \u03bcm = 237 nm.\n\nSo, the average decay length is 237 nanometers.\n\nNow, to observe at least 30% of the decays, I need to find the resolution such that 30% of decays occur at a distance greater than this resolution.\n\nAssuming exponential decay, the probability that a particle decays within a distance x is 1 - e^{-x/l}.\n\nI want this probability to be at least 30%, so:\n\n1 - e^{-x/l} \u2265 0.30\n\nThen, e^{-x/l} \u2264 0.70\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-x/l \u2264 ln(0.70)\n\nx \u2265 -l ln(0.70) \u2248 0.3567 l\n\nSo, the resolution should be better than x \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 237 nm \u2248 84 nm.\n\nBut 84 nm is 8.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 m, which is 8.4 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 mm, which is not matching any of the options directly.\n\nOption C is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 m, which is 2.08 nm, much smaller than 84 nm.\n\nOption B is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, which is 2.08 \u03bcm, which is larger than 84 nm.\n\nOption A is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m, which is 2.08 mm, much larger.\n\nOption D is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9 m, which is 20.8 cm, even larger.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the resolution should be better than the average decay length, not a fraction of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be comparable to the decay length itself.\n\nBut 237 nm is not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of \u03b3.\n\nWait, \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917.\n\nBut maybe E is the total energy, including rest mass energy.\n\nWait, in particle physics, E = sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074), but here it's given as 27 GeV, probably the kinetic energy.\n\nWait, perhaps E is the total energy, so E = sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u2074 + m\u00b2 c\u2074), and \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2).\n\nSo, \u03b3 = E / m c\u00b2 = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is the kinetic energy, so E_kin = E - m c\u00b2 = 27 GeV - 3.41 GeV = 23.59 GeV.\n\nThen, E = sqrt(p\u00b2 c\u00b2 + m\u00b2 c\u2074), and E_kin = E - m c\u00b2.\n\nSo, E = m c\u00b2 + E_kin = 3.41 + 23.59 = 27 GeV.\n\nWait, so E is the total energy, including rest mass.\n\nTherefore, \u03b3 = E / (m c\u00b2) = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.917.\n\nThen, \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/62.69) \u2248 0.992.\n\nThen, l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 7.917 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 \u2248 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 63.336 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076.\n\nWait, no, l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 7.917 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, \u03b2 c = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 = 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s.\n\nThen, \u03b3 = 7.917.\n\nSo, l = 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 7.917 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 = 2.976 \u00d7 7.917 = 23.67\n\nThen, 23.67 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 = 189.36 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 m = 1.8936 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 m.\n\nWait, earlier I thought l = 2.37 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m, but that was a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080.\n\n\u03b2 = 0.992, c = 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s, \u03b3 = 7.917, \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s.\n\nSo, l = \u03b2 c \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 0.992 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 7.917 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076.\n\nFirst, 0.992 \u00d7 3 = 2.976.\n\nThen, 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 = 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s.\n\nThen, 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 \u00d7 7.917 \u2248 2.367 \u00d7 10\u2079 m/s.\n\nThen, 2.367 \u00d7 10\u2079 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s = 1.8936 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m = 1.8936 \u03bcm.\n\nSo, l \u2248 1.89 \u03bcm.\n\nThen, for 30% decays, x \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 l \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 1.89 \u03bcm \u2248 0.67 \u03bcm.\n\nBut option B is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m = 2.08 \u03bcm, which is larger than 0.67 \u03bcm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the resolution should be better than the average decay length, so better than 1.89 \u03bcm.\n\nBut option B is 2.08 \u03bcm, which is worse than 1.89 \u03bcm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that to observe 30% decays, the resolution should be better than the distance corresponding to 30% probability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the resolution to be better than the average decay length divided by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the decay process.\n\nThe particle travels a certain distance before decaying, and the decay is probabilistic.\n\nThe probability density for decay is e^{-x/l} / l.\n\nThe cumulative probability of decaying within a distance x is 1 - e^{-x/l}.\n\nI want this probability to be at least 30%, so:\n\n1 - e^{-x/l} \u2265 0.30\n\nThen, e^{-x/l} \u2264 0.70\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-x/l \u2264 ln(0.70)\n\nx \u2265 -l ln(0.70) \u2248 0.3567 l\n\nSo, x \u2248 0.3567 \u00d7 1.89 \u03bcm \u2248 0.67 \u03bcm.\n\nBut option B is 2.08 \u03bcm, which is larger than 0.67 \u03bcm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution should be better than the standard deviation of the decay distribution.\n\nThe decay length distribution is exponential, with mean l.\n\nThe standard deviation of an exponential distribution is also l.\n\nSo, perhaps to observe 30% of decays, the resolution should be better than some multiple of l.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the uncertainty in the position measurement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be better than the distance corresponding to the decay probability of 30%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of the detector's spatial resolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the minimum resolvable distance to separate the decay vertex from the production vertex.\n\nIn that case, the resolution should be better than the typical decay length, or better than the distance at which 30% of decays occur.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution should be better than the distance traveled by the particle in its lifetime, considering its velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be better than the distance corresponding to the decay probability of 30%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the geometric mean or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula I should be using.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the Lorentz factor differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the particle is moving relativistically, and the resolution needs to be better than the contracted length.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the resolution should be better than the Compton wavelength of the particle.\n\nThe Compton wavelength is \u03bb = h / (m c), where h is Planck's constant.\n\nFor m = 3.41 GeV / c\u00b2, first convert to kg:\n\n1 GeV / c\u00b2 = 1.78266 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg\n\nSo, m = 3.41 \u00d7 1.78266 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg \u2248 6.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg\n\nThen, \u03bb = h / (m c) = (6.626 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2074 Js) / (6.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2077 kg \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s) \u2248 3.66 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 m = 0.366 pm.\n\nBut this is much smaller than any of the options.\n\nSo, probably not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I"
