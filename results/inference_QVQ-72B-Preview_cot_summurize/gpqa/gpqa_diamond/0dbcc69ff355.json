                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid in shape and radiates at a wavelength \\(\\lambda\\). The power radiated per unit solid angle depends on \\(\\lambda\\) and the angle \\(\\theta\\) from the z-axis. There's a maximum power \\(A\\), and I need to find the fraction of \\(A\\) that's radiated at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\), along with the possible form of the function \\(f\\) that describes this dependence.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the radiated power depends on \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\lambda\\). Since it's an oscillating charge distribution, it should behave similarly to an electric dipole radiator. For dipoles, the angular distribution of the radiated power is proportional to \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\). So, maybe the function \\(f\\) depends on \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\) and some power of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nLet me assume that the power per unit solid angle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = f(\\lambda, \\theta) = k \\lambda^{-n} \\sin^2\\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant, and \\(n\\) is the power of \\(\\lambda\\) that we need to determine.\n\nGiven that the maximum power is \\(A\\), I need to find the fraction of \\(A\\) at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\). To find the maximum power, I should find the maximum value of \\(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\) reaches its maximum value of 1 at \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\), the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n\n\\[\nA = k \\lambda^{-n} \\times 1 = k \\lambda^{-n}\n\\]\n\nNow, at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\), \\(\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\), so the power per unit solid angle at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}(\\theta = 30^\\circ) = k \\lambda^{-n} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{A}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo, the fraction of \\(A\\) at \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nNow, looking at the options, options C and D have \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) as the fraction. So, between A and D, I need to determine the correct power of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nBut wait, my assumption was that \\(f(\\lambda, \\theta) = k \\lambda^{-n} \\sin^2\\theta\\), and from that, the fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), which matches with options C and D. But I need to determine the correct power of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the actual formula for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole.\n\nThe power radiated by an electric dipole is proportional to \\(\\omega^4\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency. Since \\(\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light, then \\(\\omega \\propto \\lambda^{-1}\\), so power \\(\\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(n = 4\\).\n\nSo, the function \\(f\\) should be \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, option C has \\(\\lambda^{-3}\\), and option D has \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), but according to my earlier calculation, the fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), which matches both C and D. However, the power dependence should be \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), so option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power per unit solid angle has a different dependence on \\(\\lambda\\). Let me look up the exact formula for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole per unit solid angle.\n\nThe formula for the power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{k}{\\lambda^4} \\sin^2\\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant that includes \\(\\mu_0\\), etc.\n\nSo, indeed, \\(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\lambda^{-4}\\), which matches option D.\n\nBut wait, option A has \\(\\lambda^{-6}\\), option B has \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), option C has \\(\\lambda^{-3}\\), and option D has \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\). So, both options C and D have the correct fraction of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), but only option D has the correct power of \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: 1/4, \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a mistake here. Maybe the power per unit solid angle depends on \\(\\lambda^{-3}\\) in some cases.\n\nLet me recall the exact formula for the power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{12\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\omega^4}{c^3} \\right) p^2 \\sin^2\\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the dipole moment, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nSince \\(\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\), then \\(\\omega^4 \\propto \\lambda^{-4}\\), and \\(c^3\\) is constant, so overall, \\(\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct power dependence is \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nOption C has \\(\\lambda^{-3}\\), which doesn't match the derivation.\n\nOption B has \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\) but the fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption A has \\(\\lambda^{-6}\\), which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 1/4, \\(\\lambda^{-4}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{D}"
