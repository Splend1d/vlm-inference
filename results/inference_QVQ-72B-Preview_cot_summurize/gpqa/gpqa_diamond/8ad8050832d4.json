                    "text": "So I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all angles are 30 degrees. The options are A. 10.05 \u00c5, B. 9.54 \u00c5, C. 9.08 \u00c5, and D. 8.95 \u00c5.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a rhombohedral crystal structure is. A rhombohedral lattice is a type of crystal lattice where all edges are of equal length, and all angles between pairs of edges are equal, but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are 30 degrees, which is quite acute, so the unit cell is quite elongated along one direction.\n\nThe interplanar spacing, or d-spacing, for a given set of Miller indices (hkl) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^{2}} = \\frac{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2} - 2hk\\cos\\alpha - 2kl\\cos\\beta - 2lh\\cos\\gamma}{a^{2} (\\sin^{2}\\alpha + \\cos^{2}\\alpha)}\n\\]\n\nBut since this is a rhombohedral lattice, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees, there might be a simpler formula I can use.\n\nAlternatively, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing for (hkl) can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2} - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees, and for (111) planes, h = k = l = 1.\n\nFirst, I need to find the lattice parameter a. The problem gives the interatomic distance as 10 \u00c5, but in a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance isn't directly the lattice parameter a, especially with such acute angles.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to relate the interatomic distance to the lattice parameter a in this specific lattice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the geometry of the rhombohedral unit cell to find a relationship between the interatomic distance and the lattice parameter a.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me look up the formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nUpon checking, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is indeed:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2} - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nWhere a is the lattice constant, and \u03b1 is the angle between the lattice vectors.\n\nGiven that \u03b1 = 30 degrees, and for (111) planes, h = k = l = 1.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 1 - 2(1*1*\\cos30 + 1*1*\\cos30 + 1*1*\\cos30)}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the cosine of 30 degrees. I know that cos30 = \u221a3/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3 - 2(1*\\cos30 + 1*\\cos30 + 1*\\cos30)}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3 - 6*(\\sqrt{3}/2)}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n3 - 6*(\\sqrt{3}/2) = 3 - 3\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3 - 3\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to find d_{111} in terms of known quantities. The problem gives the interatomic distance as 10 \u00c5, but I need to relate this to the lattice parameter a.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance depends on the specific arrangement of atoms within the unit cell. However, without more information about the atomic positions, it's challenging to directly relate a to the interatomic distance.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the structure of the crystal more carefully. If it's a simple rhombohedral lattice with one atom per unit cell, the interatomic distance would be related to the lattice parameter a in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is equal to a, but given the angles are 30 degrees, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between nearest neighbor atoms can be different from a, especially with such acute angles.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider using the Bravais lattice parameters or look up the relationship between a and the interatomic distance in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the interatomic distance corresponds to the distance between two atoms along a specific direction, and use that to find a.\n\nBut without knowing the specific atomic positions, this seems tricky.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can use the volume of the unit cell and the number of atoms per unit cell to find a relationship between a and the interatomic distance.\n\nBut again, without knowing the number of atoms per unit cell or their arrangement, this might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the geometry of the rhombohedral unit cell and find a relationship between a and the interatomic distance based on the angles.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, all edges are equal, and all angles are equal, but with angles of 30 degrees, the unit cell is quite skewed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the reciprocal lattice and use the formula for d-spacings in reciprocal space.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nLet me try to think differently. If I consider two atoms connected by a vector in the lattice, the distance between them would be the interatomic distance.\n\nIn the rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two atoms can be calculated using the lattice vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the lattice vectors as a, b, and c, all of length a, and angles between them as \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees.\n\nThe position vectors of atoms can be expressed in terms of these lattice vectors.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specific atomic positions, this seems difficult.\n\nPerhaps I need to make an assumption about the atomic positions to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance corresponds to the length of the lattice vector a, which would mean a = 10 \u00c5.\n\nIf that's the case, then plugging a = 10 \u00c5 into the d_{111} formula would give:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 3\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3 - 3\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{3(1 - \\sqrt{3})}\n\\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I can rationalize or find a numerical approximation.\n\nFirst, calculate 1 - \u221a3:\n\n\u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so 1 - 1.732 = -0.732.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3(1 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{3(-0.732)} = \\sqrt{-2.196}\n\\]\n\nOh, that's a problem because the square root of a negative number is imaginary. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 1 - \u221a3. Let me double-check.\n\n\u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so 1 - 1.732 is indeed -0.732. So, 3(1 - \u221a3) = 3(-0.732) = -2.196, and the square root of that is imaginary.\n\nBut distances can't be imaginary, so there must be an error in my approach.\n\nMaybe the assumption that a = 10 \u00c5 is incorrect. Perhaps the interatomic distance corresponds to a different vector in the lattice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is not equal to a in this lattice with such acute angles.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe I can consider the geometry of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral lattice.\n\nIn a cubic lattice, the (111) plane has a d-spacing of a / sqrt(3), but this is not a cubic lattice; it's rhombohedral.\n\nGiven the angles are 30 degrees, the formula should adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the general formula for d-spacing in a triclinic lattice, but since it's rhombohedral, which is a special case of triclinic, the formula I used earlier should still apply.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral lattice in terms of the axial ratio or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the relationship between the lattice parameter a and the interatomic distance in terms of the atomic positions within the unit cell.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a standard formula that relates the interatomic distance to the lattice parameter in a rhombohedral lattice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance corresponds to the length of the lattice vector a, and proceed with that.\n\nAssuming a = 10 \u00c5, then:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 3\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nBut as I saw earlier, this leads to an imaginary denominator, which doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the interatomic distance is not equal to a in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance corresponds to the distance between two atoms in the lattice, which might be different from a.\n\nLet me try to calculate the distance between two atoms in the lattice.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two atoms can be calculated using the scalar product formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\sqrt{(\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1) \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1)}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}_2\\) are position vectors expressed in terms of the lattice vectors a, b, and c.\n\nBut without knowing the specific atomic positions, this approach is limited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in a rhombohedral lattice with angles of 30 degrees, the interatomic distance corresponds to a specific multiple of a.\n\nBut I'm stuck here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider numerical methods or look up standard formulas for rhombohedral lattices with such acute angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the volume of the unit cell and relate it to the interatomic distance.\n\nThe volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is:\n\n\\[\nV = a^{3} \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos^{2}\\alpha - \\cos^{3}\\alpha}\n\\]\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30 degrees, cos30 = \u221a3/2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nV = a^{3} \\sqrt{1 + 2*(\\sqrt{3}/2)^{2} - (\\sqrt{3}/2)^{3}} = a^{3} \\sqrt{1 + 2*(3/4) - (3\\sqrt{3}/8)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} = \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\n\\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated and probably not helpful for finding d_{111}.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me try to think about the geometry of the (111) plane in the rhombohedral lattice.\n\nIn a cubic lattice, the (111) plane has a d-spacing of a / sqrt(3), but in a rhombohedral lattice with angles of 30 degrees, it's different.\n\nMaybe I can consider the reciprocal lattice and use the formula for d-spacings in reciprocal space.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector for (hkl) is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{g}_{hkl} = h\\mathbf{b}_1 + k\\mathbf{b}_2 + l\\mathbf{b}_3\n\\]\n\nAnd the interplanar spacing is:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}|}\n\\]\n\nBut calculating the reciprocal lattice vectors for a rhombohedral lattice seems too involved for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using the formula for d-spacing in terms of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can plug in the values and compute numerically.\n\nGiven a = 10 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 30 degrees, h = k = l = 1.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 1 - 2(1*1*\\cos30 + 1*1*\\cos30 + 1*1*\\cos30)}}\n\\]\n\nCompute the cosine terms:\n\n\\[\n\\cos30 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 2*(1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660 + 1*1*0.8660)}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 2*(3*0.8660)}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n3 - 2*(2.598) = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196\n\\]\n\nAgain, this results in a negative value under the square root, which can't be right.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about a being equal to the interatomic distance is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the interatomic distance corresponds to a different vector in the lattice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula I'm using isn't applicable in this case, or perhaps I need to adjust it for the specific angles.\n\nLet me try to look up the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral lattice again.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is:\n\n\\[\nd_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2} - 2(hk + kl + lh)\\cos\\alpha}}\n\\]\n\nYes, that's what I used earlier.\n\nGiven that, and plugging in the values, I get a negative value under the square root, which indicates an error in my approach.\n\nPerhaps the interatomic distance isn't equal to a in this lattice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angles are not all 30 degrees; perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem: \"a rhombohedral crystal, with the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and the angles \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=30\u00b0.\"\n\nThis seems clear: a rhombohedral crystal with all angles equal to 30 degrees and interatomic distance of 10 \u00c5.\n\nBut perhaps \"interatomic distance\" refers to the distance between nearest neighbors, which isn't necessarily equal to a in this lattice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interatomic distance corresponds to the edge length a, but as we've seen, that leads to an imaginary d-spacing.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the interatomic distance is related to a in a different way.\n\nLet me consider that in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two atoms can be expressed as a * sqrt(2 - 2*cos\u03b1), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the geometry of the unit cell and find a relationship between a and the interatomic distance.\n\nGiven the angles are 30 degrees, the unit cell is quite elongated, so the interatomic distance might correspond to a different vector.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the interatomic distance is equal to a * sqrt(2 - 2*cos30), but I need to verify that.\n\nWait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between two atoms along a body diagonal can be calculated using the formula for vector lengths in such a lattice.\n\nBut without more information, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the interatomic distance corresponds to the length of the lattice vector a, and proceed with that.\n\nAssuming a = 10 \u00c5, then:\n\n\\[\nd_{111} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3 - 3\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nBut as before, this leads to a negative value under the square root, which is impossible for a distance.\n\nThis suggests that a cannot be equal to 10 \u00c5 in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance corresponds to a different vector, say, the distance between two atoms along a face diagonal or something similar.\n\nLet me try to calculate the distance between two atoms in the lattice.\n\nSuppose I have two atoms at positions r1 and r2, expressed in terms of the lattice vectors a, b, and c.\n\nGiven that a = b = c = a, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees.\n\nThe distance between r1 and r2 is:\n\n\\[\n|\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1| = \\sqrt{(\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1) \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1)}\n\\]\n\nBut without knowing the specific positions of the atoms, I can't proceed further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the interatomic distance corresponds to the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral lattice can be expressed in terms of a and the angle \u03b1.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specific arrangement, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this and the lack of progress, perhaps I need to consider that there might be an error in the problem statement or that additional information is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to accept that with the given information, it's not possible to determine the interplanar spacing without making assumptions about the atomic positions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to assume that a = 10 \u00c5 and proceed with the calculation,"
