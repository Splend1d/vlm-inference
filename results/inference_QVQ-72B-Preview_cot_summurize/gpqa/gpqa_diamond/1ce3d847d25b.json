                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a solution containing 0.02 M calcium-EDTA complex, and we're assuming ideal pH and temperature of 25\u00b0C. The equilibrium constant for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as K = 5 \u00d7 10^10. We need to find the concentration of calcium ions in the solution.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the chemical equilibrium here. The reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{EDTA}^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}\n\\]\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression for this reaction is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}\n\\]\n\nGiven that K = 5 \u00d7 10^10, it suggests that the complexation reaction strongly favors the formation of the complex.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we're dealing with a stoichiometric amount of Ca-EDTA complex already present in the solution. The term \"stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex\" likely means that the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio of Ca to EDTA, and we're adding this pre-formed complex to the solution.\n\nLet's assume that the solution contains only the Ca-EDTA complex initially, and we're interested in the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in equilibrium with the complex.\n\nGiven that the complex is strong (with a large K), most of the Ca and EDTA will be bound in the complex, and only a small amount of free Ca^2+ will be present.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- [Ca^2+] = concentration of free calcium ions\n\n- [EDTA^{4-}] = concentration of free EDTA ions\n\n- [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] = concentration of the complex\n\nGiven that the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that all of it is present as Ca-EDTA^{2-}, then [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 M.\n\nHowever, in reality, there will be some dissociation of the complex into Ca^2+ and EDTA^{4-}, leading to small amounts of free ions.\n\nLet's assume that the dissociation is negligible, meaning that [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] remains approximately 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^{4-}] are very small compared to 0.02 M.\n\nUsing this approximation, we can write the equilibrium constant expression as:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2}\n\\]\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Actually, since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^{4-}, for each molecule of Ca-EDTA that dissociates, one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^{4-} are produced.\n\nLet\u2019s set up an ICE table to keep track of the concentrations:\n\nInitial concentrations:\n\n- [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 M\n\n- [Ca^{2+}] = 0 M\n\n- [EDTA^{4-}] = 0 M\n\nChange in concentrations:\n\n- [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] decreases by x M\n\n- [Ca^{2+}] increases by x M\n\n- [EDTA^{4-}] increases by x M\n\nEquilibrium concentrations:\n\n- [Ca-EDTA^{2-}] = 0.02 - x M\n\n- [Ca^{2+}] = x M\n\n- [EDTA^{4-}] = x M\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant expression is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}\n\\]\n\nGiven that K is very large (5 \u00d7 10^10), the denominator must be very small, meaning that x is much smaller compared to 0.02 M. Therefore, we can approximate 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.02}{x^2} = 5 \\times 10^{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n\\[\n0.02 = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\times x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.325 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the concentration of free Ca^{2+} ions is approximately 6.3 \u00d7 10^{-7} M.\n\nLet me check if this is a valid approximation. We assumed that x is much smaller than 0.02 M. Indeed, 6.3 \u00d7 10^{-7} M is much smaller than 0.02 M, so the approximation holds.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. 6.3x10^{-7} M.\n\nJust to make sure, let's plug the value back into the equilibrium constant expression to verify:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{(6.3 \\times 10^{-7})^2} = \\frac{0.02}{3.969 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 5.03 \\times 10^{10}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given K value of 5 \u00d7 10^10, confirming that our calculation is accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}} \\]"
