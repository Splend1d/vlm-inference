                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum has six distinct signals: two for aromatic hydrogen (aromatic-H), two for vinyl hydrogen (vinyl-H) with one doublet and one doublet of quartets, and two for methyl groups (\u2013CH3). There are no signals for methylene groups (\u2013CH2\u2013). The possible formulas to choose from are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring means. A 6-membered aromatic ring is likely benzene, which has the formula C6H6. Di-substitution means that there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring.\n\nGiven that the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks for an ester group, that's important. An ester has the general structure R-CO-O-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups or aryl groups. In this case, since we're dealing with a substituted benzene ring, at least one of the R groups is likely an aryl group.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six distinct signals:\n\n1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogen (aromatic-H).\n\n2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogen (vinyl-H), with one being a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets.\n\n3. Two signals corresponding to methyl groups (\u2013CH3).\n\n4. No signals for methylene groups (\u2013CH2\u2013).\n\nThis information suggests that the molecule has two aromatic hydrogens, two vinyl hydrogens, and two methyl groups, with no methylene groups present.\n\nLet me try to piece this together. Starting with benzene, which has six hydrogen atoms. If it's di-substituted, two of those hydrogens are replaced by substituents.\n\nGiven the presence of vinyl hydrogens, which are typically found in alkene groups (C=C), and methyl groups, it seems like one of the substituents might be an alkene chain or something similar.\n\nAlso, considering the ester group indicated by the FTIR, one of the substituents is likely an ester group attached to the benzene ring.\n\nLet me consider the possible structures that fit this description.\n\nOption A: C12H12O2\n\nOption B: C11H12O2\n\nOption C: C12H14O2\n\nOption D: C11H14O2\n\nI need to see which of these formulas aligns with the described molecular structure.\n\nLet me think about the structure step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a benzene ring, C6H6. Two hydrogen atoms are substituted by two groups.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the two substituents as X and Y.\n\nSo, the molecule is C6H4XY.\n\nGiven that there are two aromatic hydrogens left, which makes sense because two hydrogens are substituted.\n\nNow, from the NMR, there are two vinyl hydrogens, which are typically found in alkene groups, like -CH=CH2 or something similar.\n\nAlso, there are two methyl groups.\n\nGiven that, let's see what X and Y could be.\n\nOption 1: One substituent is an ester group, and the other is some alkene-derived group with methyl groups.\n\nGiven that there are two methyl signals, they could be part of the substituents.\n\nLet me consider if one of the substituents is a methyl group directly attached to the benzene ring. But if that were the case, there would be three methyl hydrogens, but the NMR shows two methyl groups, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the methyl groups could be part of larger substituents.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of an ester group attached to the benzene ring.\n\nFor example, if one substituent is -COO-CH3 (methoxy carbonyl), that would be an ester group.\n\nBut that would only account for one methyl group, whereas there are two methyl groups present.\n\nAlternatively, if the ester group is part of a larger substituent that includes another methyl group.\n\nLet me try to construct a molecule that fits the description.\n\nSuppose one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2, which is an acrylate ester.\n\nThis would have a vinyl hydrogen and a methyl group.\n\nThe other substituent could be another group that includes a methyl group.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the total number of hydrogens and carbons matches one of the given formulas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both substituents are ester groups, but that seems unlikely given the presence of vinyl hydrogens.\n\nWait, maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.\n\nLet me try to draw a structure.\n\nOption A: C12H12O2\n\nOption B: C11H12O2\n\nOption C: C12H14O2\n\nOption D: C11H14O2\n\nLet me consider the total number of hydrogens and carbons.\n\nStarting with benzene: C6H6.\n\nIf two hydrogens are substituted by two groups, X and Y, then the total carbons and hydrogens depend on what X and Y are.\n\nGiven that there are two vinyl hydrogens, which are typically part of a double bond, like -CH=CH2 or -CH=CH-.\n\nAlso, there are two methyl groups, which are -CH3.\n\nLet me consider that one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate), which would contribute:\n\n- C: 3 (C=O, C=CH2, C=CH2)\n\n- H: 3 (O-H, C=CH2, C=CH2)\n\n- O: 2\n\nAnd the other substituent could be -CH3, but that would only add one methyl group, and we have two methyl groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other substituent is -O-CH=CH2, but that doesn't fit the ester group indication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other substituent is -COO-CH3 (methyl ester), which would add:\n\n- C: 2 (C=O, C=CH3)\n\n- H: 3 (O-H, C=CH3)\n\n- O: 2\n\nSo, total carbons would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + 3 (acrylate) + 2 (methyl ester) = C11\n\nHydrogens:\n\nH6 (benzene) + 3 (acrylate) + 3 (methyl ester) - 2 (since two H's were substituted) = 10\n\nOxygens:\n\n0 (benzene) + 2 (acrylate) + 2 (methyl ester) = 4\n\nBut the options only have O2, so this can't be right.\n\nWait, I must be missing something.\n\nLet me recast this.\n\nThe molecule is C6H4XY, where X and Y are substituents.\n\nGiven that one of them is an ester group, and the other has vinyl and methyl groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both substituents include ester groups, but that seems unlikely given the NMR signals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate), and the other is -CH=CH2 (vinyl group), but that doesn't account for both methyl groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are -COO-CH=CH2 and -CH2-CH3 (ethyl group), but that would introduce a methylene group, which is not present according to the NMR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 and the other is -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl group), but that would introduce a methine group, which isn't accounted for in the NMR.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the possible formulas and see which one can accommodate the described structure.\n\nOption A: C12H12O2\n\nOption B: C11H12O2\n\nOption C: C12H14O2\n\nOption D: C11H14O2\n\nGiven that the molecule is a di-substituted benzene, with two substituents X and Y.\n\nLet me consider that one substituent is an ester group.\n\nAn ester group would typically involve a carbonyl group and an alkoxide group.\n\nGiven that, let's assume one substituent is -COO-R, where R is some alkyl or aryl group.\n\nGiven the presence of vinyl hydrogens, R likely contains a vinyl group.\n\nFor example, R could be -CH=CH2 (vinyl), making the substituent -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate).\n\nNow, the other substituent needs to account for the remaining methyl groups and possibly other groups.\n\nGiven that there are two methyl groups, perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group, but that would only add one methyl group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an ethyl group, but that would introduce methylene protons, which aren't present in the NMR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH(CH3)2, but again, that would introduce methine protons.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to calculate the total number of carbons and hydrogens based on possible substituents.\n\nSuppose one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate):\n\nC: 3\n\nH: 3\n\nO: 2\n\nThe other substituent needs to account for the remaining carbons and hydrogens.\n\nLooking at option B: C11H12O2\n\nIf the benzene ring is C6H4, and one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (C3H3O2), then the total so far is:\n\nC: 6 + 3 = 9\n\nH: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nO: 0 + 2 = 2\n\nBut option B is C11H12O2, so the other substituent would need to be C2H5 (ethyl group), which is C2H5.\n\nBut an ethyl group would introduce methylene protons, which aren't present in the NMR.\n\nTherefore, this can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other substituent is -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl group), which is C3H7.\n\nBut again, that would introduce methine protons, which aren't present.\n\nThis doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first substituent is -COO-CH=CH-CH3 (crotonate), which is C4H5O2.\n\nThen, the total carbons would be 6 + 4 = 10, and hydrogens 4 + 5 = 9, plus the other substituent.\n\nFor option B: C11H12O2, the other substituent would need to be C1H3O0, which is impossible.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate), and the other is -CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl group), but that would introduce methylene protons again.\n\nNot fitting the NMR.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both substituents are ester groups.\n\nSuppose both are -COO-CH=CH2, but that would give two acrylate groups, totaling C6H4 + 2*(C3H3O2) = C12H10O4, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 and the other is -O-CH=CH2 (vinyl ether), but that doesn't account for both methyl groups.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nGiven that there are two methyl groups, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a methyl group directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the methyl group would be directly attached to the benzene ring, which is common in toluene derivatives.\n\nHowever, in that case, there would be three methyl hydrogens, but the NMR shows two methyl groups, which suggests two separate methyl groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are part of larger substituents.\n\nWait, maybe one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate), and the other is -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl group), but again, that introduces methine protons.\n\nNot fitting the NMR.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 and the other is -CH(CH3)CH3 (isobutyl group), but that still introduces methine protons.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps the ester group is part of a larger ring or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester group is attached to a side chain that includes both vinyl and methyl groups.\n\nFor example, if the substituent is -COO-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenoate), but that would introduce methylene protons, which aren't present.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH2 (2-methylpropenoate), which would have a methyl group and a vinyl group.\n\nThis would contribute C4H5O2.\n\nThen, the total carbons would be 6 + 4 = 10, and hydrogens 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nFor option B: C11H12O2, the other substituent would need to be C1H3O0, which is impossible.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH-CH3 (2-methyl-2-butenoate), but that would have more carbons.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me try to look at the options again.\n\nOption A: C12H12O2\n\nOption B: C11H12O2\n\nOption C: C12H14O2\n\nOption D: C11H14O2\n\nGiven that the molecule is di-substituted benzene, C6H4XY.\n\nIf X and Y together account for the remaining carbons and hydrogens, plus the ester group.\n\nLooking at option A: C12H12O2\n\nTotal carbons: 12\n\nTotal hydrogens: 12\n\nTotal oxygens: 2\n\nSubtracting the benzene ring: C6H4\n\nSo, X + Y = C6H8O2\n\nGiven that one of the substituents is an ester group, which is -COO-.\n\nLet\u2019s assume one substituent is -COO-CH=CH2 (acrylate): C3H3O2\n\nThen, the other substituent would need to be C3H5, which could be a propyl group, but again, that introduces methylene protons.\n\nNot fitting the NMR.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other substituent is -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl group), but that introduces methine protons.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are -COO-CH=CH2 and -CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl group), but again, introduces methylene protons.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both substituents are ester groups.\n\nSuppose both are -COO-CH=CH2: total C6H6O4, but that doesn't match C6H8O2.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one is -COO-CH=CH2 and the other is -COO-CH3 (methyl ester): total C4H4O4, which doesn't match C6H8O2.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one is -COO-CH=CH2 and the other is -CH2-CH=CH2: total C5H8O2, which matches C6H4 + C5H8O2 = C11H12O2, but again, introduces methylene protons.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps the ester group is part of a larger ring or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester group is attached to a side chain that includes both vinyl and methyl groups without introducing methylene protons.\n\nFor example, if the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH2 (2-methylpropenoate), which would have a methyl group and a vinyl group, without introducing methylene protons.\n\nThis would contribute C4H5O2.\n\nThen, the total carbons would be 6 + 4 = 10, and hydrogens 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nFor option A: C12H12O2, the other substituent would need to be C2H3O0, which is impossible.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH-CH3 (2-methyl-2-butenoate), but that would have more carbons.\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nLet me try to consider that perhaps the ester group is part of a cyclic structure or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester group is attached to a side chain that branches in a way that doesn't introduce methylene protons.\n\nFor example, if the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)-CH=CH2 (3-methylbutenoate), which would have a methyl group and a vinyl group, without introducing methylene protons.\n\nThis would contribute C5H7O2.\n\nThen, the total carbons would be 6 + 5 = 11, and hydrogens 4 + 7 = 11.\n\nFor option A: C12H12O2, the other substituent would need to be C1H1O0, which is impossible.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the ester group is part of a larger substituent that includes both vinyl and methyl groups without introducing methylene protons.\n\nFor example, if the substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH2 (2-methylpropenoate), which has a methyl group and a vinyl group, without methylene protons.\n\nThis would contribute C4H5O2.\n\nThen, if both substituents are the same, total would be C8H10O4, which doesn't match any option.\n\nNot fitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is -COO-CH(CH3)=CH2 and the other is -CH3, but that would introduce three methyl protons, not two.\n\nNot"
