                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism where molecules are mirror images of each other and not superimposable. These are also known as enantiomers. For a compound to show optical isomerism, it must have at least one chiral center, which is usually a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet me recall what a chiral center is. It's a tetrahedral carbon atom that is bonded to four different substituents. If such a carbon atom is present in a molecule, it can exist in two non-superimposable forms, which are mirror images of each other. These forms are called enantiomers and they exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nSo, to determine which of these compounds show optical isomerism, I need to identify if they have any chiral centers.\n\nLet's look at each compound one by one.\n\n1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a biphenyl derivative with substituents. Biphenyl is two phenyl rings connected directly to each other. Now, 6,6'-dinitro means there are nitro groups on the 6 positions of both rings, and 2,2'-dicarboxylate suggests there are carboxylate groups on the 2 positions of both rings. Then, it's dimethyl ester, so each carboxylate is esterified with a methyl group.\n\nI need to visualize or draw the structure to see if there are any chiral centers.\n\nFirst, biphenyl can have different conformations depending on the rotation around the bond connecting the two rings. The substituents can be in different spatial arrangements.\n\nIn this case, with substituents at the 2 and 6 positions on both rings, and considering the symmetry, I need to check if any of the carbon atoms in the molecule are bonded to four different groups.\n\nLooking at the 2-position of the biphenyl, which has a carboxylate group, and the 6-position has a nitro group. But since it's a biphenyl, the two rings are connected, and substituents are on corresponding positions.\n\nI think this compound might have a chiral axis due to the biphenyl structure, especially if the two rings are twisted relative to each other.\n\nWait, but optical isomerism typically refers to molecules with chiral centers, not axial chirality. Maybe I need to consider both.\n\nBut for now, I'll note that this compound might have axial chirality, which can lead to optical isomers.\n\n2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThis sounds like a derivative of lactic acid. Let's break it down.\n\n2-hydroxypropanoate is lactic acid, and methyl ester of that would be methyl lactate.\n\nLactic acid is known to have a chiral center at the 2-position.\n\nThe structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH, and the methyl ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n\nThe carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is connected to four different groups: methyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl oxygen, and the rest of the chain.\n\nTherefore, it's a chiral center, and thus, this compound can exist as enantiomers, showing optical isomerism.\n\n3. Benzophenone.\n\nThis is diphenyl ketone, where two phenyl rings are connected to a carbonyl group.\n\nStructure: Ph-C(O)-Ph, where Ph is phenyl group.\n\nLooking at this structure, the carbon atom in the carbonyl group is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups.\n\nSo, it's sp2 hybridized and bonded to two phenyl groups and one oxygen.\n\nSince both substituents are the same (two phenyl groups), this carbon is not a chiral center.\n\nTherefore, benzophenone does not have any chiral centers and hence does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. Dimethyl fumarate.\n\nFumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate, which is the cis-trans isomer of maleate.\n\nThe structure of fumarate is H2C=CH-COOH connected to another carboxylic acid group.\n\nWait, but dimethyl ester would be both carboxylic acid groups esterified with methyl alcohol.\n\nSo, structure: CH3-OOC-CH=CH-COO-CH3.\n\nNow, looking at this structure, are there any chiral centers?\n\nThe carbon atoms in the chain are:\n\n- Double-bonded carbon: sp2, bonded to one hydrogen, one methyl ester, and one vinyl group.\n\n- The other double-bonded carbon: sp2, bonded to one hydrogen, one methyl ester, and one vinyl group.\n\nBut since both double-bonded carbons are sp2 and have a plane of symmetry due to the double bond, they are not chiral centers.\n\nSo, no chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate.\n\nTherefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Compound 1: possibly has axial chirality, which can lead to optical isomers.\n\n- Compound 2: definitely has a chiral center, exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n- Compound 3: no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.\n\n- Compound 4: no chiral centers, no optical isomerism.\n\nBut the question mentions \"optical isomerism,\" which typically refers to molecules with chiral centers, not axial chirality.\n\nHowever, in some cases, axial chirality can lead to optical isomers, especially in rigid molecules like biphenyls.\n\nBut to be precise, in the context of this question, perhaps they are considering only molecules with tetrahedral chiral centers.\n\nGiven that, compound 2 definitely shows optical isomerism due to the chiral center, while compounds 3 and 4 do not have chiral centers.\n\nCompound 1 might have axial chirality, but it's more complex.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"optical isomerism,\" and considering that compound 2 is the most straightforward case with a chiral center, and compounds 3 and 4 lack chiral centers, the answer might be B. 2 and 3.\n\nWait, but compound 3 does not have optical isomerism, so that can't be.\n\nOption C is 1 and 2, which might be possible if compound 1 has axial chirality leading to optical isomers.\n\nOption D is 1, 2, and 4, but compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center.\n\nOption A is 3 and 4, which also don't have chiral centers.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is C. 1 and 2.\n\nBut I need to confirm if compound 1 indeed has axial chirality leading to optical isomers.\n\nLet me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.\n\nIn biphenyl derivatives, if the two rings are twisted relative to each other, and the substituents are appropriately placed, it's possible to have axial chirality, leading to optical isomers.\n\nGiven that it's substituted at the 2 and 6 positions on both rings, and considering the symmetry, it might indeed have axial chirality.\n\nTherefore, both compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nCompounds 3 and 4 do not have chiral centers and hence do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. 1 and 2.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of compound 4 having optical isomerism through some other means, like cis-trans isomerism.\n\nDimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, and in trans configurations, if the double bond is part of a ring or constrained in some way, it might have chirality.\n\nBut in this case, it's a simple acyclic trans double bond, which does not introduce chirality because the plane of the double bond serves as a plane of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, no, compound 4 does not have optical isomerism.\n\nSimilarly, compound 3, benzophenone, lacks a chiral center and does not have optical isomerism.\n\nHence, the answer should be C. 1 and 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
