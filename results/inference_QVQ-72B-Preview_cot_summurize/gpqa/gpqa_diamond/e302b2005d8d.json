                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). It says that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96 times the speed of light, which is 0.96c. And I need to find the energy of this nucleus at that speed. The options are a few different values in GeV, and the precision should be to 1e-4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what nucleus X is. It's defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Li stands for Lithium, which has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. So, the nucleus is Lithium, which typically has different isotopes based on the number of neutrons. Since it has 3 neutrons, that means the total number of nucleons is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So, it's likely Lithium-6.\n\nBut wait, standard Lithium is Lithium-7, which has 4 neutrons, but here it's specified as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so it's Lithium-6. I need to make sure I'm using the correct mass for this isotope.\n\nNow, the energy of the nucleus moving at a speed v = 0.96c can be found using the relativistic energy formula. The total energy E is given by:\n\n\\[ E = \\gamma m c^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, which is \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\)\n\n- m is the rest mass of the nucleus\n\n- c is the speed of light\n\nSo, first I need to calculate \\(\\gamma\\) for v = 0.96c.\n\nLet's compute \\(\\gamma\\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} = 3.5714 \\]\n\nOkay, so \\(\\gamma\\) is approximately 3.5714.\n\nNext, I need the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus. I know that the atomic mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.01512 amu (atomic mass units). To convert this to kilograms, I use:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ amu} = 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512 \\text{ amu} \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nWait, let me calculate that properly:\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nActually, calculating it:\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 10.000 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nOkay, that seems right.\n\nNow, plugging into the energy formula:\n\n\\[ E = \\gamma m c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\times (2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})^2 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( c^2 \\):\n\n\\[ c^2 = (2.99792458 \\times 10^8)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ c^2 \\approx 8.98755 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\nNow,\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\nWait, no:\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let's see:\n\n\\[ E = \\gamma m c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nBut the problem asks for the energy in GeV, not joules. So, I need to convert joules to GeV.\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ E (\\text{GeV}) = \\frac{E (\\text{J})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\nAlternatively, I can directly compute E in GeV by using the mass in units compatible with GeV.\n\nBut to keep it consistent, maybe it's easier to compute E in joules and then convert to GeV.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nFirst, compute E in joules:\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 32.13 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nWait, no:\n\n\\[ 3.5714 \\times 8.98755 = 32.13 \\]\n\nBut \\( 10^{-26} \\times 10^{16} = 10^{-10} \\), so:\n\n\\[ E \\approx 32.13 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nNow, convert to GeV:\n\n\\[ E (\\text{GeV}) = \\frac{32.13 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx \\frac{32.13}{1.602176634} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 20.05 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nHmm, but none of the options are exactly 20.05 GeV. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the mass of Lithium-6.\n\nThe atomic mass of Lithium-6 is approximately 6.01512 amu. But to be precise, I should use the exact nuclear mass.\n\nLooking up the exact mass of Lithium-6:\n\n\\[ m(\\text{^6Li}) = 6.01512277(24) \\text{ u} \\]\n\nWhere u is the atomic mass unit.\n\nConvert to kg:\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512277 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nYes, that's what I had before.\n\nNow, perhaps I need to consider the rest mass energy of the nucleus in GeV.\n\nFirst, find the rest mass energy in GeV.\n\n\\[ E_0 = m c^2 \\]\n\n\\[ E_0 = 6.01512277 \\text{ u} \\times 931.494028(2) \\text{ MeV/u} \\]\n\n\\[ E_0 \\approx 5.602 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nWait, no:\n\nActually, 1 u = 931.494028(2) MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ E_0 = 6.01512277 \\times 931.494028 \\text{ MeV} \\]\n\n\\[ E_0 \\approx 5.602 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nBut this is the rest mass energy. The total energy at v = 0.96c is \\(\\gamma E_0\\).\n\nGiven that \\(\\gamma = 3.5714\\),\n\n\\[ E = 3.5714 \\times 5.602 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 20.05 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nHmm, still getting 20.05 GeV, but the closest option is D. 20.132 GeV.\n\nMaybe I need to use more precise values.\n\nLet me use more decimal places for \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nCalculate \\(\\gamma\\) more accurately.\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.2799} \\approx 3.57147 \\]\n\nNow, using this value:\n\n\\[ E = 3.57147 \\times 5.602 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 20.05 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nStill, same result.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the kinetic energy, not the total energy.\n\nWait, in relativistic physics, the total energy is what's typically considered, and it's given by \\( E = \\gamma m c^2 \\), which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n\nAlternatively, kinetic energy can be expressed as \\( E_{kin} = (\\gamma - 1) m c^2 \\), but the problem likely refers to the total energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the binding energy or something, but that seems unlikely for this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the nucleus has both protons and neutrons, and their individual masses, but that might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass I used for Lithium-6 is not precise enough.\n\nLooking up more precise values:\n\nThe atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.01512277(24) u.\n\nSo, using 6.01512277 u.\n\nConvert to kg:\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512277 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nActually, calculating it:\n\n\\[ m = 6.01512277 \\times 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 10.0000 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nNow, calculate \\( c^2 \\):\n\n\\[ c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ c^2 = (2.99792458)^2 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\n\\[ c^2 \\approx 8.98755178737 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\nNow,\n\n\\[ E = \\gamma m c^2 = 3.57147 \\times 1.0000 \\times 10^{-26} \\times 8.98755178737 \\times 10^{16} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 3.57147 \\times 8.98755178737 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 32.129 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ J} \\]\n\n\\[ E (\\text{GeV}) = \\frac{32.129 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 20.05 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nStill getting 20.05 GeV, which rounds to 20.050 GeV, but the options have more decimal places.\n\nLooking at option D: 20.132 GeV, which is slightly higher.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, and use their individual masses.\n\nThe mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276466812 u, and a neutron is approximately 1.00866491588 u.\n\nSo, for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n\n\\[ m = 3 \\times 1.007276466812 + 3 \\times 1.00866491588 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 3.021829399836 + 3.02599474764 \\]\n\n\\[ m \\approx 6.047824147476 \\text{ u} \\]\n\nBut the atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.01512 u, which is less due to the binding energy.\n\nBut since we're dealing with the rest mass of the nucleus, we should use the atomic mass, not the sum of the individual nucleons.\n\nWait, actually, in nuclear physics, the mass of the atom is used for the nucleus, including the electrons, but for heavy ions like Lithium, the electron mass is negligible compared to the nuclear mass.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps I should use the atomic mass of Lithium-6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, not the total energy.\n\nLet me try calculating the kinetic energy.\n\nKinetic energy \\( E_{kin} = (\\gamma -
