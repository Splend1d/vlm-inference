                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with wave functions and normalization. It says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, where i is the imaginary unit, and this function describes the particle's state in the region where x is between 1 and 3. No particles are found outside this range.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a wave function is. In quantum mechanics, the wave function, often denoted by \u03a8(x), represents the state of a particle. The square of the magnitude of the wave function, |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2, gives the probability density of finding the particle at position x.\n\nThe problem mentions that no particles are found outside the interval x = 1 to x = 3. This suggests that the wave function must be normalized over this interval, meaning that the integral of the probability density over this region should be equal to 1.\n\nSo, to find the value of 'a', I need to normalize the wave function over the interval x from 1 to 3.\n\nThe general formula for normalization is:\n\n\u222b|\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 dx from x = a to x = b = 1\n\nwhere a and b are the limits of the interval where the particle can be found.\n\nGiven the wave function \u03a8(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, I need to find |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2.\n\nRecall that for a complex function, |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 = \u03a8*(x) \u03a8(x), where \u03a8*(x) is the complex conjugate of \u03a8(x).\n\nSo, \u03a8*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i\n\nTherefore,\n\n|\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 = [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i] * [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i]\n\nI remember that (a - b*i)(a + b*i) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n|\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 = (a / sqrt(1 + x))\u00b2 + (0.5)\u00b2\n\n= (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25\n\nNow, set the integral of |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 from x = 1 to x = 3 equal to 1:\n\n\u222b from x=1 to x=3 of [(a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nFirst, integrate (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) dx from 1 to 3.\n\nLet u = 1 + x, then du = dx\n\nWhen x = 1, u = 2\n\nWhen x = 3, u = 4\n\nSo, \u222b from u=2 to u=4 of (a\u00b2 / u) du = a\u00b2 * \u222b from 2 to 4 of (1/u) du = a\u00b2 * [ln|u|] from 2 to 4 = a\u00b2 * (ln4 - ln2) = a\u00b2 * ln(4/2) = a\u00b2 * ln2\n\nNext, integrate 0.25 dx from x=1 to x=3.\n\n= 0.25[x] from 1 to 3 = 0.25*(3 - 1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5\n\nTherefore, the integral is:\n\na\u00b2 * ln2 + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, solve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 * ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 0.5 / ln2\n\nNow, to find 'a', take the square root:\n\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln2)\n\nBut I need to make sure about the sign. Since wave functions can have complex parts, and 'a' is a constant, I think the positive root is what we're after.\n\nLet me calculate this numerically.\n\nFirst, calculate ln2 \u2248 0.6931\n\nThen, 0.5 / 0.6931 \u2248 0.7217\n\nTherefore, a \u2248 sqrt(0.7217) \u2248 0.85\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.6\n\nB. 1.1\n\nC. 0.85\n\nD. 0.35\n\nSo, 0.85 seems to be the closest option.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 = [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i] * [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i] = (a / sqrt(1 + x))\u00b2 + (0.5)\u00b2\n\nYes, that's correct, because the imaginary parts cancel out.\n\nThen, integral from 1 to 3 of |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2 dx = 1\n\nSubstituting |\u03a8(x)|\u00b2, we get:\n\n\u222b from 1 to 3 of [(a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nThen, a\u00b2 * ln2 + 0.5 = 1\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (1 - 0.5)/ln2 = 0.5 / ln2 \u2248 0.7217\n\nThen, a \u2248 sqrt(0.7217) \u2248 0.85\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.85\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
