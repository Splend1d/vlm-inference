                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a star with dark spots, and it's asking how big a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots. Let's see, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of it. The effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler than that. Also, because only one hemisphere has spots, the brightness changes as the star rotates, similar to having a planet transit in front of it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the spots affect the star's brightness. Since the spots are darker, they reduce the overall light we see from the star as that hemisphere rotates into view. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of one hemisphere is covered by these spots.\n\nNow, the temperature of the spots is 1000K less than the effective temperature, which is 6000K, so the spots are at 5000K. The brightness or flux from a surface is proportional to the temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. So, the flux from the unspotted area would be \u03c3T_eff^4, and from the spotted area, it's \u03c3T_spot^4.\n\nSince only one hemisphere has spots, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, the rest of that hemisphere (80%) is at the effective temperature. So, the total flux from the spotted hemisphere is 0.8 * \u03c3T_eff^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3T_spot^4.\n\nThe unspotted hemisphere has no spots, so its flux is \u03c3T_eff^4.\n\nNow, the total flux we observe from the star when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the fluxes from both hemispheres: \u03c3T_eff^4 (unspotted) + (0.8 * \u03c3T_eff^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3T_spot^4) (spotted).\n\nSimilarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is \u03c3T_eff^4 (unspotted) + \u03c3T_eff^4 (spotted, but spots are on the far side, so fully at T_eff).\n\nWait, actually, since the star is spherical, both hemispheres are always visible, but the spots are only on one hemisphere. So, the total flux observed depends on which hemisphere is facing us.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the integrated flux over the visible hemisphere.\n\nActually, in photometry, when we observe a star, we see one side of it, and the other side is on the far side, not contributing to the observed flux. So, the observed flux is only from the visible hemisphere.\n\nGiven that, if the spots are on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spotted side, and when the star rotates, we see the unspotted side.\n\nSo, the observed flux alternates between the flux of the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.\n\nThe unspotted hemisphere has a flux of \u03c3T_eff^4 per unit area, and the spotted hemisphere has a flux of (0.8 * \u03c3T_eff^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3T_spot^4) per unit area.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two fluxes.\n\nWait, actually, the amplitude would be half the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes, since the variation is sinusoidal around the mean.\n\nBut let's calculate the flux difference first.\n\nFirst, calculate the flux from the spotted hemisphere:\n\nFlux_spotted = 0.8 * \u03c3T_eff^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3T_spot^4\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nFlux_spotted = 0.8 * \u03c3(6000)^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3(5000)^4\n\nSimilarly, Flux_unspotted = \u03c3(6000)^4\n\nThe difference in flux is:\n\n\u0394F = Flux_unspotted - Flux_spotted\n\n\u0394F = \u03c3(6000)^4 - [0.8 * \u03c3(6000)^4 + 0.2 * \u03c3(5000)^4]\n\nFactor out \u03c3:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c3[(6000)^4 - 0.8*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nCalculate (6000)^4 and (5000)^4:\n\n(6000)^4 = 1.296 \u00d7 10^17 K^4\n\n(5000)^4 = 6.25 \u00d7 10^16 K^4\n\nPlug these in:\n\n\u0394F = \u03c3[1.296e17 - 0.8*1.296e17 - 0.2*6.25e16]\n\nCalculate 0.8*1.296e17 = 1.0368e17\n\nAnd 0.2*6.25e16 = 0.125e17\n\nSo, \u0394F = \u03c3[1.296e17 - 1.0368e17 - 0.125e17] = \u03c3[0.1342e17] = 0.1342 * \u03c3 * 1e17 K^4\n\nBut actually, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is 5.670373 \u00d7 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4.\n\nSo, \u0394F \u2248 0.1342 \u00d7 5.67 \u00d7 10^-8 W m^-2 = 0.759 \u00d7 10^-8 W m^-2\n\nWait, but this doesn't seem right because the units are per square meter, but we need to consider the area of the star.\n\nActually, the flux we observe is the flux per unit area on the surface of the star, integrated over the visible hemisphere.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think in terms of the brightness variation due to the spots.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us versus when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nGiven that, the amplitude \u0394F is proportional to the area of the spots times the temperature difference.\n\nThe area of the spots is 20% of one hemisphere, so 0.2 * (1/2 of the star's surface area).\n\nThe temperature difference is 1000K.\n\nSo, \u0394F \u2248 area_of_spots * \u03c3 * (T_eff - T_spot)\n\nWhere area_of_spots = 0.2 * (1/2) * 4\u03c0R^2 = 0.2 * 2\u03c0R^2 = 0.4\u03c0R^2\n\nSo, \u0394F \u2248 0.4\u03c0R^2 * \u03c3 * 1000 K\n\nBut \u03c3 is in W m^-2 K^-4, so need to make sure units are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fraction of the star's luminosity that the spots affect.\n\nThe luminosity of the star is L = 4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4\n\nThe reduction in luminosity due to the spots is the area of the spots times the difference in flux.\n\nSo, \u0394L = area_of_spots * \u03c3 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)\n\nWe already calculated T_eff^4 and T_spot^4 as 1.296e17 K^4 and 6.25e16 K^4, respectively.\n\nSo, \u0394L = 0.4\u03c0R^2 * \u03c3 (1.296e17 - 0.625e17) = 0.4\u03c0R^2 * \u03c3 * 0.671e17 K^4\n\nAgain, \u03c3 is 5.67e-8 W m^-2 K^-4\n\nSo, \u0394L \u2248 0.4\u03c0R^2 * 5.67e-8 * 0.671e17 = 0.4\u03c0R^2 * 5.67e-8 * 6.71e16 = 0.4\u03c0R^2 * 3.80e10 W\n\nBut L = 4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4 = 4\u03c0R^2 * 5.67e-8 * 1.296e17 = 4\u03c0R^2 * 7.326e10 W\n\nSo, the relative luminosity variation is \u0394L / L \u2248 (0.4\u03c0R^2 * 3.80e10) / (4\u03c0R^2 * 7.326e10) = 0.4 * 3.8 / (4 * 7.326) \u2248 1.52 / 29.304 \u2248 0.0518, or about 5.18%\n\nBut this is the relative variation in luminosity due to the spots.\n\nNow, we need to find the radius of a planet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the light curve, assuming it transits the star.\n\nA transit causes a decrease in the observed flux proportional to the area of the planet compared to the area of the star's disk.\n\nSo, the fractional decrease in flux due to a planet is (\u03c0 R_pl^2) / (\u03c0 R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2\n\nWe want this to be equal to the relative luminosity variation due to the spots, which we calculated as approximately 0.0518.\n\nSo, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.0518\n\nTherefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.0518) \u2248 0.227\n\nSo, approximately 22.7% of the star's radius.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. ~0.07\n\nB. ~0.32\n\nC. ~0.39\n\nD. ~0.11\n\nNone of these match exactly, but 0.227 is closest to option B, which is ~0.32.\n\nWait, but 0.227 is closer to 0.32 than to 0.11 or 0.07.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the area of the spots is 20% of one hemisphere.\n\nThe star's surface area is 4\u03c0R^2.\n\nOne hemisphere is 2\u03c0R^2, so 20% of that is 0.4\u03c0R^2.\n\nThe temperature difference is 1000K, so the flux difference per unit area is \u03c3 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4).\n\nSo, the total luminosity difference is \u0394L = area_of_spots * \u03c3 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)\n\nThen, the relative luminosity variation is \u0394L / L, where L = 4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4\n\nSo, \u0394L / L = (0.4\u03c0R^2 * \u03c3 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4\u03c0R^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4) = 0.1 * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4\n\nPlugging in T_eff = 6000K and T_spot = 5000K:\n\n(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4 = (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\n\nSo, 1 - (5000/6000)^4 = 1 - (5/6)^4 = 1 - (625/1296) \u2248 1 - 0.482 = 0.518\n\nWait, earlier I had 0.0518, but that was a miscalculation.\n\nActually, 1 - (5/6)^4 = 1 - (625/1296) \u2248 1 - 0.482 = 0.518\n\nSo, \u0394L / L \u2248 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, for the planet, the fractional decrease in flux is (\u03c0 R_pl^2) / (\u03c0 R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2\n\nSet this equal to 0.0518:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.0518\n\nThus, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.0518) \u2248 0.227\n\nSo, approximately 0.227, which is closest to option B, ~0.32.\n\nWait, but 0.227 is closer to 0.2 than to 0.32. Maybe I need to check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by the average flux.\n\nGiven that, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nSo, the amplitude \u0394F = (F_max - F_min) / F_avg\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I considered \u0394L / L, which is similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the brightness variation more accurately.\n\nLet me consider that the star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere and the hidden hemisphere.\n\nBut since we only see one hemisphere, the observed flux is only from the visible hemisphere.\n\nWhen the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is the flux from the spotted hemisphere.\n\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the brightness variation is half the difference between the maximum and minimum observed fluxes.\n\nWait, actually, in photometry, the amplitude is typically defined as half the peak-to-peak variation.\n\nSo, amplitude A = (F_max - F_min) / (2 F_avg)\n\nBut sometimes it's defined differently.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps I should calculate the relative flux variation as (F_max - F_min) / F_avg\n\nGiven that, F_max is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere, and F_min is the flux from the spotted hemisphere.\n\nSo, relative flux variation = (F_max - F_min) / F_avg\n\nWhere F_avg is the average flux, which is (F_max + F_min) / 2\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to consider the fractional decrease due to the spots and set it equal to the fractional decrease due to the planet.\n\nGiven that, the fractional decrease due to the spots is the ratio of the spot area times the temperature difference to the total luminosity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the brightness variation per unit area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the filling factor and the temperature difference to find the equivalent planet radius.\n\nGiven that, the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is proportional to the area of the spots times the temperature difference.\n\nSo, amplitude_spots = (area_of_spots) * (T_eff - T_spot)\n\nSimilarly, the amplitude due to the planet is (area_of_planet) / (area_of_star)\n\nWe want these two amplitudes to be equal.\n\nSo, (area_of_planet) / (area_of_star) = (area_of_spots) * (T_eff - T_spot) / L_star\n\nWhere L_star is the luminosity of the star.\n\nBut L_star = 4\u03c0R_star^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4\n\nAnd area_of_spots = 0.2 * 2\u03c0R_star^2 = 0.4\u03c0R_star^2\n\nSo, (\u03c0 R_pl^2) / (\u03c0 R_star^2) = (0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * \u03c3 (T_eff - T_spot)) / (4\u03c0R_star^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = (0.4 * \u03c3 (T_eff - T_spot)) / (4 \u03c3 T_eff^4)\n\nCancel \u03c3 and simplify:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * (T_eff - T_spot) / T_eff^4\n\nBut T_spot = T_eff - 1000K, so T_eff - T_spot = 1000K\n\nSo, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * 1000 / T_eff^4\n\nPlug in T_eff = 6000K:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * 1000 / (6000)^4 = 0.1 * 1000 / 1.296e17 = 100 / 1.296e17 = 0.00000007716\n\nSo, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(7.716e-9) \u2248 0.00000278, which is 0.00278%\n\nThat can't be right. I must have messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) instead of just (T_eff - T_spot).\n\nLet me correct that.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = (area_of_spots * \u03c3 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4\u03c0R_star^2 \u03c3 T_eff^4)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = (0.4\u03c0R_star^2 * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (4\u03c0R_star^2 T_eff^4)\n\nCancel \u03c0R_star^2:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4\n\nNow, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 = 5000K\n\nSo, T_eff^4 = 6000^4 = 1.296e17 K^4\n\nT_spot^4 = 5000^4 = 6.25e16 K^4\n\nThus, T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 = 1.296e17 - 6.25e16 = 0.671e17 K^4 = 6.71e16 K^4\n\nSo, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.1 * 6.71e16 / 1"
