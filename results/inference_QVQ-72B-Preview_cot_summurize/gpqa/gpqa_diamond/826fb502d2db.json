                    "text": "So I've got this problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction, respectively. C is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relative speed between these two astronauts. I remember that at low speeds, the relative speed is just the difference between their speeds. But since these are relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract 0.5c from 0.6c to get 0.1c. I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula because at speeds close to the speed of light, velocities don't add up the same way they do at everyday speeds.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_2 v_1}{c^2}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_2\\) and \\(v_1\\) are the speeds of the two astronauts, and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the numerator:\n\n\\[0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\\]\n\nThen, simplify the denominator:\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\\]\n\nSo, the relative speed is:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.1429c\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.14c.\n\nNow, I need to find the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy of an object is given by:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m c^2\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nSo, I need to calculate the energy for each astronaut and then add them together.\n\nFirst, for the astronaut with mass 2m moving at 0.6c:\n\n\\[\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\\]\n\nSo, their energy is:\n\n\\[E_1 = \\gamma_1 \\times 2m \\times c^2 = 1.25 \\times 2m \\times c^2 = 2.5m c^2\\]\n\nNext, for the astronaut with mass 3m moving at 0.5c:\n\n\\[\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547\\]\n\nSo, their energy is:\n\n\\[E_2 = \\gamma_2 \\times 3m \\times c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times 3m \\times c^2 \\approx 3.464m c^2\\]\n\nNow, the total energy of the system is:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \\approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 5.96m c^2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nB. v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nC. v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nD. v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nMy calculations give v_rel \u2248 0.14c and E_total \u2248 5.96m c^2, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, option A has E=5mc^2. Let's check if that could be possible. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the energy calculations.\n\nFor the first astronaut:\n\n\\[\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\\]\n\n\\[E_1 = 1.25 \\times 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\\]\n\nFor the second astronaut:\n\n\\[\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547\\]\n\n\\[E_2 = 1.1547 \\times 3m c^2 \\approx 3.4641m c^2\\]\n\nTotal energy:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{total}} = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 = 5.9641m c^2\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. Maybe the option A has a typo or something.\n\nAlso, option B has v_rel = 1.1c, which doesn't match our calculation, and E=mc^2 seems too low.\n\nOption C has v_rel=0.1c, which is the non-relativistic approach, which is incorrect at these speeds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
