                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're dealing with the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce electron-positron pairs, which is written as \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e\u207ae\u207b. The question is asking from what energy these gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process, given that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10\u207b\u00b3 eV.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the process. For two photons to annihilate into an electron-positron pair, there's an energy threshold that must be met because of the rest masses of the electron and positron. The rest energy of an electron (or positron) is m\u2091 c\u00b2, where m\u2091 is the electron mass and c is the speed of light. The electron mass is approximately 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, so the rest energy is about 0.511 MeV per particle, meaning 1.022 MeV for both the electron and positron together.\n\nBut wait, that's just the threshold energy in the center-of-mass frame. In reality, because the CMB photons have a distribution of energies (they follow a blackbody distribution with a temperature of about 2.7 K, which corresponds to an average energy of about 10\u207b\u00b3 eV, as given), the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy to make up for both the rest masses and the kinetic energy of the CMB photon.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving relativistic particle interactions, particularly the threshold energy for pair production in photon-photon collisions.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray photon in the lab frame. I think it involves the energy of the target photon and the rest energy of the electron.\n\nI found that the threshold center-of-mass energy squared (s) for e\u207ae\u207b pair production is s = 4m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074. In the lab frame, where one photon is moving with energy E\u03b3 and the other is nearly at rest (the CMB photon with energy E\u2080), the threshold condition can be related through a Lorentz transformation.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the threshold energy of the gamma-ray photon in the lab frame can be expressed as:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh = 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the velocity of the CMB photon in units of c, but since it's a photon, \u03b2 = 1. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the invariant mass squared of the two photons. In the center-of-mass frame, s = 4m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074, as mentioned. In the lab frame, s = 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 (1 - cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the two photons. At threshold, s = 4m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074, and the particles are back-to-back, so \u03b8 = \u03c0, meaning cos\u03b8 = -1.\n\nWait, but the CMB photon is nearly at rest relative to the gamma-ray photon, so maybe I can approximate this.\n\nActually, for a CMB photon with negligible momentum compared to the gamma-ray photon, the threshold energy in the lab frame can be approximated as:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh = 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2), but since \u03b2 \u2248 1 for both photons, this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I found a formula that relates the threshold gamma-ray energy to the energy of the target photon:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh = 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2), where \u03b2 is the velocity of the CMB photon in units of c, which is 1. This would make E\u03b3,thresh infinite, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI must be missing something here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the energy-momentum conservation in the center-of-mass frame. The total energy in the CM frame should be equal to the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the minimum energy of the gamma-ray photon such that, when it collides with a CMB photon, the total energy in the CM frame is at least 2m\u2091c\u00b2.\n\nThe CM energy squared s is given by:\n\ns = (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (E\u03b3/c + E\u2080/c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\nBut since the CMB photon has very low energy, its momentum is negligible compared to that of the gamma-ray photon. So, approximately, s \u2248 2E\u03b3 E\u2080.\n\nAt threshold, s = 4m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074, so:\n\n2E\u03b3 E\u2080 = 4m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074 \u21d2 E\u03b3 = 2m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074 / E\u2080\n\nWait, that can't be right because units don't match. E\u2080 is in eV, and m\u2091 is in kg or something, but usually, we work in natural units where c = 1, and energies are in MeV or GeV.\n\nLet me convert all units to MeV for consistency. The electron mass is 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2, so m\u2091 c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV. Then, 2m\u2091\u00b2c\u2074 = 2*(0.511 MeV)\u00b2 = 2*(0.26121 MeV\u00b2) = 0.52242 MeV\u00b2.\n\nGiven that E\u2080 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV = 10\u207b\u2076 MeV (since 1 eV = 10\u207b\u00b3 MeV), then:\n\nE\u03b3 = 0.52242 MeV\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 GeV\n\nThat's way higher than any of the options provided. Clearly, I've made a mistake here.\n\nLet me check my steps again. Maybe I misremembered the formula for the threshold energy.\n\nAfter some research, I found that the threshold center-of-mass energy squared s\u2080 for e\u207ae\u207b production is s\u2080 = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2. In the lab frame, s = 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 (1 - \u03b2), where \u03b2 is the velocity of the CMB photon in units of c, which is 1. This would make s = 0, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I need to consider the angle between the photons.\n\nAlternatively, for low-energy target photons like the CMB, the threshold energy of the gamma-ray photon can be approximated by:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh = 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2), but \u03b2 is nearly 1 for both photons, leading to division by zero, which again doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I need to use a different formula. Upon further research, I found that the threshold energy for gamma-ray photon annihilation with a CMB photon to produce an e\u207ae\u207b pair can be estimated using the formula:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh \u2248 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - cos\u03b8) * (1 / E\u2080)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the two photons. At threshold, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0, so cos\u03b8 approaches -1, leading to E\u03b3,thresh \u2248 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - (-1)) * (1 / E\u2080) = 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / 2 * (1 / E\u2080) = m\u2091c\u00b2 / E\u2080\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the energy condition for pair production. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m\u2091c\u00b2. The CM energy s is related to the lab frame energies by:\n\ns = 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 (1 - \u03b2), but as before, \u03b2 \u2248 1 for both photons, which doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, in the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron, each with energy m\u2091c\u00b2 + some kinetic energy. At threshold, they have no kinetic energy, so s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nIn the lab frame, s = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2248 2E\u03b3 E\u2080, assuming p\u2080 is negligible.\n\nSetting s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2, we get 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 \u21d2 E\u03b3 = 2(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 / E\u2080\n\nGiven m\u2091c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV, then E\u03b3 = 2*(0.511 MeV)\u00b2 / E\u2080 = 2*(0.26121 MeV\u00b2) / E\u2080\n\nGiven E\u2080 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV = 10\u207b\u2076 MeV, then E\u03b3 = 2*0.26121 MeV\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 0.52242 MeV / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 GeV\n\nThis is still way higher than the options provided, which are in the range of 10\u2075 GeV. Maybe I need to consider that the CMB photon has a temperature of 2.7 K, corresponding to an average energy of about 0.25 meV, not 10\u207b\u00b3 eV. Let's check that.\n\nThe average energy of a photon in a blackbody spectrum is given by:\n\nE_avg = (3/2) k_B T\n\nwhere k_B is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 eV/K), and T is the temperature (2.7 K).\n\nSo, E_avg = (3/2) * 8.617 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 eV/K * 2.7 K \u2248 3.15 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 eV, which is 0.315 meV, not 10\u207b\u00b3 eV as given in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that the average photon energy of the CMB is 10\u207b\u00b3 eV, which seems inconsistent with the standard value. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold energy calculation needs to account for the relative motion of the two photons more carefully. Let's try using the invariant mass approach again.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the two photons is:\n\ns = (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (E\u03b3/c + E\u2080/c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 - (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 \u2248 2E\u03b3 E\u2080, assuming p\u2080 is negligible.\n\nAt threshold, s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2, so 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 \u21d2 E\u03b3 = 2(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 / E\u2080\n\nUsing m\u2091c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV and E\u2080 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV = 10\u207b\u2076 MeV:\n\nE\u03b3 = 2*(0.511 MeV)\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 2*(0.26121 MeV\u00b2) / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 0.52242 MeV / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 MeV = 5.2242 \u00d7 10\u2075 GeV\n\nThis is still not matching the provided options. Maybe I need to consider that the CMB photon has a finite momentum, which affects the CM energy.\n\nLet's consider the CMB photon energy E\u2080 and its corresponding momentum p\u2080 = E\u2080 / c.\n\nIn the lab frame, the gamma-ray has energy E\u03b3 and momentum p\u03b3 = E\u03b3 / c.\n\nThe total four-momentum is:\n\np_total = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080, p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\n\nThe invariant mass squared is:\n\ns = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - |p\u03b3 + p\u2080|\u00b2 c\u00b2\n\nAt threshold, s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nAssuming p\u2080 is much smaller than p\u03b3, we can approximate |p\u03b3 + p\u2080|\u00b2 \u2248 p\u03b3\u00b2 + 2p\u03b3\u00b7p\u2080 + p\u2080\u00b2 \u2248 (E\u03b3 / c)\u00b2 + 2*(E\u03b3 / c)*(E\u2080 / c) + (E\u2080 / c)\u00b2\n\nBut since c = 1 in natural units, this becomes:\n\ns \u2248 (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 = 0, which can't be right.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be an error in my approximation.\n\nLet me try to expand (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - |p\u03b3 + p\u2080|\u00b2 c\u00b2:\n\n(E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2 - (p\u03b3\u00b2 c\u00b2 + 2p\u03b3\u00b7p\u2080 c\u00b2 + p\u2080\u00b2 c\u00b2)\n\nAssuming c = 1, and using E\u03b3 = p\u03b3 for massless particles:\n\ns = E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2 - (E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 / c + E\u2080\u00b2 / c\u00b2)\n\nWait, actually, for massless particles, E = pc, so p = E / c.\n\nTherefore, |p\u03b3 + p\u2080|\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (E\u03b3 / c + E\u2080 / c)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 / c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2\n\nSo, s = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 = 0, which is impossible because at threshold, s should be 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption is incorrect. Maybe I need to consider the angle between the momenta.\n\nIn reality, the two photons are not necessarily collinear, so their momenta don't add directly. The invariant mass squared is:\n\ns = (E\u03b3 + E\u2080)\u00b2 - (p\u03b3 + p\u2080)\u00b2 c\u00b2 = E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2 - (p\u03b3\u00b2 c\u00b2 + 2p\u03b3\u00b7p\u2080 c\u00b2 + p\u2080\u00b2 c\u00b2)\n\nUsing p\u03b3 = E\u03b3 / c and p\u2080 = E\u2080 / c:\n\ns = E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2 - (E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 cos\u03b8 + E\u2080\u00b2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between p\u03b3 and p\u2080.\n\nAt threshold, \u03b8 approaches \u03c0, so cos\u03b8 approaches -1:\n\ns \u2248 E\u03b3\u00b2 + 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2 - (E\u03b3\u00b2 - 2E\u03b3 E\u2080 + E\u2080\u00b2) = 4E\u03b3 E\u2080\n\nSet s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2:\n\n4E\u03b3 E\u2080 = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 \u21d2 E\u03b3 = (m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 / E\u2080\n\nGiven m\u2091c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV and E\u2080 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV = 10\u207b\u2076 MeV:\n\nE\u03b3 = (0.511 MeV)\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 0.26121 MeV\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 261.21 MeV\n\nThat's much more reasonable. So, E\u03b3 \u2248 261 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the options are in the range of 10\u2075 GeV, which is way higher. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check the formula. The invariant mass squared s is indeed s = 4E\u03b3 E\u2080 at threshold for e\u207ae\u207b production from two photons.\n\nGiven that, s = 4(m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2, and s = 4E\u03b3 E\u2080, so E\u03b3 = (m\u2091c\u00b2)\u00b2 / E\u2080.\n\nWith m\u2091c\u00b2 = 0.511 MeV and E\u2080 = 10\u207b\u00b3 eV = 10\u207b\u2076 MeV, E\u03b3 = (0.511 MeV)\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 0.26121 MeV\u00b2 / 10\u207b\u2076 MeV = 261.21 MeV.\n\nBut this is only 0.261 GeV, which is much lower than the options provided. Maybe the problem is considering a different threshold or including other effects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the actual cross-section for this process and determining the energy at which the mean free path of the gamma-ray becomes comparable to the size of the universe, thereby limiting its lifetime.\n\nIn that case, the threshold energy would be higher due to the need for a significant cross-section for the interaction to occur.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the threshold energy in gamma-ray interactions with CMB photons leading to e\u207ae\u207b pair production.\n\nUpon research, I find that the threshold energy for gamma-ray interactions with CMB photons to produce e\u207ae\u207b pairs is given by:\n\nE\u03b3,thresh \u2248 2m\u2091c\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b2), where \u03b2 is the velocity of the CMB photon in units of c, which is 1.\n\nThis would make E\u03b3,thresh infinite, which doesn't make sense.
