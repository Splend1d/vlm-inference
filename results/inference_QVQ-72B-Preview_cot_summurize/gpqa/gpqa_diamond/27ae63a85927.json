                    "text": "So I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the starting materials for two different reactions that lead to two enantiomers of a compound. The reactions are:\n\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nAnd I have four options to choose from, each pairing different stereoisomers of a starting acid. My goal is to determine which option correctly identifies the starting materials A and B that would give the specified products upon reduction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the starting materials and the products. Both reactions involve reduction steps, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3, followed by protonation (H+). These reducing agents are known for reducing carbonyl groups, like ketones or aldehydes, to alcohols.\n\nLooking at the products:\n\n- (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from A\n\n- (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from B\n\nThese are enantiomers of each other, differing only in the configuration at the chiral center.\n\nNow, the starting materials are given as:\n\n- (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n- (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nWait a minute, both starting materials in options A and B are the same acid but with different stereochemistry at the chiral center. Similarly, options C and D have the same acid with different stereochemistry.\n\nI need to recall how reduction affects the stereochemistry of a chiral center. Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol can introduce a new chiral center or modify an existing one, depending on the stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the starting acid. It's a 5-oxopentanoic acid, which means it has a ketone group at position 5 and a carboxylic acid group at the end. The chiral center is at position 3, as indicated by the \"(R)-\" or \"(S)-\" prefix.\n\nWhen we reduce the ketone group with LiBH4 or BH3, followed by protonation, we're turning the ketone into a secondary alcohol. This reaction can be stereoselective, meaning it can favor one enantiomer over the other, depending on the conditions and the structure of the starting material.\n\nI need to think about the stereoselectivity of these reductions. LiBH4 is known to be a mild reducing agent that can reduce ketones to alcohols with some stereoselectivity, often favoring the anti addition. BH3 is another reducing agent that can also reduce ketones to alcohols, but its stereoselectivity might differ slightly.\n\nHowever, more importantly, I need to consider the stereochemistry of the starting material and how the reduction affects the existing chiral center.\n\nLet me try to visualize the starting acid. It's a 5-oxopentanoic acid with an ethyl group at position 3 and an isobutoxy group at position 5, I believe. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption A: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = same\n\nOption B: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nOption C: A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = same\n\nOption D: A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nSo, for reaction A, both starting materials are supposed to be the same in options A and B, and for reaction B, they differ in options B and D.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking to select the proper starting material for both reactions. So, for reaction A, starting material A gives (R)-product, and for reaction B, starting material B gives (S)-product. I need to match which starting materials A and B correspond to the given options.\n\nI think I need to consider each reaction separately.\n\nFirst, reaction A:\n\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nSo, starting material A is being reduced to give the (R)-enantiomer.\n\nSimilarly, reaction B:\n\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nStarting material B is being reduced to give the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nNow, I need to determine which combination of A and B from the options matches these transformations.\n\nLet me consider the structure transformations.\n\nStarting material A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nStarting material B is either (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, depending on the option.\n\nWait, no. In the options, for A and B, they specify which enantiomer A is and which enantiomer B is.\n\nOption A: A = (R)-, B = (R)-\n\nOption B: A = (R)-, B = (S)-\n\nOption C: A = (S)-, B = (S)-\n\nOption D: A = (S)-, B = (R)-\n\nSo, for reaction A, starting material A is reduced to (R)-product, and for reaction B, starting material B is reduced to (S)-product.\n\nI need to determine which combination of A and B leads to these products.\n\nFirst, consider reaction A:\n\nA + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-product\n\nSimilarly, reaction B:\n\nB + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-product\n\nI need to understand how the stereochemistry of the starting material influences the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nLet me think about the reduction step.\n\nReduction of a ketone to an alcohol can occur with different stereoselectivities depending on the reducing agent and the structure of the ketone.\n\nLiBH4 is known to approach from the less hindered side of the ketone, while BH3 might have different selectivity.\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with enantiomers, and the reduction is introducing a new stereocenter, I need to consider the existing stereocenter's influence on the new one being formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing stereocenter is being epimerized or not, depending on the reaction conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Markovnikov's rule or anti-Markovnikov addition, but that's for alkene hydration, not ketone reduction.\n\nLet me recall that ketone reduction can be stereoselective, and the stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the reducing agent.\n\nI need to consider the stereochemistry at the chiral center in the starting material and how it influences the approach of the reducing agent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reduction doesn't affect the existing stereocenter, and only reduces the ketone group to an alcohol, introducing a new stereocenter.\n\nIf that's the case, then the stereochemistry of the new alcohol center would depend on the stereoselectivity of the reduction, which could be influenced by the existing stereocenter.\n\nI need to consider the spatial arrangement of the groups around the ketone and how the reducing agent approaches.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern or consider the options one by one.\n\nLet's consider option A: A = (R)-, B = (R)-\n\nSo, both starting materials are (R)-enantiomers.\n\nBut reaction B is supposed to give the (S)-enantiomer of the product. If both starting materials are (R)-, and reaction B gives (S)-, that would require an inversion or some other change in stereochemistry during the reduction.\n\nIs that possible? Maybe, but it seems unlikely unless there's an inversion during the reduction process.\n\nSimilarly, option B: A = (R)-, B = (S)-\n\nSo, starting material A is (R)-, giving (R)-product via LiBH4 reduction.\n\nStarting material B is (S)-, giving (S)-product via BH3 reduction.\n\nThis seems more straightforward. If the reduction preserves the stereochemistry at the existing chiral center and introduces a new stereocenter with the same configuration, then this could work.\n\nOption C: A = (S)-, B = (S)-\n\nSimilar to option A, but with (S)-starting materials.\n\nOption D: A = (S)-, B = (R)-\n\nStarting material A is (S)-, giving (R)-product.\n\nStarting material B is (R)-, giving (S)-product.\n\nThis seems like it might require inversion during the reduction, which might not be typical for these reductions.\n\nSo, between options A and B, option B seems more plausible, as it suggests that the reduction preserves the stereochemistry, leading to the corresponding enantiomers.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me think about the reduction mechanism.\n\nLiBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols via a hydride transfer, typically with some stereoselectivity.\n\nBH3 also reduces ketones to alcohols, often with different selectivity.\n\nIn general, reductions can be syn or anti selective, depending on the reagent and the substrate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the reducing agent approaches from one side or the other, depending on the steric environment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing stereocenter influences the approach of the reducing agent, leading to retention or inversion.\n\nI need to consider the stereoselectivity of the reduction.\n\nIf the reduction is syn selective, it would add from the same side, potentially leading to retention of configuration.\n\nIf it's anti selective, it would add from the opposite side, leading to inversion.\n\nI need to know which reducing agent is more syn or anti selective.\n\nLiBH4 is known to be somewhat syn selective, meaning it adds from the same side, leading to retention of configuration.\n\nBH3 is also syn selective, although it can have different selectivity depending on the substrate.\n\nIf both reducing agents are syn selective, then starting from (R)-enantiomer would lead to (R)-alcohol, and from (S)-enantiomer to (S)-alcohol.\n\nThat would suggest that option B is correct, where A is (R)- and B is (S)-.\n\nAlternatively, if the reducing agents have different selectivity, it could be different.\n\nBut based on general trends, syn selective reduction should preserve the stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, for reaction A, starting with (R)-enantiomer and reducing to (R)-product, and for reaction B, starting with (S)-enantiomer and reducing to (S)-product, which matches option B.\n\nOption A would have both starting materials as (R)-, but reaction B is supposed to give (S)-, which wouldn't match unless there's inversion, which isn't typical for syn selective reduction.\n\nOption C has both starting materials as (S)-, but reaction A is supposed to give (R)-, which again wouldn't match unless there's inversion.\n\nOption D has A as (S)- giving (R)-, and B as (R)- giving (S)-, which would require inversion in both cases, which isn't typical for these reductions.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible option is B: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis should ensure that the reduction preserves the stereochemistry, leading to the corresponding enantiomers of the product.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider the structure transformations.\n\nStarting with (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, reducing the ketone group to an alcohol with LiBH4, which is syn selective, should lead to retention of configuration, giving (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nSimilarly, starting with (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, reducing with BH3, which is also syn selective, should lead to retention, giving (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
