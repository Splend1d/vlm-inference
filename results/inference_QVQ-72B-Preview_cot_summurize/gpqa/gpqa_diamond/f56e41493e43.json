                    "text": "Oh, this is a problem about exoplanets and their properties. I'm a bit rusty on planetary science, but I think I can figure this out step by step. Let's see what we have here.\n\nWe have three exoplanets\u2014Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3\u2014with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I believe stands for Transit Timing Variations. That probably means they're affecting each other gravitationally, causing slight changes in their transit times as observed from Earth.\n\nThe problem gives us ratios of equilibrium temperatures and masses between these planets. Specifically:\n\n- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4.\n\n- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3.\n\n- The ratio of masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15.\n\n- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35.\n\nWe're also told that all three planets have the same albedo of 0.3, similar to Earth.\n\nThe question is asking for the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So, we need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, \\( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature, its mass, albedo, and its orbital period.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (\\( T \\)) of a planet can be related to its distance from the star (\\( d \\)) and the stellar flux (\\( S \\)) it receives. The formula for equilibrium temperature is generally:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{S (1 - A)}{4 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( S \\) is the stellar flux,\n\n- \\( A \\) is the albedo,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSince all planets have the same albedo (\\( A = 0.3 \\)), and assuming they receive similar stellar flux (which might not be directly true, but perhaps the star is the same for all), I need to see how their temperatures relate to their distances and thus their orbital periods.\n\nBut wait, the stellar flux \\( S \\) depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. If we assume that all planets orbit the same star, then the stellar flux \\( S \\) would be inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ S \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2} \\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right)^{1/4} = d^{-1/2} \\]\n\nSo, temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\]\n\nNow, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period \\( P \\) to the orbital distance \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ P^2 \\propto d^3 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P \\propto d^{3/2} \\]\n\nCombining these two relationships:\n\n\\[ T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\]\n\n\\[ P \\propto d^{3/2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^2} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps.\n\nFrom \\( T \\propto d^{-1/2} \\) and \\( P \\propto d^{3/2} \\), if I solve for \\( d \\) in terms of \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ d \\propto \\frac{1}{T^2} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T^2} \\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{1}{T^3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^3} \\]\n\nHmm, that seems off. I think I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P = k d^{3/2} \\]\n\nAnd from the temperature relationship:\n\n\\[ T = C d^{-1/2} \\]\n\nWhere \\( k \\) and \\( C \\) are constants.\n\nIf I solve for \\( d \\) in terms of \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\left( \\frac{T}{C} \\right)^{-2} = \\left( \\frac{C}{T} \\right)^{2} \\]\n\nThen substitute into the period formula:\n\n\\[ P = k \\left( \\frac{C}{T} \\right)^{3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^3} \\]\n\nWait, that seems similar to what I had before. But I recall that in reality, the relationship between period and temperature should be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, starting from the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{S (1 - A)}{4 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nAnd since \\( S = \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2} \\), where \\( L \\) is the star's luminosity,\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L (1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma d^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nAssuming all planets orbit the same star, \\( L \\) is constant.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ T \\propto d^{-1/2} \\]\n\nAnd from Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P \\propto d^{3/2} \\]\n\nSo, if \\( T \\propto d^{-1/2} \\), then \\( d \\propto T^{-2} \\), and thus:\n\n\\[ P \\propto (T^{-2})^{3/2} = T^{-3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^3} \\)\n\nOkay, that seems consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's consider the equilibrium temperature formula again:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{S (1 - A)}{4 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nGiven that albedo \\( A \\) is the same for all planets, and assuming \\( S \\) is the same for all (since they orbit the same star), then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{S_1 (1 - A)}{S_2 (1 - A)} \\right)^{1/4} = \\left( \\frac{S_1}{S_2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nBut wait, if they all orbit the same star, \\( S \\) should be proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{d^2} \\), as I mentioned earlier.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a relationship involving the planet's mass as well.\n\nI recall that for circular orbits, the orbital period is given by:\n\n\\[ P = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{d^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nWhere \\( M \\) is the mass of the star.\n\nAssuming all planets orbit the same star, \\( M \\) is constant, so:\n\n\\[ P \\propto d^{3/2} \\]\n\nAnd as established,\n\n\\[ T \\propto d^{-1/2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^3} \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.\n\nMaybe I should think about the ratios given.\n\nWe have:\n\n- \\( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \\)\n\n- \\( \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \\)\n\n- \\( \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = 1.15 \\)\n\n- \\( \\frac{M_2}{M_3} = 1.35 \\)\n\nI need to find \\( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\).\n\nFirst, let's find expressions for \\( T_1 \\), \\( T_2 \\), and \\( T_3 \\).\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \\), we have \\( T_1 = 1.4 T_2 \\)\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \\), we have \\( T_2 = 2.3 T_3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( T_1 = 1.4 \\times 2.3 T_3 = 3.22 T_3 \\)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, \\( T_2 = 2.3 T_3 \\), so \\( T_1 = 1.4 T_2 = 1.4 \\times 2.3 T_3 = 3.22 T_3 \\)\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for masses:\n\n\\( M_1 = 1.15 M_2 \\)\n\n\\( M_2 = 1.35 M_3 \\)\n\nSo, \\( M_1 = 1.15 \\times 1.35 M_3 = 1.5525 M_3 \\)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nNow, recalling that \\( P \\propto \\frac{1}{T^3} \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_3} \\right)^3 \\)\n\nFrom earlier, \\( T_1 = 3.22 T_3 \\), so \\( \\frac{T_1}{T_3} = 3.22 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 = 33.4 \\)\n\nSo, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. ~ 4.4\n\nB. ~ 10.4\n\nC. ~ 33.4\n\nD. ~ 3.2\n\nThe correct answer is C. ~ 33.4\n\nI think that makes sense. The key was to use the relationships between temperatures and masses to find the ratio of periods, leveraging the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
