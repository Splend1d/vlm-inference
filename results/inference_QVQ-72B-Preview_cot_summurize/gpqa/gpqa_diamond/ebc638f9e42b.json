                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who have built a spacecraft that can travel at almost the speed of light. They're planning to send an astronaut to Earth, and I need to figure out how long it will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are 77 years, the astronaut dies before arriving, 72 years, or 81 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy near the Milky Way, and I think it's about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So, the distance to travel is roughly 160,000 light-years.\n\nThe spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's incredibly close to the speed of light. At such high speeds, time dilation becomes significant according to Einstein's theory of relativity. This means that time passes slower for the moving astronaut compared to someone stationary.\n\nSo, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip will seem shorter than it would at lower speeds because of time dilation.\n\nNow, to calculate the time from the astronaut's frame of reference, I should use the formula for time dilation in special relativity. The formula is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( t' \\) is the proper time (the time measured by the astronaut), \\( t \\) is the coordinate time (the time measured by someone stationary), and \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nFirst, I need to find \\( \\gamma \\) for the given speed.\n\nGiven that \\( v = 0.99999987 c \\), let's calculate \\( \\gamma \\).\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2}} \\]\n\nLet me compute \\( \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\left(0.99999987\\right)^2 = 0.99999974000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
