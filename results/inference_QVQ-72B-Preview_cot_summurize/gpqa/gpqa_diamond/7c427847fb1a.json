                    "text": "So I have this problem about a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each of which can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3), and I need to find the partition function Z. The options are given in terms of \u03b2 = 1/(kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the partition function is. In statistical mechanics, the partition function Z for a system is defined as the sum over all possible states of the system of e^{-\u03b2E}, where E is the energy of the state. So, Z = \u03a3 e^{-\u03b2E} over all possible configurations of the system.\n\nIn this case, the system consists of three spins, each with two possible states: +1 and -1. So, the total number of possible configurations is 2^3 = 8.\n\nI need to list all 8 possible configurations of S1, S2, and S3, calculate the energy for each configuration using the given energy formula, and then sum up e^{-\u03b2E} for each configuration.\n\nLet's list the configurations:\n\n1. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n\n2. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n\n3. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n\n4. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n\n5. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n\n6. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n\n7. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n\n8. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n\nNow, for each configuration, I need to compute E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet's compute E for each:\n\n1. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n\nE1 = -J(+1 * +1 + +1 * +1 + +1 * +1) = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n2. S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n\nE2 = -J(+1 * +1 + +1 * -1 + +1 * -1) = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n3. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n\nE3 = -J(+1 * -1 + +1 * +1 + -1 * +1) = -J(-1 + 1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n4. S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n\nE4 = -J(+1 * -1 + +1 * -1 + -1 * -1) = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n5. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n\nE5 = -J(-1 * +1 + -1 * +1 + +1 * +1) = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n6. S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1\n\nE6 = -J(-1 * +1 + -1 * -1 + +1 * -1) = -J(-1 +1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n7. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1\n\nE7 = -J(-1 * -1 + -1 * +1 + -1 * +1) = -J(1 -1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n8. S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n\nE8 = -J(-1 * -1 + -1 * -1 + -1 * -1) = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\nSo, the energies are:\n\nConfiguration 1: -3J\n\nConfigurations 2 through 7: J\n\nConfiguration 8: -3J\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum over all configurations of e^{-\u03b2E}.\n\nSo, Z = e^{-\u03b2(-3J)} + 6e^{-\u03b2(J)} + e^{-\u03b2(-3J)} = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\nWe have two configurations with E = -3J, and six with E = J.\n\nSo, Z = 2e^{-\u03b2(-3J)} + 6e^{-\u03b2(J)} = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this exactly. Let's see:\n\nOption C: 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6e^{-J\u03b2}, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there's a different approach or if I made a mistake in calculating the energies.\n\nLet me double-check the energy calculations for each configuration.\n\n1. All spins +1: S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = 1, S2S3 = 1 \u2192 E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 E = -J(1 -1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 E = -J(-1 +1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 E = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 \u2192 E = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 E = -J(-1 +1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 \u2192 E = -J(1 -1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\n8. All spins -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 \u2192 E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n\nYes, so two configurations have E = -3J, and six have E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2e^{-\u03b2(-3J)} + 6e^{-\u03b2(J)} = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nSo, the correct option should be C: Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6e^{-J\u03b2}\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't a mistake here. Maybe I should consider if there are more configurations with E = -3J.\n\nWait, in my earlier count, configurations 1 and 8 have E = -3J, and the rest have E = J. Is that correct?\n\nLet me verify configuration 1: S1=S2=S3=+1\n\nE = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1) = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n\nConfiguration 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(1*1 + 1*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J(1 -1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J(1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*1) = -J(-1 +1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(1*(-1) + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J((-1)*1 + (-1)*1 + 1*1) = -J(-1 -1 +1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J((-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) + 1*(-1)) = -J(-1 +1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*1 + (-1)*1) = -J(1 -1 -1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nConfiguration 8: S1=S2=S3=-1\n\nE = -J((-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)) = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\n\nYes, so indeed, only configurations 1 and 8 have E = -3J, and the rest have E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the properties of spin systems or Ising models.\n\nThis looks like a simple Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions. The Hamiltonian is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nIn Ising models, the partition function can sometimes be calculated using recursion relations or by grouping terms.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is small (only three spins), it's feasible to enumerate all configurations, which is what I did.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to group the configurations to see the factor of 2 and 6 more clearly.\n\nLet me think about the number of configurations where E = -3J. These are the ones where all three pairwise interactions S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3 are positive, which happens when all spins are aligned, i.e., all +1 or all -1. So, indeed, only two configurations have E = -3J.\n\nFor E = J, there are six configurations where one interaction is negative and two are positive, or vice versa. But in this specific Hamiltonian, it's only positive when exactly one of the three products S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 is positive, which seems to correspond to having an odd number of -1 spins.\n\nWait, in configuration 2: +1, +1, -1 \u2192 two +1 and one -1\n\nSimilarly, configurations 3 to 7 have one or three spins being -1, which makes E = J.\n\nConfiguration 1 and 8 have all spins the same, so E = -3J.\n\nTherefore, yes, two configurations with E = -3J and six with E = J.\n\nThus, Z = 2e^{3\u03b2J} + 6e^{-\u03b2J}, which matches option C.\n\nBut let's check if there's a possible confusion with the signs.\n\nIn the Hamiltonian, E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nSo, when S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is maximized, E is minimized (most negative), which corresponds to the lowest energy state.\n\nIn my calculations, E = -3J for all spins aligned, which is the lowest energy, and E = J for the other configurations.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: Z = 2 e^{3J\u03b2} + 6e^{-J\u03b2}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
