                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have particles colliding at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These new particles produced are ultra-relativistic, meaning they're moving at speeds very close to the speed of light, and they have a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector.\n\nThe question is asking for the Lorentz factor needed to have approximately two thirds of these particles reaching the detector's inner walls. The options provided are 40, 54, 28, and 68.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a Lorentz factor is. The Lorentz factor, often denoted by \u03b3 (gamma), is a measure of how much an object's time is dilated or its length is contracted due to its high velocity relative to an observer. It's defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the object,\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nGiven that the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity \\(v\\) is extremely close to \\(c\\), which makes \u03b3 quite large.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that these particles are fast-decaying. That probably means they have a certain lifetime, \u03c4, in their rest frame, and due to time dilation, their observed lifetime in the detector's frame is \u03b3\u03c4.\n\nThe key here is to relate the Lorentz factor to the fraction of particles that reach the detector's inner walls. Since the particles are decaying, some will decay before reaching the walls, while others will make it.\n\nLet's think about the scenario where one third of the particles reach the walls with \u03b3 = 20.\n\nWe need to find the \u03b3 that would increase this fraction to two thirds.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distance these particles have to travel to reach the detector's inner walls. Since the detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters, the maximum distance a particle would have to travel is 30 meters (straight to the wall), but actually, depending on the direction, it could be less or more. However, for simplicity, let's assume that the particles are emitted isotropically, and the average distance to the wall is related to the radius.\n\nBut to make this problem tractable, perhaps we can consider the straight-line distance from the center to the wall, which is 30 meters, and calculate the time it takes for the particle to travel this distance and compare it to its decay lifetime.\n\nGiven that the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately \\(c\\), so the time to reach the wall is:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d}{v} \\approx \\frac{30 \\text{ m}}{c}\n\\]\n\nIn the particle's rest frame, the decay time is \u03c4, but in the detector's frame, it's \u03b3\u03c4.\n\nSo, the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is the probability that its decay occurs within time t.\n\nTherefore, the survival probability, i.e., the probability that the particle reaches the wall without decaying, is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{survival}} = e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau)}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this seems off because in the detector's frame, the particle's decay time is \u03b3\u03c4, and the time to reach the wall is t. So, the probability of surviving the trip to the wall should be:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{survival}} = e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau)}\n\\]\n\nBut actually, the decay rate in the detector's frame is \\(1 / (\\gamma \\tau)\\), so the probability of decaying in time t is \\(1 - e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau)}\\), and the survival probability is \\(e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau)}\\).\n\nHowever, the problem states that one third of the particles reach the wall when \u03b3 = 20, and we need to find \u03b3 such that two thirds reach the wall.\n\nLet's set up an equation using the survival probability.\n\nGiven that the fraction of particles reaching the wall is \\(P_{\\text{survival}}\\), and we know that when \u03b3 = 20, \\(P_{\\text{survival}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\), we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{c \\gamma \\tau}}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, we need to find \u03b3 such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{c \\gamma \\tau}}\n\\]\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{c \\cdot 20 \\cdot \\tau}}\\)\n\n2. \\(\\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{c \\gamma \\cdot \\tau}}\\)\n\nWe can solve the first equation for \u03c4 and then plug it into the second equation to solve for \u03b3.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{20 c \\tau}}\n\\]\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{30}{20 c \\tau}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-\\ln(3) = -\\frac{30}{20 c \\tau}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\ln(3) = \\frac{30}{20 c \\tau}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{30}{20 c \\ln(3)}\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this expression for \u03c4 into equation 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30}{c \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{30}{20 c \\ln(3)}}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\\frac{30 \\cdot 20 \\ln(3)}{30 c \\gamma}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = e^{-\\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{c \\gamma}}\n\\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the relationship between the survival probability and the Lorentz factor.\n\nGiven that the survival probability is \\(P_{\\text{survival}} = e^{-t / (\\gamma \\tau)}\\), and we know that when \u03b3 = 20, \\(P_{\\text{survival}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\), and we want to find \u03b3 such that \\(P_{\\text{survival}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nLet's denote \\(P_1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) at \u03b3 = \u03b3\u2081 = 20, and \\(P_2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\) at \u03b3 = \u03b3\u2082.\n\nWe can set up a ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{e^{-t / (\\gamma_1 \\tau)}}{e^{-t / (\\gamma_2 \\tau)}} = e^{-t / \\gamma_1 \\tau + t / \\gamma_2 \\tau} = e^{t / \\gamma_2 \\tau - t / \\gamma_1 \\tau}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(P_1 / P_2 = \\frac{1/3}{2/3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = e^{t / \\gamma_2 \\tau - t / \\gamma_1 \\tau} = e^{t (\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2 \\tau} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 \\tau})} = e^{t / \\tau (\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1})}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2) = t / \\tau (\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1})\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t / \\tau} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{30 / (c \\tau)} = -\\frac{\\ln(2) c \\tau}{30}\n\\]\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{30}{20 c \\ln(3)}\n\\]\n\nPlugging this in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{20} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{30} \\cdot c \\cdot \\frac{30}{20 c \\ln(3)} = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{20 \\ln(3)}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{20 \\ln(3)} = \\frac{\\ln(3) - \\ln(2)}{20 \\ln(3)} = \\frac{\\ln(3/2)}{20 \\ln(3)}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 = \\frac{20 \\ln(3)}{\\ln(3/2)}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute this numerically.\n\nFirst, calculate ln(3) and ln(2):\n\nln(3) \u2248 1.098612\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.693147\n\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) \u2248 1.098612 - 0.693147 = 0.405465\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_2 = \\frac{20 \\times 1.098612}{0.405465} \\approx \\frac{21.97224}{0.405465} \\approx 54.19\n\\]\n\nSo, the Lorentz factor needed is approximately 54.19, which rounds to 54.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 40\n\nB. 54\n\nC. 28\n\nD. 68\n\nThe closest option is B. 54.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
