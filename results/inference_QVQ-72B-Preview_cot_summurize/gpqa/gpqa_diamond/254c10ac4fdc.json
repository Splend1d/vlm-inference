                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e, and negligible mass. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, expressed in Joules and correct to three decimal places.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[ U = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately \\(8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{C}^2\\).\n\n- \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the magnitudes of the charges.\n\n- \\(r\\) is the distance between the charges.\n\nIn this problem, all charges are identical and have a charge of \\(2e\\), where \\(e\\) is the elementary charge, approximately \\(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}\\).\n\nSo, each charge has:\n\n\\[ q = 2e = 2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nNow, we have 12 charges at 2 meters from point P, and one charge fixed at P. I need to calculate the total potential energy of this system.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrangement. The 12 charges are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from P, so they are located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters centered at P.\n\nThe energy of the system will include the potential energy between:\n\n1. Each pair of the 12 charges at 2 meters from P.\n\n2. Each of the 12 charges and the charge at P.\n\n3. The potential energy of the 12 charges among themselves.\n\nWait, actually, the system consists of 13 charges: 12 at 2 meters from P and one at P. So, I need to calculate the total potential energy between all unique pairs of these charges.\n\nBut, since all 12 charges are at the same distance from P, and they are all identical, there might be some symmetry that can simplify the calculation.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFirst, consider the potential energy between the charge at P and each of the 12 charges at 2 meters:\n\n\\[ U_{P-to-each} = k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\(r = 2\\) meters.\n\nSo, the total potential energy due to interactions between P and the 12 charges is:\n\n\\[ U_{P-to-12} = 12 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nNow, we need to consider the potential energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.\n\nThe total potential energy for a system of \\(n\\) charges is:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i < j} k \\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}} \\]\n\nIn this case, all \\(q_i = q\\), so:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i < j} k \\frac{q^2}{r_{ij}} \\]\n\nBut since all 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distances between them vary. Calculating the exact potential energy would require knowing the exact positions of these charges on the sphere.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the system is isolated and we're to find the minimum energy, perhaps there's a way to find the configuration that minimizes the potential energy.\n\nThe minimum energy configuration for multiple charges on a sphere is when they are as far apart as possible, which is the Thomson problem, but solving that exactly for 12 charges is complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approximate the potential energy of the 12 charges by considering them as a uniform charge distribution on the sphere, but that might not be accurate for a small number of charges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can treat the 12 charges as a single effective charge at P, but that doesn't seem right because they are distributed on the sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since all charges are identical and repel each other, the potential energy between any two of them is \\(k \\frac{q^2}{r}\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance between them.\n\nBut since the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, their positions are fixed relative to P, but relative to each other, their distances vary.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should consider the potential energy due to the interactions between P and the 12 charges, and then add the potential energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges.\n\nFirst part: P to each of the 12 charges.\n\nAs calculated earlier:\n\n\\[ U_{P-to-12} = 12 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} = 12 \\times k \\frac{(3.204 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{2} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, \\( q^2 = (3.204 \\times 10^{-19})^2 = 10.24 \\times (10^{-19})^2 = 10.24 \\times 10^{-38} = 1.024 \\times 10^{-37} \\, \\text{C}^2 \\)\n\nThen, \\( k = 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ U_{P-to-12} = 12 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{1.024 \\times 10^{-37}}{2} \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\times 1.024 \\times 10^{-37} = 8.98755 \\times 1.024 \\times 10^{9 + (-37)} = 9.22 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nThen, divide by 2: \\( 9.22 \\times 10^{-28} / 2 = 4.61 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 12: \\( 12 \\times 4.61 \\times 10^{-28} = 55.32 \\times 10^{-28} = 5.532 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nSo, \\( U_{P-to-12} = 5.532 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nNow, for the second part: the potential energy among the 12 charges themselves.\n\nThis is more complicated because the distances between the charges vary depending on their positions on the sphere.\n\nAssuming that the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which would be the case for an isolated system, they would distribute themselves as uniformly as possible on the sphere.\n\nThe exact calculation of this part would require knowing the pairwise distances between the 12 charges and summing up the potential energies accordingly.\n\nThis seems too involved for this problem. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the potential energy of the 12 charges as a combination of their interactions, using the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges.\n\nBut still, without specific positions, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the potential energy of one charge due to the other 11, and then sum over all charges.\n\nBut that would be similar to what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the 12 charges as forming a regular polyhedron on the sphere, such as an icosahedron, which is known to distribute points uniformly on a sphere.\n\nFor 12 points, the regular icosahedron is a good approximation.\n\nIn a regular icosahedron, each vertex is connected to 5 others, and the bond angles are approximately 60\u00b0 and 108\u00b0.\n\nThe distances between the charges can be categorized into different shell distances.\n\nBut calculating this precisely is beyond my current means.\n\nPerhaps I need to make an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges on a sphere.\n\nI recall that for \\(n\\) charges on a sphere of radius \\(r\\), the total potential energy can be approximated by:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nWait, that seems too simplistic. It treats all pairwise interactions as if they are at distance \\(r\\), which isn't the case since charges are distributed on the sphere.\n\nThis might give an overestimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for charges on a sphere, the average distance can be used, but I don't know what that average distance is for 12 charges.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the total potential energy of the system as the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges.\n\nSo, the total potential energy \\(U_{\\text{total}}\\) is:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i < j} k \\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}} \\]\n\nGiven that all \\(q_i = q\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r_{\\text{avg}}} \\]\n\nBut I don't know \\(r_{\\text{avg}}\\), the average distance between charges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the potential energy by considering the interactions in parts.\n\nFirst, the potential energy between P and each of the 12 charges, which we already calculated as \\(5.532 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nThen, the potential energy among the 12 charges themselves.\n\nFor the 12 charges on the sphere, perhaps I can consider their mutual potential energy.\n\nI found a reference that for \\(n\\) identical charges on a sphere of radius \\(r\\), the mutual potential energy is approximately:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nBut I suspect this is an overestimate because not all pairs are at distance \\(r\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy can be approximated by:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r_{\\text{eff}}} \\]\n\nWhere \\(r_{\\text{eff}}\\) is some effective average distance between charges.\n\nFor a sphere, the average distance between two points can be calculated, but I don't know the exact value for 12 points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the potential energy of a uniformly charged sphere, but since the charges are discrete points, that might not be accurate.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the approximation and see what I get.\n\nSo, let's assume that the mutual potential energy among the 12 charges is:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} = 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{2} \\]\n\nWait, no. Let's recalculate:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} = 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{2} \\]\n\nWait, that seems off. Let's check the formula.\n\nThe number of unique pairs in 12 charges is \\(\\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} = 66\\), and each pair has potential energy \\(k \\frac{q^2}{r}\\), assuming all pairs are at distance \\(r\\), which they are not.\n\nBut in reality, the distances vary, so this is an overestimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the potential energy per pair and multiply by the number of pairs, but use an average distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the potential energy between P and the 12 charges, and then add the potential energy of the 12 charges among themselves, assuming they are at an average distance.\n\nBut this seems too hand-wavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat the 12 charges as a single charge at the center, but since they are distributed on the sphere, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the potential energy due to the interactions between P and the 12 charges, and then add the potential energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges, assuming they are at an average distance.\n\nBut I don't know the average distance between the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the electrostatic energy of a uniformly charged sphere, but since the charges are discrete points, that might not be accurate.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the approximation and see what I get.\n\nSo, let's assume that the mutual potential energy among the 12 charges is approximately:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} = 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{2} \\]\n\nWait, no. Let's recalculate:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{12 \\times 11}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} = 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nBut this assumes all pairs are at distance \\(r\\), which they are not.\n\nThis is clearly an overestimate because the actual distances between the charges on the sphere vary, and some pairs are closer together, while others are farther apart.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the potential energy of a system of charges on a sphere.\n\nI found a reference that for \\(n\\) identical charges on a sphere of radius \\(r\\), the mutual potential energy is:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nBut again, this seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the average distance between two charges on a sphere is less than \\(r\\), so the actual mutual potential energy would be greater than the above expression.\n\nWait, no. If the average distance is less than \\(r\\), then \\(1/r_{\\text{avg}}\\) is greater than \\(1/r\\), so the potential energy would be greater.\n\nBut in reality, since some pairs are closer and some are farther, the average potential energy might be higher or lower depending on the distribution.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the approximation and see what I get.\n\nSo, let's assume that the mutual potential energy among the 12 charges is:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{mutual}} = 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nThen, the total potential energy of the system would be:\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = U_{P-to-12} + U_{\\text{mutual}} \\]\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = 12 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} + 66 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = 78 \\times k \\frac{q^2}{r} \\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ q = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\n\\[ r = 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ k = 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = 78 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{(3.204 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( q^2 \\):\n\n\\[ q^2 = (3.204 \\times 10^{-19})^2 = 10.24 \\times (10^{-19})^2 = 10.24 \\times 10^{-38} = 1.024 \\times 10^{-37} \\, \\text{C}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ U_{\\text{total}} = 78 \\times 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\times \\frac{1.024 \\times 10^{-37}}{2} \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, \\( 8.98755 \\times 10^9 \\times 1.024 \\times 10^{-37} = 8.98755 \\times 1.024 \\times 10^{9 + (-37)} = 9.22 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nThen, divide by 2: \\( 9.22 \\times 10^{-28} / 2 = 4.61 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 78: \\( 78 \\times 4.61 \\times 10^{-28} = 360.58 \\times 10^{-28} = 3.6058 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J} \\)\n\nSo, according to this approximation, the total potential energy is approximately \\(3.6058 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nBut looking back"
