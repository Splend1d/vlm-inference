                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, both detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same minimum masses, but different orbital periods: Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both planets have circular orbits. The host stars have different masses but the same radii. We need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting its star, based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what determines the transit probability of a planet. I know that the transit probability is related to the geometry of the system, specifically the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the transit probability is generally given by:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{transit}} = \\frac{R_*}{a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin(i)} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( R_* \\) is the radius of the star,\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit,\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince both planets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis \\( a \\) is equal to the orbital radius. Also, for circular orbits, the transit probability is maximized when the orbit is edge-on, i.e., \\( i = 90^\\circ \\). However, in reality, the inclination is a random angle between 0 and 180 degrees, so the probability involves the solid angle.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this. Since both planets are detected via RV, and their minimum masses are known, which are equal, but their periods differ by a factor of three, with Planet_1 having a shorter period.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the orbital period relates to the semi-major axis. According to Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ a^3 = G M_* P^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis,\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\( M_* \\) is the mass of the star,\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period.\n\nWait, actually, the exact form depends on the units, but in the standard SI units, it's:\n\n\\[ a = \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nBut for our purposes, the key point is that \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\) for a given stellar mass.\n\nBut here, the stellar masses are different: the star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star of Planet_2. So, to find the ratio of semi-major axes, we need to account for both the period and stellar mass differences.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( P_1 = P \\) (orbital period of Planet_1),\n\n- \\( P_2 = 3P \\) (orbital period of Planet_2),\n\n- \\( M_{*1} = 2 M_{*2} \\) (star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star of Planet_2),\n\n- \\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \\) (both stars have the same radius).\n\nWe need to find the ratio of transit probabilities \\( P_{\\text{transit,1}} / P_{\\text{transit,2}} \\).\n\nFrom the transit probability formula, \\( P_{\\text{transit}} \\propto R_* / a \\), assuming \\( i \\) is the same for both (though inclinations might differ).\n\nWait, actually, the inclination is a random variable, and the probability depends on the geometry of the system.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the transit probability in terms of the impact parameter.\n\nThe transit occurs if the impact parameter \\( b \\) is less than the stellar radius \\( R_* \\), where:\n\n\\[ b = a \\cos(i) \\]\n\nThe probability that \\( b < R_* \\) is:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{transit}} = \\frac{R_*}{a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sin(i)} \\]\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets have the same minimum mass and circular orbits, perhaps we can use the fact that the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis.\n\nBut wait, the semi-major axis depends on both the stellar mass and the orbital period.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law, \\( a \\propto M_*^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\).\n\nGiven that Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2, and its star has twice the mass, we can express the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( a_1 = \\left( \\frac{G M_{*1} P_1^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\)\n\n- \\( a_2 = \\left( \\frac{G M_{*2} P_2^2}{4 \\pi^2} } \\right)^{1/3} \\)\n\nGiven \\( M_{*1} = 2 M_{*2} \\) and \\( P_2 = 3 P_1 \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{*1}}{M_{*2}} \\right)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2} \\right)^{1/3} = (2)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{9} \\right)^{1/3} = 2^{1/3} \\times 9^{-1/3} = (2/9)^{1/3} \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recast this.\n\nGiven \\( a \\propto M_*^{1/3} P^{2/3} \\), then:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{*1}}{M_{*2}} \\right)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} = \\left( 2 \\right)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{2/3} = 2^{1/3} \\times 3^{-2/3} = (2/3^2)^{1/3} = (2/9)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSo, \\( a_1 / a_2 = (2/9)^{1/3} \\)\n\nNow, the transit probability is \\( P_{\\text{transit}} = R_* / a \\), assuming the same \\( R_* \\) for both stars.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of transit probabilities is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_{\\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\\text{transit,2}}} = \\frac{R_{*1}/a_1}{R_{*2}/a_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{9}{2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{9}{2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx (4.5)^{1/3} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator, \\( 4.5^{1/3} \\approx 1.65 \\)\n\nSo, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nB. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the relationship between semi-major axis, stellar mass, and period:\n\n\\[ a = \\left( \\frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nGiven that, the ratio is correct: \\( a_1 / a_2 = \\left( \\frac{M_{*1}}{M_{*2}} \\right)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} = 2^{1/3} \\times (1/3)^{2/3} = (2/9)^{1/3} \\)\n\nThen, since \\( P_{\\text{transit}} \\propto 1/a \\), the ratio of probabilities is \\( a_2 / a_1 = (9/2)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65 \\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both stars have the same radius, and the transit probability is \\( R_* / a \\), and given the ratio of \\( a \\)'s, the conclusion holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting, approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Planet\\_1 is preferred due to its } \\sim1.65 \\text{ times higher probability to transit.}} \\]"
