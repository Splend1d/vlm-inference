                    "text": "So I have this problem about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B. I need to find the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation before and after the magnetic field is switched. Initially, the particle is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction, so its spin is along Z, and its magnetic moment is \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\). When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the particle's magnetic moment will precess around the new magnetic field direction.\n\nI recall that in quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment of a spin 1/2 particle interacts with a magnetic field via the Hamiltonian \\(H = -\\mu \\cdot B\\). Given that \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\), and the new magnetic field is along the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \\(H = -\\gamma S_z B_y\\).\n\nWait, but the magnetic field is along the Y direction, so \\(B_y = B\\), and \\(B_z = 0\\). Therefore, \\(H = -\\gamma S_z B\\). But hold on, if the field is along Y, and \\(\\mu\\) is along Z, their dot product should be \\(\\mu_z B_y\\), which is \\(\\gamma S_z B\\). So, \\(H = -\\gamma S_z B_y = -\\gamma S_z B\\).\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because typically, in the presence of a magnetic field along Y, the Hamiltonian should involve \\(S_y\\), not \\(S_z\\). Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the time evolution of the particle's state after the magnetic field is switched to the Y direction. The magnetic moment will precess around the Y axis due to the new magnetic field.\n\nThe equation of motion for the magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by the torque equation: \\(\\tau = \\mu \\times B\\). In terms of angular frequency, the precession frequency is \\(\\omega = \\gamma B\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with quantum mechanics, I should use the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation to find the evolution of the state vector.\n\nInitially, the particle is in the eigenstate of \\(S_z\\), say \\(|+\\rangle\\), corresponding to spin up along Z. When the magnetic field is switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \\(H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma S_z B_y\\). But since \\(B_y = B\\), \\(H = -\\gamma S_z B\\).\n\nWait, but in quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment interaction Hamiltonian is indeed \\(H = -\\mu \\cdot B\\), but for a spin 1/2 particle, \\(\\mu = -\\gamma S\\), where \\(S\\) is the spin operator. So actually, \\(H = \\gamma S \\cdot B\\).\n\nIn this problem, it's given that \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\), which might be a typo or specific to the context. Typically, \\(\\mu = -\\gamma S\\), where \\(S\\) is the spin operator vector.\n\nLet me assume standard conventions. For a spin 1/2 particle, the magnetic moment is \\(\\mu = -\\gamma S\\), where \\(S = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) are the Pauli matrices.\n\nGiven that, the Hamiltonian is \\(H = -\\mu \\cdot B = \\gamma S \\cdot B\\). With \\(B\\) along the Y direction, \\(H = \\gamma S_y B\\).\n\nNow, the eigenstates of \\(S_y\\) are \\(|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle + i|\\downarrow\\rangle)\\) and \\(|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle - i|\\downarrow\\rangle)\\), with eigenvalues \\(\\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\).\n\nInitially, the particle is in the eigenstate of \\(S_z\\), say \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\), corresponding to spin up along Z.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is switched to the Y direction, the Hamiltonian is \\(H = \\gamma S_y B\\), so the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is \\(i \\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} |\\psi(t)\\rangle = H |\\psi(t)\\rangle\\).\n\nGiven that, the state evolves as \\(|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i H t / \\hbar} |\\psi(0)\\rangle\\).\n\nExpressed in the \\(S_y\\) eigenbasis, \\(|\\psi(0)\\rangle = a |+\\rangle + b |-\\rangle\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coefficients determined by the initial state.\n\nFirst, express \\(|\\uparrow\\rangle\\) in terms of \\(|+\\rangle\\) and \\(|-\\rangle\\):\n\n\\( |\\uparrow\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|+\\rangle + |-\\rangle) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\(a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), \\(b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\nThen, the state evolves as:\n\n\\( |\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i \\gamma S_y B t / \\hbar} (a |+\\rangle + b |-\\rangle) \\).\n\nSince \\(S_y\\) is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates evolve with phases corresponding to their eigenenergies.\n\nThe eigenenergies are \\(E_+ = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{2} B\\) and \\(E_- = -\\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{2} B\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-i E_+ t / \\hbar} |+\\rangle + e^{-i E_- t / \\hbar} |-\\rangle\\), with \\(a = b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, since \\(H = \\gamma S_y B\\), and \\(S_y |+\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |+\\rangle\\), \\(S_y |-\\rangle = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} |-\\rangle\\), the eigenstates evolve as:\n\n\\( |\\psi(t)\\rangle = a e^{-i E_+ t / \\hbar} |+\\rangle + b e^{-i E_- t / \\hbar} |-\\rangle \\).\n\nGiven that, the expectation value of \\(S_z\\) is:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t)rangle\\).\n\nExpressed in terms of \\(|+\\rangle\\) and \\(|-\\rangle\\), \\(S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (|+\\rangle\\langle +| - |-\\rangle\\langle -|)\\).\n\nSubstituting, we get:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( |a|^2 e^{-i (E_+ - E_-) t / \\hbar} - |b|^2 e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t / \\hbar} \\right)\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's compute it properly.\n\nFirst, express \\(S_z\\) in the \\(S_y\\) basis:\n\n\\( S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (|+\\rangle\\langle +| - |-\\rangle\\langle -|) \\).\n\nThen, \\(\\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle = \\left( a e^{-i E_+ t / \\hbar} \\langle + | + b e^{-i E_- t / \\hbar} \\langle - | \\right) S_z \\left( a e^{-i E_+ t / \\hbar} | + \\rangle + b e^{-i E_- t / \\hbar} | - \\rangle \\right)\\).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( |a|^2 e^{-i (E_+ - E_-) t / \\hbar} + |b|^2 e^{i (E_+ - E_-) t / \\hbar} \\right)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(E_+ - E_- = \\gamma \\hbar B\\), this becomes:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( |a|^2 e^{-i \\gamma \\hbar B t / \\hbar} + |b|^2 e^{i \\gamma B t / \\hbar} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( |a|^2 e^{-i \\gamma B t} + |b|^2 e^{i \\gamma B t} \\right)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(|a|^2 = |b|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} e^{-i \\gamma B t} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{i \\gamma B t} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with frequency \\(\\omega = \\gamma B\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is \\(\\gamma B\\). However, looking back at the options, they are:\n\nA. gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nB. gamma*B/2\n\nC. gamma*B\n\nD. sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nOption C seems to be \\(\\gamma B\\), which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any factor I might have missed.\n\nFirst, the Hamiltonian is \\(H = \\gamma S_y B\\), with eigenenergies \\(E_+ = \\gamma \\hbar B / 2\\) and \\(E_- = -\\gamma \\hbar B / 2\\).\n\nThe time evolution of the state is:\n\n\\( |\\psi(t)\\rangle = a e^{-i E_+ t / \\hbar} |+\\rangle + b e^{-i E_- t / \\hbar} |-\\rangle \\).\n\nThe expectation value of \\(S_z\\) is:\n\n\\(\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | S_z | \\psi(t) \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (|a|^2 e^{-i \\gamma B t} + |b|^2 e^{i \\gamma B t})\\).\n\nGiven \\(|a|^2 = |b|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\), this indeed simplifies to \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\\), which oscillates at frequency \\(\\gamma B\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: gamma*B.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because the problem mentions that both fields have the same magnitude B, but since the field is switched instantly from Z to Y direction, and assuming no transients during the switch, my calculation suggests that the frequency is \\(\\gamma B\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a factor considering the geometry or the sudden switch that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider the Larmor precession frequency, which is \\(\\omega_L = \\gamma B\\), which matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. gamma*B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
