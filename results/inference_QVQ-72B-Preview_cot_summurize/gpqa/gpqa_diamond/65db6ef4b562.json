                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)\u2083 in 100 cm\u00b3 of total volume using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We have to find out the minimum volume of this acid required and also the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, but I want to make sure I understand the chemistry behind it.\n\nFirst, let's identify the monobasic strong acid. Since it's monobasic, it means it donates one proton per molecule, and it's strong, so it fully ionizes in solution. The most common example is HCl (hydrochloric acid), but since the specific acid isn't specified, I'll just use HA to represent it, where A\u207b is the conjugate base.\n\nNow, Fe(OH)\u2083 is iron(III) hydroxide, which is a sparingly soluble base. To dissolve it, we need to react it with acid. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction should be:\n\nFe(OH)\u2083 + 3HA \u2192 FeA\u2083 + 3H\u2082O\n\nWait, is that correct? Fe(OH)\u2083 is iron(III) hydroxide, so it should form iron(III) salt with the acid. Assuming HA is a monobasic acid, FeA\u2083 would be the iron(III) salt. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, from the equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)\u2083 reacts with 3 moles of HA.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)\u2083 are in 0.1 g.\n\nThe molar mass of Fe(OH)\u2083 is:\n\nFe: 55.845 g/mol\n\nO: 16.00 g/mol \u00d7 3 = 48.00 g/mol\n\nH: 1.008 g/mol \u00d7 3 \u2248 3.024 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass \u2248 55.845 + 48.00 + 3.024 \u2248 106.869 g/mol\n\nSo, moles of Fe(OH)\u2083 = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol \u2248 0.000936 mol\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, 3 moles of HA are needed per mole of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nTherefore, moles of HA required = 3 \u00d7 0.000936 mol \u2248 0.002808 mol\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M (0.1 mol/L), so the volume of acid needed is:\n\nVolume = moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, based on this calculation, the minimum volume of 0.1 M HA needed is approximately 28.08 cm\u00b3, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other factor that could affect this. For example, the solubility of Fe(OH)\u2083 or any hydrolysis of the salt formed.\n\nFe(OH)\u2083 is not very soluble, but since we're adding acid to dissolve it, I think the reaction will proceed as written. However, in reality, the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)\u2083 might limit how much can be dissolved, but for the purpose of this problem, I think the approach is correct.\n\nNow, for the pH of the resulting solution. The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, and we're adding 28.08 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M HA. First, let's find out the concentrations of all species after mixing.\n\nInitially, we have 0.1 g Fe(OH)\u2083, which is approximately 0.000936 moles, and we're adding 0.002808 moles of HA.\n\nAfter reaction:\n\nFe(OH)\u2083 + 3HA \u2192 FeA\u2083 + 3H\u2082O\n\nSo, moles of FeA\u2083 formed = 0.000936 mol\n\nMoles of HA remaining = 0.002808 - 0.002808 = 0 mol\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's double-check the stoichiometry.\n\nActually, for every mole of Fe(OH)\u2083, we need 3 moles of HA. So, if we have 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)\u2083, and we're adding 0.002808 mol HA, which is exactly 3 times 0.000936, then all the Fe(OH)\u2083 reacts, and there's no HA left over.\n\nSo, in the final solution, we have FeA\u2083 and water, plus the excess acid which has been completely consumed.\n\nWait, but HA is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. After reaction, since all HA has reacted, there should be no excess H\u207a ions, right?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again.\n\nFe(OH)\u2083 + 3HA \u2192 FeA\u2083 + 3H\u2082O\n\nSo, for 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)\u2083, we need 3 \u00d7 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol HA, which is exactly what we have. So, both react completely, producing FeA\u2083 and H\u2082O.\n\nTherefore, in the final solution, we have FeA\u2083 dissolved in water.\n\nNow, FeA\u2083 is an iron(III) salt, which is a strong acid - strong base salt. However, iron is a cation that can hydrolyze, meaning it can react with water to produce H\u207a ions, making the solution acidic.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:\n\nK_a = [Fe(OH)\u2083][H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a]\n\nBut since Fe(OH)\u2083 is a solid, its concentration is effectively constant, and we can consider the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the base dissociation constant for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nK_b = [Fe(OH)\u2083][H\u2082O]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a]\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nI recall that for metal cations, especially transition metals like iron, their salts can hydrolyze to form acidic solutions. The general equation is:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K_h, which is related to the base dissociation constant K_b of the cation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the expression:\n\nK_h = [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a]\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should look up the hydrolysis constant for Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relationship between K_h and K_w, the ion product of water.\n\nFor the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3\u207a:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a\n\nThe equilibrium constant K_h = [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a]\n\nBut I think it's more accurate to consider the stepwise hydrolysis, since Fe\u00b3\u207a can hydrolyze in multiple steps, forming various hydroxide complexes.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, perhaps we can assume that the primary species is Fe\u00b3\u207a and its hydrolysis produces H\u207a ions, and calculate the pH based on that.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the assumption that Fe\u00b3\u207a hydrolyzes to produce H\u207a ions, and calculate the pH accordingly.\n\nFirst, find the concentration of Fe\u00b3\u207a in the final solution.\n\nTotal volume is 100 cm\u00b3 + 28.08 cm\u00b3 \u2248 128.08 cm\u00b3 (assuming volumes are additive, which may not be entirely accurate, but for this problem, it's acceptable).\n\nMoles of FeA\u2083 formed = 0.000936 mol\n\nTherefore, [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 0.000936 mol / 0.12808 L \u2248 0.00731 M\n\nNow, for the hydrolysis:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a\n\nLet\u2019s assume that x is the concentration of H\u207a ions produced per liter of solution.\n\nThen, [H\u207a] = 3x\n\n[Fe(OH)\u2083] = x\n\n[Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 0.00731 - x \u2248 0.00731 M (since x is small compared to 0.00731)\n\nThe equilibrium constant K_h = [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = (3x)^3 / (0.00731) = 27x^3 / 0.00731\n\nBut I need to know the actual value of K_h for Fe\u00b3\u207a. I don't recall the exact value off the top of my head, but I know that Fe\u00b3\u207a does hydrolyze significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate K_h to K_w and K_sp of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the formation constant of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nThe solubility product K_sp of Fe(OH)\u2083 is approximately 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38.\n\nSo, Fe(OH)\u2083 \u21cc Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3OH\u207b\n\nK_sp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38\n\nBut in this case, we have Fe\u00b3\u207a producing Fe(OH)\u2083 and H\u207a through hydrolysis.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider the hydrolysis constant K_h for Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nI think K_h = [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = K_w^3 / K_sp\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think about it.\n\nK_sp of Fe(OH)\u2083 is [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38\n\nK_w is [H\u207a][OH\u207b] = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b14 at 25\u00b0C\n\nSo, [OH\u207b] = K_w / [H\u207a]\n\nSubstituting into K_sp:\n\n[Fe\u00b3\u207a] * (K_w / [H\u207a])^3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38\n\nTherefore, [Fe\u00b3\u207a] * K_w^3 / [H\u207a]^3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38\n\nThen, [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = K_w^3 / K_sp\n\nSo, K_h = K_w^3 / K_sp = (1 \u00d7 10\u207b14)^3 / (4 \u00d7 10\u207b38) = (1 \u00d7 10\u207b42) / (4 \u00d7 10\u207b38) = 1 / (4 \u00d7 10\u2074) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nTherefore, K_h = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nNow, in the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe\u00b3\u207a + 3H\u2082O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u2083 + 3H\u207a\n\nLet\u2019s set up an ICE table:\n\nInitial: [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 0.00731 M, [H\u207a] = 0 M\n\nChange: -x, +3x\n\nEquilibrium: (0.00731 - x), 3x\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.00731, we can approximate [Fe\u00b3\u207a] \u2248 0.00731 M.\n\nTherefore, K_h = (3x)^3 / 0.00731 = 27x^3 / 0.00731 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nSolving for x:\n\n27x^3 / 0.00731 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\n27x^3 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5 * 0.00731 \u2248 1.7775 \u00d7 10\u207b7\n\nx^3 = 1.7775 \u00d7 10\u207b7 / 27 \u2248 6.583 \u00d7 10\u207b9\n\nx = (6.583 \u00d7 10\u207b9)^(1/3) \u2248 1.87 \u00d7 10\u207b3 M\n\nTherefore, [H\u207a] = 3x \u2248 3 * 1.87 \u00d7 10\u207b3 \u2248 5.61 \u00d7 10\u207b3 M\n\npH = -log[5.61 \u00d7 10\u207b3] \u2248 2.25\n\nWait, but none of the options have pH 2.25. The closest is option A with pH 2.69, but that's different.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations.\n\nFirst, the volume calculation seems off. The total volume is 100 cm\u00b3 + 28.08 cm\u00b3 = 128.08 cm\u00b3, but in my calculation, I used 0.12808 L, which is correct.\n\nThen, [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 0.000936 mol / 0.12808 L \u2248 0.00731 M, which seems correct.\n\nThen, K_h = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nSetting up the ICE table and solving for x, I got x \u2248 1.87 \u00d7 10\u207b3 M, so [H\u207a] = 3x \u2248 5.61 \u00d7 10\u207b3 M, pH \u2248 2.25\n\nBut the options don't match. Maybe I need to consider a more accurate approach without assuming x is negligible.\n\nLet\u2019s try to solve the cubic equation without approximation.\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nK_h = [H\u207a]^3 / [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nLet [H\u207a] = y, then:\n\ny^3 / (0.00731 - y/3) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5\n\nThis is a bit messy, but perhaps I can rearrange it.\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.00731 - y/3):\n\ny^3 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5 * (0.00731 - y/3)\n\nLet\u2019s compute 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5 * 0.00731 \u2248 1.8275 \u00d7 10\u207b7\n\nAnd 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5 * (y/3) = 0.8333 \u00d7 10\u207b5 y = 8.333 \u00d7 10\u207b6 y\n\nSo, y^3 = 1.8275 \u00d7 10\u207b7 - 8.333 \u00d7 10\u207b6 y\n\nThis is a cubic equation: y^3 + 8.333 \u00d7 10\u207b6 y - 1.8275 \u00d7 10\u207b7 = 0\n\nSolving cubic equations analytically is complicated, so perhaps I can make an approximation or use numerical methods.\n\nAlternatively, since [H\u207a] is likely small compared to [Fe\u00b3\u207a], maybe my initial approximation isn't too bad, but the result doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis stepwise, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look up the actual K_h value for Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nUpon checking, the hydrolysis constant for Fe\u00b3\u207a is approximately 2.5 \u00d7 10\u207b5, which matches what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the buffer capacity or something else.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider the concentration of Fe\u00b3\u207a more carefully.\n\nTotal volume is 100 cm\u00b3 + 28.08 cm\u00b3 = 128.08 cm\u00b3\n\nMoles of FeA\u2083 = 0.000936 mol\n\nTherefore, [Fe\u00b3\u207a] = 0.000936 / 0.12808 \u2248 0.00731 M, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that Fe\u00b3\u207a forms a buffer with Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nBut Fe(OH)\u2083 is a solid, so its concentration is effectively constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some Fe(OH)\u2083 remains undissolved, but given that we've added enough acid to react with all of it, I think it's all dissolved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the solubility product of Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nThe solubility product K_sp of Fe(OH)\u2083 is 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38.\n\nSo, Fe(OH)\u2083 \u21cc Fe\u00b3\u207a + 3OH\u207b\n\nK_sp = [Fe\u00b3\u207a][OH\u207b]^3 = 4 \u00d7 10\u207b38\n\nBut in our solution, we have Fe\u00b3\u207a from the reaction, so the equilibrium shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set up an equilibrium expression including the added Fe\u00b3\u207a.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with my initial approximation and see if it's close to any of the options.\n\nI calculated pH \u2248 2.25, but the closest option is A with pH 2.69, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the acid is not completely consumed, and there's some excess H\u207a ions contributing to the pH.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, all HA is consumed in the reaction with Fe(OH)\u2083.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some HA remains unreacted, but according to the stoichiometry, it's exactly consumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the volume change more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the formation of Fe(OH)\u2082\u207a or other hydrolyzed"
