                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about a star with dark spots affecting its effective temperature and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in different energy levels. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the star's effective temperature (Teff) and the presence of dark spots. The problem says that when the star has no spots, its Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. I need to find out how this temperature change affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels.\n\nThe problem also mentions that the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. It asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does have spots.\n\nGiven that the transition between these energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5, which is in the ultraviolet region, I might need to consider the energy corresponding to this wavelength to relate it to the atomic energy levels.\n\nAssuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the population of atomic energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels can be expressed using the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the energy difference between the levels and the temperature.\n\nFirst, I need to find the energy difference between level 1 and level 2. The energy corresponding to a photon of wavelength 1448 \u00c5 can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ E = h \\nu = h \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant\n\n- \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ E = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js}) \\times \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}}{1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8}}{1448 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\n\\[ E = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 2.072 \\times 10^{11} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-22} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nBut for atomic energy levels, it's more common to use electronvolts (eV), so I'll convert this energy:\n\n\\[ 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-22}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ E \\approx 8.61 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nNow, in LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N_2 \\) and \\( N_1 \\) are the populations in levels 2 and 1, respectively\n\n- \\( g_2 \\) and \\( g_1 \\) are the degeneracies of levels 2 and 1\n\n- \\( \\Delta E \\) is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1\n\n- \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant\n\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nAssuming that the degeneracies \\( g_2 \\) and \\( g_1 \\) are known, but since they're not provided, I'll consider them as constants for the purpose of finding the ratio change.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Since the temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K when spots are present, the ratio changes due to the change in temperature.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( R_{\\text{no spots}} = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\) at \\( T = 6000 \\) K\n\n- \\( R_{\\text{spots}} = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\) at \\( T = 5500 \\) K\n\nWe need to find the factor by which \\( R_{\\text{no spots}} \\) is larger than \\( R_{\\text{spots}} \\), i.e., \\( \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} \\).\n\nUsing the Boltzmann factor:\n\n\\[ R_{\\text{no spots}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 6000}} \\]\n\n\\[ R_{\\text{spots}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 5500}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the ratios is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 6000}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 5500}}} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} \\right)} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right)} \\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values. First, find \\( \\Delta E \\) in joules:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = 8.61 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV} = 1.38 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nAnd \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant:\n\n\\[ k = 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-19}}{1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 10000 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33 \\times 10^{6}} \\approx 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right) \\approx 10000 \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.1515 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the ratios is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = e^{0.1515} \\approx 1.16 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio when there are no spots is approximately 1.16 times the ratio when there are spots. But looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this value. Maybe I made a calculation error or misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the spot coverage affecting the overall temperature and thus the population ratios differently.\n\nWait a minute, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Maybe I need to account for the spot coverage in the population ratio calculation.\n\nHowever, since the star is in LTE, and we're considering the photospheric effective temperature, perhaps the simple Boltzmann factor approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the temperature difference and how it affects the population ratio.\n\nLet me try another approach. The ratio of populations is proportional to \\( e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} \\). So, the ratio of the ratios would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 6000}}}{e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\times 5500}}} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right)} \\]\n\nWhich is what I had before. So, perhaps I need to check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.3806 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}} \\approx 10000 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\nThen, calculate the temperature difference in the exponent:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{12 - 11}{66000} = \\frac{1}{66000} \\, \\text{K}^{-1} \\]\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the subtraction earlier.\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{12 - 11}{66000} = \\frac{1}{66000} \\, \\text{K}^{-1} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} \\right) = 10000 \\times \\frac{1}{66000} \\approx 0.1515 \\]\n\n\\[ e^{0.1515} \\approx 1.16 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio of the ratios is approximately 1.16, which corresponds to option C. ~1.1.\n\nBut the problem says \"the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". If the ratio without spots is 1.16 times the ratio with spots, then the change factor is indeed approximately 1.16.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots\", meaning that \\( R_{\\text{spots}} < R_{\\text{no spots}} \\), so \\( \\frac{R_{\\text{no spots}}}{R_{\\text{spots}}} > 1 \\), which aligns with my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the change in temperature affecting the population ratio differently, considering the spot coverage.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the spot temperature being different from the normal photosphere temperature. Typically, sunspots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, which might affect the overall temperature.\n\nBut the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, from 6000 K without spots. So, perhaps I need to model the effective temperature considering the spot coverage.\n\nHowever, since the problem gives the overall effective temperature directly for both cases, perhaps the simple Boltzmann factor approach is sufficient.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation leading to a ratio of approximately 1.16, which is closest to option C. ~1.1, I'll go with that.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the change in the population ratio due to the temperature change.\n\nThe population ratio changes as \\( e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} \\), so a decrease in temperature from 6000 K to 5500 K would lead to a smaller exponent, meaning a larger ratio \\( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\), which contradicts the statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If temperature decreases, and \\( \\Delta E \\) is positive (assuming level 2 is higher in energy), then \\( e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} \\) increases as T decreases, meaning \\( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\) increases when T decreases, which would imply that the ratio increases when spots are present, contrary to the problem statement.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my assumption about the energy levels is incorrect. Maybe level 1 is the lower energy level, and level 2 is the higher one, so \\( \\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 > 0 \\).\n\nBut if that's the case, then as temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K, \\( e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}} \\) should increase, meaning more population in the lower level and less in the higher level, which would imply that the ratio \\( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\) decreases, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 1.16, which is closest to option C. ~1.1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
