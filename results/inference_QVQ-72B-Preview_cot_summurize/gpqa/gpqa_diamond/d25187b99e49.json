                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons, and I need to find the angle between the directions of these two photons. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide and annihilate, two photons are produced, moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, respectively, with the same energy.\n\nFirst off, I know that in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons with energies that can be calculated using their momenta and masses. Since both the electron and the positron have the same mass (except for their charges being opposite), their annihilation should conserve both energy and momentum.\n\nLet me recall that the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is defined as \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. Given the Lorentz factors, I can find the velocities of the electron and the positron.\n\nFor the electron: \u03b3_e = 4\n\nSo, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3_e\u00b2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c\n\nSimilarly, for the positron: \u03b3_p = 2\n\nv_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3_p\u00b2) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c\n\nNow, before the annihilation, the total momentum of the system is the vector sum of the momenta of the electron and the positron.\n\nMomentum of a particle is p = \u03b3 * m * v, where m is the mass.\n\nBoth particles have the same mass, m_e = m_p = m.\n\nSo, p_e = \u03b3_e * m * v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m * sqrt(15) c\n\np_p = \u03b3_p * m * v_p = 2 * m * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m * sqrt(3) c\n\nSince the electron is moving from the left, its momentum is in the negative x-direction, and the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is in the positive x-direction.\n\nTherefore, total momentum before annihilation is:\n\np_total = -p_e + p_p = -m * sqrt(15) c + m * sqrt(3) c = m c (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3))\n\nAfter annihilation, this total momentum must be conserved. The two photons have momenta p_1 and p_2, each equal to E/c, where E is the energy of each photon, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSince both photons have the same energy, their momenta are equal in magnitude but directed differently.\n\nLet me denote the directions of the photons using angles. Suppose the positron is moving along the positive x-axis, and the electron along the negative x-axis.\n\nOne photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction. Let's say the first photon makes an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the upper-right quadrant, and the second photon makes an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the lower-right quadrant.\n\nWait, that might not be precise. The problem says one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. So, their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, if one photon makes an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the upper-right quadrant, the other makes an angle -\u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the lower-right quadrant.\n\nNow, their momenta can be expressed in terms of their energies and angles.\n\nThe momentum of the first photon is:\n\np_1 = (E/c) * (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)\n\nThe momentum of the second photon is:\n\np_2 = (E/c) * (cos (-\u03b8), sin (-\u03b8)) = (E/c) * (cos \u03b8, -sin \u03b8)\n\nThe total momentum after annihilation is:\n\np_total' = p_1 + p_2 = (E/c) (cos \u03b8 + cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8 - sin \u03b8) = (E/c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0)\n\nThis must equal the total momentum before annihilation, which is:\n\np_total = m c (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3), 0)\n\nSo, setting p_total' = p_total:\n\n(E/c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0) = m c (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3), 0)\n\nThis gives:\n\n(E/c) * 2 cos \u03b8 = m c (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3))\n\nTherefore:\n\nE = (m c\u00b2) * (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) / (2 cos \u03b8)\n\nBut wait, energy must be positive, and m c\u00b2 is positive. However, (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) is negative because sqrt(15) \u2248 3.87 and sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73. So, (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) \u2248 -2.14, which is negative. That would make E negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI must have made a mistake in setting up the momenta.\n\nLet me double-check the directions.\n\nThe positron is moving to the right, along the positive x-axis, and the electron is moving to the left, along the negative x-axis.\n\nAfter annihilation, one photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction.\n\nSo, both photons are moving in the rightward direction but at angles above and below the x-axis.\n\nLet me denote the angles with respect to the positive x-axis.\n\nLet\u2019s say the first photon makes an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the upper-right quadrant, and the second photon makes an angle -\u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the lower-right quadrant.\n\nThen, their momenta are:\n\np_1 = (E/c) (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)\n\np_2 = (E/c) (cos (-\u03b8), sin (-\u03b8)) = (E/c) (cos \u03b8, -sin \u03b8)\n\nTotal momentum:\n\np_total' = p_1 + p_2 = (E/c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0)\n\nNow, the total momentum before annihilation is:\n\np_total = -p_e + p_p = m c (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3}, 0)\n\nSetting p_total' = p_total:\n\n(E/c) * 2 cos \u03b8 = m c (-sqrt(15} + sqrt{3})\n\nTherefore:\n\nE = (m c\u00b2) * (-sqrt{15} + sqrt{3}) / (2 cos \u03b8)\n\nBut E must be positive, and m c\u00b2 is positive. However, (-sqrt{15} + sqrt{3}) is negative, so to make E positive, the denominator must also be negative.\n\nBut cos \u03b8 is positive in the first quadrant, so 2 cos \u03b8 is positive. Therefore, E would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests I've made a mistake in setting up the momenta or the directions.\n\nLet me consider the directions again.\n\nPerhaps the positron is moving to the right, and the electron to the left, as I said.\n\nAfter annihilation, both photons are moving in the rightward direction but at angles above and below the x-axis.\n\nSo, their momenta should add up to a net momentum in the positive x-direction, but according to my earlier calculation, it's in the negative x-direction.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I got the signs wrong for the momenta before annihilation.\n\nLet me assume that the positron is moving to the right (positive x-direction) and the electron to the left (negative x-direction).\n\nThen, p_e = -m * sqrt{15} c (since it's moving left)\n\np_p = m * sqrt{3} c (since it's moving right)\n\nSo, p_total = p_p + p_e = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15})\n\nThis is in the negative x-direction, since sqrt{15} > sqrt{3}.\n\nAfter annihilation, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, so their momenta are in the positive x-direction component-wise.\n\nTherefore, their total momentum should be in the positive x-direction, but according to conservation of momentum, it should be in the negative x-direction.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption about the directions is incorrect, or perhaps I need to consider the center-of-momentum frame.\n\nMaybe I should approach this problem using the center-of-momentum frame.\n\nFirst, find the center-of-momentum velocity.\n\nThe total momentum before annihilation is:\n\np_total = p_p + p_e = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15})\n\nThe center-of-momentum velocity \u03b2_cm is given by:\n\n\u03b2_cm = p_total / (m_e + m_p) = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) c / (m_e + m_p)\n\nBut since m_e = m_p = m,\n\n\u03b2_cm = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) c / (2 m)\n\nNow, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero.\n\nI need to boost to the center-of-momentum frame, perform the annihilation, and then boost back.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider energy conservation.\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron.\n\nEnergy of a particle is E = \u03b3 m c\u00b2.\n\nSo, E_e = \u03b3_e m c\u00b2 = 4 m c\u00b2\n\nE_p = \u03b3_p m c\u00b2 = 2 m c\u00b2\n\nTotal energy before annihilation: E_total = E_e + E_p = 6 m c\u00b2\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is carried by the two photons, each with energy E_photon.\n\nSo, 2 E_photon = 6 m c\u00b2 \u21d2 E_photon = 3 m c\u00b2\n\nNow, each photon has energy E_photon = p_photon c, where p_photon is the momentum of the photon.\n\nTherefore, p_photon = E_photon / c = 3 m c\u00b2 / c = 3 m c\n\nNow, the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the momenta of the two photons.\n\nLet me denote the momenta of the two photons as vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s say the first photon makes an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the upper-right quadrant, and the second makes an angle -\u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the lower-right quadrant.\n\nThen, their momenta are:\n\np_1 = (3 m c) (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)\n\np_2 = (3 m c) (cos (-\u03b8), sin (-\u03b8)) = (3 m c) (cos \u03b8, -sin \u03b8)\n\nTotal momentum after annihilation:\n\np_total' = p_1 + p_2 = (3 m c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0)\n\nNow, the total momentum before annihilation is:\n\np_total = p_p + p_e = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}, 0)\n\nAccording to conservation of momentum:\n\np_total' = p_total\n\nTherefore:\n\n(3 m c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0) = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}, 0)\n\nDivide both sides by m c:\n\n(3)(2 cos \u03b8, 0) = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}, 0)\n\nSo, 6 cos \u03b8 = sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}\n\nTherefore:\n\ncos \u03b8 = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / 6\n\nNow, I need to find \u03b8, which is the angle between the positive x-axis and one of the photons.\n\nBut the problem asks for the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n\nSince one photon is at \u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, the angle between them is 2 \u03b8.\n\nSo, I need to find 2 \u03b8.\n\nFirst, find \u03b8 from the equation:\n\ncos \u03b8 = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / 6\n\nLet me compute the numerical value of cos \u03b8:\n\nsqrt{3} \u2248 1.732\n\nsqrt{15} \u2248 3.872\n\nSo, sqrt{3} - sqrt{15} \u2248 1.732 - 3.872 = -2.14\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = -2.14 / 6 \u2248 -0.3567\n\nNow, find \u03b8 such that cos \u03b8 \u2248 -0.3567\n\nUsing inverse cosine:\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 arccos(-0.3567)\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 109.47 degrees\n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2 \u03b8 \u2248 218.94 degrees\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options: 138, 96, 172, 74.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the angle.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf one photon is at \u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, then the angle between them is indeed 2 \u03b8, but perhaps the angle is measured differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle between them is 180\u00b0 - 2 \u03b8, considering they are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the angle between their directions.\n\nLet me consider the angle between the two vectors.\n\nIf one photon is at \u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, the angle between them is the angle from one vector to the other, which is 2 \u03b8.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, the angle is measured differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the angle between their momenta vectors.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the angle between their directions, which could be different from 2 \u03b8.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the directions of the two photons.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the direction of the first photon as making an angle \u03b8 with the positive x-axis in the upper-right quadrant, and the second photon making an angle \u03c6 with the positive x-axis in the lower-right quadrant.\n\nBut according to the problem, one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, so they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 = -\u03b8.\n\nNow, their momenta are:\n\np_1 = (E/c) (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8)\n\np_2 = (E/c) (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6) = (E/c) (cos (-\u03b8), sin (-\u03b8)) = (E/c) (cos \u03b8, -sin \u03b8)\n\nTotal momentum:\n\np_total' = p_1 + p_2 = (E/c) (2 cos \u03b8, 0)\n\nThis must equal the total momentum before annihilation:\n\np_total = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}, 0)\n\nTherefore:\n\n(E/c) * 2 cos \u03b8 = m c (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15})\n\nSo,\n\nE = (m c\u00b2) * (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / (2 cos \u03b8)\n\nBut earlier, I found that E = 3 m c\u00b2, from energy conservation.\n\nTherefore:\n\n3 m c\u00b2 = (m c\u00b2) * (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / (2 cos \u03b8)\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / (2 cos \u03b8)\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 cos \u03b8 = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / 3\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{15}) / 6\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nNow, compute numerical value:\n\nsqrt{3} \u2248 1.732\n\nsqrt{15} \u2248 3.872\n\nSo,\n\ncos \u03b8 \u2248 (1.732 - 3.872)/6 \u2248 (-2.14)/6 \u2248 -0.3567\n\nThen,\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 109.47 degrees\n\nTherefore, the angle between the two photons is 2 \u03b8 \u2248 218.94 degrees\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the angle between them is not exactly 2 \u03b8, or perhaps there's a different way to interpret the angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle between the directions is measured differently.\n\nLet me consider the angle between the two vectors.\n\nIf one photon is at \u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8, the angle between them is 180\u00b0 - 2 \u03b8.\n\nSo, angle between them is 180\u00b0 - 2 \u03b8 \u2248 180\u00b0 - 218.94\u00b0 = -38.94\u00b0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the angle between two vectors is the smaller angle between them.\n\nIn this case, the angle between the two photons is 2 \u03b8, but since they are on opposite sides, the smaller angle would be 360\u00b0 - 2 \u03b8.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle between them is 180\u00b0 - 2 \u03b8.\n\nWait, in the upper-right and lower-right quadrants, the angle between them should be 2 \u03b8.\n\nBut according to the calculation, 2 \u03b8 \u2248 218.94\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, so the smaller angle would be 360\u00b0 - 218.94\u00b0 \u2248 141.06\u00b0\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the angle is measured from one photon to the other in the plane they define.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the angle between their momenta vectors.\n\nLet me recall that the angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (p_1 \u2022 p_2) / (|p_1| |p_2|)\n\nGiven that both photons have the same energy, their momenta are equal in magnitude.\n\nSo, |p_1| = |p_2| = E/c = 3 m c\n\nNow, p_1 \u2022 p_2 = (E/c)^2 (cos \u03b8 cos (-\u03b8) + sin \u03b8 sin (-\u03b8)) = (E/c)^2 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 - sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = (E/c)^2 cos 2\u03b8\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos \u03c6 = cos 2\u03b8\n\nSo, \u03c6 ="
