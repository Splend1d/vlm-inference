                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by \\( V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2 \\), which is a classic example of a harmonic oscillator. The particle has mass \\( m \\), and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency.\n\nFirst, I need to find the energy of the third excited state and determine how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue. The options provided are in terms of \\( \\hbar \\), \\( \\omega \\), and some other quantities, so I should probably work in terms of these variables.\n\nI recall that for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( n + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \\) is the total quantum number, and \\( n_x, n_y, n_z \\) are the quantum numbers in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, each starting from 0.\n\nThe third excited state would correspond to \\( n = 3 \\). So, plugging in \\( n = 3 \\) into the energy formula:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( 3 + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega = \\left( \\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega\n\\]\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega \\).\n\nNext, I need to find out how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to this energy eigenvalue. This means I need to find the degeneracy of the energy level \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nTo find the degeneracy, I need to consider all possible combinations of \\( n_x, n_y, n_z \\) such that \\( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \\). Additionally, each of these quantum numbers can be 0, 1, 2, etc., but for \\( n = 3 \\), they can be:\n\n- \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 0, n_z = 3 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 1, n_z = 2 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 2, n_z = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 0, n_z = 2 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 1, n_z = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 2, n_z = 0 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 2, n_y = 0, n_z = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 2, n_y = 1, n_z = 0 \\)\n\n- \\( n_x = 3, n_y = 0, n_z = 0 \\)\n\nWait, but in 3D, for each set of \\( n_x, n_y, n_z \\), there are additional degeneracies due to the angular momentum states. For a harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\ng(n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\n\\]\n\nLet me check this formula. For \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\ng(3) = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy level \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2 m r^2) \\), 3\n\nB. \\( (9/2) \\hbar \\omega \\), 3\n\nC. \\( (9/2) \\hbar \\omega \\), 10\n\nD. \\( 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2 m r^2) \\), 10\n\nBased on my calculations, the correct energy is \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega \\) and the degeneracy is 10. Therefore, the correct choice should be C: \\( (9/2) \\hbar \\omega \\), 10.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the degeneracy formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nThe general formula for the degeneracy of the nth energy level in a 3D harmonic oscillator is:\n\n\\[\ng(n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\ng(3) = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the number of ways to distribute the quanta among the three dimensions. The number of quanta in each dimension must be non-negative integers that sum to \\( n \\), and then for each such distribution, there are certain angular momentum states.\n\nBut using the formula above seems straightforward, and it gives 10 for \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C: \\( (9/2) \\hbar \\omega \\), 10.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the energy expression again. The energy for a 3D harmonic oscillator is indeed:\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( n + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\left( 3 + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega\n\\]\n\nAnd the degeneracy is 10, as calculated.\n\nSo, the final answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
