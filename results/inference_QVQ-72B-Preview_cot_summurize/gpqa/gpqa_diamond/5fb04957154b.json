                    "text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars, and I need to find out by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. The options are pretty close, so I need to be careful with my calculations.\n\nFirst, I know that for black bodies, the luminosity \\(L\\) is related to the radius \\(R\\) and the temperature \\(T\\) by the formula:\n\n\\[L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nGiven that both stars have the same brightest wavelength, I can use Wien's displacement law, which states that:\n\n\\[\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T}\\]\n\nwhere \\(b\\) is Wien's displacement constant. Since \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\) is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So, \\(T_1 = T_2 = T\\).\n\nNow, given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the mass is also 1.5 times, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects luminosity in this context. Maybe in reality, mass affects luminosity through its effect on temperature or radius, but since we've already established that temperature is the same, maybe mass isn't relevant here. Anyway, I'll focus on what's given.\n\nSo, if \\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\\) and \\(T_1 = T_2\\), then the luminosity ratio should be:\n\n\\[\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \\sigma T^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T^4} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but the options are all around 2.2 to 2.3, so maybe there's more to it.\n\nOh, right! The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. I need to think about how radial velocity affects luminosity. Radial velocity is related to the Doppler effect, which affects the observed wavelength of light, but not the intrinsic luminosity of the star. So, probably, the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation. Maybe it's there to distract.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the Doppler effect on the luminosity measurement. If a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed luminosity might be affected by the Doppler shift, but I think that's more about the observed flux rather than the intrinsic luminosity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the radial velocity is related to the motion in a binary system, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can ignore the radial velocities for this particular calculation, assuming that the intrinsic luminosity isn't affected by the star's motion relative to us.\n\nSo, going back to the luminosity formula, with \\(L \\propto R^2 T^4\\), and since \\(T\\) is the same for both stars, the luminosity ratio is just \\((1.5)^2 = 2.25\\).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. ~2.35\n\nB. ~2.23\n\nC. ~2.32\n\nD. ~2.25\n\nSo, 2.25 matches with option D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of\", and I got exactly 2.25. But the options are all approximate values, so maybe there's a slight miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the mass affects the luminosity through the mass-luminosity relation. I recall that for main sequence stars, luminosity is proportional to mass to some power, like \\(L \\propto M^{3.5}\\), but in this problem, both stars have the same temperature, and radius is proportional to mass, which might not be the case generally.\n\nWait, but if radius is proportional to mass, and temperature is the same, then luminosity would be proportional to \\(R^2\\), which is \\(M^2\\) if \\(R \\propto M\\). But in my earlier calculation, I only considered the radius difference.\n\nHowever, since both stars have the same temperature and radius is 1.5 times, then luminosity should be \\((1.5)^2 = 2.25\\) times greater, assuming temperature is constant.\n\nMaybe the mass information is just there to confuse, and it doesn't directly affect the luminosity calculation under these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between mass, radius, and temperature that I need to consider.\n\nLet me think about the mass-luminosity relation. For main sequence stars, \\(L \\propto M^{3.5}\\), but here, mass is 1.5 times, so \\(L_1 = (1.5)^{3.5} \\approx 3.35\\), which doesn't match with 2.25.\n\nWait, but that would suggest a different answer, which contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the mass-radius relation. For main sequence stars, \\(R \\propto M^{0.8}\\), so if mass is 1.5 times, radius is \\(1.5^{0.8} \\approx 1.465\\) times, but in this problem, radius is 1.5 times directly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven that temperature is the same, and radius is 1.5 times, then luminosity is proportional to \\(R^2\\), so \\(L_1 = 2.25 L_2\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. ~2.25.\n\nBut since the options are approximate, maybe there's a more precise calculation I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants me to consider the mass-luminosity relation and the mass-radius relation together.\n\nLet me try to incorporate that.\n\nIf \\(L \\propto M^{3.5}\\) and \\(R \\propto M^{0.8}\\), then \\(L \\propto R^{4.375}\\), because \\(M \\propto R^{1.25}\\) (since \\(R \\propto M^{0.8}\\), so \\(M \\propto R^{1.25}\\)), and \\(L \\propto M^{3.5} \\propto R^{(1.25 \\times 3.5)} = R^{4.375}\\).\n\nBut in the problem, we're given that \\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\\) and \\(T_1 = T_2\\), so \\(L_1 = 4\\pi (1.5 R_2)^2 \\sigma T^4 = 2.25 \\times 4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T^4 = 2.25 L_2\\).\n\nSo, again, I arrive at 2.25.\n\nPerhaps the mass information is just extraneous, and the answer is indeed 2.25.\n\nBut the options are given with tildes (~), suggesting that the exact value might not be one of the options, or that there's a slight correction factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the stars are in a binary system, and their luminosities are affected by their mutual gravitational interaction, but that seems beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radial velocities indicate that one star is moving away or towards us, affecting the observed luminosity due to the Doppler effect, but again, that probably doesn't affect the intrinsic luminosity of the star.\n\nGiven that, I think the simplest answer is that the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2, based on the radius difference and the assumption of equal temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. ~2.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
