                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water when treated with platinum and heated, resulting in another equimolar mixture Y of two different liquids. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Also, both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give only one substance, a hydrocarbon Z, which is also a component of mixture Y and is commonly used as a solvent. Additionally, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen and doesn't have conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n\nPhew, that's a mouthful. Let's see what we can make of this.\n\nStarting with mixture X: it decolorizes bromine water. This typically happens when there are carbon-carbon double bonds present, as they can react with bromine to form addition products, thus removing the bromine's color.\n\nSo, mixture X contains two liquids with double bonds. But they're not conjugated, according to the problem. So, no sequences of alternating single and double bonds.\n\nWhen mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y. Disproportionation usually involves a redox reaction where some components are oxidized and others are reduced. In this case, since it's happening between the same molecules, it might involve breaking and forming bonds in a way that some molecules gain hydrogen and others lose it.\n\nMixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning it doesn't have double bonds or has fewer double bonds that don't react with bromine under those conditions.\n\nNow, both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give only one substance, a hydrocarbon Z. This suggests that Z is fully saturated, with no double bonds left, since it doesn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nAlso, Z is a component of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Given that it's a hydrocarbon, it's likely an alkane.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Since Z is an alkane, its general formula is C_nH_{2n+2}. The mass fraction of hydrogen can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass fraction of H} = \\frac{2n \\times 1.008}{(12.011 \\times n) + (2n + 2) \\times 1.008} = 14.28\\%\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n \\times 1.008}{12.011n + (2n + 2) \\times 1.008} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify the denominator:\n\n\\[\n12.011n + 2n \\times 1.008 + 2 \\times 1.008 = 12.011n + 2.016n + 2.016 = (12.011 + 2.016)n + 2.016 = 14.027n + 2.016\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.016n}{14.027n + 2.016} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 0.1428 \\times (14.027n + 2.016)\n\\]\n\nCalculate the right side:\n\n\\[\n0.1428 \\times 14.027n = 1.999n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.1428 \\times 2.016 = 0.288\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 1.999n + 0.288\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1.999n from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.017n = 0.288\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{0.288}{0.017} \\approx 17.0\n\\]\n\nHmm, n isn't an integer. That's odd because n should be an integer in the alkane series. Maybe my calculations are off.\n\nLet me check the mass fraction calculation again.\n\nGiven that Z is C_nH_{2n+2}, the molar mass is:\n\n\\[\nM = 12.011n + 1.008(2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM = 12.011n + 2.016n + 2.016 = 14.027n + 2.016\n\\]\n\nThe mass of hydrogen per mole is:\n\n\\[\nm_{\\text{H}} = 2.016n\n\\]\n\nSo, the mass fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.016n}{14.027n + 2.016} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for n:\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 0.1428(14.027n + 2.016)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 1.999n + 0.288\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.016n - 1.999n = 0.288\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.017n = 0.288\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{0.288}{0.017} \\approx 16.94 \\approx 17\n\\]\n\nOkay, n is approximately 17. So, Z is C17H36.\n\nBut Z is supposed to be a component of mixture Y and is a solvent. C17H36 seems like a high molecular weight alkane, which might be a bit unusual for a common solvent, but maybe it's possible.\n\nNow, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids with double bonds, and mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids formed by disproportionation of X, and hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, C17H36.\n\nAlso, Z is a component of mixture Y, meaning one of the products of disproportionation is Z.\n\nGiven that, let's think about what disproportionation could be doing here.\n\nDisproportionation typically involves some molecules gaining hydrogen and others losing it. In the context of alkenes, this could mean some alkenes being reduced to alkanes and others being oxidized to other compounds, but since we're dealing with hydrocarbons, oxidation might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, but the problem states that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, suggesting no double bonds are present or they don't react with bromine. So, perhaps in the disproportionation, some double bonds are being removed entirely.\n\nGiven that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, C17H36, it suggests that the total hydrogen content in X and Y is the same as in Z, just distributed differently.\n\nWait, but X has double bonds, so it has fewer hydrogen atoms than Z, and Y has no double bonds or fewer reactive double bonds.\n\nBut hydrogenation of X and Y both give Z, meaning that the total hydrogen added in both cases is the same.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes, let's say A and B, both with the same number of carbon atoms, since it's equimolar.\n\nWait, no, equimolar mixture means equal amounts of each component, but they could have different numbers of carbon atoms. However, since they're both liquids, their boiling points must be close enough to be in the same liquid state at room temperature.\n\nBut perhaps they have similar carbon numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are positional isomers.\n\nGiven that, let's assume mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two isomers with the same molecular formula but different double bond positions.\n\nThen, upon treatment with platinum and heat, they undergo disproportionation to form mixture Y, which is another equimolar mixture of two different compounds.\n\nNow, the key point is that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z, C17H36.\n\nThis suggests that the total hydrogen content in X and Y is such that when fully hydrogenated, they both reach the same fully saturated hydrocarbon, Z.\n\nGiven that Z is C17H36, its molecular formula corresponds to C17H36.\n\nNow, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two compounds, let's say compound 1 and compound 2, both with fewer hydrogen atoms than Z, since they have double bonds.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the molecular formulas of compound 1 and compound 2 as C_mH_{2m} and C_mH_{2m}, respectively, assuming they have the same number of carbon atoms and are alkenes.\n\nWait, but alkenes generally have the formula C_nH_{2n}, but since Z is C17H36, which is C_nH_{2n+2}, then each double bond reduces the hydrogen count by 2 compared to the alkane.\n\nSo, if mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes, each with one double bond, their molecular formulas would be C_mH_{2m}, and together they would have a combined hydrogen count of 4m.\n\nBut hydrogenation of X gives Z, C17H36, which has 36 hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, the total hydrogen added in hydrogenation would be 36 - 4m.\n\nSimilarly, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other compounds, and hydrogenation of Y also gives Z, C17H36.\n\nThis suggests that mixture Y also has a combined hydrogen count that, upon hydrogenation, adds up to 36.\n\nBut mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning it doesn't have double bonds or has different types of bonds that don't react with bromine.\n\nWait, but if mixture Y has no double bonds, then its components must be alkanes or other saturated compounds.\n\nBut the problem states that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, and hydrogenation gives Z, which is already an alkane.\n\nWait, but Z is an alkane, C17H36, so if mixture Y already contains alkanes, then hydrogenation wouldn't change them.\n\nBut the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z.\n\nSo, if mixture Y contains Z already, then hydrogenation wouldn't change it.\n\nBut the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z, implying that some hydrogenation is occurring.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture Y contains one component that is Z and another component that is hydrogenated to Z.\n\nBut the problem says that mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, and hydrogenation gives only Z.\n\nSo, perhaps one component of Y is Z already, and the other component is another alkane that, upon hydrogenation, turns into Z.\n\nBut alkanes don't react with hydrogen under those conditions, as stated in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that Z does not react further with hydrogen, meaning that if one component of Y is Z, it won't change upon hydrogenation.\n\nSo, if Y is an equimolar mixture of Z and another compound, and hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, then the other compound must be hydrogenated to Z.\n\nTherefore, the other component of Y must be an alkene that, upon hydrogenation, gives Z.\n\nBut Z is C17H36, so the other component must be an alkene with 17 carbon atoms and 34 hydrogen atoms (since C17H34).\n\nWait, but C17H34 is an alkene, which would decolorize bromine water, but the problem says that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water.\n\nThis is contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other component is a diene, but then it would decolorize bromine water.\n\nWait, maybe the other component is a cyclic alkane or something else that doesn't decolorize bromine water.\n\nBut the problem mentions that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, implying no double bonds are present or they don't react with bromine.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\n\nGiven that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, C17H36, perhaps mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes, each with 17 carbon atoms and 34 hydrogen atoms (C17H34), and mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (C17H36) and another compound, say C17H34, but modified in some way.\n\nBut again, if mixture Y contains Z and another C17H34 alkene, then hydrogenation would give Z and another alkane, which contradicts the statement that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n\nWait, perhaps the other component of Y is a cyclic alkane or something that, upon hydrogenation, doesn't change.\n\nBut the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z, so if the other component is already Z, then hydrogenation wouldn't change it.\n\nBut then, why is mixture Y considered to be an equimolar mixture of two other liquids if one of them is already Z?\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the disproportionation reaction changes the carbon skeleton or introduces rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes with different degrees of unsaturation.\n\nWait, but the problem says they are both alkenes without conjugated double bonds.\n\nLet's assume mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes, each with one double bond, both having 17 carbon atoms.\n\nSo, compound 1: C17H34\n\nCompound 2: C17H34\n\nTogether, mixture X has a total of 68 hydrogen atoms (34 from each).\n\nUpon hydrogenation, each C17H34 would become C17H36, adding 2 hydrogen atoms per molecule, so total hydrogen added would be 4, resulting in Z, C17H36.\n\nNow, upon treatment with platinum and heat, mixture X undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two other compounds.\n\nDisproportionation could involve some molecules gaining hydrogen and others losing it.\n\nSo, perhaps some C17H34 molecules are reduced to C17H36, and others are oxidized to C17H32.\n\nBut C17H32 would have two double bonds, which might still decolorize bromine water, contradicting the statement that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the oxidation step goes further, forming cyclic compounds or other structures without double bonds.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's try another angle.\n\nGiven that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, C17H36, perhaps mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes with a total of 34 hydrogen atoms each, and mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of Z (C17H36) and another compound, say C17H32, which upon hydrogenation gives Z.\n\nBut again, C17H32 has two double bonds and would decolorize bromine water, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other component of Y is a cyclic alkane with the same hydrogen content as Z.\n\nBut Z is C17H36, which is a straight-chain alkane, and a cyclic alkane with 17 carbon atoms would have fewer hydrogen atoms.\n\nWait, no. For a single ring, the molecular formula would be C_nH_{2n}, so for n=17, it would be C17H34, which is the same as the alkenes in mixture X.\n\nBut the problem says that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, so if one component is Z, C17H36, and the other is C17H34, which is an alkene, that would decolorize bromine water.\n\nSo, this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other component is a diene, but again, that would decolorize bromine water.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet's consider that the disproportionation reaction might involve forming a more saturated compound and a less saturated one, but in such a way that the less saturated one doesn't decolorize bromine water.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a compound that doesn't have double bonds but has some other functionality that doesn't react with bromine.\n\nBut the problem specifies that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, implying no double bonds are present or they don't react with bromine.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two alkenes with different degrees of unsaturation, but both having the same number of carbon atoms.\n\nWait, no, they both have one double bond each, as alkenes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one has one double bond and the other has two, but the problem says they are both alkenes without conjugated double bonds.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nLet's try to look at the answer choices.\n\nThe question is: indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 18\n\nD. 16\n\nWait, these numbers are much smaller than what I was considering earlier. I was thinking about C17H34, which has 34 hydrogen atoms per molecule, so two molecules would have 68 hydrogen atoms in total.\n\nBut the options are much smaller, suggesting that the molecules in mixture X have fewer carbon atoms.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that Z is C17H36.\n\nLet's re-examine the calculation for n in the alkane formula.\n\nWe had:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.016n}{14.027n + 2.016} = 0.1428\n\\]\n\nSolving for n:\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 0.1428(14.027n + 2.016)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.016n = 1.999n + 0.288\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2.016n - 1.999n = 0.288\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.017n = 0.288\n\\]\n\n"
