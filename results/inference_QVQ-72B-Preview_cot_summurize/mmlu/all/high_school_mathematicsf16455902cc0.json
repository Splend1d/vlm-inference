                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have this expression for M: M equals 4a squared minus 2b squared plus a. Then, there are two scenarios: one where a is 5 and b is 3, which gives us j, and another where a is -1 and b is 4, giving us k. Finally, we need to find j plus 2 times k. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the value of M when a=5 and b=3. So, plugging those values into the expression:\n\nM = 4*(5)^2 - 2*(3)^2 + 5\n\nLet me calculate that. 5 squared is 25, so 4 times 25 is 100. 3 squared is 9, so 2 times 9 is 18. And then add 5. So, 100 minus 18 is 82, plus 5 is 87. Therefore, j = 87.\n\nNext, I need to find k, which is the value of M when a=-1 and b=4.\n\nSo, M = 4*(-1)^2 - 2*(4)^2 + (-1)\n\nLet's compute each part. (-1)^2 is 1, so 4 times 1 is 4. (4)^2 is 16, so 2 times 16 is 32. And then add -1, which is the same as subtracting 1. So, 4 minus 32 is -28, plus (-1) is -29. Therefore, k = -29.\n\nNow, the problem asks for j + 2k. So, that's 87 plus 2 times -29.\n\nFirst, calculate 2 times -29, which is -58.\n\nThen, add that to 87: 87 + (-58) = 29.\n\nSo, j + 2k = 29.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 29\n\nB. 28\n\nC. 27\n\nD. 26\n\nIt seems like the answer is A. 29.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, for j:\n\nM = 4*(5)^2 - 2*(3)^2 + 5 = 4*25 - 2*9 + 5 = 100 - 18 + 5 = 87. That seems correct.\n\nFor k:\n\nM = 4*(-1)^2 - 2*(4)^2 + (-1) = 4*1 - 2*16 -1 = 4 - 32 -1 = -29. That also seems right.\n\nThen, j + 2k = 87 + 2*(-29) = 87 - 58 = 29.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the answer should be A. 29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 29} \\]"
