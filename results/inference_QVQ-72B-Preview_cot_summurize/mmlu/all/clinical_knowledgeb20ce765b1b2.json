                    "text": "So I've got this question about headaches, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that when a headache is associated with neck stiffness, it's always due to meningitis. Hmm, I remember that meningitis can cause neck stiffness, but is it always the case? I don't think so. There might be other reasons for neck stiffness with a headache, like viral infections or even muscle tension. So, probably not always meningitis.\n\nOption B says that severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause. I'm not sure about that. While it's true that some serious conditions can cause severe headaches, like subarachnoid hemorrhage or a brain tumor, not all severe headaches are life-threatening. For example, migraines can be very painful but aren't usually life-threatening. So, maybe not always true.\n\nOption C mentions that temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. I need to recall what temporal arteritis is. It's a type of vasculitis that affects the temporal arteries, often seen in older adults. I think it can be associated with other inflammatory conditions, but is it strongly linked to rheumatoid arthritis? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up later.\n\nOption D says that tension headaches are a common cause of headache. That sounds familiar. Tension headaches are pretty common, right? They're often caused by stress, muscle tension in the neck and shoulders, and can be triggered by things like poor posture or staring at a screen for too long. So, yeah, I think they're quite common.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Not always meningitis\n\n- B: Severe pain isn't always life-threatening\n\n- C: Not sure about the association with rheumatoid arthritis\n\n- D: Tension headaches are common\n\nBased on this, D seems to be the most accurate statement. So, I think the correct answer is D: Tension headaches are a common cause of headache.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
