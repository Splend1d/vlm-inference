We need to determine whether f must necessarily be injective and/or surjective.\n\nFirst, let's recall what injective and surjective mean:\n\n1. **Injective (One-to-One):** A function f: A \u2192 B is injective if for every a1, a2 in A, f(a1) = f(a2) implies a1 = a2.\n\n2. **Surjective (Onto):** A function f: A \u2192 B is surjective if for every b in B, there exists some a in A such that f(a) = b.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, we have a composition of g after f that acts as the identity function on A.\n\nLet's analyze Statement 1: The function f must necessarily be injective.\n\nTo prove that f is injective, we need to show that if f(a1) = f(a2), then a1 = a2.\n\nAssume f(a1) = f(a2). Then, g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). But g(f(a1)) = a1 and g(f(a2)) = a2, so a1 = a2. Therefore, f is injective.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f(a1) = f(a2) but a1 \u2260 a2. Then, g(f(a1)) = a1 and g(f(a2)) = a2, but since f(a1) = f(a2), we have a1 = g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)) = a2, which contradicts our assumption that a1 \u2260 a2. Hence, f must be injective.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's look at Statement 2: The function f must necessarily be surjective.\n\nTo determine if f is surjective, we need to check if every element in B is the image of some element in A under f.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, this tells us something about the composition of g and f, but it doesn't directly tell us about whether every element of B is hit by f.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nLet A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b, c, d}. Define f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 A as follows:\n\n- f(1) = a\n\n- f(2) = b\n\n- f(3) = c\n\n- g(a) = 1\n\n- g(b) = 2\n\n- g(c) = 3\n\n- g(d) = 3\n\nThen, for all a in A:\n\n- g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1\n\n- g(f(2)) = g(b) = 2\n\n- g(f(3)) = g(c) = 3\n\nSo, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nHowever, f is not surjective because d in B is not the image of any element in A under f.\n\nIn this case, f is injective but not surjective, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that f must be injective but not necessarily surjective.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f is surjective. Then, for every b in B, there exists some a in A such that f(a) = b. If f is also injective, then f has an inverse function f^{-1}: B \u2192 A. In our case, g(f(a)) = a suggests that g could be considered as f^{-1}. However, our earlier example shows that f can be injective without being surjective, and g is still well-defined.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false because f does not necessarily have to be surjective.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: True (f must be injective)\n\n- Statement 2: False (f need not be surjective)\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
