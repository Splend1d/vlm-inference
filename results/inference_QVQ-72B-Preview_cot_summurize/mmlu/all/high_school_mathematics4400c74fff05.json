                    "text": "So I have this function \\( h(x) = \\sqrt{25 - x^2} + \\sqrt{-(x - 2)} \\), and I need to find the domain of this function. The domain is the set of all possible x-values that make the function work, right? And then it asks for the width of that interval. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that for square roots to be defined in the real numbers, the stuff inside has to be greater than or equal to zero. So, both \\( 25 - x^2 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( -(x - 2) \\geq 0 \\) need to be true.\n\nLet me start by solving \\( 25 - x^2 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nThis can be rewritten as \\( x^2 \\leq 25 \\), which means \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\). So, the domain from the first square root is between -5 and 5, inclusive.\n\nNow, for the second square root, \\( -(x - 2) \\geq 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( -x + 2 \\geq 0 \\), or \\( x \\leq 2 \\). So, the domain from the second square root is all x less than or equal to 2.\n\nBut both conditions have to be satisfied simultaneously because they're being added together in the function. So, I need the intersection of these two domains.\n\nThe first domain is \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\), and the second is \\( x \\leq 2 \\). So, the intersection should be \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me visualize this. If one domain is from -5 to 5, and the other is from negative infinity up to 2, then the overlap should indeed be from -5 up to 2.\n\nSo, the domain of \\( h(x) \\) is \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nNow, the question asks for the width of this interval. Width is just the length, right? So, it's the difference between the upper limit and the lower limit.\n\nSo, width = 2 - (-5) = 7.\n\nTherefore, the width of the domain interval is 7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 2\n\nD. 25\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 7.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, \\( 25 - x^2 \\geq 0 \\) leads to \\( |x| \\leq 5 \\), so \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\).\n\nSecond, \\( -(x - 2) \\geq 0 \\) simplifies to \\( x - 2 \\leq 0 \\), which is \\( x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nIntersection of \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\) and \\( x \\leq 2 \\) is indeed \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nAnd the width is \\( 2 - (-5) = 7 \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, is there any reason to consider open or closed intervals? No, because both square roots allow equality, so it's closed interval.\n\nAlso, considering the function is defined only where both parts are defined, and there are no other restrictions.\n\nSo, I think 7 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
