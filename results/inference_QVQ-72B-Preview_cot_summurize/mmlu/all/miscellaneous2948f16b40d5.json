                    "text": "So I have this question about Lewis and Clark's famous expedition in 1804. It's asking where they began their journey, and the options are Seattle, St. Louis, New Orleans, or Washington D.C. Hmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, I know that Lewis and Clark were explorers who set out to map and explore the Louisiana Territory, which the United States had recently acquired from France. Their expedition was a big deal because they were venturing into unknown territory, documenting the land, its resources, and encountering various Native American tribes along the way.\n\nNow, trying to recall, where did they start from? I think St. Louis was a significant starting point for many westward expeditions in American history. It was sort of the gateway to the West back then. Plus, I remember that the Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States, and St. Louis was located near the center of this new land at that time.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Seattle: That's in Washington state, which is way up northwest, close to Canada. I don't think Lewis and Clark started from there. They were exploring the Midwest and the northern parts of what would become the western United States. So, Seattle seems unlikely.\n\nNext, St. Louis: As I thought earlier, this seems like a plausible starting point. It's located near the Mississippi River, which was a major waterway for transportation and trade back then. I believe they set sail from St. Louis down the Mississippi and then up the Missouri River to explore the interior of the continent.\n\nThen, New Orleans: That's also on the Mississippi River, but further south. New Orleans was an important port city, but I don't recall it being the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Maybe they passed through there at some point, but I don't think they started from there.\n\nLastly, Washington D.C.: That's the capital city, and while it was certainly a center of government and decision-making, I don't think it was the starting point for their expedition. It's on the East Coast, and their journey was primarily through the Midwest and West.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, St. Louis seems like the most logical choice. Let me just double-check this to make sure I'm not mistaken.\n\nI recall that Thomas Jefferson, who was the President at the time, commissioned the expedition. Lewis and Clark were to find a water route to the Pacific Ocean, explore the territory, and establish trade relations with Native American tribes. St. Louis was a strategic starting point because it was the farthest point on the Mississippi River that was considered part of the United States at that time.\n\nAdditionally, I think that St. Louis was where they began assembling their team, including the famous Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who proved invaluable as a guide and interpreter.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility that they started from another location. For instance, maybe they began in Keelboat Park in St. Charles, Missouri, which is near St. Louis, but that's still considered part of the St. Louis area.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of Camp Dubois, which was located across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, in what is now Illinois. They might have prepared there before setting out on their journey.\n\nBut in terms of the official starting point, I'm pretty confident that it was St. Louis.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Lewis and Clark began their famous expedition in 1804 from St. Louis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
