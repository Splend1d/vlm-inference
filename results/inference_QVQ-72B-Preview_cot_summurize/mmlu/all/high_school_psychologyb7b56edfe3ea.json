                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about young Tina having trouble recognizing the space shuttle when she saw it flying after only seeing a picture of it ready to launch. And I need to figure out which concept best explains this problem. The options are the autokinetic effect, dishabituation, summation, and shape constancy.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the autokinetic effect. I think it's something related to how lights appear to move when they're actually stationary, especially in a dark environment. Like, if you stare at a point of light in a dark room, it might seem like it's shifting position. But in this scenario, we're talking about recognizing a space shuttle in different states\u2014on the ground ready to launch and flying in the air. I don't see a direct connection here between the autokinetic effect and recognizing the shuttle's shape in different orientations. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nNext, dishabituation. I recall that habituation is when an organism stops responding to a stimulus after being exposed to it repeatedly. Dishabituation is when that response comes back after something new or different happens. But in this case, Tina is seeing pictures of the shuttle, not repeatedly seeing the same thing and then something different. She's seeing one picture and then another, and having trouble recognizing it in the second picture. Doesn't seem to fit dishabituation either.\n\nSummation. I think summation refers to the combination of multiple stimuli to produce a stronger response. Like, in sensory perception, if you have multiple points of stimulation close together in time or space, they can add up to make a bigger response in the nervous system. But again, this doesn't seem directly related to recognizing the shuttle in different positions. Maybe I'm missing something, but for now, I'll set this one aside too.\n\nNow, shape constancy. This sounds more promising. Shape constancy is the perception of an object's shape remaining the same even when the viewing angle or perspective changes. For example, a cup looks like the same shape whether you're looking at it straight on or from the side, even though the image on your retina changes. In Tina's case, the shuttle would look different when it's on the ground ready to launch versus when it's flying through the air. The shape might appear distorted or changed from her previous perception, which could lead to difficulty in recognizing it.\n\nThinking about this more, the shuttle in its launch configuration is sitting vertically, with its boosters and fuel tank attached. When it's flying, it's horizontal or at an angle, and the boosters might have separated. So, the shape and structure visible in the picture could be quite different from what she initially saw on the ground. Her brain might be having trouble adjusting to this change in appearance and recognizing that it's still the same shuttle.\n\nSo, among the given options, shape constancy seems to be the most relevant concept to explain Tina's difficulty in recognizing the shuttle in its flying position after seeing it ready to launch.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other concept that might also apply here? Maybe something about size constancy or orientation constancy? Hmm, size constancy is similar to shape constancy but relates to perceiving an object's size as constant despite changes in distance. Orientation constancy might involve perceiving an object's orientation consistently regardless of our own position relative to it.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, it's more about the change in shape appearance due to the change in perspective or orientation of the shuttle. So, shape constancy still seems the most fitting explanation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other psychological or perceptual phenomenon that could explain Tina's difficulty. Perhaps something related to familiarity or learning? Tina might have only seen one image of the shuttle and hasn't had enough exposure to recognize it in different positions. But that seems more related to recognition memory rather than a perceptual constant.\n\nAnother thought: maybe it's related to gestalt principles, where we perceive objects based on their overall form rather than individual parts. If Tina is used to seeing the shuttle in one form and then sees it in another, her gestalt perception might not immediately recognize it as the same object.\n\nBut again, that seems to circle back to shape constancy, as gestalt principles include things like proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure, which all relate to perceiving shapes and forms.\n\nI think I'm reinforcing my initial thought that shape constancy is the key concept here.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options again quickly.\n\nAutokinetic effect: Movement of stationary lights in darkness\u2014doesn't relate to recognizing objects in different positions.\n\nDishabituation: Recovery of response after habituation\u2014doesn't apply to recognizing different images of the same object.\n\nSummation: Combination of stimuli for stronger response\u2014doesn't directly relate to recognizing objects from different angles.\n\nShape constancy: Perceiving an object's shape as constant despite changes in viewing angle\u2014directly relates to recognizing the shuttle in different positions.\n\nYes, shape constancy is the best explanation for Tina's difficulty in recognizing the shuttle when it's flying after seeing it ready to launch.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
