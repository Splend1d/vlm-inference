                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about processor interconnections. There are two types of networks: fully interconnected and ring networks. I need to find the ratio of their figures of merit for even n > 2, where n is the number of processors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a figure of merit is in this context. It's defined as the product of the number of links required for the network and the worst-case path length between any two processors.\n\nSo, for each type of network, I need to find:\n\n1. The number of links required.\n\n2. The worst-case path length.\n\nThen, calculate the figure of merit for each and find their ratio.\n\nLet's start with the fully interconnected network.\n\n**Fully Interconnected Network:**\n\nIn a fully interconnected network, each processor is directly connected to every other processor.\n\n1. **Number of links:**\n\n   Each processor connects to (n-1) others, but since the links are bidirectional and unique, the total number of links is n(n-1)/2.\n\n2. **Worst-case path length:**\n\n   In a fully interconnected network, any two processors are directly connected, so the path length is always 1.\n\n   Therefore, the worst-case path length is 1.\n\n3. **Figure of merit:**\n\n   Number of links * worst-case path length = n(n-1)/2 * 1 = n(n-1)/2\n\nNow, let's consider the ring network.\n\n**Ring Network:**\n\nIn a ring network, each processor is connected to two others, forming a single continuous loop.\n\n1. **Number of links:**\n\n   In a ring with n processors, there are n links (each processor connects to two neighbors).\n\n2. **Worst-case path length:**\n\n   In a ring, the path between two processors can be measured as the minimum of the clockwise or counterclockwise distance.\n\n   For n processors, the maximum distance between any two processors is floor(n/2).\n\n   Since n is even (as per the problem), n/2 is an integer, so the worst-case path length is n/2.\n\n3. **Figure of merit:**\n\n   Number of links * worst-case path length = n * (n/2) = n\u00b2/2\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network to that of the ring network.\n\n**Ratio:**\n\nFully interconnected figure of merit / Ring figure of merit = [n(n-1)/2] / [n\u00b2/2] = (n(n-1)/2) * (2/n\u00b2) = n(n-1)/n\u00b2 = (n-1)/n\n\nSo, the ratio is (n-1)/n.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1/(n\u00b2)\n\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\n\nC. 1/n\n\nD. (n-1)/n\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (n-1)/n.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, fully interconnected network:\n\n- Links: n(n-1)/2\n\n- Worst-case path length: 1\n\n- Figure of merit: n(n-1)/2\n\nRing network:\n\n- Links: n\n\n- Worst-case path length: n/2\n\n- Figure of merit: n * (n/2) = n\u00b2/2\n\nRatio: [n(n-1)/2] / [n\u00b2/2] = (n(n-1)/2) * (2/n\u00b2) = (n(n-1))/n\u00b2 = (n-1)/n\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is D. (n-1)/n"
