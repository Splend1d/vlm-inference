                    "text": "So I've got this question about the Supreme Court case Regents of University of California v. Bakke. It's asking what issue this case concerned. The options are:\n\nA. The rights of students to protest on a publicly funded campus\n\nB. In-class prayer at a publicly funded school\n\nC. The rights of students to carry concealed weapons on campus\n\nD. The use of racial quotas in public university admissions\n\nHmm, I need to recall what this case was about. I remember that Bakke was a white applicant who was denied admission to the University of California, Davis, Medical School. He argued that the school had a quota system that favored minority applicants, which he believed was unfair and unconstitutional.\n\nSo, looking back at the options, it seems like option D\u2014The use of racial quotas in public university admissions\u2014aligns with what I remember about the case.\n\nLet me double-check. I think the case dealt with affirmative action policies in college admissions. Affirmative action is when institutions try to give equal opportunities to groups that have been historically disadvantaged or discriminated against. Sometimes, this involves setting quotas for how many minority students should be admitted.\n\nIn Bakke's case, UC Davis had a special admissions program for minority students, and Bakke was arguing that this program was effectively a quota that gave preferential treatment based on race, which he claimed violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nI think the Supreme Court eventually ruled that while universities could consider race as one factor in admissions decisions to promote diversity, they could not use rigid quotas that automatically favored certain racial groups.\n\nSo, based on that, it's clear that the case was about the use of racial quotas in public university admissions. That means option D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options:\n\nOption A: The rights of students to protest on a publicly funded campus.\n\nI don't recall Bakke being about student protests. There have been other cases dealing with free speech on campus, like Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which protected students' rights to wear armbands as a form of protest. But Bakke was about admissions policies, not protest rights.\n\nOption B: In-class prayer at a publicly funded school.\n\nThis sounds like it's related to separation of church and state in public schools. Cases like Engel v. Vitale and Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe have addressed prayers in schools. Again, Bakke was about admissions processes, not about religious practices in schools.\n\nOption C: The rights of students to carry concealed weapons on campus.\n\nThis is about gun control and Second Amendment rights on college campuses. While there have been debates and legal challenges regarding carrying concealed weapons on campus, Bakke was not related to this issue.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, it's evident that the correct answer is option D: The use of racial quotas in public university admissions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
