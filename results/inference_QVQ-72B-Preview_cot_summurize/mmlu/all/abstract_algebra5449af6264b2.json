                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have the polynomial \\(x^2 + 1\\) in the finite field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), and we need to find all its zeros in that field. The options are 0, 1, both, or neither. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) is. It's the integers modulo 2, right? So, there are only two elements in this field: 0 and 1. That means any potential zero of the polynomial has to be either 0 or 1.\n\nNow, to find the zeros of \\( x^2 + 1 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), I need to plug in these two values and see if the polynomial equals zero.\n\nLet's start with \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( (0)^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). So, it's not zero. That means 0 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNext, \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( (1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\). But in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), 2 is congruent to 0 because 2 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), 2 is equivalent to 0 modulo 2, since 2 - 0 is divisible by 2. So, \\( 1^2 + 1 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). That means 1 is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nSo far, only 1 seems to be a zero. But let's double-check. Maybe there's another zero?\n\nWait, in a field, a polynomial of degree 2 can have at most two zeros. But in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), since it's a finite field with only two elements, and we've already checked both, we can confirm that only 1 is a zero.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I should consider if there are any repeated roots or something. The polynomial is \\( x^2 + 1 \\), and in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), we have \\( x^2 + 1 = x^2 + 0x + 1 \\). Plugging in 1, we get \\( 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \\equiv 0 \\) mod 2, which confirms 1 is a root.\n\nIs there a possibility of a double root here? Well, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), the derivative of \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is \\( 2x \\), which is 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). So, the polynomial and its derivative don't share a common root, which suggests that the root is not repeated. Therefore, 1 is the only zero.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 1.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is 0,1, which would suggest that both are zeros, but we already saw that 0 is not a zero. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption A is 0, which we checked and isn't a zero.\n\nOption D is 2, but 2 isn't an element of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), so that can't be considered.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is B. 1.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the factorization of the polynomial. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), \\( x^2 + 1 = (x + 1)(x + 1) \\) because \\( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\), and since 2 is 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), this simplifies to \\( x^2 + 1 \\). So, indeed, the polynomial factors as \\( (x + 1)^2 \\), confirming that 1 is the only zero.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to solve \\( x^2 + 1 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), then \\( x^2 = 1 \\). So, \\( x \\) must be a square root of 1 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\). In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\), both 0 and 1 are candidates.\n\nBut \\( 0^2 = 0 \\), which is not 1, and \\( 1^2 = 1 \\), which matches. So, again, only 1 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
