                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking about changes that do not usually occur to the lens of the eye as one grows older. The options are:\n\nA. It becomes thicker\n\nB. It yellows\n\nC. It becomes clouded\n\nD. It fills with fluid\n\nI need to recall what happens to the eye's lens as people age. I know that aging can affect the eyes in various ways, like presbyopia, which is when the lens loses elasticity and makes it harder to focus on close objects. But let's focus on the lens specifically.\n\nOption A says it becomes thicker. Does the lens get thicker with age? I think that as we age, the lens can become slightly thicker because it loses some of its flexibility and may swell a bit. So, maybe it does become thicker, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B says it yellows. I've noticed that some older people have a yellowish tint to their eyes, but I think that might be related to jaundice or something else. But specifically for the lens, does it yellow with age? I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption C says it becomes clouded. I know that cataracts are a common age-related condition where the lens becomes cloudy, affecting vision. So, this seems like a definite change that occurs with aging.\n\nOption D says it fills with fluid. The lens is already mostly made up of water and proteins, so it's already filled with fluid. But does it fill with more fluid as one ages? I don't know.\n\nMaybe I should think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: Does the lens become thicker with age?\n\nI found that as people age, the lens can become slightly thicker due to the accumulation of proteins, which can make it less elastic and harder to focus. So, it does tend to thicken somewhat. But is this a usual occurrence, or is it more of a gradual change that might not happen in everyone to the same degree?\n\nOption B: Does the lens yellow with age?\n\nI recall that the lens can develop a yellowish tint over time, which might be due to changes in the proteins within the lens or exposure to ultraviolet light. This can affect the quality of vision, making colors appear less vibrant or changing the perception of certain hues.\n\nOption C: Does the lens become clouded with age?\n\nYes, this is a common age-related change. Cataracts are when the lens becomes opaque or cloudy, leading to blurred vision, glare, and other vision problems. This is a significant issue in older adults.\n\nOption D: Does the lens fill with fluid?\n\nThe lens is already composed mostly of water and proteins, so it's already filled with fluid. However, I don't think it fills with more fluid as one ages. In fact, the consistency of the lens might change, but I don't recall it filling with additional fluid.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that option D, \"it fills with fluid,\" is not usually a change that occurs to the lens with aging. The lens is already fluid-filled, and there isn't evidence to suggest that it fills with more fluid as one gets older.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. It fills with fluid.\n\nBut to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIf I consider that the lens is enclosed in a capsule and has a specific structure, any significant increase in fluid could lead to swelling or other problems, but I don't think that's a typical age-related change.\n\nWhereas, thickening, yellowing, and clouding are well-documented age-related changes in the lens.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. It fills with fluid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
