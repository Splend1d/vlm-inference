He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nAccounts of Xuanzang's travels from both the 600s and 1500s C.E. are inspired by which of the following accomplishments?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about Xuanzang and his travels. It mentions accounts from both the 600s and the 1500s CE being inspired by one of his accomplishments. The options are:\n\nA. Xuanzang's career as a spy against the Gupta Empire\n\nB. Xuanzang's conversion of South Asian Hindus\n\nC. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India\n\nD. Xuanzang's opening of new trade routes to Southeast Asia\n\nFirst off, I need to recall who Xuanzang was and what he's famous for. I remember that Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India to study Buddhism and bring back Buddhist scriptures to China. This was during the Tang Dynasty in China, which was around the 7th century CE.\n\nSo, he set out on this journey because he wanted to learn more about Buddhism and to get better texts to translate into Chinese. His travels were quite famous, and he wrote about them, which became very influential.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Spy against the Gupta Empire \u2013 that sounds off. The Gupta Empire was in India, and while Xuanzang did travel to India, I don't recall any stories about him being a spy. Moreover, the Gupta Empire was a historical entity in India, but I don't think Xuanzang was involved in espionage against them.\n\nB. Conversion of South Asian Hindus \u2013 Xuanzang was a Buddhist monk, and while he might have tried to spread Buddhism, I don't remember any significant conversions attributed directly to him during his travels. His main focus was on studying and bringing back Buddhist texts, not converting Hindus.\n\nC. Study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India \u2013 This seems spot on. Xuanzang is well-known for his journey to India to study Buddhism and to collect scriptures, which he then brought back to China and translated into Chinese. This was a massive undertaking and had a significant impact on Buddhism in China.\n\nD. Opening of new trade routes to Southeast Asia \u2013 While his travels might have contributed to some knowledge about trade routes, Xuanzang's primary purpose wasn't to open trade routes. He was more of a scholar and a monk, not an explorer in the sense of Marco Polo or someone like that.\n\nGiven this background, option C seems the most accurate. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India are indeed what he's best known for, and his accounts of his travels, such as the \"Record of the Western Regions,\" provided valuable insights into the regions he visited during his journey.\n\nAdditionally, the reference to the 1500s CE might be pointing to the famous Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Cheng'en, which is a fictionalized account of Xuanzang's travels. This novel is a classic of Chinese literature and features Xuanzang and his three supernatural disciples, including the Monkey King, as they undertake a perilous journey to India to retrieve Buddhist sutras.\n\nSo, both the historical accounts from the 600s and the later fictionalized accounts from the 1500s are indeed inspired by Xuanzang's real-life endeavor to study and bring back Buddhist texts from India.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
