                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about the initial development of peace studies. There are four statements, and I need to figure out which one can't be applied to that early period. Let me read them again carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\"\n\nOption B: \"Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\"\n\nOption C: \"Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\"\n\nOption D: \"The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to think about each of these and see which one doesn't fit with the early days of peace studies.\n\nStarting with Option A: It talks about mathematicians and natural scientists entering the field, which was mainly a social sciences area, and this added to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.\n\nI recall that peace studies emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, largely in response to the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. It was indeed an interdisciplinary field from the start, drawing on sociology, political science, history, and other social sciences. But did mathematicians and natural scientists play a significant role in the early days?\n\nLet me think about this. Mathematicians might have been involved in conflict resolution theories or game theory, which are relevant to peace studies. Natural scientists might have been involved in discussions about the environmental impacts of war or nuclear weapons. But were they major players in the field during its initial development?\n\nI'm a bit unsure here. Maybe they did contribute, but perhaps not as much as social scientists. Maybe their involvement came later.\n\nMoving on to Option B: It says that creating journals was not a prominent feature of peace studies until late in the twentieth century, but now it's fundamental to the field.\n\nI know that academic journals are important for publishing research and advancing fields. If peace studies started in the mid-20th century, were there journals dedicated to peace research from the beginning, or did they come later?\n\nI think that some of the early peace research was published in general social science journals or in specialized journals that emerged later. For example, the Journal of Peace Research was founded in 1964, which is relatively early. So, maybe journals were a part of the field from quite early on, not just late in the twentieth century.\n\nWait, late in the twentieth century would be the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. By that time, peace studies had been around for a few decades, and journals were likely already established.\n\nSo, if journals were important from the beginning, or at least from the 1960s, then saying they weren't prominent until late in the twentieth century might not be accurate.\n\nMaybe this is the statement that can't be applied to the initial development of peace studies.\n\nOption C: Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\n\nI've heard that peace research indeed started in these regions. North America, especially the United States, was a center of social science research, and Scandinavia has a tradition of peace and conflict resolution.\n\nSo, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D: The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.\n\nThis also seems likely. As peace studies grew, more universities and organizations set up institutes and centers dedicated to peace research and education.\n\nSo, this appears to be a valid point about the development of the field.\n\nAlright, after considering all four options, I think Option B is the one that can't be applied to the initial development of peace studies. Because journals were actually important from quite early on in the field's history, not just late in the twentieth century.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
