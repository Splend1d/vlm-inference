                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A sample of solid MgCl2 would be most soluble in which of the following solutions? The options are A. LiOH(aq), B. CBr4(aq), C. Mg(NO3)2(aq), D. AlCl3(aq).\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means for a substance to be soluble in another substance. Solubility is basically how much of one substance can dissolve in another at a given temperature. There's a general rule that \"like dissolves like,\" meaning that polar solvents dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes.\n\nSo, MgCl2 is a ionic compound. It's magnesium chloride, which is ionic because it's made up of metal and nonmetal bonded by ionic bonds. So, it's polar. Therefore, it should dissolve best in a polar solvent.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. LiOH(aq) - Lithium hydroxide, which is also ionic and polar.\n\nB. CBr4(aq) - Carbon tetrabromide, which is a covalent compound and nonpolar.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq) - Magnesium nitrate, ionic and polar.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq) - Aluminum chloride, which can be covalent or ionic depending on the conditions, but in solution, it's likely to be ionic.\n\nSo, based on the \"like dissolves like\" principle, MgCl2 should dissolve well in the polar solvents, which are LiOH(aq), Mg(NO3)2(aq), and AlCl3(aq). But it shouldn't dissolve as well in the nonpolar CBr4(aq).\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the solution in which MgCl2 is most soluble, so I need to figure out which of these polar solutions it would dissolve best in.\n\nMaybe I should consider the common ion effect. If I have MgCl2 and Mg(NO3)2, both contain magnesium ions, so adding MgCl2 to Mg(NO3)2 solution might not dissolve as much MgCl2 because of the common ion effect, which would decrease its solubility.\n\nSimilarly, in AlCl3 solution, which contains chloride ions, adding MgCl2 would increase the chloride ion concentration, which might affect solubility via the common ion effect.\n\nLiOH contains neither magnesium nor chloride ions, so there wouldn't be a common ion effect there.\n\nWait, but AlCl3 contains both aluminum and chloride ions. MgCl2 contains magnesium and chloride ions. So, in AlCl3 solution, the chloride ions are already present, which might reduce the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect.\n\nSimilarly, in Mg(NO3)2 solution, the magnesium ions are already present, which might reduce the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nSo, perhaps MgCl2 would be least soluble in solutions that share ions with it, and most soluble in solutions that don't share any ions.\n\nBut wait, LiOH doesn't share any ions with MgCl2, as LiOH is lithium and hydroxide, while MgCl2 is magnesium and chloride. So, there's no common ion effect there.\n\nBut, LiOH is a strong base, and MgCl2 is a salt of a base (magnesium hydroxide) and hydrochloric acid. So, maybe there are some chemical reactions that could happen between LiOH and MgCl2.\n\nWait, magnesium hydroxide is slightly soluble in water, but it's a base, and LiOH is also a strong base. So, maybe there's some precipitation or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should look at the solubility product, Ksp, for MgCl2, but I don't have those values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or something, but that might be too complicated for this level.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, identify the nature of each solution:\n\nA. LiOH(aq): Strong base, fully ionized into Li+ and OH- ions.\n\nB. CBr4(aq): Nonpolar molecule, not expected to dissolve well in water.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq): Salt, fully ionized into Mg2+ and 2 NO3- ions.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq): Salt, partially ionized in water, forming Al3+ and Cl- ions.\n\nGiven that MgCl2 is a soluble salt, it should dissolve in water to form Mg2+ and 2 Cl- ions.\n\nNow, considering the common ion effect:\n\n- In Mg(NO3)2 solution, Mg2+ ions are already present, which might reduce the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect.\n\n- In AlCl3 solution, Cl- ions are already present, which might reduce the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect.\n\n- In LiOH solution, neither Li+ nor OH- are common ions with MgCl2, so no common ion effect.\n\nTherefore, MgCl2 should be most soluble in LiOH(aq) because there's no common ion effect reducing its solubility.\n\nBut wait, LiOH is a strong base, and MgCl2 is a salt of a base (magnesium hydroxide) and acid. Magnesium hydroxide is not very soluble, but in the presence of a strong base like LiOH, maybe there's some reaction that affects the solubility.\n\nLet me check the solubility of magnesium hydroxide. I know that magnesium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water, but in the presence of a strong base like LiOH, the hydroxide ions might react with magnesium ions to form more magnesium hydroxide precipitate, thereby reducing the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If I add MgCl2 to LiOH solution, the magnesium ions and hydroxide ions might react to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate, which would actually remove magnesium ions from solution, potentially increasing the solubility of MgCl2 beyond what it would be in pure water.\n\nBut I need to think carefully about this.\n\nLet me consider the solubility equilibrium of MgCl2 in water:\n\nMgCl2(s) <=> Mg2+(aq) + 2 Cl-(aq)\n\nIn LiOH solution, there are no common ions with MgCl2, so the solubility should be similar to that in pure water, assuming no other reactions.\n\nIn Mg(NO3)2 solution, there is Mg2+, which would shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nIn AlCl3 solution, there is Cl-, which would also shift the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nSo, based on this, LiOH solution should allow the highest solubility of MgCl2 among the options.\n\nBut what about the possibility of forming magnesium hydroxide precipitate in LiOH solution?\n\nLet me think about the reaction:\n\nMg2+(aq) + 2 OH-(aq) <=> Mg(OH)2(s)\n\nThis is a precipitation reaction. If I add MgCl2 to LiOH solution, the Mg2+ and OH- ions would react to form Mg(OH)2 precipitate. This would remove Mg2+ from solution, which might actually increase the solubility of MgCl2 beyond its normal solubility in water, as the precipitation reaction would pull more MgCl2 into solution to replace the Mg2+ being removed.\n\nHowever, this might not necessarily lead to increased solubility beyond what it would be in pure water, because the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Mg(OH)2 would limit how much Mg2+ can be present before precipitation occurs.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the solubility of MgCl2 in LiOH solution might not be higher than in pure water, and maybe the answer is that MgCl2 is most soluble in pure water, which isn't one of the options.\n\nBut since pure water isn't an option, perhaps I need to consider another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the fact that LiOH is a strong base and might affect the activity coefficients or something, but that seems too advanced for this level.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the fact that MgCl2 is an acid in the presence of a strong base like LiOH.\n\nWait, no, MgCl2 is the salt of a weak base (magnesium hydroxide) and a strong acid (HCl), so in the presence of a strong base like LiOH, maybe it would react to form more magnesium hydroxide.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for the solubility product constants or something, but I don't have those values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in CBr4(aq), which is nonpolar, MgCl2 wouldn't dissolve at all, so that's the least soluble option.\n\nBetween the other three options, LiOH has no common ions with MgCl2, Mg(NO3)2 shares Mg2+, and AlCl3 shares Cl-.\n\nSo, in Mg(NO3)2 and AlCl3 solutions, the common ion effect would reduce the solubility of MgCl2, while in LiOH solution, there's no common ion effect.\n\nTherefore, MgCl2 should be most soluble in LiOH(aq).\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about the potential precipitation reaction in LiOH solution.\n\nLet me try to think about it differently.\n\nSuppose I have pure water, and I add a small amount of MgCl2, it dissolves to give Mg2+ and Cl- ions.\n\nNow, if I add LiOH to this solution, the OH- ions could potentially react with Mg2+ to form Mg(OH)2 precipitate.\n\nBut this precipitation would remove Mg2+ from solution, which might actually drive more MgCl2 to dissolve to replace the Mg2+ being removed.\n\nHowever, this is a bit of a double-edged sword because as more MgCl2 dissolves, more Mg2+ is added, leading to more precipitation, and so on.\n\nIn reality, the solubility would be limited by the solubility product of Mg(OH)2.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the solubility of MgCl2 in LiOH solution isn't higher than in pure water, and maybe it's less due to the precipitation reaction.\n\nBut I'm really not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in LiOH solution, the OH- ions could react with Cl- ions or something, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fact that LiOH is a strong base and might hydrolyze the Mg2+ ions, but Mg2+ is not amphoteric, so it doesn't react with strong bases.\n\nI'm getting more confused.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to stick with the common ion effect argument: in solutions containing Mg2+ or Cl-, the solubility of MgCl2 is reduced, while in LiOH solution, which contains neither Mg2+ nor Cl-, the solubility is not reduced by common ions.\n\nTherefore, MgCl2 should be most soluble in LiOH(aq).\n\nSo, the answer is A.
