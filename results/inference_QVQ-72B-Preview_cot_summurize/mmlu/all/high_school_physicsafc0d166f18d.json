                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a rock is dropped off a cliff and hits the ground with a velocity of 30 m/s. I need to find out how high the cliff is. The options are 20 m, 30 m, 45 m, and 60 m.\n\nAlright, first things first, I know that when something is dropped, it's falling freely under the influence of gravity. So, I can use the equations of motion for free fall.\n\nI remember that the velocity of an object in free fall can be calculated using the equation v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and s is the displacement.\n\nIn this case, the rock is dropped, so the initial velocity u is 0 m/s. The final velocity v is 30 m/s, and the acceleration a is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2. I need to find the displacement s, which would be the height of the cliff.\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\n30\u00b2 = 0\u00b2 + 2 * 9.8 * s\n\nSo, 900 = 0 + 19.6 s\n\nThen, 900 = 19.6 s\n\nNow, solving for s: s = 900 / 19.6\n\nLet me calculate that: 900 divided by 19.6.\n\nWell, 20 * 19.6 = 392\n\n40 * 19.6 = 784\n\nSo, 45 * 19.6 should be 882\n\nWait, 45 * 20 = 900, but 45 * 19.6 is a bit less.\n\nActually, 45 * 19.6 = 882\n\nSo, 882 is less than 900.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a calculator for this, but since I don't have one, I'll try to estimate.\n\nIf 45 * 19.6 = 882, then to get to 900, I need an additional 18.\n\nSo, s \u2248 45 + (18/19.6)\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Maybe I should just divide 900 by 19.6 directly.\n\nSo, s = 900 / 19.6\n\nLet me see, 900 \u00f7 20 = 45, but since 19.6 is less than 20, s should be a bit more than 45.\n\nWait, actually, no. Since 19.6 is less than 20, dividing by 19.6 will give a larger result than dividing by 20.\n\nWait, no. Actually, dividing by a smaller number gives a larger result.\n\nWait, let's think about it: 900 \u00f7 20 = 45\n\n900 \u00f7 19.6 will be slightly more than 45 because 19.6 is less than 20.\n\nBut maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI can rearrange the equation: s = v\u00b2 / (2a) = 900 / (2 * 9.8) = 900 / 19.6\n\nWhich is the same as 900 \u00f7 19.6.\n\nLet me try to do this division step by step.\n\nFirst, 19.6 * 45 = 882\n\n900 - 882 = 18\n\nSo, 45 + (18/19.6)\n\nNow, 18 \u00f7 19.6 is approximately 0.918, so s \u2248 45.918 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, 45 m is one of them, and 60 m is another.\n\nBut wait, 45 is less than the actual value we calculated, which is approximately 45.918, and 60 is significantly higher.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the formula I used.\n\nYes, v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2as is the correct formula for free fall when only velocity and displacement are known.\n\nGiven u = 0, v = 30 m/s, a = 9.8 m/s\u00b2, s = ?\n\ns = v\u00b2 / (2a) = 900 / (2 * 9.8) = 900 / 19.6 \u2248 45.918 meters.\n\nSo, the closest option is 45 m.\n\nBut wait, the options are 20 m, 30 m, 45 m, and 60 m.\n\nI think the answer is 45 m.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any air resistance? Well, in ideal situations, we neglect air resistance, so my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the acceleration due to gravity isn't exactly 9.8 m/s\u00b2; maybe it's different based on location, but for the sake of this problem, I think 9.8 m/s\u00b2 is acceptable.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the equation for time in free fall: t = sqrt(2s / g)\n\nBut since I don't know time, that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use v = u + at to find time first, then find s.\n\nGiven v = 30 m/s, u = 0, a = 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nThen, t = v / a = 30 / 9.8 \u2248 3.06 seconds\n\nThen, s = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2 = 0 + (1/2)*9.8*(3.06)^2\n\nCalculate (3.06)^2 \u2248 9.3636\n\nThen, s \u2248 0.5 * 9.8 * 9.3636 \u2248 45.9 meters\n\nWhich again confirms s \u2248 45.9 meters.\n\nTherefore, the height of the cliff is approximately 45 meters.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 45 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
