                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this scenario about a truck driver who was making deliveries for his employer. He called his employer to say he was going for lunch and got approval, then pulled into a restaurant parking lot where he accidentally ran over and injured a pedestrian. Now, the injured person is suing both the driver and the driver's employer for negligence. The question is, is the employer liable?\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand the relationship between the driver and the employer. The driver was an employee, right? And he was making deliveries for his employer, which seems like part of his job duties. But he was on his way to lunch when the accident happened.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the driver was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Because if he was, then the employer might be held liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nLet me recall what vicarious liability means. It's when one person is held responsible for the actions of another person. In employment relationships, it's often referred to as \"respondeat superior,\" which is Latin for \"let the master answer.\" So, if an employee causes harm while acting within the scope of their employment, the employer can be held liable.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\n\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n\nHmm, option A suggests that vicarious liability applies, which seems plausible if the driver was acting within the scope of his employment. But was he?\n\nHe was going for lunch, which is a personal activity, generally outside the scope of employment. However, he did call his employer to get approval before going to lunch, and he was driving a company truck, which might suggest that he was still representing the company or performing work-related tasks.\n\nWait, but the fact that he was driving a company truck might be relevant. Maybe the employer expected him to use the truck even during lunch breaks, or perhaps he was supposed to be available for work during lunch.\n\nOption B says yes, because the employer owned the truck. But owning the vehicle doesn't automatically make the employer liable for the driver's actions. It's still about whether the driver was acting within the scope of employment.\n\nOption C says no, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment. That seems like a direct contradiction to option A. But as I thought earlier, lunch breaks are typically personal time, not work time.\n\nOption D says no, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another. Well, that's not entirely accurate. Vicarious liability does allow for liability to be imputed from the employee to the employer under certain circumstances.\n\nSo, D is probably incorrect based on that.\n\nNow, between A and C, it's a matter of whether the driver was within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If the driver was on a lunch break, which is a personal activity, generally, that's outside the scope of employment. However, there might be exceptions if the employer required the employee to remain on call or to use the company vehicle during lunch breaks.\n\nThe fact that he called for approval suggests that there might be some expectations from the employer regarding his lunch breaks.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nWait, the scenario says he was \"making deliveries for his employer.\" So, his primary task was delivering goods. He took a break to have lunch, which is a personal need, not directly related to his delivery duties.\n\nIn general, employees are not acting within the scope of their employment during lunch breaks because they are engaging in personal activities.\n\nTherefore, the employer might not be liable for the driver's actions during that time.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any way the employer could still be liable.\n\nIf the employer required the driver to use the company vehicle during lunch breaks or if the driver was still performing some work-related duties during lunch, then it might be considered within the scope of employment.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide that information. It just says he was going for lunch and got approval.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems like the driver was outside the scope of his employment during lunch, making the employer not liable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A is yes, because of vicarious liability. But vicarious liability requires that the employee was acting within the scope of employment, which seems not to be the case here during lunch.\n\nOption B is yes, because the employer owned the truck. But ownership of the vehicle isn't sufficient to impose liability; it's about the employee's actions being within the scope of employment.\n\nOption D is no, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another. But that's not accurate, as vicarious liability does allow for such imputation under certain conditions.\n\nSo, the best answer is C. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
