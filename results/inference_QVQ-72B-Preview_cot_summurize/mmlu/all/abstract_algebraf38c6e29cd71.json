                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If (G, .) is a group such that (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 for all a, b in G, then G is a what? The options are commutative semigroup, abelian group, non-abelian group, or none of these.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some definitions. A group (G, .) is a set G equipped with a binary operation \".\" that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Specifically:\n\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation a . b is also in G.\n\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a . b) . c = a . (b . c).\n\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for every a in G, e . a = a . e = a.\n\n4. Invertibility: For each a in G, there exists an element a^-1 in G such that a . a^-1 = a^-1 . a = e.\n\nNow, the problem states that for all a, b in G, (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1. I need to determine what this implies about the group G.\n\nI should recall that in group theory, the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in the reverse order. That is, in any group, (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1. This is a standard result.\n\nSo, if (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1 in general, but in this problem, it's given that (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1, then there must be some relationship between these two expressions.\n\nLet me set up an equation based on this. Since (ab)^-1 is equal to both b^-1 a^-1 and a^-1 b^-1, I can write:\n\nb^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1\n\nNow, I want to see what this tells me about the group G.\n\nTo simplify this equation, I can multiply both sides on the left by a and then on the right by b to cancel out the inverses. Let's try that:\n\nb^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1\n\nMultiply both sides on the left by a:\n\na b^-1 a^-1 = a a^-1 b^-1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na b^-1 a^-1 = e b^-1\n\nWhich is just:\n\na b^-1 a^-1 = b^-1\n\nSimilarly, multiply both sides on the right by b:\n\na b^-1 a^-1 b = b^-1 b\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na b^-1 e = e\n\nSo, a b^-1 = e\n\nBut this would imply that b^-1 = a^-1, which doesn't make sense in general for a group. This suggests that my approach might be flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider rearranging the equation b^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 to see if I can derive some property of the group.\n\nLet me try to rearrange it differently. Starting from:\n\nb^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1\n\nI can multiply both sides on the left by a and on the right by b to get:\n\na b^-1 a^-1 b = a a^-1 b^-1 b\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na b^-1 b = a b^-1 b\n\nWhich is:\n\na e = e\n\nSo, a = e, but this can't be true for all a in G unless G is the trivial group with only the identity element. But the problem assumes G is a group, so it likely has more than one element. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I need to consider taking inverses on both sides of the equation b^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1.\n\nTaking the inverse of both sides:\n\n(b^-1 a^-1)^-1 = (a^-1 b^-1)^-1\n\nWhich gives:\n\na b = b a\n\nWait a minute, this is interesting. So, a b = b a for all a, b in G.\n\nThis means that the group operation is commutative for all elements in G.\n\nBut hold on, in group theory, if the operation is commutative for all pairs of elements, then the group is called abelian.\n\nSo, if a b = b a for all a, b in G, then G is abelian.\n\nTherefore, based on this derivation, G should be an abelian group.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nStarting from b^-1 a^-1 = a^-1 b^-1, we took the inverse of both sides to get a b = b a.\n\nIs it valid to take the inverse of both sides in this way?\n\nYes, because in groups, the operation is invertible, and taking inverses is a valid operation.\n\nSo, if a b = b a for all a, b in G, then G is abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be B. abelian group.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any possibility that this conclusion is incorrect.\n\nSuppose G is not abelian, meaning there exist at least two elements a and b in G such that a b \u2260 b a.\n\nBut according to our earlier derivation, if (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1, then a b = b a for all a, b in G, which would force G to be abelian.\n\nTherefore, if G is not abelian, then (ab)^-1 \u2260 a^-1 b^-1 for some a, b in G.\n\nIn other words, the given condition (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 for all a, b in G implies that G is abelian.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. abelian group.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider some examples.\n\nFirst, take the group of integers under addition, (Z, +).\n\nThis is an abelian group.\n\nLet's check if (a + b)^-1 = a^-1 + b^-1 holds.\n\nWait, but addition doesn't have a multiplicative inverse in the usual sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of additive inverses.\n\nIn additive groups, the inverse of a is -a.\n\nSo, (a + b)^-1 = -(a + b) = -a + (-b)\n\nAnd a^-1 + b^-1 = (-a) + (-b) = -a + (-b)\n\nSo, (a + b)^-1 = a^-1 + b^-1 in this case.\n\nBut this is just a specific example, and it's abelian, which aligns with our conclusion.\n\nLet's consider another example, maybe the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication, (R*, \u00d7), which is also abelian.\n\nIn this group, (a * b)^-1 = 1/(a * b)\n\nAnd a^-1 * b^-1 = (1/a) * (1/b) = 1/(a * b)\n\nSo again, (a * b)^-1 = a^-1 * b^-1.\n\nThis also holds, and the group is abelian.\n\nNow, let's try a non-abelian group to see what happens.\n\nConsider the symmetric group S3, which is non-abelian.\n\nLet's pick two elements in S3 that do not commute.\n\nTake a = (1 2) and b = (2 3).\n\nThen, a * b = (1 2)(2 3) = (1 2 3)\n\nAnd b * a = (2 3)(1 2) = (1 3 2)\n\nSo, a * b \u2260 b * a, hence S3 is non-abelian.\n\nNow, let's check if (a * b)^-1 = a^-1 * b^-1.\n\nFirst, (a * b)^-1 = (1 2 3)^-1 = (1 3 2)\n\nAnd a^-1 * b^-1 = (1 2)^-1 * (2 3)^-1 = (1 2) * (2 3) = (1 2 3)\n\nBut (1 3 2) \u2260 (1 2 3), so (a * b)^-1 \u2260 a^-1 * b^-1.\n\nThis aligns with our earlier conclusion that if (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 for all a, b in G, then G must be abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. abelian group.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility that G could be a commutative semigroup but not a group.\n\nA commutative semigroup is a set with an associative and commutative operation, but it doesn't necessarily have an identity or inverses.\n\nHowever, the problem states that (G, .) is a group, so it must have an identity and inverses for all elements.\n\nTherefore, it's already a group, and the additional condition implies it's abelian.\n\nSo, the answer is B. abelian group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
