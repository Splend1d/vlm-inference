                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and what actions are being described. Then, I have to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on general moral standards in the US from around 2020. I should also consider the context and any relevant cultural or ethical norms.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1:\n\n\"I'm consistently losing in a video game, so I learn new strategies in order to win.\"\n\nOkay, so here's someone who's not doing well in a video game and decides to improve by learning new strategies to start winning. Now, learning new strategies in a video game seems like a perfectly normal and healthy way to get better at it. It's about improving skills and understanding the game better. There doesn't seem to be anything morally questionable about this. It's more about personal growth and adaptation.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance here that I'm missing. Is there any way that learning new strategies could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the strategies involve cheating or using hacks, that might be a different story. But the scenario specifically says \"I learn new strategies in order to win,\" without specifying how these strategies are obtained or what they entail. Assuming that these strategies are legitimate and fair within the game's rules, there's nothing inherently wrong with this.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, based on the information provided, it seems like the action is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2:\n\n\"I had to hide because she was mad I had cheated on her.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit more complex. Here, someone is hiding because another person is angry about them cheating. Cheating, in general, is considered morally wrong in many contexts, especially in relationships where trust is involved. In the US, infidelity is widely viewed as a betrayal of trust and a violation of the commitments made in a relationship.\n\nSo, the reason for hiding is that the person cheated, which is the morally questionable action. Therefore, the action that led to the need to hide\u2014cheating\u2014is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- Scenario 1: Learning new strategies in a video game to win \u2013 Not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Cheating on a partner \u2013 Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possibility that learning new strategies could be considered wrong? For example, if the strategies were learned by breaking the game's terms of service or by using external cheats. However, the scenario doesn't specify any unethical methods; it just says \"learning new strategies,\" which generally implies improving one's skills and knowledge within the game's intended design.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating is clearly stated, and it's a action that's almost universally condemned in monogamous relationships. The fact that the person is hiding suggests they know they did something wrong and are avoiding facing the consequences of their actions.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. The answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
