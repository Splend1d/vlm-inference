                    "text": "Let's see. I need to find the prime factorization of 77. The options are A. 7 \u2022 11\u00b2 \u2022 13, B. 7\u00b2 \u2022 11, C. 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 13, and D. 7 \u2022 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what prime factorization means. It's breaking down a number into its smallest prime number components. And exponents are used when a prime factor repeats.\n\nSo, starting with 77, I need to divide it by prime numbers starting from the smallest one.\n\nLet's try 2. 77 divided by 2 is 38.5, which is not an integer, so 2 is not a factor.\n\nNext, 3. 77 divided by 3 is approximately 25.666, which again isn't an integer.\n\nNow, 5. 77 divided by 5 is 15.4, still not an integer.\n\nNext is 7. 77 divided by 7 is 11. Oh, that's nice and clean. So, 7 is a factor.\n\nSo, 77 = 7 \u00d7 11.\n\nBut wait, let's check if 11 is a prime number. Yes, 11 is a prime number.\n\nSo, according to this, the prime factorization of 77 is 7 multiplied by 11.\n\nLooking at the options, that would be D. 7 \u2022 11.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other factors or if 11 can be further factored.\n\n11 is a prime number, so it can't be factored further into smaller primes.\n\nOption A suggests 7 \u2022 11\u00b2 \u2022 13. But 11\u00b2 is 121, and 7 \u00d7 121 is 847, which is much larger than 77.\n\nOption B is 7\u00b2 \u2022 11, which is 49 \u00d7 11 = 539, also larger than 77.\n\nOption C is 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 13. That's 7 \u00d7 11 = 77, and 77 \u00d7 13 = 1001, which is way bigger than 77.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct answer should be D. 7 \u2022 11.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed something. The question says \"use exponents where possible.\" But in this case, since 7 and 11 are both prime and don't repeat, there are no exponents needed.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if 77 could have other factors. Let's see, 77 divided by 7 is 11, and 11 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 4, so 11 is prime.\n\nAlternatively, we could try factoring 77 using a factor tree.\n\nStarting with 77, split it into 7 and 11. Both are primes, so that's the end of the tree.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization is indeed 7 \u2022 11.\n\nI think the other options are just there to confuse, or perhaps they relate to other numbers, but for 77, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. 7 \u2022 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 7 \\cdot 11} \\]"
