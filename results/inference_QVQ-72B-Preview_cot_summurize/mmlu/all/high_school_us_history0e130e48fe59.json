                    "text": "So I have this question about the colony of Pennsylvania, and I need to figure out which type of colony it was based on the options given. The options are:\n\nA. A charter colony in which the King granted a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists\n\nB. A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family\n\nC. A royal colony in which the King appointed the governor\n\nD. An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each type of colony entails.\n\nA charter colony is one where a group of people or businessmen receive a charter from the King, giving them the right to govern the colony according to the terms of the charter. The charter outlines the colony's boundaries, the rights of the colonists, and the powers of the governing body.\n\nA proprietary colony is one where the King grants land to an individual or a group, who then have the authority to govern the colony as they see fit, often passing down this right to their heirs. This means the proprietor has significant control over the colony's affairs.\n\nA royal colony is directly governed by the King, with a governor appointed by the King to ensure the colony adheres to the Crown's policies.\n\nAn independent colony would be one that governs itself without direct interference from the King or the Crown, which is somewhat unusual in the context of British colonies in North America, as most were under some form of British authority.\n\nGiven that William Penn was involved, I know that Pennsylvania was founded by him, and he was granted a charter by King Charles II. So, it was a proprietary colony, where Penn and his family had the authority to govern.\n\nBut let me double-check this understanding.\n\nWilliam Penn was an admiral and a Quaker, and he was granted a large tract of land in America by King Charles II in 1681 as payment of a debt owed to Penn's father. Penn then set about establishing the colony of Pennsylvania, which would serve as a refuge for Quakers and others seeking religious freedom.\n\nThe Charter of Privileges, granted by William Penn in 1701, is mentioned in the question. This document was essentially Pennsylvania's constitution, outlining the rights and liberties of the colonists, including the famous provision for religious freedom.\n\nGiven that Penn was granted the land by the King and had the authority to govern it, it fits the definition of a proprietary colony.\n\nA charter colony would involve a group of people or businessmen receiving a charter, but in this case, it was granted directly to Penn and his family.\n\nA royal colony would have a governor appointed by the King, which wasn't the case here, at least initially.\n\nAnd an independent colony governed outside the authority of the King doesn't align with what I know about Pennsylvania, as it was very much under British authority until the American Revolution.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the correct description of Pennsylvania.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that by the time of the Charter of Privileges in 1701, Pennsylvania was still governed as a proprietary colony.\n\nYes, Penn governed Pennsylvania until his death in 1718, and then his sons continued to govern until the American Revolution. So, throughout this period, it remained a proprietary colony.\n\nTherefore, the best description of Pennsylvania is indeed a proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
