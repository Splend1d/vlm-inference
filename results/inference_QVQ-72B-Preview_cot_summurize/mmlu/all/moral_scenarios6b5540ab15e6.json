                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario separately and apply moral standards to them. Moral standards can be tricky because they can vary based on context, culture, and individual beliefs, but here we're supposed to consider ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, I should think about general ethical principles that are widely accepted in American society during that time.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I ran over the fresh grass with a lawnmower.\"\n\nOkay, so running over fresh grass with a lawnmower. Is this morally wrong? At first thought, it seems like a fairly benign action. Mowing grass is a common chore, especially in residential areas, to keep lawns neat and tidy. It's part of maintaining property appearance and often required by local ordinances. So, mowing grass isn't inherently immoral; it's a standard practice.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the grass was newly planted or recently watered, and running over it could cause damage beyond just cutting the grass. If that's the case, then perhaps there's a moral consideration there, especially if it's someone else's property or if it goes against an agreement.\n\nWait, but the scenario doesn't specify whose grass it is or whether there was any agreement about not mowing it. It just says \"I ran over the fresh grass with a lawnmower.\" So, without more context, it's hard to judge. Maybe it's the person's own lawn, and they're just doing routine maintenance. In that case, it's not morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's someone else's grass and the person doesn't have permission to mow it, then it could be seen as trespassing or causing harm to someone else's property. But again, the scenario doesn't provide that information. So, based on the given details, I think it's safe to assume that mowing the grass isn't morally wrong, especially if it's part of regular lawn care.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"My rent was due, so I had to sell my guitar without telling my friend.\"\n\nThis one seems more complex. So, the person is facing financial pressure\u2014rent is due, which is a urgent obligation. To meet this financial need, they decide to sell their guitar but do so without informing their friend. The question is, is this action morally wrong?\n\nWell, first off, selling one's own possessions to meet financial obligations isn't inherently immoral. People often sell items they own to raise money when they need it. However, the issue here is that the person didn't tell their friend about selling the guitar.\n\nNow, the moral implications depend heavily on the relationship between the person and their friend, and whether there was any agreement or understanding about the guitar.\n\nIf the guitar was solely the person's property, and there was no agreement with the friend regarding its use or ownership, then selling it without\u544a\u77e5 might not be morally wrong, provided that the friend didn't have any expectations or rights over the guitar.\n\nHowever, if the guitar was co-owned, or if there was an understanding that the friend could use it whenever needed, or if the friend had expressed interest in buying it, then selling it without informing the friend could be seen as disrespectful or even dishonest.\n\nGiven that the scenario specifies \"without telling my friend,\" it suggests that there might be some relevance to the friend's feelings or rights in this situation. But without knowing the full context of their relationship or any prior agreements, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.\n\nIn general, transparency and honesty are valued in friendships and social interactions. If selling the guitar could affect the friend in some way or if the friend had some sentimental attachment to it, then not telling them could be considered morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend was unaware that the guitar was being sold, and the person felt compelled to sell it quickly to pay the rent, fearing that telling the friend might create complications or prevent the sale.\n\nIn such a case, the person might be prioritizing their immediate financial needs over the potential impact on their friend, which could be seen as self-serving or insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, if the guitar was solely the person's property and the friend had no claim to it, then perhaps there's no moral wrongdoing in selling it without\u544a\u77e5.\n\nBut even then, friendships are built on trust and openness, so withholding information about a significant decision like selling a valuable possession might still be morally questionable, especially if the friend would have had an interest in purchasing it or being informed about it for other reasons.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that there is a possibility of moral wrongdoings in Scenario 2, depending on the specifics of the situation and the relationship between the person and their friend.\n\nNow, comparing both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Mowing fresh grass with a lawnmower. Based on the information provided, this seems like a routine maintenance activity without any clear moral implications. Unless there's more context that suggests otherwise, it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Selling a guitar without telling a friend to pay rent. This scenario involves financial pressures and interpersonal relationships. While selling one's own guitar isn't inherently wrong, the act of not informing a friend could be seen as morally questionable, especially if the friend had some connection to the guitar or if transparency is valued in their relationship.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that Scenario 2 has a higher likelihood of being considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, whereas Scenario 1 does not clearly involve moral wrongdoings based on the provided information.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for the two scenarios respectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
