                    "text": "So I've got this question about bird songs and development. It's about an experiment where young male birds are raised in isolation and only hear the song of a different species. Then, when they're adults, their own song repertoire is missing some typical characteristics of their own species. The question is asking what this result suggests about how their species' song develops.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, what do we know about bird songs in general? I remember that bird songs are often a combination of innate (instinctive) and learned components. So, birds have some natural predisposition to sing certain ways, but they also learn by listening to other birds, usually males of their own species, during a critical period in their development.\n\nIn this experiment, the young males are raised in isolation, meaning they don't hear other birds of their own species. But they do hear the song of a different species. And as a result, their adult song repertoire lacks certain characteristics that are typical of their own species.\n\nSo, if they're not hearing their own species' song, and they're only hearing another species' song, it makes sense that they might not develop the typical song of their own species. This suggests that hearing the correct song model during development is important for learning the species-typical song.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Entirely learned during development\n\nB. Entirely instinctive\n\nC. Both instinctive and learned\n\nD. Dependent upon hormones for proper development\n\nGiven that the birds in the experiment didn't hear their own species' song but did hear another species' song, and their song repertoire is incomplete or lacks certain characteristics, it seems like they still developed some aspects of their song, but not all.\n\nThis implies that there is an innate component to their song, but certain parts require learning from conspecifics (their own species).\n\nOption A suggests the song is entirely learned. But if that were the case, and they heard another species' song, maybe they would adopt that song completely. However, the experiment shows that their song repertoire is incomplete, not that they have adopted the other species' song entirely.\n\nOption B says entirely instinctive. But if that were true, then hearing another species' song shouldn't affect their song development at all; they should still develop a fully typical song of their own species. But that's not what happened; their repertoire is lacking certain characteristics.\n\nOption C says both instinctive and learned. This seems plausible because it aligns with the idea that birds have an innate song template that they refine through learning from conspecifics. If they don't hear their own species' song, parts of their song that require learning are missing or incomplete.\n\nOption D mentions hormones. While hormones do play a role in bird song development, especially in males, the experiment doesn't provide any information about hormonal influences. So, it's probably not the best choice here.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is C. Both instinctive and learned.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIf the song were entirely learned, and the birds heard only another species' song, perhaps they would try to imitate that song, but the experiment says their repertoire lacks certain characteristics of their own species. So, it's not that they're imitating the other species completely, but they're missing parts of their own song.\n\nThis suggests that there is an innate component to their song that allows them to produce some elements without learning, but other parts require learning from conspecifics.\n\nTherefore, the song is a combination of instinctive and learned components.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
