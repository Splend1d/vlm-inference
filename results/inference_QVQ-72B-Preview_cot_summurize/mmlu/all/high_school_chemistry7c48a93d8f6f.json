                    "text": "So I have this question here about molecular shapes, and I need to identify which molecule has a tetrahedral shape from the options provided: PCl4F, BF3, CO2, and CBr4. I remember that in chemistry, the shape of a molecule is determined by the arrangement of its atoms, which is often predicted using the VSEPR theory. That stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory. Basically, it helps us understand how atoms are positioned around a central atom based on the repulsion between electron pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of each molecule. Let's start with PCl4F. Phosphorus pentachloride fluoride, I believe. Phosphorus (P) is the central atom, and it's bonded to four chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom. So, the formula is actually PCl4F, which means there are five atoms bonded to phosphorus. Wait a minute, but the formula given is PCl4F, which suggests that there are four chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom attached to phosphorus. So, that would make phosphorus the central atom with five bonds coming out of it: four to chlorine and one to fluorine.\n\nNow, according to VSEPR theory, if a central atom has five bonds, it should have a trigonal bipyramidal shape, not tetrahedral. So, PCl4F should have a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Therefore, it's not tetrahedral. Maybe I miscounted. Let me double-check. Phosphorus has five valence electrons, and it's forming five bonds: four to chlorine and one to fluorine. So, no lone pairs on phosphorus. Yes, trigonal bipyramidal shape.\n\nNext is BF3, boron trifluoride. Boron (B) is the central atom, and it's bonded to three fluorine atoms. So, boron has three bonds and no lone pairs. According to VSEPR, this should be trigonal planar. The shape is a flat triangle with boron in the center and the fluorines at the corners. So, trigonal planar, not tetrahedral.\n\nMoving on to CO2, carbon dioxide. Carbon (C) is the central atom, double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. Each oxygen also has two lone pairs. So, around carbon, there are two double bonds and no lone pairs. According to VSEPR, this should be linear. The molecule is straight with the oxygen atoms on either side of the carbon. So, linear, not tetrahedral.\n\nLastly, CBr4, tetrabromomethane. Carbon (C) is the central atom, bonded to four bromine atoms. Carbon has four bonds and no lone pairs. According to VSEPR, this should be tetrahedral. The four bromines are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion around the carbon, with each bromine at the corners of a tetrahedron.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, CBr4 should have a tetrahedral shape. Therefore, the correct answer is D. CBr4.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recap:\n\n- PCl4F: trigonal bipyramidal\n\n- BF3: trigonal planar\n\n- CO2: linear\n\n- CBr4: tetrahedral\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the molecule with a tetrahedral shape is CBr4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
