                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which answer is correct. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are four people who own a property together. They decide to convey the property to one of their adult children. This conveyance is a deed in fee simple, which means the adult child now owns the property outright, right?\n\nNow, there's a purchase-money mortgage on the property. That means when they bought the property, they took out a mortgage, and all four of them signed a promissory note as security for this loan. So, all four are liable for repaying this mortgage.\n\nAt the time they conveyed the property to the adult child, the loan wasn't paid off yet. So, there's still a mortgage on the property.\n\nThe adult child starts making the mortgage payments after getting the property. But then, at some point, the adult child stops making those payments and conveys the property again to a bona fide purchaser who didn't do a title search.\n\nNow, this bona fide purchaser is someone who buys the property in good faith, without knowing about any defects in the title. But because they didn't do a title search, they didn't find out about the existing mortgage on the property.\n\nSo, the purchaser is now holding the property, but there's still a mortgage lien on it from the original loan that hasn't been paid off.\n\nThe purchaser decides to sue the adult child (their grantor) to get an order compelling the adult child to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from the property.\n\nNow, the defendants in this case make a motion to dismiss. The question is, will the court more than likely grant this motion to dismiss?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, that's the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\n\nSo, this option suggests that because the purchaser didn't do a title search, they assumed the risk of any existing liens or encumbrances on the property. Normally, a title search would reveal any mortgages or liens, and a title company would ensure that these are taken care of at closing.\n\nSince the purchaser didn't do that, they might be considered to have assumed the risk of the existing mortgage. Therefore, they can't force the adult child to pay it off.\n\nB. Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\n\nThis option seems to suggest that only the original owners can be compelled to pay off the mortgage, and even then, it would require them to pay it in full.\n\nBut, the adult child is one of the original owners, right? Wait, no. The adult child received the property from the four owners, so the adult child is not one of the original four owners.\n\nWait, no. The four owners conveyed the property to the adult child, who is the child of one of them. So, the adult child is not one of the original four owners.\n\nBut, the adult child took over the mortgage payments initially. Now, the purchaser is suing the adult child to compel them to pay the mortgage and remove the lien.\n\nSo, according to this option, the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full. But, the adult child is not one of the original four owners, so maybe this doesn't apply directly.\n\nThis option seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's not the best choice.\n\nC. No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.\n\nThis option suggests that the court won't grant the motion to dismiss and will instead order the original four owners to defend the adult child in this matter.\n\nIt also states that the adult child has no legal responsibility for the mortgage. But, wait\u2014the adult child took over the mortgage payments after receiving the property. Does that mean they assumed some responsibility for the mortgage?\n\nHowever, just because they were making payments doesn't necessarily mean they are legally responsible for the mortgage, especially if the original mortgage was in the names of the four owners.\n\nBut, the adult child is now the owner of the property, and the mortgage is likely attached to the property, not just to the original borrowers.\n\nSo, perhaps the adult child is responsible for the mortgage as the current owner, even if they weren't the original borrowers.\n\nThis option seems to suggest that the adult child isn't responsible, which might not be accurate.\n\nD. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n\nThis option proposes that the court won't dismiss the case and will instead order the adult child to start making mortgage payments again and find a way to pay off the mortgage soon.\n\nThis seems like a possible solution, but it assumes that the adult child has the ability to obtain another loan to pay off the existing mortgage.\n\nAlso, it's not clear whether the adult child is still owning the property or if they have already conveyed it to the bona fide purchaser.\n\nWait, the adult child conveyed the property to the bona fide purchaser, who is now the owner. So, ordering the adult child to pay off the mortgage might not directly help the current owner, the bona fide purchaser.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to think about this differently.\n\nThe bona fide purchaser bought the property from the adult child without knowing about the existing mortgage because they didn't do a title search.\n\nIn general, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of prior claims may have some protections, but it depends on the jurisdiction and specific laws regarding real estate transfers.\n\nHowever, in many places, failing to do a title search is considered negligence, and the purchaser may be responsible for any existing liens or mortgages on the property.\n\nSo, perhaps the purchaser assumed the risk by not doing a title search and therefore can't force the adult child to pay off the mortgage.\n\nThat would lean towards option A.\n\nBut let's consider if the adult child had any obligations to disclose the existence of the mortgage.\n\nIf the adult child knew about the mortgage and didn't disclose it to the purchaser, that could be fraudulent or at least negligent misrepresentation.\n\nBut, the problem states that the purchaser didn't do a title search, so perhaps they should have known about the mortgage.\n\nStill, in some jurisdictions, the seller has a duty to disclose known defects in the title.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should stick with the most straightforward answer.\n\nOption A seems to make the most sense: the purchaser took a risk by not doing a title search, and therefore they can't force the adult child to pay off the mortgage.\n\nSo, the motion to dismiss would likely be granted because the purchaser doesn't have a strong case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
