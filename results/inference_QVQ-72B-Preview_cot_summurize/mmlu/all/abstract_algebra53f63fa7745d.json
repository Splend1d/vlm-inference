                    "text": "So I have these two statements about groups and subgroups, and I need to figure out which ones are true. I'm a bit rusty on group theory, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic definitions. A group \\( G \\) is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. A subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is a subset of \\( G \\) that is itself a group under the operation of \\( G \\).\n\nNow, statement 1 says: If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of a group \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) belongs to \\( G \\), then \\( aH = Ha \\).\n\nHmm, I think this is related to the concept of cosets in group theory. For any subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) and any element \\( a \\) in \\( G \\), the left coset \\( aH \\) is the set of all elements of the form \\( ah \\) where \\( h \\) is in \\( H \\), and the right coset \\( Ha \\) is the set of all elements of the form \\( ha \\) where \\( h \\) is in \\( H \\).\n\nSo, the statement is claiming that for any subgroup \\( H \\) and any element \\( a \\) in \\( G \\), the left coset \\( aH \\) is equal to the right coset \\( Ha \\).\n\nWait a minute, I think this is not always true. I recall that in general, left and right cosets of a subgroup need not be equal. In fact, the condition that left and right cosets are equal for all \\( a \\) in \\( G \\) is a defining property of a normal subgroup.\n\nYes, that's it. A subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is called normal if and only if for every \\( a \\) in \\( G \\), \\( aH = Ha \\). So, statement 1 is actually false because not every subgroup is normal; only normal subgroups have the property that left and right cosets are equal for all \\( a \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nOkay, moving on to statement 2: If \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) belongs to \\( G \\), then \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nSo, here \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), and we're saying that for any \\( a \\) in \\( G \\) and any \\( h \\) in \\( H \\), \\( ah = ha \\). That is, every element of \\( G \\) commutes with every element of \\( H \\).\n\nI need to check if this is always true when \\( H \\) is normal.\n\nI know that \\( H \\) being normal means that for every \\( a \\) in \\( G \\), \\( aH = Ha \\), which implies that \\( aHa^{-1} = H \\). But does this necessarily mean that every element of \\( H \\) commutes with every element of \\( G \\)?\n\nLet me think about this. If \\( H \\) is normal, then for every \\( a \\) in \\( G \\), \\( aHa^{-1} = H \\), which means that \\( aha^{-1} \\) is in \\( H \\) for every \\( h \\) in \\( H \\). But this doesn't directly imply that \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nIn other words, conjugation by \\( a \\) sends \\( h \\) to \\( aha^{-1} \\), which is in \\( H \\), but unless \\( aha^{-1} = h \\), which would imply that \\( ah = ha \\), these elements don't necessarily commute.\n\nSo, just because \\( H \\) is normal doesn't mean that every element of \\( H \\) commutes with every element of \\( G \\). There could be elements in \\( G \\) that don't commute with elements in \\( H \\), even if \\( H \\) is normal.\n\nLet me try to find a counterexample to statement 2.\n\nConsider the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\), which is the group of permutations of three elements. Let \\( H \\) be a subgroup of \\( S_3 \\), say \\( H = \\{e, (12)\\} \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity permutation and \\( (12) \\) is the transposition swapping 1 and 2.\n\nNow, \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( S_3 \\) if and only if it is equal to its conjugates under every element of \\( S_3 \\). Let's check if \\( H \\) is normal.\n\nTake an element \\( a = (13) \\) in \\( S_3 \\). Then, \\( aHa^{-1} = (13)H(13) \\).\n\nCompute \\( (13)(12)(13) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( (13)(12) = (123) \\), because applying \\( (12) \\) and then \\( (13) \\) gives \\( (123) \\).\n\nThen, \\( (123)(13) = (132) \\), because applying \\( (13) \\) and then \\( (123) \\) gives \\( (132) \\).\n\nSo, \\( aHa^{-1} = \\{ e, (132) \\} \\), which is not equal to \\( H = \\{ e, (12) \\} \\). Therefore, \\( H \\) is not normal in \\( S_3 \\).\n\nWait, I wanted to find a normal subgroup. Maybe I should choose \\( H \\) differently.\n\nLet's try \\( H = \\{ e, (123), (132) \\} \\), which is the subgroup of even permutations, also known as the alternating group \\( A_3 \\).\n\nIs \\( A_3 \\) normal in \\( S_3 \\)? Yes, because the index of \\( A_3 \\) in \\( S_3 \\) is 2, and a subgroup of index 2 is always normal.\n\nNow, let's see if for every \\( a \\) in \\( S_3 \\) and every \\( h \\) in \\( A_3 \\), \\( ah = ha \\).\n\nTake \\( a = (12) \\), which is in \\( S_3 \\) but not in \\( A_3 \\), and \\( h = (123) \\), which is in \\( A_3 \\).\n\nCompute \\( ah = (12)(123) = (13) \\), and \\( ha = (123)(12) = (132) \\).\n\nClearly, \\( ah \\neq ha \\), since \\( (13) \\neq (132) \\).\n\nTherefore, even though \\( A_3 \\) is normal in \\( S_3 \\), not every element of \\( A_3 \\) commutes with every element of \\( S_3 \\). This shows that statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false. But let me double-check if there are any cases where they are true.\n\nFor statement 1, it's only true if \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\), which is not always the case.\n\nFor statement 2, it's only true if \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup and every element of \\( G \\) commutes with every element of \\( H \\). But as the counterexample shows, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
