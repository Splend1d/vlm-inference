                    "text": "So I've got this question about jaundice, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of hemolytic anemia.\" Hmm, I thought pale stools and dark urine were more related to obstructive jaundice, not hemolytic anemia. In hemolytic anemia, the red blood cells break down too quickly, leading to increased bilirubin production, which can cause jaundice. But I don't recall pale stools and dark urine being primary symptoms of this type. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'll keep this in mind.\n\nOption B: \"Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\" Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right. Bilirubin is actually a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells. The liver processes bilirubin and excretes it in bile. It's not used in the synthesis of red blood cells. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\" Now, this rings a bell. Obstructive jaundice occurs when there's a blockage in the bile ducts, which can lead to buildup of bile acids in the blood, causing itching. I think this is a correct statement.\n\nOption D: \"Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional.\" This seems ethically and medically questionable. Intravenous drug users can be at risk for infections like hepatitis or HIV, which could cause jaundice. It's important to follow proper infection control procedures and label samples appropriately to protect healthcare workers and prevent cross-contamination. So, saying it's optional doesn't seem right.\n\nAlright, let's summarize:\n\n- A: Pale stools and dark urine are more associated with obstructive jaundice, not hemolytic anemia.\n\n- B: Bilirubin is from the breakdown of red blood cells, not used in their synthesis.\n\n- C: Itching is indeed a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\n- D: Infection control measures aren't optional; they're mandatory for safety.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option C: Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
