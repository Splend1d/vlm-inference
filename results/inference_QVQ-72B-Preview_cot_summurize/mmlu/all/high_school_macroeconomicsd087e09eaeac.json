                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of an expansionary supply shock. The options are:\n\nA. Rapidly increasing wages\n\nB. A greatly depreciated currency\n\nC. Declining labor productivity\n\nD. Lower factor prices in major industries\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an expansionary supply shock is. From what I recall, a supply shock is an unexpected change in the price of inputs that affects the overall production capacity of an economy. An expansionary supply shock, also known as a positive supply shock, is one that increases the economy's production capacity, leading to higher output and potentially lower prices.\n\nSo, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Rapidly increasing wages\n\nIf wages are increasing rapidly, that might seem like a good thing for workers, but from a production perspective, higher wages can increase the cost of labor for companies. This could lead to higher production costs, which might reduce the supply of goods and services. That sounds more like a contractionary supply shock, not an expansionary one.\n\nOption B: A greatly depreciated currency\n\nCurrency depreciation means that the value of a country's currency has decreased relative to other currencies. This can make imports more expensive and exports cheaper. For domestic producers, cheaper exports might lead to increased demand, but the overall effect on production capacity isn't immediately clear. It could lead to increased production if exports rise, but it also depends on the elasticity of supply and demand. However, generally, currency depreciation is more associated with inflationary pressures rather than a direct expansionary supply shock.\n\nOption C: Declining labor productivity\n\nLabor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per unit of labor. If labor productivity is declining, that means workers are producing less output per hour worked. This could lead to higher production costs and potentially higher prices, which would be a contractionary supply shock.\n\nOption D: Lower factor prices in major industries\n\nFactor prices refer to the costs of the inputs used in production, such as labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship. If factor prices decrease in major industries, that would reduce the cost of production for firms in those industries. Lower production costs could encourage firms to produce more, increasing supply and potentially decreasing prices. This sounds like an expansionary supply shock.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A: Increasing wages \u2192 higher production costs \u2192 contractionary\n\n- B: Depreciated currency \u2192 potentially higher production costs (if imports are needed) or increased exports \u2192 mixed effects\n\n- C: Declining labor productivity \u2192 higher production costs \u2192 contractionary\n\n- D: Lower factor prices \u2192 lower production costs \u2192 increased supply \u2192 expansionary\n\nBased on this analysis, option D seems to be the best example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nBut wait, let's think about option B a bit more. If a currency depreciates, imports become more expensive, which could increase production costs for firms that rely on imported inputs. This could lead to higher prices and reduced supply, which would be a contractionary supply shock. On the other hand, exports become cheaper, which could lead to increased demand and potentially increased production, which might be expansionary. However, the net effect depends on the specific structure of the economy and the balance between imports and exports.\n\nGiven that, it seems that currency depreciation is more likely to lead to inflationary pressures rather than a direct increase in production capacity. Therefore, it's probably not the best example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nSo, sticking to my initial conclusion, option D\u2014lower factor prices in major industries\u2014is the most straightforward example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Suppose lower factor prices in major industries lead to increased profits for those industries. With higher profits, firms might invest more in capital, leading to increased production capacity in the long run. This would definitely be an expansionary supply shock, as it increases the economy's ability to produce goods and services.\n\nYes, that reinforces my initial thought.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Lower factor prices in major industries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
