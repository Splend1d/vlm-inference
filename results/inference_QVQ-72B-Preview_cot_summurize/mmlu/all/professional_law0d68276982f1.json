                    "text": "Let's dive into this property law scenario. It's a bit involved with multiple conveyances and recordings, so I need to keep track of each step carefully. The question mentions that the state in question has a \"notice-type statute,\" which is important because it will determine the priority of interests based on whether subsequent purchasers have actual notice of prior unrecorded deeds.\n\nFirst, let's map out the timeline of events:\n\n1. February 1: A woman conveys her farm to a man, and he records the conveyance immediately.\n\n2. February 2: The man conveys the property to his sister but she does not record her deed.\n\n3. February 4: The man conveys the farm again to a friend, who knows about the prior conveyance to the sister but proceeds anyway and records the conveyance.\n\n4. February 5: The friend sells the farm to a farmer for $115,000, and the farmer buys it without knowing about the sister's conveyance and records the deed.\n\n5. February 6: The sister finally records her deed.\n\nNow, I need to determine who has the superior claim to the property under a notice-type recording statute.\n\nLet's recall what a notice-type statute entails. Generally, these statutes provide that a subsequent purchaser takes priority over a prior unrecorded deed if the subsequent purchaser records their deed first and had no actual notice of the prior deed.\n\nSo, the priority generally goes to:\n\n- A recorded deed over an unrecorded one, if the subsequent purchaser had no notice of the prior unrecorded deed.\n\n- An unrecorded deed over a recorded one, if the subsequent purchaser had actual notice of the prior unrecorded deed before recording.\n\nLet's apply this step by step.\n\nStarting from February 1:\n\n- The woman conveys to the man, and he records it immediately. So, he has a recorded interest.\n\nFebruary 2:\n\n- The man conveys to his sister, but she does not record her deed. So, her interest is unrecorded.\n\nFebruary 4:\n\n- The man conveys again to the friend, who records the conveyance, knowing about the sister's prior conveyance.\n\nAt this point, the friend records his deed, which is subsequent to the man's recording but prior to the sister recording hers.\n\nFebruary 5:\n\n- The friend sells to the farmer, who records the deed without having notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\nFebruary 6:\n\n- The sister finally records her deed.\n\nNow, let's consider the various conveyances and recordings:\n\n1. Man's conveyance (recorded February 1)\n\n2. Sister's conveyance (unrecorded until February 6)\n\n3. Friend's conveyance (recorded February 4)\n\n4. Farmer's conveyance (recorded February 5)\n\nWait a minute, the man's conveyance is recorded first on February 1. Then, the sister's conveyance is unrecorded until February 6, but the man has already conveyed it to the friend on February 4, who records it on the same day.\n\nUnder a notice-type statute, the friend records his deed on February 4, but he had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance. Does that affect his priority?\n\nIn a notice statute, if a subsequent purchaser records without actual notice of a prior unrecorded deed, they take priority. However, in this case, the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance. So, even though he records his deed, his knowledge of the sister's prior claim might affect his priority.\n\nBut, the sister has not recorded her deed yet when the friend records his. So, between the friend's recorded deed (February 4) and the sister's unrecorded deed (recorded February 6), the friend's recorded deed would prevail because the sister's deed was unrecorded, and the friend had actual knowledge of it.\n\nWait, but under notice statutes, if the subsequent purchaser records without notice of a prior unrecorded deed, they take priority. Here, the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance, but he recorded his deed anyway. So, does that mean his recording is ineffective against the sister's unrecorded deed?\n\nI think I need to look up the specific provisions of a notice-type recording statute.\n\nUpon checking, a notice recording statute generally provides that:\n\n- A subsequent bona fide purchaser for value who records their deed without actual notice of a prior unrecorded deed has priority over the prior unrecorded deed.\n\n- If the subsequent purchaser had actual notice of the prior unrecorded deed, then the prior unrecorded deed takes priority over the subsequent recorded deed.\n\nIn this case, the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance, so his recording on February 4 would not give him priority over the sister's unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the sister's unrecorded deed would have priority over the friend's recorded deed, despite her later recording date, because the friend had actual notice of her prior conveyance.\n\nHowever, the sister had not recorded her deed when the friend recorded his, so perhaps the friend's recording would still be effective against her since she hadn't yet recorded.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider it this way:\n\n- The man's conveyance to the sister is unrecorded.\n\n- The friend, knowing about the sister's conveyance, records his own conveyance from the man.\n\n- Under a notice statute, since the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, his recording does not give him priority over the sister's unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the sister's unrecorded deed takes priority over the friend's recorded deed.\n\nBut then, the sister records her deed on February 6, after the friend has already recorded his on February 4.\n\nIn this scenario, since the friend recorded first and had actual knowledge of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, the sister's later recording would not give her priority over the friend's earlier recorded deed.\n\nWait, but according to the notice statute principles, the friend's recording should not give him priority over the sister's prior unrecorded deed because he had actual notice of it.\n\nThis seems contradictory. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consult a standard property law textbook.\n\nAccording to the notice recording statute, generally:\n\n- A subsequent bona fide purchaser for value who records without notice of a prior unrecorded deed has priority.\n\n- If the subsequent purchaser has actual notice of the prior unrecorded deed, then the prior unrecorded deed has priority, even if the subsequent purchaser records first.\n\nSo, in this case, since the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance, his recording on February 4 would not give him priority over the sister's unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the sister's unrecorded deed would have priority over the friend's recorded deed.\n\nBut then, the sister records her deed on February 6, after the friend has already recorded his on February 4.\n\nIn this situation, since the friend's recording was ineffective against the sister's prior unrecorded deed due to his actual notice, the sister's later recording should give her priority over the friend's deed.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If the friend's recording doesn't give him priority over the sister's unrecorded deed because he had notice, then the sister's recording should solidify her priority.\n\nSo, perhaps the sister's recording on February 6 gives her priority over the friend's recording on February 4, given that his recording was ineffective against her unrecorded deed.\n\nBut, the friend sold to the farmer on February 5, who recorded the deed without having notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\nThe farmer records on February 5, before the sister records on February 6, and the farmer had no notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\nUnder the notice statute, since the farmer recorded without actual notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, the farmer's recording should give him priority over the sister's unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's recorded deed on February 5 would prevail over the sister's unrecorded deed.\n\nThen, the sister records her deed on February 6, after the farmer has already recorded his deed on February 5.\n\nSince the farmer recorded first without actual notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, the farmer's deed should have priority over the sister's later recording.\n\nTherefore, the farmer would be the one with the superior claim to the property.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the friend gave the farm to the farmer for $115,000, and the farmer recorded the deed without notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\nHowever, the friend had already conveyed the property to the farmer based on his own conveyance from the man, but the friend's conveyance was invalid because the man had already conveyed the property to the sister.\n\nWait a second, the man conveyed the property to the sister on February 2, then to the friend on February 4.\n\nBut the man had already conveyed the property to the sister, so could he legally convey it again to the friend?\n\nIn general, once a property is conveyed, the grantor no longer has the right to convey it again unless there's some agreement or the first conveyance is invalid.\n\nIn this case, the man conveyed to the sister on February 2, but she didn't record it. Then he conveyed again to the friend on February 4, who recorded it.\n\nUnder the notice statute, since the friend had actual knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance, his conveyance should not be valid against the sister's prior unrecorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the friend did not have good title to convey to the farmer, because his own title was defective due to his knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's deed is defective because the friend did not have good title to convey.\n\nSo, perhaps the farmer does not have the superior claim after all.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider the concept of a bona fide purchaser.\n\nA bona fide purchaser (BFP) is someone who purchases property without notice of any other claims or interests in the property and gives valuable consideration for it.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- The man conveys to the sister on February 2, unrecorded.\n\n- The man conveys to the friend on February 4, who records it.\n\n- The friend sells to the farmer on February 5, who records it without notice of the sister's conveyance.\n\n- The sister records her deed on February 6.\n\nUnder the notice statute, the farmer, as a subsequent purchaser without notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, should have priority over the sister's deed because he recorded first.\n\nHowever, the friend's conveyance to the farmer is questionable because the friend's own title was defective due to his knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the friend did not have good title to convey to the farmer.\n\nBut the farmer was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the sister's conveyance, and he recorded his deed before the sister.\n\nSo, perhaps the farmer's recording gives him priority over the sister's later recording, despite the friend's defective title.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to consider that the friend's recording on February 4 put the sister on constructive notice of his claim, even though his recording was ineffective against her unrecorded deed due to his actual knowledge.\n\nThen, when the farmer purchased on February 5 and recorded on February 5, he was purchasing with notice of the friend's recorded deed from February 4.\n\nHowever, the farmer had no actual notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed.\n\nUnder the notice statute, since the farmer recorded without actual notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed, he should have priority over her deed.\n\nTherefore, the farmer would have the superior claim.\n\nBut, considering that the friend's title was defective due to his knowledge of the sister's prior conveyance, does that affect the farmer's title?\n\nProbably not, because the farmer was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the sister's claim.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's recording on February 5 would give him priority over the sister's later recording on February 6.\n\nHence, the farmer would be the one who ultimately prevails.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sister's unrecorded deed has priority over the friend's recorded deed because the friend had actual knowledge of her prior conveyance.\n\nThen, when the sister records her deed on February 6, her priority is established over the friend's recorded deed.\n\nHowever, the farmer has already recorded his deed on February 5, before the sister, and he had no actual notice of her prior unrecorded deed.\n\nUnder the notice statute, the farmer's recording without actual notice of the sister's prior unrecorded deed should give him priority over her deed.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's recording on February 5 prevails over the sister's recording on February 6.\n\nAdditionally, the man's original conveyance to the sister was not recorded until February 6, while the farmer recorded on February 5.\n\nTherefore, the farmer's recording would take precedence over the sister's later recording, especially since the farmer was a bona fide purchaser without notice.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the farmer would have the superior claim to the property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ The farmer.}} \\]"
