                    "text": "So I have this problem about an ideal gas. It says that the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8. I need to find out what happens to the pressure, P. The options are:\n\nA. P decreases by a factor of 16.\n\nB. P decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nC. P decreases by a factor of 2.\n\nD. P increases by a factor of 4.\n\nOkay, first things first, I know that for an ideal gas, there's this equation called the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT. Here, P is pressure, V is volume, T is temperature, n is the number of moles, and R is the ideal gas constant.\n\nNow, in this problem, the number of moles, n, should be constant because it's the same gas, right? So, n is not changing.\n\nThe problem says the temperature is increased by a factor of 2. That means T final is 2 times T initial.\n\nAnd the volume is increased by a factor of 8. That means V final is 8 times V initial.\n\nI need to find out how P changes. So, I need to relate P initial to P final.\n\nLet me write down the initial and final states.\n\nInitial state: P_initial, V_initial, T_initial.\n\nFinal state: P_final, V_final = 8 * V_initial, T_final = 2 * T_initial.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law for both states:\n\nInitial: P_initial * V_initial = n * R * T_initial.\n\nFinal: P_final * V_final = n * R * T_final.\n\nSince n and R are constants, I can set up a ratio to eliminate n and R.\n\nSo, P_initial * V_initial / (n * R * T_initial) = P_final * V_final / (n * R * T_final).\n\nSimplifying, the n and R cancel out, so:\n\nP_initial * V_initial / T_initial = P_final * V_final / T_final.\n\nNow, plug in V_final and T_final:\n\nP_initial * V_initial / T_initial = P_final * (8 * V_initial) / (2 * T_initial).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\nP_final * (8 V_initial) / (2 T_initial) = P_final * (4 V_initial) / T_initial.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP_initial * V_initial / T_initial = P_final * 4 V_initial / T_initial.\n\nNow, I can cancel V_initial and T_initial from both sides:\n\nP_initial = P_final * 4.\n\nWait, that means P_final = P_initial / 4.\n\nSo, the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. P decreases by a factor of 16.\n\nB. P decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nC. P decreases by a factor of 2.\n\nD. P increases by a factor of 4.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of combined gas law.\n\nFor ideal gases, the combined gas law is P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nGiven that, and plugging in V2 = 8 V1 and T2 = 2 T1, we get:\n\nP1 V1 / T1 = P2 * 8 V1 / 2 T1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nP1 V1 / T1 = P2 * 4 V1 / T1.\n\nCancel V1 and T1:\n\nP1 = 4 P2.\n\nWait, that would imply P2 = P1 / 4, which again means pressure decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I got P_final = P_initial / 4, and now again the same.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of pressure and temperature relationship, keeping volume constant first, and then volume and temperature relationship, keeping pressure constant, but that might be more complicated.\n\nBut since it's an ideal gas, and both temperature and volume are changing, it's best to use the combined gas law, which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. P decreases by a factor of 4.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about the physical meaning.\n\nIf temperature increases by a factor of 2, that tends to increase pressure, but volume increases by a factor of 8, which tends to decrease pressure.\n\nSo, the net effect is that pressure decreases, and specifically by a factor of 4.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
