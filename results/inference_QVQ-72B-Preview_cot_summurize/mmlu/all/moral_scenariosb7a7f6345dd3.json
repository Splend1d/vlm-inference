                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: I'm walking past a pond and see a drowning child. Instead of helping, I continue walking because I don't want my expensive shoes to get tarnished. Hmm, that sounds pretty bad. I mean, most people would think that saving a drowning child is the right thing to do, right? Not helping seems really wrong, especially since the reason is protecting my shoes. It feels like a clear case of valuing material possessions over a human life, which is generally considered morally unacceptable.\n\nSecond scenario: I ate the produce before paying. Okay, so this is about eating something before you've paid for it. I think in many places, especially grocery stores or farmers' markets, there are samples that you can eat, but usually, you're supposed to pay for what you consume. If I ate produce without paying, that's like taking something without paying for it, which sounds a lot like stealing. And stealing is definitely considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be morally wrong. But let me double-check. In the first scenario, not helping a drowning child when you can is seen as a failure to act, which some might argue is different from actively doing something wrong. However, in many moral frameworks, if you have the ability to help someone in danger without risking your own life, not helping is still considered wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, eating produce before paying is pretty straightforward\u2014it's taking something that isn't yours yet, which is generally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a difference in severity here. Not helping a drowning child seems more serious than eating produce before paying. But the question is asking about whether they're clearly morally wrong, not about the degree of wrongness.\n\nAnother thought: maybe in some circumstances, not helping a drowning child could be understandable or excusable, like if the person was in shock or didn't know how to swim. But in this scenario, it says they continued walking to avoid tarnishing their shoes, which suggests they could have helped but chose not to for selfish reasons.\n\nAs for eating produce before paying, it's pretty clear-cut. Unless there's some cultural or contextual exception I'm missing, it's generally wrong to eat something without paying for it.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, both scenarios seem to be clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any way the first scenario could be not wrong. Maybe if the person didn't see the child drowning or thought someone else was already helping, but the scenario says they saw the drowning child and continued walking, knowing the risk to their shoes. That seems intentional and avoidable.\n\nAs for the second scenario, perhaps if the produce was free for tasting, but generally, you still need to pay for what you consume, even if you eat it on the spot.\n\nOverall, I think both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020. So, my final answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
