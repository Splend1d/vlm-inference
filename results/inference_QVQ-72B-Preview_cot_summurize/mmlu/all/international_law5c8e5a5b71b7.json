                    "text": "So I have this question about the legal nature of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). There are four options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the UDHR is. I know that it's a document that outlines fundamental human rights to be universally protected. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, right after World War II, as a response to the horrors of that conflict.\n\nOption A says that the UDHR is a multilateral treaty. Hmm, I think a multilateral treaty is an agreement between multiple countries that is legally binding. For example, the United Nations Charter is a multilateral treaty. But I don't think the UDHR is a treaty; it's more of a declaration. Let me confirm that.\n\nOption B says that the UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution. That sounds familiar. I remember that the General Assembly passes resolutions on various issues, and the UDHR was indeed adopted by the General Assembly. But is it just a resolution, or is it something more?\n\nOption C mentions the UN Security Council resolution. The Security Council deals with peace and security issues and has the authority to make binding decisions. But the UDHR was not adopted by the Security Council; it was adopted by the General Assembly. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption D says that the UDHR is a declaration adopted by several States at an international conference. Well, it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, which consists of member states, so in a way, it was adopted by multiple states. But I think there's a difference between a General Assembly resolution and a declaration adopted at an international conference.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to understand what constitutes a declaration versus a resolution. A declaration is often a statement of principles or intentions, whereas a resolution is a formal expression of the opinion or will of a legislative body.\n\nIn the context of the UN, resolutions passed by the General Assembly are generally not legally binding, unlike resolutions from the Security Council, which can be enforceable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.\n\nThe UDHR was adopted by the General Assembly as a resolution, specifically Resolution 217 A (III) on December 10, 1948. So, it's a resolution of the General Assembly, not the Security Council.\n\nBut it's often referred to as a declaration. So, perhaps it's a specific type of resolution that's called a declaration. In fact, many human rights instruments are declarations adopted by the General Assembly.\n\nLet me check if there's a difference between a resolution and a declaration in the UN context. I think that a declaration is a type of resolution that sets out principles or guidelines, often in a non-binding manner. So, the UDHR is a declaration adopted by the General Assembly, which makes it a resolution, but not a legally binding one.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The UDHR is a multilateral treaty: No, it's not a treaty; it's a declaration.\n\nB. The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution: Yes, that's accurate.\n\nC. The UDHR is a UN Security Council resolution: No, it was adopted by the General Assembly.\n\nD. The UDHR is a declaration adopted by several States at an international conference: While technically true, it was adopted by the General Assembly, which is composed of member states, but it's more precise to say it's a General Assembly resolution.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer is B. The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution.\n\nBut wait, option D also seems plausible. After all, the General Assembly is composed of member states, and when it adopts a declaration, it's like adopting it collectively as states. However, I think that option B is more precise because it specifies the body of the UN that adopted it.\n\nMaybe I should consider that sometimes declarations are adopted at international conferences separate from the General Assembly, like the International Conference on Civil and Political Rights, which led to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But the UDHR was specifically adopted by the General Assembly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is B. The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
