At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset.

                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage from William Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation, and it's about the early days of the Pilgrims in what would become Massachusetts. They're interacting with the local Indians, and there's a guy named Samoset who can speak some English because he's been around English fishermen in the east. He tells the Pilgrims about another Indian, Squanto, who is from the area and has been to England and speaks even better English.\n\nThe question is asking about why the area was already important to Europeans in the 1620s, and the options are fishing, farming, mining, or shipbuilding.\n\nLet me think about this. The passage mentions that Samoset is from the eastern parts where English ships come to fish. So, that suggests that fishing was an activity that attracted Europeans to the region.\n\nI remember from history class that New England had rich fishing grounds, especially for cod, which was a valuable resource in Europe because of dietary restrictions and demand.\n\nBut let's see if there's any mention of farming, mining, or shipbuilding in the passage.\n\nThe passage says that the Indians were skulking about, sometimes showing themselves from afar, but running away when approached. It also mentions that they stole some tools while the Pilgrims were at dinner.\n\nThen Samoset comes along, speaking broken English, and tells them about the eastern parts where English ships fish. He also mentions Squanto, who is from the area and has been to England.\n\nSo, again, the reference to fishing is clear here.\n\nNow, about farming: the Pilgrims were farmers, and they did establish farms in Plymouth. But the passage doesn't specifically mention farming by Europeans yet in the area.\n\nMining: I don't recall any mention of mining in early New England colonies. I think mining for gold and silver was more associated with the Spanish in South America or later American westward expansion.\n\nShipbuilding: New England did become known for shipbuilding later on, especially in ports like Boston. But I think that was more in the 18th century and beyond. In the early 17th century, I'm not sure if shipbuilding was a major activity yet.\n\nSo, based on the information in the passage and my general knowledge, it seems like fishing was the primary reason Europeans were interested in the region at that time.\n\nLet me double-check. The passage specifically mentions English ships coming to fish in the eastern parts, and Samoset had learned English from them.\n\nAlso, the fact that Squanto had been to England suggests there was some interaction between the natives and the English, possibly through the fishing trade.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. fishing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
