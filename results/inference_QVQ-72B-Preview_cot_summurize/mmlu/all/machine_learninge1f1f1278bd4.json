                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about machine learning concepts. Let me try to understand each one separately.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: It says that the derivative of the sigmoid function \u03c3(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1} with respect to x is equal to the variance of a Bernoulli random variable B, where B is parameterized by \u03c3(x). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the derivative of \u03c3(x) with respect to x. So, \u03c3(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}. Let's compute its derivative using the chain rule.\n\nLet u = 1 + e^{-x}, then \u03c3(x) = u^{-1}.\n\nSo, d\u03c3/dx = -u^{-2} * du/dx.\n\nNow, du/dx = -e^{-x}.\n\nTherefore, d\u03c3/dx = -u^{-2} * (-e^{-x}) = e^{-x} / (1 + e^{-x})^2.\n\nSimplifying this, I can write it as \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)).\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. I recall that the variance of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter p is p(1 - p). So, if B ~ Bern(\u03c3(x)), then Var(B) = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)).\n\nBut earlier, I derived that d\u03c3/dx = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)). So, according to this, the derivative of \u03c3(x) with respect to x is indeed equal to the variance of B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. Is it always true that d\u03c3/dx = \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x))?\n\nLet me verify the derivative again.\n\n\u03c3(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}\n\nUsing the chain rule:\n\nd\u03c3/dx = -1 * (1 + e^{-x})^{-2} * (-e^{-x}) = e^{-x} / (1 + e^{-x})^2.\n\nNow, \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)) = (1 / (1 + e^{-x})) * (1 - 1 / (1 + e^{-x})) = (1 / (1 + e^{-x})) * (e^{-x} / (1 + e^{-x})) = e^{-x} / (1 + e^{-x})^2.\n\nYes, it matches. So, the derivative of \u03c3(x) with respect to x is indeed \u03c3(x)(1 - \u03c3(x)), which is Var(B).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: It says that setting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 changes the bias-variance trade-off such that the model's variance increases and the model's bias decreases.\n\nOkay, let's think about this. In neural networks, bias parameters are used to shift the activation functions. If we set all bias parameters to 0, what does that imply?\n\nWell, without bias terms, the activation functions are centered at the origin. This might restrict the flexibility of the model because the decision boundaries will always pass through the origin.\n\nIn terms of bias and variance:\n\n- Bias refers to the error due to erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. A high-bias model is overly simplistic and may underfit the data.\n\n- Variance refers to the error due to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. A high-variance model is overly complex and may overfit the data.\n\nIf we remove the bias terms, making the model less flexible, it's likely that the model becomes simpler and might underfit the data. That is, the bias increases because the model is making stronger assumptions about the data.\n\nOn the other hand, since the model is less flexible, it might be less sensitive to the noise in the training data, which could potentially decrease the variance.\n\nBut wait, Statement 2 says that setting biases to 0 increases variance and decreases bias. That seems counterintuitive based on my understanding.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer. If we set all biases to 0, the activation functions will be centered at zero, which might limit the model's ability to represent complex functions. This could lead to higher bias because the model is less capable of capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nAs for variance, if the model is less flexible, it might be less prone to overfitting the training data, which would imply lower variance.\n\nTherefore, it seems that setting biases to 0 would increase bias and decrease variance, which is the opposite of what Statement 2 claims.\n\nLet me check some resources to confirm this.\n\nI recall that in the bias-variance trade-off, increasing model complexity typically decreases bias but increases variance, and vice versa. So, if we make the model simpler by setting biases to 0, we should see increased bias and decreased variance.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor Statement 1, I confirmed that the derivative of the sigmoid function is indeed equal to the variance of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \u03c3(x). So, that checks out.\n\nFor Statement 2, based on my understanding of the bias-variance trade-off and how model complexity affects bias and variance, setting biases to 0 should make the model simpler, thus increasing bias and decreasing variance. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the final answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
