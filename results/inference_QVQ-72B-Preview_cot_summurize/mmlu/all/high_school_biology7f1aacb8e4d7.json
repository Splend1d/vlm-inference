                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about cellular respiration, and I need to pick the correct statement from the options provided. I'm a bit rusty on some parts of cellular respiration, but I'll try to work through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is released from glycolysis. Hmm, I thought glycolysis happens in the cytoplasm and doesn't produce much CO2. Let me recall: Glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate, and in aerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). It's in the citric acid cycle where CO2 is produced. So, I think Option A is incorrect because CO2 is mainly produced in the citric acid cycle, not in glycolysis.\n\nOption B states that protons are pumped through ATP synthase by active transport. I remember that in cellular respiration, especially in the electron transport chain, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a gradient. This gradient drives the production of ATP when protons flow back through ATP synthase. But is this active transport? Active transport typically requires energy, like ATP, to move molecules against their gradient. In this case, the proton gradient is generated by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons out of the matrix using the energy from electron transfers. So, it's somewhat similar to active transport because it's using energy to create the gradient, but it's not directly using ATP for this purpose. Maybe it's more accurate to say that the proton pump in the electron transport chain creates a gradient driven by the electron flow, not by direct ATP consumption. So, perhaps this option is not entirely correct.\n\nOption C says that the final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is NAD+. Wait, I thought the final electron acceptor in cellular respiration is oxygen, which combines with electrons and protons to form water. NAD+ is actually an electron carrier that gets reduced to NADH during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and then donates its electrons to the electron transport chain. So, NAD+ is not the final electron acceptor; it's more of an intermediate carrier. Therefore, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D states that ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction. Endergonic reactions require energy, while exergonic reactions release energy. In cellular respiration, ATP synthesis is an endergonic process because it requires energy to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. This process is coupled with exergonic reactions, such as the electron transport chain, which releases energy as electrons are passed through a series of proteins to oxygen. The energy released from the exergonic reactions is used to drive the endergonic ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. So, this seems accurate.\n\nGiven this analysis, it appears that Option D is the correct statement about cellular respiration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
