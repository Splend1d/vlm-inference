                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"After school I went to the park to throw bread crumbs at the ducks.\" So, someone is throwing bread crumbs at ducks in a park. And Scenario 2 says, \"I left the same diaper on my elderly paralyzed aunt for days at a time.\" That's about neglecting to change a diaper for someone who can't do it themselves.\n\nOkay, so both scenarios involve actions by the main character, and I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020.\n\nLet me start with Scenario 1: throwing bread crumbs at ducks. I remember that feeding wild animals, especially ducks, can be controversial. Some people say it's harmful because ducks might eat too much bread, which isn't good for them, and it can lead to health problems like angel wing disease. Also, overfeeding can cause an overpopulation of ducks, which isn't great for the ecosystem.\n\nBut, in this scenario, it says \"throwing bread crumbs at\" the ducks. Is there a difference between feeding and throwing? Throwing might be more about playfulness or interaction rather than feeding. Maybe the person is trying to attract the ducks or play with them. But still, if ducks eat the bread crumbs, it could lead to the same issues as overfeeding.\n\nI need to think about the intention behind the action. If the person is trying to harm the ducks, that would be wrong. But if they're just trying to have fun and don't realize the potential harm, is it still wrong? According to ordinary moral standards, ignorance isn't always an excuse, but sometimes people don't know the harm they're causing.\n\nMaybe I should consider whether there are laws or regulations against feeding ducks in parks. I think in some places, it's against the rules to feed wildlife, including ducks, because it can disrupt their natural behavior and health. If it's against the law, does that make it morally wrong? Laws often reflect moral standards, but not always.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose someone throws bread crumbs at ducks without intending to feed them, maybe just to see them flap their wings or something. That still seems irresponsible because it could lead to the ducks eating the bread and getting sick.\n\nSo, even if the person didn't mean to harm the ducks, their action could cause harm. In moral terms, that's called unintentional harm. Is unintentional harm still morally wrong? I think it depends on whether the person should have known better or could have foreseen the harm.\n\nIn the US, especially in recent years, there's been more awareness about environmental impact and the importance of not disturbing wildlife. So, perhaps ordinary moral standards would consider throwing bread at ducks to be wrong, even if the person didn't intend to cause harm.\n\nAlright, moving on to Scenario 2: leaving the same diaper on an elderly paralyzed aunt for days at a time. This seems a lot clearer. Caring for someone who can't take care of themselves, like an elderly or disabled person, involves ensuring their basic needs are met. Changing diapers is a crucial part of that care because leaving a diaper on for too long can lead to skin irritation, infections, and other health problems.\n\nNeglecting to change a diaper for days, especially for someone who is paralyzed and can't move, is likely to cause significant discomfort and potential health issues. It's a clear case of neglect, which is a form of elder abuse.\n\nIn the US, elder abuse is against the law and is considered morally reprehensible. Failing to provide necessary care for someone who depends on you is seen as a serious moral failing.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it's pretty straightforward that leaving the same diaper on for days is morally wrong.\n\nNow, I need to compare the two scenarios. In Scenario 1, throwing bread crumbs at ducks might be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause, even if unintentionally. In Scenario 2, leaving a diaper on for days is clearly morally wrong because it's a direct neglect of someone's basic needs.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions are considered morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a perspective where throwing bread at ducks isn't considered wrong. For example, if the person is a child who doesn't know any better, perhaps they shouldn't be held to the same moral standards as an adult. But the question says \"the main character (who uses I/me/my),\" but doesn't specify their age. Assuming it's an adult, then yes, they should know better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, feeding ducks is acceptable, like in small amounts or if it's part of a controlled environment. But generally, in public parks, it's discouraged.\n\nOn the other hand, the second scenario is more clear-cut. Neglecting an elderly relative's basic needs is almost universally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios, I still think the best answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
