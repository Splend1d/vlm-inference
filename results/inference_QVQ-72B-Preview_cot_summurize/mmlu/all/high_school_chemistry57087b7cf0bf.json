                    "text": "So I have this question about Lewis structures and bond lengths. I need to look at the molecules CO2, CO32-, NO2-, and NO3- and figure out which one has the shortest bonds. I'm a bit rusty on Lewis structures and how bond lengths relate to them, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Lewis structure is. It's a diagram that shows the valence electrons of atoms and how they bond together. Single bonds are one pair of electrons shared between two atoms, double bonds are two pairs shared, and triple bonds are three pairs shared. Generally, the more bonds between two atoms, the shorter the bond length because the atoms are pulled closer together.\n\nSo, if I can determine the type of bonds in each of these molecules, I can make an educated guess about which one has the shortest bonds.\n\nLet's start with CO2, carbon dioxide. I know that carbon has four valence electrons, and each oxygen has six. In CO2, carbon is connected to two oxygen atoms. The total valence electrons are 4 (from carbon) + 2*(6 from oxygen) = 16 electrons. Wait, but I think the rule is that the sum of valence electrons for neutral molecules is equal to the group number, which for CO2 should be group 4, but maybe I'm confusing something. Anyway, I recall that in CO2, the carbon is double-bonded to each oxygen. So, two double bonds: C=O and C=O. That makes sense because carbon needs four bonds, and each double bond provides two bonds.\n\nNext, CO32-, carbonate ion. This is an ion with a 2- charge, meaning it has two extra electrons compared to neutral CO3. Carbon has four valence electrons, each oxygen has six, so total valence electrons are 4 + 3*6 = 22, plus the two extra electrons from the charge, making it 24 valence electrons. The structure should have one carbon atom connected to three oxygen atoms. I think the carbonate ion has one carbon double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to the other two, but I might be mistaken. Wait, actually, in resonance structures, all three C-O bonds are equivalent, somewhere between single and double bonds. So, perhaps it's best to consider that all three C-O bonds are similar in length, but not exactly double or single.\n\nMoving on to NO2-, nitrite ion. Nitrogen has five valence electrons, and each oxygen has six. The total valence electrons are 5 + 2*6 = 17, plus the one extra electron from the charge, making it 18 valence electrons. The structure should have nitrogen connected to two oxygen atoms. I recall that in NO2-, there is a double bond between nitrogen and one oxygen, and a single bond with the other oxygen. So, similar to CO2, but with only two oxygen atoms.\n\nLastly, NO3-, nitrate ion. Nitrogen has five valence electrons, each oxygen has six, so total valence electrons are 5 + 3*6 = 23, plus the one extra electron from the charge, making it 24 valence electrons. The structure should have nitrogen connected to three oxygen atoms. I think in NO3-, all three N-O bonds are equivalent due to resonance, similar to CO32-, so they are all somewhere between single and double bonds.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- CO2: two C=O double bonds\n\n- CO32-: three equivalent C-O bonds, between single and double\n\n- NO2-: one N=O double bond and one N-O single bond\n\n- NO3-: three equivalent N-O bonds, between single and double\n\nFrom this, I can see that CO2 has two double bonds, which are shorter than single bonds. CO32- and NO3- have bonds that are between single and double, so their bond lengths should be longer than double bonds but shorter than single bonds. NO2- has one double bond and one single bond, so it has a mix.\n\nTherefore, among these molecules, CO2 has the shortest bonds because both of its C-O bonds are double bonds, which are shorter than the bonds in the other molecules.\n\nWait a minute, but what about NO2-? It has one double bond and one single bond. So, on average, its bonds would be longer than CO2's double bonds but shorter than CO32-'s or NO3-'s bonds, which are between single and double. But since it has a mix, maybe the average bond length is still longer than CO2's double bonds.\n\nStill, CO2 has two pure double bonds, while the others have at least some single-bond character or are averaged to something less than double bonds.\n\nI think my conclusion remains that CO2 has the shortest bonds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the bond orders. Bond order is the number of bonds between two atoms, and generally, higher bond order corresponds to shorter bond length.\n\nIn CO2, each C-O bond order is 2 (double bond).\n\nIn CO32-, the average bond order is approximately 1.333 (since there are three single bonds plus one extra bond due to resonance).\n\nIn NO2-, the bond orders are 2 and 1, so average is 1.5.\n\nIn NO3-, the bond order is approximately 1.333, similar to CO32-.\n\nSo, again, CO2 has the highest bond order for its bonds, hence the shortest bond length.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me recall some actual bond lengths. I remember that in carbon monoxide, CO, the bond length is quite short because it's a triple bond. But here, we're dealing with CO2, which has double bonds, which should be longer than a triple bond but shorter than a single bond.\n\nSimilarly, in nitrogen dioxide, NO2, the double bond is shorter than the single bond, but still longer than the double bond in CO2.\n\nAnd in carbonate and nitrate ions, the bonds are delocalized, so they should be longer than double bonds but shorter than single bonds.\n\nTherefore, yes, CO2 should have the shortest bonds among these options.\n\nI think the answer is A. CO2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ CO_2} \\]"
