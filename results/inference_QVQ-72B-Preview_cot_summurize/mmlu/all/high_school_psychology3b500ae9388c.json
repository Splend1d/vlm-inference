Hmm, I need to remember how the eye works. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that the eye is like a camera, right? Light comes in and focuses on the retina, which sends signals to the brain. But where does the light actually enter the eye? Let's think about the structure of the eye.\n\nI recall that the cornea is the clear front part of the eye that helps focus light. Behind the cornea, there's the iris and the lens. The iris is like the pupil, which gets bigger or smaller depending on how much light there is. So, maybe the iris has an opening that lets light in.\n\nWait, no. The iris is the colored part of the eye, and the pupil is the black circle in the center, which is the opening that allows light to pass through. So, perhaps the pupil is part of the iris. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the pupil is the central opening in the iris. So, light passes through the cornea, then through the pupil (which is in the iris), and then through the lens, which focuses the light onto the retina.\n\nSo, the light enters through the cornea, then the pupil, then the lens, and finally reaches the retina. Now, the question is asking about the opening through which light enters the eye. So, it's probably referring to the pupil.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. lens \u2013 The lens is where the light passes through after the pupil, but it's not an opening; it's a transparent structure that focuses the light.\n\nB. retina \u2013 That's where the light ends up after being focused; it's not an opening.\n\nC. iris \u2013 That's the part that contains the pupil, which is the opening that allows light to pass through.\n\nD. blind spot \u2013 That's a point on the retina where the optic nerve exits; it's not an opening and doesn't involve light entry.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. iris, because the pupil, which is the opening for light, is part of the iris.\n\nWait a minute, but the pupil is actually the opening in the iris, not the iris itself. So, is the pupil considered part of the iris? I think so. In that case, selecting C. iris would be correct because the pupil is within the iris.\n\nLet me double-check. If I look up a diagram of the eye, I can see that the iris is the structure that controls the size of the pupil, which is the actual opening. So, yes, the pupil is part of the iris.\n\nTherefore, light enters the eye through the pupil, which is an opening in the iris. So, the answer is C. iris.\n\nI should make sure there isn't any confusion with the other options. The lens is involved in focusing the light, but it's not the entry point. The retina is where the light is detected, and the blind spot is a specific area on the retina where no light detection occurs because it's where the optic nerve exits the eye.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that C. iris is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. iris}} \\]"
