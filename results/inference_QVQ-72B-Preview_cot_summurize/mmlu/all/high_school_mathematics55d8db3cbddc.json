                    "text": "I've got this problem here. It says that the point (3,6) is on the graph of y = g(x), and that h(x) = [g(x)]\u00b2 for all x. I need to find a point that must be on the graph of y = h(x), and then find the sum of the coordinates of that point. The options are 12, 36, 39, and 13.\n\nAlright, first, I need to understand what it means for a point to be on the graph of a function. If (3,6) is on y = g(x), that means that g(3) = 6. So, when you plug in x = 3 into g, you get y = 6.\n\nNow, h(x) is defined as [g(x)]\u00b2. So, for any x, h(x) is just g(x) squared. Therefore, if I know g(x), I can find h(x) by squaring it.\n\nSince I know g(3) = 6, I can find h(3) by plugging in x = 3 into h(x). So, h(3) = [g(3)]\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the point (3, 36) must be on the graph of y = h(x). Now, I need to find the sum of the coordinates of that point, which is 3 + 36 = 39.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 39 is the answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nThe problem says \"there is one point that must be on the graph of y = h(x).\" And I've concluded that (3, 36) is such a point, with the sum of coordinates being 39.\n\nIs there any other point that must be on the graph of y = h(x) based on the given information?\n\nWell, the only information given is that (3,6) is on y = g(x), which implies g(3) = 6. Therefore, h(3) = [g(3)]\u00b2 = 36, so (3,36) is on y = h(x).\n\nI don't think there's enough information to determine any other specific point on y = h(x), so this should be the only point that must be on the graph based on the given information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nLet me consider the function h(x) = [g(x)]\u00b2. Since g(3) = 6, then h(3) = 36, as I already concluded.\n\nIs there any possibility of another point on the graph of y = h(x) that can be determined from this information?\n\nWell, perhaps if g(x) is known to be a specific function, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says y = g(x), and we know one point on it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe g(x) could be any function passing through (3,6), and h(x) is its square. But in that case, h(x) would depend on what g(x) is, beyond just knowing g(3) = 6.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"and h(x) = [g(x)]\u00b2 for all x\", so for any x, h(x) is the square of g(x). So, regardless of what g(x) is for other x, as long as g(3) = 6, h(3) = 36.\n\nTherefore, (3,36) is indeed on the graph of y = h(x), and the sum of its coordinates is 3 + 36 = 39.\n\nLooking back at the options, 39 is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be another point that must be on the graph of y = h(x) based on the given information.\n\nSuppose g(x) is only known at x = 3, so we don't have information about g(x) at other points. Therefore, we can't determine h(x) for x \u2260 3, because we don't know g(x) for those x-values.\n\nHence, the only point on y = h(x) that we can be certain of, based on the given information, is (3,36), with the sum of coordinates being 39.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{39} \\]"
