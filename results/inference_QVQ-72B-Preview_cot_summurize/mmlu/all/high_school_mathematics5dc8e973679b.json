                    "text": "So I have this problem here: John has 12 marbles of different colors, including one red, one green, and one blue marble. I need to find out in how many ways he can choose 4 marbles, with the condition that exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. There are 12 marbles, all different colors, and among them are one red, one green, and one blue marble. So, these three are distinct, and the rest are other colors.\n\nI need to choose 4 marbles, and exactly one of them should be red, green, or blue. That means, out of the 4 chosen marbles, only one is red, green, or blue, and the other three are from the remaining marbles.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I can break it down into steps:\n\n1. Choose which one of the red, green, or blue marbles will be in the group of 4.\n\n2. Then, choose the remaining 3 marbles from the other 9 marbles (since there are 12 total marbles minus the 3 red, green, and blue marbles that we're only choosing one from).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see:\n\nTotal marbles: 12\n\nRed, green, blue: 3 marbles\n\nOther marbles: 12 - 3 = 9 marbles\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step 1: Choose 1 out of the 3 red, green, blue marbles. The number of ways to do this is C(3,1), where C(n,k) is the combination formula.\n\nStep 2: Choose 3 out of the remaining 9 marbles. The number of ways to do this is C(9,3).\n\nThen, the total number of ways should be the product of these two, since these are independent choices.\n\nSo, total ways = C(3,1) * C(9,3)\n\nI need to calculate this.\n\nFirst, C(3,1) is straightforward: 3.\n\nNow, C(9,3) is calculated as 9! / (3! * (9-3)! ) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9*8*7*6!) / (3*2*1 * 6!) ) = (9*8*7)/(3*2*1) = (9/3) * (8/2) * (7/1) = 3 * 4 * 7 = 84.\n\nSo, C(9,3) = 84.\n\nTherefore, total ways = 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options:\n\nA. 252\n\nB. 276\n\nC. 441\n\nD. 84\n\nSo, 252 is one of the options. But let me double-check if my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 4 marbles out of 12, without any restrictions, is C(12,4).\n\nBut there is a restriction here: exactly one of them should be red, green, or blue.\n\nSo, perhaps another way is to calculate C(12,4) minus the number of ways where more than one of them is red, green, or blue.\n\nBut no, that doesn't seem right because I need exactly one, not excluding more than one.\n\nWait, actually, another approach could be:\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly one red, green, or blue marble and three others.\n\nWhich is C(3,1) * C(9,3), which is what I did earlier, giving 252.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate it differently to confirm.\n\nLet me think about it step by step again.\n\nWe have 12 marbles: 3 special colors (red, green, blue) and 9 others.\n\nWe need to choose 4 marbles with exactly one from the special colors.\n\nSo, first, choose 1 from the 3 special ones: C(3,1)\n\nThen, choose 3 from the 9 others: C(9,3)\n\nMultiply them: C(3,1) * C(9,3) = 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nChoose positions for the marbles, but since order doesn't matter, combinations are appropriate.\n\nAnother way: total ways to choose 4 out of 12, minus the ways where none are special, minus the ways where two or more are special.\n\nSo, C(12,4) - [C(9,4) + C(3,2)*C(9,2) + C(3,3)*C(9,1)]\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's better to calculate it directly as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the positions differently, but I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 252.\n\nLet me check if there's any other way to interpret \"exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue.\"\n\nDoes this mean that exactly one is from the special colors, and the rest are not, or could there be more?\n\nNo, it clearly says exactly one, so only one is special, and the other three are not.\n\nSo, yes, my calculation should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 252.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 252\n\nB. 276\n\nC. 441\n\nD. 84\n\nSo, option A is 252.\n\nAlternatively, if I had miscounted, say, choosing more than one special, but I don't think so.\n\nLet me see, maybe there's another way to calculate it.\n\nTotal marbles: 12\n\nSpecial marbles: 3 (red, green, blue)\n\nOther marbles: 9\n\nWe need to choose 4 marbles with exactly one special.\n\nSo, number of ways = number of ways to choose 1 special * number of ways to choose 3 others.\n\nWhich is C(3,1) * C(9,3) = 3 * 84 = 252.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the special marble can be in any of the four positions, but since we're dealing with combinations, it's already accounted for.\n\nWait, no, in combinations, the order doesn't matter, so it's already considered.\n\nTherefore, I think 252 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the special marble is fixed in one position, but in combinations, it's already accounted for by choosing one from the three.\n\nSo, I think 252 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{252} \\]"
