                    "text": "So I have this question here about simple and complex foragers. It's asking for one of the differences between them, and there are four options. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what simple and complex foragers are. From what I remember in anthropology class, foragers are people who live by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants for food. Simple foragers might have less advanced tools and techniques, while complex foragers have more developed methods and technologies for obtaining food.\n\nOption A says that complex foragers employ irrigation technology. Hmm, irrigation is usually associated with agriculture, not foraging. Foragers don't typically cultivate plants; they rely on wild resources. So, maybe this isn't a characteristic of complex foragers.\n\nOption B says that complex foragers rely on a wider range of food sources. That seems counterintuitive. If they're more complex, wouldn't they focus on specific, more reliable sources? Wait, maybe not. Perhaps they have a broader understanding of their environment and can exploit more types of food when needed.\n\nOption C says that complex foragers are more highly mobile. Again, I'm a bit confused. Some foraging societies are highly mobile, moving frequently to follow food sources, while others might settle in one place for longer periods if the resources are abundant. Maybe complexity doesn't necessarily determine mobility.\n\nOption D says that complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources. This seems plausible. If a society has advanced techniques, they might be able to exploit certain resources more effectively and therefore rely more on those specific food sources.\n\nLet me think about this again. Simple foragers probably have limited technology and might need to rely on a variety of food sources to ensure they have enough to eat. Complex foragers, with better tools and techniques, might be able to specialize in certain resource-rich areas, like coastal regions with abundant fish or areas with large game animals.\n\nBut wait, option B says complex foragers rely on a wider range of food sources. If they have better technology, maybe they can exploit more types of resources that simpler foragers can't access. For example, using traps or nets for fishing, which allow them to catch more types of fish.\n\nOn the other hand, some complex foragers might focus on a single abundant resource, like the Inuit focusing on seal hunting. So, maybe it's not always about relying on a wider range, but about having the technology to exploit a particular resource more intensively.\n\nI need to consider this carefully. Maybe both options B and D can be true in different contexts. Perhaps some complex foragers focus on a few key resources, while others diversify their food sources.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"one of the differences,\" so I need to pick one option that is accurately describing a difference between simple and complex foragers.\n\nLet me eliminate option A first because irrigation seems more related to agriculture, which is not typically associated with foraging.\n\nOption C, higher mobility, might not be accurate because some simple foragers are highly mobile, while some complex foragers might be more sedentary if they have reliable food sources.\n\nBetween options B and D, I think option D is a better answer. Complex foragers often do focus on a few highly productive resources, thanks to their advanced technologies and techniques. For example, coastal foragers might specialize in fishing, while inland groups might focus on hunting large game.\n\nSo, I'll go with option D: complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
