                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a survey conducted by the local newspaper to assess support for an increase in the gasoline tax to fund the county school system. The school committee member is lobbying for this increase, and the survey is trying to understand what the residents think about it. Now, the question is asking for the population of interest in this scenario.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. All school-aged children\n\nB. All county residents\n\nC. All county residents with school-aged children\n\nD. All county residents with children in the county school system\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First off, a population of interest is the group that the survey is trying to gather information from. It's the group whose opinions or characteristics are being studied.\n\nIn this case, the survey is about assessing support among county residents for an increase in the gasoline tax to support the school system. So, it's aiming to understand the views of the residents in the county regarding this tax increase.\n\nOption A is \"all school-aged children.\" But wait a minute, school-aged children might not necessarily be the primary decision-makers when it comes to taxation policies. They might not even be eligible to vote, depending on their age. So, it seems a bit odd to consider them as the main population of interest for a tax increase decision.\n\nOption B is \"all county residents.\" This seems broad and inclusive. It includes everyone living in the county, regardless of whether they have children in school or not. Since the tax increase would affect all residents in some way (either directly through higher gas taxes or indirectly through improved schools), it makes sense to consider the entire resident population's opinion.\n\nOption C is \"all county residents with school-aged children.\" This narrows it down to residents who have children in the age group that would attend school. This could be relevant because these residents might have a more direct interest in the school system since their children are or will be attending school.\n\nOption D is \"all county residents with children in the county school system.\" This is similar to option C but specifies that the children are actually attending the county school system. This could be important because these residents might be more invested in the local schools' quality.\n\nNow, I need to think about which group the survey is really trying to understand the opinions of. The tax increase is to support the county school system, and it's being lobbied for by a school committee member. The survey is likely trying to gauge the overall support or opposition to this idea among the people who will be affected by the tax increase.\n\nIf the tax is being proposed at the county level, it would affect all residents in the county, regardless of whether they have children in school or not. Therefore, it would make sense for the population of interest to be all county residents, as everyone would be impacted by the tax increase, either financially or through the benefits to the school system.\n\nBut let's consider this further. Maybe the survey is specifically interested in the opinions of those who have a direct stake in the school system, i.e., those who have children currently attending or will attend the schools. In that case, focusing on residents with school-aged children or children in the county school system would make sense.\n\nHowever, even then, it's important to consider that all residents, including those without children in school, have a stake in the community's education system. For example, better schools can influence property values, crime rates, and overall quality of life, which affects everyone.\n\nMoreover, from a democratic perspective, all residents should have a say in taxation matters that affect them, regardless of their direct involvement with the schools.\n\nGiven that, it seems most appropriate to consider the population of interest as all county residents.\n\nLet me see if there's any information in the question that might suggest otherwise. The school committee member is lobbying for the tax increase, and the survey is conducted to assess support among county residents. But the question doesn't specify that the survey is only targeting certain groups.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is B. All county residents.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the survey is only targeting households that have school-aged children or children in the school system. However, based on the information provided, it doesn't specify that.\n\nThe question says: \"The local newspaper conducted a survey of county residents to assess their support for such an increase.\" It doesn't specify any further criteria about who was surveyed.\n\nTherefore, the population of interest should be all county residents.\n\nI think the answer is B. All county residents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
