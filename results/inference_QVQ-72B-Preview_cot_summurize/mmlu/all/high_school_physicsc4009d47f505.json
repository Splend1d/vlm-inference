                    "text": "So I have this problem here: an object is placed 100 cm from a plane mirror. I need to find out how far the image is from the object. The options are 50 cm, 100 cm, 200 cm, or 300 cm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about plane mirrors. I know that in a plane mirror, the image formed is virtual and located at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. So, if the object is 100 cm in front of the mirror, the image should be 100 cm behind the mirror.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the distance from the object to the image. So, if the object is at 100 cm from the mirror and the image is at 100 cm behind the mirror, the total distance from the object to the image should be the sum of these two distances.\n\nLet me visualize this. I'll draw a straight line. Let's say the mirror is at the 0 cm mark. The object is at the 100 cm mark in front of the mirror, and the image is at -100 cm behind the mirror. The distance from the object to the image would be from 100 cm to -100 cm, which is a total of 200 cm.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer should be 200 cm, which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. I remember that in plane mirrors, the distance of the object from the mirror (u) and the distance of the image from the mirror (v) are related by the equation:\n\n1/u + 1/v = 1/f\n\nBut for a plane mirror, the focal length (f) is essentially infinite, so 1/f is zero. Therefore, 1/u + 1/v = 0, which simplifies to v = -u. This means the image distance is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the object distance.\n\nGiven that, if u = 100 cm, then v = -100 cm. The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual and located behind the mirror.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the object to the image is |u - v| = |100 - (-100)| = |100 + 100| = 200 cm.\n\nThat seems consistent. Another way to think about it is to consider the optical path length or the way light travels, but I think that's unnecessary for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the magnification formula as well, just to be thorough. The magnification (m) in a plane mirror is given by m = v/u. Since v = -u, m = -u/u = -1, which means the image is upright and the same size as the object. But this doesn't directly help with finding the distance from the object to the image.\n\nPerhaps I should also consider the lateral magnification, but again, that's more about the size of the image, not the distance.\n\nLet me see if there's any trick here. The question says \"the image from the object,\" which could be interpreted differently if there are multiple images, but in a plane mirror, there's only one image formed.\n\nUnless there's some other factor at play, like the size of the mirror or something, but the problem doesn't mention any limitations to the mirror's size.\n\nI think the straightforward answer is 200 cm, which is option C.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check the options again:\n\nA. 50 cm\n\nB. 100 cm\n\nC. 200 cm\n\nD. 300 cm\n\nGiven that the object is 100 cm from the mirror and the image is 100 cm behind it, the total distance should be 200 cm.\n\nYes, I'm confident that option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
