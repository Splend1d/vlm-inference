                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to figure out which of these colleges was the first to become coeducational. The options are Oberlin College, Dartmouth College, Grinnell College, and Antioch College. Coeducational means that both men and women could attend, right? So, I need to recall which one of these schools started admitting both genders first.\n\nI think Oberlin College is pretty famous for being progressive in education. I believe it was one of the first schools to admit women and also to promote racial equality. Let me see if that's correct. If I remember correctly, Oberlin was founded in 1833, and it started admitting women in 1837 or something like that. But was it the very first?\n\nWhat about Dartmouth College? I know Dartmouth is an Ivy League school, and it's known for its strong academics and sports teams. But when did it become coeducational? I think it was later than some of the other schools on this list. Maybe in the 20th century? I'm not sure.\n\nGrinnell College is another option. I know Grinnell is located in Iowa and is known for its liberal arts program. It's been around for a while, but I don't recall the exact year it became coeducational. Maybe it was one of the earlier ones?\n\nAntioch College is also an option. Antioch is famous for its cooperative education program, where students alternate between coursework and professional work experiences. It's in Ohio, I think. But again, I don't know when it started admitting both men and women.\n\nLet me try to think of this differently. Maybe I should consider the historical context. In the early days of American higher education, most colleges were single-sex institutions. So, it must have been a significant shift when schools started becoming coeducational.\n\nI recall that some women's colleges were established in the 19th century, like Mount Holyoke or Wellesley, but they were exclusively for women. Similarly, many men's colleges were founded earlier, like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, which were originally for men only.\n\nSo, among these options, Oberlin College stands out because I think it was one of the first to admit women alongside men. In fact, I think it was the first college to grant degrees to women in a coeducational setting.\n\nLet me double-check that. If Oberlin was founded in 1833 and started admitting women in the 1830s, that would make it one of the earliest, if not the first, to be coeducational in the United States.\n\nDartmouth College, on the other hand, was founded in 1769 and was a men's college until 1972 when it became coeducational. That's much later than Oberlin.\n\nGrinnell College was founded in 1846 and I believe it became coeducational in 1869, which is still after Oberlin.\n\nAntioch College was founded in 1852 and I think it became coeducational in 1853, which is still after Oberlin.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, Oberlin College seems to be the first American college to become coeducational.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that there isn't another college that predates Oberlin in this regard. Is there any chance that another college might have admitted both men and women earlier?\n\nLet me think about it. I know that some universities had women enrolled in certain programs or as auditors before granting them degrees. But Oberlin was granting degrees to women, which might be a more significant step.\n\nI should also consider that the question specifies \"American college,\" so I need to focus on colleges in the United States. All of these options are in the U.S., so that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some colleges might have had coeducational elements before fully becoming coeducational. For example, Brown University admitted a few women before fully integrating in the 1970s, but again, that's after Oberlin.\n\nI think I'm confident with my answer. Oberlin College was the first American college to become coeducational.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Oberlin College}} \\]"
