                    "text": "So I've come across this question about age stereotypes. It says that some work on age stereotypes suggests that:\n\nA. Positive ones are stronger\n\nB. Negative ones are stronger\n\nC. They never last very long\n\nD. They are very rare\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully.\n\nFirst off, stereotypes are generalized beliefs about a particular group of people. Age stereotypes specifically refer to the assumptions or beliefs we have about people based on their age. So, for example, assuming that all elderly people are wise, or that young people are irresponsible.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the strength of these stereotypes, particularly whether positive or negative ones are stronger. Alternatively, it might be suggesting that stereotypes don't last long or that they are rare.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that positive stereotypes are stronger. So, if I understand correctly, this would mean that when people have positive beliefs about certain age groups, those beliefs are more influential or enduring than negative ones.\n\nOption B suggests the opposite: that negative stereotypes are stronger. This would imply that negative beliefs about age groups have more impact or are more deeply held than positive ones.\n\nOption C states that age stereotypes never last very long. This seems to suggest that regardless of whether they are positive or negative, stereotypes about age don't persist over time.\n\nLastly, Option D claims that age stereotypes are very rare. This would mean that people don't often hold generalized beliefs about others based on their age.\n\nI need to recall what research has found about age stereotypes. I know that stereotypes in general can be quite persistent, especially those related to age, given that ageism is a recognized form of discrimination.\n\nLet me think about the common age stereotypes. For instance, older adults are often stereotyped as wise and experienced, which is positive, but also as set in their ways or slow, which is negative. Similarly, younger people might be seen as energetic and adaptable, which is positive, but also as inexperienced or reckless, which is negative.\n\nSo, both positive and negative stereotypes exist for different age groups. But which ones are stronger?\n\nI recall that in social psychology, there's a concept called the \"negativity bias,\" which suggests that negative information has a greater impact on our perceptions and memories than positive information. This might imply that negative stereotypes could be stronger.\n\nHowever, when it comes to age stereotypes, especially towards older adults, there might be cultural variations. In some cultures, older adults are highly respected and their positive attributes are emphasized, while in others, negative stereotypes prevail.\n\nMaybe I should look at specific studies on age stereotypes to get a better understanding.\n\nLet me think of a famous study or a review article on age stereotypes. I think of the work by Susan T. Fiske and Cynthia M. Dupree on stereotypes of older adults. They proposed the Stereotype Content Model, which suggests that stereotypes can vary along dimensions of competence and warmth.\n\nAccording to this model, older adults are often seen as warm but not very competent, leading to ambivalent stereotypes where positive and negative traits coexist.\n\nBut this doesn't directly answer whether positive or negative stereotypes are stronger.\n\nAnother line of research looks at the impact of age stereotypes on individuals' self-perceptions and behaviors. For example, Becca Levy at Yale University has studied how exposure to positive and negative age stereotypes can influence older adults' cognitive performance and even their health.\n\nHer work suggests that negative age stereotypes can have harmful effects, while positive ones can be beneficial. But again, this doesn't necessarily tell me which type is stronger overall.\n\nPerhaps the strength of age stereotypes depends on the context or the culture in which they are formed and maintained.\n\nConsidering that, maybe in some societies, positive stereotypes are stronger, while in others, negative ones dominate.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest a general answer, perhaps based on common findings in psychological research.\n\nLet me consider the idea that negative stereotypes might be stronger due to the negativity bias I mentioned earlier. This bias is well-documented in various domains, including perception of events, memory, and decision-making.\n\nIf this bias applies to stereotypes as well, it would make sense that negative stereotypes are stronger and more enduring than positive ones.\n\nOn the other hand, positivity effects in aging might counteract this bias to some extent. Research has shown that older adults tend to recall more positive information than negative information, a phenomenon known as the positivity effect.\n\nBut this might not directly relate to the strength of stereotypes held by individuals about different age groups.\n\nWait a minute, the question is about \"some work on age stereotypes,\" which could refer to empirical research in social psychology or gerontology.\n\nPerhaps I should think about meta-analyses or reviews that summarize multiple studies on age stereotypes.\n\nI recall that a meta-analysis by Kite and Whitley in 1998 looked at age stereotypes and found that both positive and negative stereotypes exist, but negative stereotypes are more prevalent and powerful.\n\nLet me verify that. If that's the case, then Option B, \"negative ones are stronger,\" would be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more recent research has shown a shift in the perception of age stereotypes.\n\nGiven that ageism is a significant issue, and that negative stereotypes can lead to discrimination and prejudice against older adults, it's plausible that negative stereotypes are stronger.\n\nBut I should also consider that positive stereotypes can be powerful in certain contexts. For example, in cultures that value wisdom and experience, older adults might be highly regarded.\n\nHowever, even in such cultures, negative stereotypes might persist in specific areas, such as perceptions of physical health or technological savvy.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the self-stereotyping that occurs among older adults themselves. Some research suggests that older adults may internalize negative stereotypes, which can affect their self-esteem and performance.\n\nThis again points to the potency of negative stereotypes.\n\nOption C suggests that age stereotypes never last very long. But from what I know, stereotypes in general can be quite persistent, especially those related to deeply ingrained social categories like age.\n\nAge stereotypes can influence everything from employment opportunities to healthcare decisions, and they can be difficult to change, indicating that they do last a considerable amount of time.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems unlikely.\n\nOption D claims that age stereotypes are very rare. However, stereotypes are a common aspect of human cognition, and age is a salient social category.\n\nWhile it's possible that in some societies or among certain individuals, age stereotypes are less prevalent, in general, they are quite common.\n\nMoreover, research consistently shows that people hold a range of stereotypes about different age groups.\n\nTherefore, Option D also seems unlikely.\n\nBetween Options A and B, the evidence seems to lean towards negative stereotypes being stronger.\n\nThe negativity bias, combined with findings from various studies on ageism, supports the idea that negative age stereotypes have greater impact and are more enduring.\n\nAdditionally, the harmful effects of negative stereotypes on older adults' well-being further reinforce this notion.\n\nSo, based on my understanding of social psychology and gerontology research, I would conclude that negative age stereotypes are stronger.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
