                    "text": "So I need to find 3 over 4 minus 1 over 8. Hmm, fractions can be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let's see, the options are 21 over 32, 1, 5 over 8, and 11 over 16. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that when subtracting fractions, they need to have the same denominator. So, I need to find a common denominator for 4 and 8. What's the least common multiple of 4 and 8? Let's see, 4 times 2 is 8, so 8 is a multiple of 4. So, 8 can be my common denominator.\n\nNow, I need to rewrite 3 over 4 with 8 as the denominator. To do that, I need to find an equivalent fraction. Since 4 times 2 is 8, I should multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2. So, 3 times 2 is 6, and 4 times 2 is 8. So, 3 over 4 is equal to 6 over 8.\n\nNow that both fractions have the same denominator, I can subtract them. So, 6 over 8 minus 1 over 8 is 5 over 8. Oh, that's one of the options! So, maybe the answer is 5 over 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, finding the common denominator: 4 and 8, their least common multiple is 8, so that seems right. Then, converting 3 over 4 to eighths: 3 times 2 is 6, and 4 times 2 is 8, so 6 over 8 is correct. Then, subtracting 1 over 8 from 6 over 8 gives 5 over 8. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should try another method to confirm. Another way to subtract fractions is to use the formula for subtracting fractions with different denominators, which is (a*d - b*c) over (b*d), where a/b minus c/d equals (a*d - b*c)/b*d.\n\nSo, for 3/4 - 1/8, a=3, b=4, c=1, d=8. Plugging in, numerator: 3*8 - 4*1 = 24 - 4 = 20, and denominator: 4*8 = 32. So, 20/32 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 5/8. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert both fractions to decimals and subtract them. 3/4 is 0.75, and 1/8 is 0.125. So, 0.75 minus 0.125 is 0.625. Now, let's see which fraction that corresponds to.\n\nOption A is 21/32. Let's see, 21 divided by 32 is 0.65625, which is not equal to 0.625.\n\nOption B is 1, which is 1.0, which is definitely not 0.625.\n\nOption C is 5/8. Let's check if 5 divided by 8 equals 0.625. Yep, 5 divided by 8 is indeed 0.625.\n\nOption D is 11/16. Let's see, 11 divided by 16 is 0.6875, which is not 0.625.\n\nSo, all three methods point to 5/8 being the correct answer. I think I'm confident with that.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there any possibility that the problem could be interpreted differently, like maybe it's not just straightforward subtraction?\n\nThe problem says \"3 over 4 minus 1 over 8\", and it's written as \"3 over 4 \u2212 1 over 8\". That seems pretty straightforward. No tricks there, like negative fractions or anything.\n\nAlso, considering the options: 21/32, 1, 5/8, and 11/16. All these are positive fractions less than 1, except for 1 itself, which is equal to 1. But since 3/4 is less than 1, and 1/8 is positive, subtracting 1/8 from 3/4 should give a positive result less than 1, which matches 5/8 and 11/16, but as we've calculated, 5/8 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, maybe I can visualize it. Imagine a pie divided into 8 equal parts. 3/4 is the same as 6/8, so that's 6 parts of the pie. Then, subtracting 1/8 means taking away one part, leaving 5 parts, which is 5/8. Yeah, that makes sense too.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible ways to confirm this. So, the final answer is 5/8, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}} \\]"
