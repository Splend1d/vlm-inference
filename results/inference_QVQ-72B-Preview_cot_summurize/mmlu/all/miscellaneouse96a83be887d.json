                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is asking which part of the Sun is easily visible only during a total solar eclipse. The options are A. Core, B. Photosphere, C. Sunspots, and D. Corona.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happens during a total solar eclipse. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, blocking out the Sun's light. This makes it possible to see parts of the Sun that are usually too dim to see because they're overwhelmed by the bright sunlight.\n\nNow, let's think about each option:\n\nA. Core: The Sun's core is deep inside it, and it's not directly visible from the outside. Even during a total solar eclipse, the core wouldn't be visible because it's internal to the Sun.\n\nB. Photosphere: The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun. It's what we see every day when we look at the Sun (though it's not safe to look directly without protection). During a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks this part of the Sun, so we wouldn't be able to see the photosphere then.\n\nC. Sunspots: Sunspots are darker areas on the Sun's surface, which is the photosphere. Again, during a total solar eclipse, the photosphere is obscured by the Moon, so sunspots wouldn't be visible at that time.\n\nD. Corona: The corona is the outer atmosphere of the Sun. It extends millions of kilometers into space and is much fainter than the photosphere. Normally, the brightness of the photosphere makes the corona invisible from Earth. However, during a total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks the photosphere, the corona becomes visible.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the corona is the part of the Sun that's easily visible only during a total solar eclipse.\n\nLet me double-check. During a total solar eclipse, the Moon covers the photosphere, which means the core and sunspots (which are on the photosphere) are also blocked. The corona, being the outer atmosphere, should still be visible around the edge of the Moon.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be D. Corona.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other part of the Sun that might be visible during a total solar eclipse that isn't normally visible. For example, the chromosphere is another layer of the Sun's atmosphere, located above the photosphere and below the corona. It's also normally obscured by the brightness of the photosphere but can be seen during a total solar eclipse, but it's not as prominently visible as the corona.\n\nHowever, the question specifically mentions which part is easily visible only during a total solar eclipse, and the corona fits this description perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Corona.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
