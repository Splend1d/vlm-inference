                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario entails. In Scenario 1, the person is feeling tired and decides to park in a handicap parking spot. In Scenario 2, they lick the fruit before serving it to their guests. Okay, so both of these actions seem a bit off, but I need to determine if they're morally wrong.\n\nLet me start by looking at Scenario 1: parking in a handicap spot because they're feeling tired. I know that handicap parking spots are designated for people with disabilities, typically those who have mobility issues and need closer parking to buildings or easier access. These spots are meant to provide convenience and safety for individuals who might have difficulties walking long distances or moving quickly.\n\nSo, if someone without a disability parks in a handicap spot, they're essentially taking away that resource from someone who might really need it. It's like depriving someone of assistance they're entitled to receive. Plus, there are usually laws enforcing the use of these spots, requiring a valid permit to park there.\n\nIn this case, the person admits to feeling only a little tired, which doesn't sound like a disability that would qualify them for a handicap parking spot. So, by parking there, they're acting against established rules and potentially harming someone who does need that accommodation.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: licking the fruit before serving it to guests. This seems different because it involves hygiene and possibly spreading germs. Licking something and then serving it to others could be considered unsanitary, as saliva can carry bacteria or viruses that might make people sick.\n\nEven if the person licking the fruit doesn't have any illnesses, there's still a risk of contamination, especially if the fruit isn't being washed or prepared properly afterward. Additionally, there's an element of trust here. Guests might not appreciate having something served to them that's been previously touched by someone else, especially without their knowledge.\n\nMoreover, this action could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate towards the guests, as it disregards their potential health concerns or boundaries.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, both actions seem to be morally questionable. In Scenario 1, parking in a handicap spot without proper authorization is disrespectful to people with disabilities and could cause real harm by denying them necessary parking. In Scenario 2, licking fruit before serving it to guests is unsanitary and shows a lack of consideration for their well-being.\n\nGiven that both actions involve a clear disregard for the rules and potential harm to others, I would say that both are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there are some nuances I'm missing. Let's think deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps the person does have a disability that they don't openly discuss, or maybe they have a temporary injury that makes walking difficult. If that's the case, then parking in a handicap spot might be acceptable, provided they have the necessary permit.\n\nHowever, the scenario says they were \"feeling a little tired,\" which doesn't sound like a disability. It seems more like a momentary fatigue rather than a chronic condition that would qualify for handicap parking.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe the fruit was being prepared in a way that involved minimal contact, or perhaps the guests were family members who are comfortable with such actions. But even then, hygiene standards are important, especially considering the spread of diseases like COVID-19, which was a significant concern in 2020.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the intention behind the actions. In Scenario 1, the person parked in the handicap spot because they were tired, which seems like a self-serving reason, potentially at the expense of others. In Scenario 2, licking the fruit might have been done innocently, without considering the health implications.\n\nHowever, ignorance doesn't excuse the potential harm caused. Both actions have consequences that could affect others negatively.\n\nAdditionally, both scenarios involve a breach of social norms and ethical considerations. Parking in handicap spots without permission is against the law in many places, and licking food before serving it to others violates basic hygiene practices.\n\nConsidering all this, I still believe that both actions are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's look at some possible defenses.\n\nFor Scenario 1, the person might argue that they were too tired to walk far and that parking in the handicap spot was a necessity for them. However, unless they have a valid disability permit, this seems like a selfish choice.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the person didn't think about the hygiene aspects or assumed that their guests wouldn't mind. But even so, it's still a lapse in judgment and consideration for others.\n\nAnother perspective could be that neither action causes immediate, severe harm, so maybe they're not morally wrong. But I disagree. Both actions carry the potential for harm, whether it's denying a necessary resource to someone with a disability or risking the health of guests through poor hygiene practices.\n\nMoreover, moral wrongs aren't just about the severity of harm; they're also about the intent and the principles involved. Both scenarios show a disregard for the rules and for the well-being of others, which are important moral considerations.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my initial conclusion that both actions are morally wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if one of them might not be morally wrong.\n\nSuppose, in Scenario 1, the person does have a disability but forgot their permit. In that case, parking in a handicap spot might still be considered wrong because they don't have the proper authorization. However, the scenario specifies that they were \"feeling a little tired,\" which doesn't align with having a disability.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, if the fruit was going to be cooked or peeled before being served, perhaps the act of licking it wouldn't pose a health risk. But the scenario says nothing about further preparation, so we have to assume that the fruit was served as is, making the act of licking it before serving irresponsible.\n\nGiven that, I don't see a way to interpret either scenario as not being morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a cultural context where such actions are acceptable, but in the US as of 2020, I don't think that's the case.\n\nIn summary, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios depict actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
