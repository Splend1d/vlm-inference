A baseball fan traveled all night to the stadium, planning to purchase tickets from a scalper at the stadium. However, the fan arrived at the stadium after the game had started, and no tickets were available. He proceeded to sneak around the guard at the entrance gate and illegally entered the stadium. He watched the remainder of the game in the standing room only section. The fan became so enraged when the opposition took the lead in the ninth inning that he pulled out a gun from under his jacket and aimed it at the section of spectators in front of him. Before he could be subdued he had fired three shots, killing one person and severely injuring another.\nB. A customer was in a bank filling out a deposit slip when a robber entered. The robber went to the teller's window and quietly slipped a note to the teller, demanding everything in the cash drawer. The customer, who was unaware of the robbery taking place, went to the adjoining teller's window and made his deposit. Upon obtaining his receipt, the customer suddenly collapsed and died of a heart attack. When the robber saw this, he panicked and left the bank before the teller could comply with his demand.\nC. Two men planned to rob a luncheonette during the noontime rush. At 12:30 p. m. , as planned, one of the men entered the luncheonette and pointed a gun at the cashier, who handed over the money. The man left to meet the other man outside as he was standing guard as a lookout. As soon as the man ran out of the door, a police officer tried to grab him. The man evaded the officer for a brief moment. Thinking that the other man had double-crossed him and informed the police of their plans, he fatally shot the other man.\nD. A man and a woman had been feuding for years. In order to show him a thing or two, the woman decided to set fire to the man's house. Before dawn one morning, the woman went to the man's house and lit a match to gasoline she had poured at the man's front door. The house caught fire and quickly spread to the man's bedroom, where the man was able to leap out of the window without injury. A police officer who was driving by saw the woman running away one block from the man's house. The police officer pulled his car up to the woman to determine if she was involved in setting the fire. Upon seeing the officer, the woman starts to flee the scene. As she is running away, the woman pulled out a revolver and started shooting indiscriminately behind her. The police officer was struck by one of the shots and was killed.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these scenarios would most likely result in a defendant being found guilty of felony murder. I need to recall what exactly constitutes felony murder. From what I remember, felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the death is a foreseeable result of the felony. The person committing the felony can be held responsible for the death, even if they didn't intend to kill anyone.\n\nOkay, so with that in mind, let's look at each scenario one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nThis is about a baseball fan who sneaks into a stadium without a ticket and then, in a fit of rage over the game's outcome, pulls out a gun and shoots into the crowd, killing one person and injuring another.\n\nSo, here, the initial act is trespassing by sneaking into the stadium. Then, inside, he commits assault with a deadly weapon, leading to homicide.\n\nIs trespassing a felony? I think it depends on the jurisdiction, but often trespassing is a misdemeanor unless it's aggravated under certain circumstances. Even if it's considered a felony, the shooting seems like a separate act of violence, not directly part of the trespassing.\n\nWait, but in some places, if you commit a felony and someone dies as a result, even if the death wasn't intended, it could be felony murder.\n\nHowever, in this case, the shooting seems premeditated, as he pulled out the gun and aimed it. It doesn't seem like an accidental death during a felony; it's more like a deliberate act of violence.\n\nSo, maybe this isn't the best example of felony murder. It seems more like direct murder.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nHere, a customer is in a bank when a robber comes in and demands money from the teller. The customer makes a deposit, gets a receipt, and then has a heart attack and dies. The robber panics and leaves without taking any money.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the customer dies of a heart attack during the robbery.\n\nNow, the robbery is a felony, and the customer dies during its commission.\n\nBut, the death was caused by a heart attack, not by any direct action of the robber.\n\nIs a heart attack a foreseeable result of a robbery? I mean, yes, robberies can be stressful and alarming, which could trigger a heart attack in someone with heart issues.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, this might be considered felony murder because the death was a foreseeable consequence of the felony.\n\nBut, I think there might be debates about whether the robber should be held responsible for the natural causes death of the customer.\n\nMaybe it's a grey area.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nIn this case, two men plan to rob a luncheonette during lunchtime. One man goes in, points a gun, takes the money, and leaves. Outside, he thinks his partner betrayed him and shoots the partner dead.\n\nSo, here, the robbery is the felony, and the shooting is during the getaway.\n\nThe shooting is a separate act from the robbery, but it happens immediately after the robbery.\n\nIn some legal systems, all crimes committed in furtherance of the felony can be considered part of the same criminal episode.\n\nSo, if the shooting is seen as part of the felony, then the death could be considered felony murder.\n\nBut, it's also possible that the shooting is a separate intentional act, not just a foreseeable risk of the robbery.\n\nSo, maybe not the strongest example of felony murder.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nThis one involves a woman who sets fire to a man's house in retaliation for a feud. The man escapes uninjured, but a police officer pursuing the woman is shot and killed by her.\n\nSo, here, the woman commits arson, which is definitely a felony.\n\nDuring her escape, she is pursued by a police officer, and she shoots the officer dead.\n\nArson is a dangerous felony, and the death of the officer occurs during her attempt to evade arrest for the arson.\n\nIn this scenario, the death of the officer is a direct result of the felony of arson.\n\nMoreover, shooting at pursuing law enforcement is a violent act that escalates the felony.\n\nThis seems like a clear case where the defendant could be charged with felony murder because the death occurred during the commission of the felony and was a foreseeable consequence of the arson and the subsequent flight.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing all four options, Option D seems to be the most straightforward case for felony murder.\n\nIn Option A, the shooting seems more premeditated and less directly tied to the felony of trespassing.\n\nIn Option B, the death was due to natural causes, which might not qualify for felony murder in all jurisdictions.\n\nIn Option C, the shooting was a separate act during the getaway, which might not neatly fit into the felony murder rule.\n\nOption D, however, has a clear felony (arson) and a death that occurs during the commission of that felony, making it the strongest candidate for a felony murder charge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
