                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal question about evidence admissibility in a negligence case. The plaintiff is suing the manufacturer of a slicing machine because it allegedly caused injury by cutting off the plaintiff's finger during cleaning. The plaintiff claims that two wires came into contact, activating the machine. The manufacturer is arguing that designing the machine to prevent the wires from touching was too expensive and not feasible. Now, the plaintiff wants to introduce evidence that after the lawsuit was filed, the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact. The question is whether this evidence is admissible.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general rules about evidence of subsequent remedial measures. I think there's a rule that prevents parties from introducing evidence of changes made after an incident to show that the original condition was unsafe. This is to encourage companies to make safety improvements without fear that such improvements will be used against them in court.\n\nSo, option B seems to suggest that this evidence shouldn't be admitted because of the rule encouraging manufacturers to make their products safer. That sounds familiar.\n\nBut option C says that the evidence is admissible because it shows that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact. That also makes sense because if the manufacturer could redesign the machine to prevent wire contact, it might imply that they could have done so earlier.\n\nOption D goes further by saying that the evidence is admissible to show that the manufacturer was negligent because their initial design didn't prevent wire contact.\n\nOption A says that the evidence shouldn't be admitted because the design change might have been for a different reason, unrelated to this type of accident.\n\nI need to think carefully about this. The Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 407, address subsequent remedial measures. It says that in civil cases, evidence of subsequent measures that are undertaken to correct a condition is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in the product, or a need for a warning. However, there are exceptions.\n\nOne exception is that such evidence may be admitted to show ownership, control, or the feasibility of corrective measures, if disputed. Another exception is that it can be admitted for impeachment purposes.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer is arguing that it was unreasonably expensive to design the machine so that the wires couldn't come into contact. The plaintiff wants to show that, in fact, the manufacturer was able to redesign the machine to prevent wire contact after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nSo, the plaintiff is using the redesign as evidence that it was feasible to make such changes, contrary to the manufacturer's claim.\n\nOption B suggests that the evidence shouldn't be admitted under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer. But in this scenario, the plaintiff isn't trying to use the redesign to prove that the original machine was defective or that the manufacturer was negligent solely because they changed the design after the incident.\n\nInstead, the plaintiff is using the redesign to counter the manufacturer's specific claim that it was too expensive or not feasible to make those changes in the first place.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule allowing evidence of subsequent remedial measures when it's relevant to contesting the feasibility of the measures applies here.\n\nOption C says that the evidence is admissible to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact. That seems to align with the exception in Rule 407 that allows such evidence when it's relevant to the feasibility of corrective measures.\n\nOption D suggests that the evidence is admissible to show negligence because the initial design failed to prevent wire contact. That sounds more like using the subsequent remedial measure to prove a defect or negligence, which is generally not allowed under Rule 407.\n\nSo, option D might be incorrect based on the general rule against using subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence.\n\nOption A says that the evidence shouldn't be admitted because the design change might have been for a different reason, unrelated to this type of accident. That's a possibility, but in this case, the plaintiff is specifically claiming that the redesign was to prevent wire contact, which is directly related to the accident in question.\n\nUnless there's evidence that the redesign was for some other purpose, like improving efficiency or reducing costs in a different way, this argument might not hold.\n\nBut perhaps the manufacturer could argue that the redesign was for reasons unrelated to safety or preventing wire contact, and therefore, the evidence shouldn't be admitted to suggest that the redesign was an admission of a safety issue.\n\nSo, option A might have some merit if the manufacturer can show that the redesign was for a different purpose.\n\nHowever, in the context of this question, the plaintiff is offering evidence that the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent wire contact after the action was filed. This suggests that the redesign was directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the evidence is admissible to show that it was feasible to design the machine to prevent wire contact, which directly contradicts the manufacturer's claim that such a design was unreasonably expensive or not feasible.\n\nSo, between options B and C, option C seems more accurate because it aligns with the exception in Rule 407 that allows evidence of subsequent remedial measures to show feasibility of corrective measures.\n\nOption B is arguing against admission based on the general rule, but in this specific case, there's an exception that allows such evidence for the purpose of showing feasibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\n\nBut I should double-check this because option D also seems tempting, but I think it's more about showing feasibility rather than direct negligence.\n\nWait, but option D says \"as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\"\n\nWhile it's true that the redesign shows that the manufacturer could have prevented the wires from coming into contact, using that specifically to prove negligence might be crossing the line into what Rule 407 is designed to prevent.\n\nWhereas, using it to show that it was feasible to make such a design change is more acceptable under the exceptions to Rule 407.\n\nSo, I think C is the better answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's based on the assumption that the design change was unrelated to the accident, but in this case, the plaintiff is specifically offering evidence that the redesign was to prevent wire contact, which is directly related.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it relies on the general rule against admitting subsequent remedial measures without considering the exceptions that apply in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
