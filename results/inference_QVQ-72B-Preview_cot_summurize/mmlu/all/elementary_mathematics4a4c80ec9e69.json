                    "text": "So Mr. Fuller has a rectangular-shaped yard, and he wants to put fencing around it. The width is 55 feet, and the length is 75 feet. I need to figure out how many feet of fencing he needs. The options are 130, 260, 3,905, and 4,125 feet.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So, to find the perimeter, which is what he needs for the fencing, I should add up all the sides.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 75 + 2 \u00d7 55\n\nNow, calculate that:\n\n2 \u00d7 75 = 150 feet\n\n2 \u00d7 55 = 110 feet\n\nAdding them together: 150 + 110 = 260 feet\n\nSo, the fencing needed is 260 feet. Looking back at the options, B is 260.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the yard isn't just a simple rectangle? Maybe there are gates or something that would require less fencing, or perhaps it's a different shape? The problem says it's rectangular, so I think it's safe to assume it's a standard rectangle.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\n\nPlugging in the values: P = 2(75 + 55) = 2(130) = 260 feet.\n\nThat matches option B again.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other calculation that might be relevant here. Maybe the area of the yard, but that wouldn't help with the fencing, which is perimeter-based.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple sections to the yard that need fencing, but the problem seems to indicate it's a single rectangular yard.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about the units. Since everything is in feet, and we're adding feet together, the result should indeed be in feet, not square feet or anything else.\n\nAlso, checking the other options: 130 would be the sum of the length and width, but that's not the perimeter; 3,905 and 4,125 seem way too big for a yard, unless it's an enormous yard, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 260 feet, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
