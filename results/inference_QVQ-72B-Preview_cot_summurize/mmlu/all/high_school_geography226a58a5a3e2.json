                    "text": "So I have this question about folklore, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read the options again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is: \"Which of the following statements is true concerning folklore?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. It is the written tradition of a group.\n\nB. It encourages changing the old values and customs.\n\nC. It serves to blend all cultures into one.\n\nD. It expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what folklore actually is. From what I remember, folklore is like the traditional beliefs, customs, and stories that are passed down from generation to generation within a community or group. It's usually oral, meaning it's shared through speaking or performing, rather than being written down.\n\nSo, option A says it's the written tradition of a group. But I think folklore is more about oral traditions, not written ones. Maybe this is a trick question, or perhaps there's more to it. I should double-check that.\n\nOption B says that folklore encourages changing the old values and customs. Hmm, I would have thought that folklore helps preserve traditional values and customs. If that's the case, then this option seems contrary to what folklore is supposed to do. But maybe there's a perspective where it promotes change; I'm not sure. I need to think carefully about this.\n\nOption C says that folklore serves to blend all cultures into one. Well, that sounds like it could lead to cultural homogenization, where different cultures start to look the same. But folklore is often about celebrating and maintaining the uniqueness of a particular group or culture. So, I doubt that it aims to blend all cultures into one. That seems unlikely.\n\nFinally, option D says that folklore expresses in words the shared values of a group by expressing their ideals. This sounds more accurate. Folklore includes stories, proverbs, legends, and other forms of expression that convey the values and ideals of a community. So, it does use words (and sometimes actions in performances) to share these values and ideals.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts:\n\n- Option A: Folklore is primarily oral, not written, so this seems incorrect.\n\n- Option B: Folklore typically preserves traditional values, not encourages changing them.\n\n- Option C: Folklore celebrates cultural diversity, not blends all cultures into one.\n\n- Option D: This seems to accurately describe what folklore does\u2014it expresses the shared values and ideals of a group through words.\n\nI think the correct answer is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any chance that one of the other options could be correct in some contexts.\n\nFor example, sometimes folklore might be written down, like in books or manuscripts, especially in modern times. But historically, folklore was predominantly oral, passed down through storytelling and performance. So, even if it's sometimes written, that's not its primary nature.\n\nOption B: Could folklore encourage changing old values and customs? Well, perhaps in some cases, folklore might adapt over time as society changes, but generally, it's meant to preserve and\u4f20\u9012\u4f20\u7edf values.\n\nOption C: Does folklore blend all cultures into one? No, folklore is usually specific to a particular culture or group and helps maintain that group's identity.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
