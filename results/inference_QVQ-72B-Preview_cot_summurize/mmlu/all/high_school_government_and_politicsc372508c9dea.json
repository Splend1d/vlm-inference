                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about legal principles and how judges make decisions. The question is asking about the principle that tells judges to follow established precedent when deciding cases. The options are certiorari, de jure, ex post facto, and stare decisis. Hmm, let's see what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst off, I know that in law, precedent is really important. It's like saying if something was decided a certain way before, similar cases should be decided the same way to maintain consistency and fairness. So, the principle that requires judges to follow previous decisions is called \"stare decisis.\" Let me just make sure I'm not mixing that up with something else.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Certiorari \u2013 I think this is a legal procedure where a higher court reviews a decision of a lower court. Like, if someone disagrees with a lower court's decision, they can ask for a certiorari to have it reviewed. So, that doesn't seem to be about following precedent in deciding cases. Maybe not the right answer.\n\nB. De jure \u2013 This term sounds familiar, but I'm not sure in this context. I think \"de jure\" means \"by law\" or \"according to law.\" It's often used to describe something that is legitimate by law, but not necessarily in practice. For example, de jure segregation was legal segregation. So, that doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nC. Ex post facto \u2013 This is a Latin phrase that means \"after the fact.\" In law, an ex post facto law is one that applies retroactively, meaning it criminalizes actions that were legal when done or increases the punishment for crimes committed before the law was passed. That's not about following precedent; it's about the application of laws retroactively, which is generally forbidden.\n\nD. Stare decisis \u2013 This one seems promising. It's another Latin phrase that translates to \"stand by things decided.\" It's the principle under which courts are bound to follow previous decisions made in similar cases by higher courts or by courts of coordinate jurisdiction. So, it's literally about following precedent.\n\nWait a minute, is there any chance that one of the other terms could also relate to precedent in some way? Let me double-check.\n\nCertiorari is more about the review process between different levels of courts, not about following precedent in decision-making. De jure and ex post facto don't seem related to the concept of precedent at all.\n\nSo, based on this, stare decisis is the correct answer. It's the principle that requires judges to adhere to established precedents when making their decisions, ensuring a degree of consistency and predictability in the law.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about whether there's any other principle that might be related or if there's a trick here. But no, it seems straightforward. The question is asking directly for the principle that instructs judges to follow precedent, and stare decisis is the term for that principle.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is D. stare decisis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\text{ stare decisis}} \\]"
