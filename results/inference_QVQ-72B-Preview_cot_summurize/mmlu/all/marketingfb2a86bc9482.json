                    "text": "So I've got this question here about coupons that are included in packages for later purchase. The options are a free-standing coupon, an instant-redemption coupon, a bounce-back coupon, and a rebate coupon. I need to figure out which one fits this description.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of coupon is.\n\nStarting with a free-standing coupon: I think these are the ones you usually find in newspapers or magazines that you can cut out and take to the store to redeem. So, they're not necessarily included in a product package; they're more like standalone items. Maybe that's why they're called free-standing.\n\nNext, an instant-redemption coupon. This sounds like a coupon that you can use right away, maybe at the checkout counter. So, if I buy a product and there's a coupon inside that I can use immediately on my next purchase, that would be instant redemption. But the question is about a coupon included in a package for later purchase, which might not necessarily be instant.\n\nThen there's a bounce-back coupon. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe it's a coupon that encourages you to come back to the store after a certain period, like a loyalty incentive. So, it's for a future purchase, which aligns with the \"later purchase\" part of the question.\n\nLastly, a rebate coupon. I know that rebates are when you send in some form after purchasing a product, and you get money back. So, it's more about getting a refund on what you've already bought rather than a discount on a future purchase.\n\nGiven all that, the question is about a coupon included in a package for later purchase. So, it's something you get when you buy a product, and you can use it to save money on something you buy in the future.\n\nA free-standing coupon isn't part of the package; it's something you get from elsewhere. An instant-redemption coupon might be used right away, not necessarily for a later purchase. A rebate coupon is about getting money back from a purchase you've already made, not about discounting a future purchase.\n\nSo, the bounce-back coupon seems to fit the description. It's included in the package and intended for use on a future purchase, kind of like a reward for coming back to the store.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is \"bounce-back\" the standard term for this type of coupon? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more commonly called a \"comeback coupon\" or something else.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I buy a product and inside there's a coupon for my next purchase, what's that called? It's probably a bounce-back coupon because it's meant to make you \"bounce back\" to the store for another purchase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's called a customer loyalty coupon or something similar, but that's not one of the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, a bounce-back coupon seems the most fitting for a coupon included in a package intended for later purchase.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly fit.\n\nA free-standing coupon is typically not included in a product package; it's usually found in newspapers or other media.\n\nAn instant-redemption coupon might be given at the time of purchase, but it's meant to be used immediately, not necessarily for a later purchase.\n\nA rebate coupon is about getting a refund after purchasing a product, not about discounting a future purchase.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer should be C. a bounce-back coupon.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
