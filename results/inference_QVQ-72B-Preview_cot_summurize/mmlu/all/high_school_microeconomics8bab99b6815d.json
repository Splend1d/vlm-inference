                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry. So, collusion is when these big companies secretively agree to act together, maybe to set prices or control output. The government doesn't like that, and I need to figure out why. There are four options, and one of them is correct. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says that collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price above competitive levels. Hmm, I thought that collusion usually leads to reduced output to drive up prices, not increase output. If they're producing more, wouldn't that make prices go down? Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Maybe I need to recall how collusion works.\n\nIn a competitive market, firms produce at a level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. In a collusive scenario, like a cartel, they might restrict output to increase prices, similar to a monopoly. So, actually, output decreases, and price increases. So, option A seems to have it backwards. It says output levels increase, but I think it's the opposite.\n\nOption B says consumer surplus falls as the price is driven downward. But if collusion leads to higher prices, as I just thought, then this can't be right. Consumer surplus would fall if prices go up, not down. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption C says collusive output levels tend to decrease, driving the price down to competitive levels. Wait, if output decreases, shouldn't price go up, not down? This seems inconsistent with basic supply and demand. Less supply should lead to higher prices, not lower.\n\nOption D says joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels. This seems to align with what I know about collusion. When firms collude, they act like a monopoly, restricting output to maximize joint profits, which leads to higher prices. As a result, consumer surplus decreases because consumers have to pay more for less product.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D seems to be the correct answer. It accurately describes the situation where collusion leads to higher prices and reduced consumer surplus, which is why the government discourages it.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In economics class, we learned that collusion can lead to inefficient market outcomes because it reduces competition. In a competitive market, prices are lower, and output is higher. When firms collude, they can coordinate to reduce output, which pushes prices up, similar to a monopoly. This benefits the firms but harms consumers because they have to pay more for fewer goods.\n\nAdditionally, in a competitive market, consumer surplus is maximized because prices are lower, and more goods are available. When collusion occurs, consumer surplus decreases as prices rise above competitive levels, and some consumers are priced out of the market.\n\nTherefore, the government intervenes to prevent collusion to protect consumer interests and maintain a competitive market environment.\n\nSo, to sum it up, option D is the correct reason why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry: joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
