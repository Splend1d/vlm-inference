                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"According to the title of a popular children's TV show, what color is Bear's big house?\" And the options are A. red, B. green, C. purple, D. blue. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I think I know the answer, but I want to make sure I'm not mixing it up with another show.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the title of the TV show that features a bear and his big house. I remember there's a show called \"Bear in the Big Blue House.\" Is that right? Let me think about it. Bear is a friendly character who lives in a big house, and there are other animal friends who come over for adventures and lessons in friendship and problem-solving.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Is it \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" or is it \"Blue's Clues\" with Steve and Blue? No, \"Blue's Clues\" is a different show. In \"Bear in the Big Blue House,\" Bear lives in a big blue house with his friends Ojo, Treelo, Pip and Pop, and Shadow.\n\nSo, according to the title, Bear's big house is blue. That would make the answer D. blue.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another show where Bear lives in a different colored house. Wait, there's \"The Berenstain Bears,\" but they live in a brown bear country house, which isn't any of these options. So, that's not it.\n\nAnother show with a bear is \"Bear in the Big Blue House.\" Yeah, that sounds familiar. It was a popular children's show on PBS Kids, I think. The house was indeed blue, and it was a big part of the show's setting.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can try to recall some episodes or characters. Ojo was a young bear, Treelo was a young tree, Pip and Pop were two small creatures, and Shadow was Bear's shadow who would often sing at the end of the show.\n\nAlso, the theme song mentioned \"Bear in the Big Blue House,\" so that should confirm that the house is blue.\n\nI don't think the color of the house changes in different episodes, as it's a central element of the show. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is D. blue.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me by using \"big\" and \"blue\" together, but I don't think so. The title clearly says \"Bear in the Big Blue House,\" emphasizing that it's a big house that's blue.\n\nJust to make sure, I can consider if there's any other children's TV show with a bear and a big house that might have a different color. But I can't think of any right now, besides \"The Berenstain Bears,\" which again, has a brown house.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all possible angles here. The correct answer should be D. blue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
