                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this psychology question here. It's about Sal meeting Petunia for the first time and forming an opinion based on their interaction. Petunia seems really outgoing and funny, and Sal thinks she's a fun person. But actually, Petunia is only acting that way because she just won the lottery, which is making her temporarily gleeful. So, the question is asking why Sal thinks Petunia is funny, and it gives four options: the mere-exposure effect, self-serving bias, equipotentiality, and the fundamental attribution error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the mere-exposure effect: I think this is when people tend to like things more just because they've been exposed to them repeatedly. Like, if you hear a song over and over, you might start to like it more simply because you're familiar with it. But in this scenario, Sal is meeting Petunia for the first time, so he's not repeatedly exposed to her. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nNext is self-serving bias. I remember this is when people take credit for their successes but blame external factors for their failures. It's a way to protect their self-esteem. But in this situation, Sal is forming an opinion about Petunia based on their interaction, not evaluating his own successes or failures. So, this doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nThen there's equipotentiality. I'm not as familiar with this term, but from what I recall, it might have to do with the idea that different people or situations can have similar potentials or capabilities. Maybe it's about how people can adapt to different environments or how different environments can elicit similar behaviors. But again, in this context, it's about Sal forming an opinion based on a single interaction, not about potential capabilities or environmental adaptations.\n\nLastly, there's the fundamental attribution error. This one seems more promising. It's when people tend to overattribute others' behavior to internal factors, like personality traits, and underattribute them to external situational factors. So, for example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a bad person rather than considering that maybe they're in a hurry because of an emergency.\n\nIn this scenario, Petunia is acting outgoing and funny, and Sal thinks she's just a fun person. But actually, her behavior is due to an external factor\u2014she just won the lottery, which is making her temporarily gleeful. So, Sal is attributing her behavior to her personality (she's a fun person) rather than to the situation (she's happy because she won the lottery). This sounds a lot like the fundamental attribution error.\n\nLet me double-check. The fundamental attribution error is also known as correspondence bias or attribution bias. It's the tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal factors in explaining other people's behavior. In this case, Sal is seeing Petunia's behavior and attributing it to her being a fun person, which is an internal trait, rather than to the fact that she just won the lottery, which is an external situational factor.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, the correct answer should be D. the fundamental attribution error.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing something, let's quickly revisit the other options.\n\nA. the mere-exposure effect: Not applicable because it's about repeated exposure, and this is a first meeting.\n\nB. self-serving bias: Not relevant here because it's about how people attribute their own successes and failures, not how they perceive others.\n\nC. equipotentiality: While I'm not entirely sure about this term's exact definition, it doesn't seem to fit the context of forming an opinion based on a single interaction.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for Sal's opinion is the fundamental attribution error.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
