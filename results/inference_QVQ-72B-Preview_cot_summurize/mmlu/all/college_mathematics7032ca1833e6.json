                    "text": ": \nSo I have this problem: \"What is the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has radius 2?\" And the options are 12, 16, 12\u221a3, and 16\u221a3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of equilateral triangles and their incircles. An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. The incircle is the largest circle that fits inside the triangle and touches all three sides.\n\nI know that the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nBut here, I don't know the side length yet. Instead, I know the radius of the inscribed circle, which is 2. I need to find a relationship between the inradius and the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\nI remember that the area of a triangle can also be expressed in terms of its inradius \\(r\\) and its semiperimeter \\(s\\). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = r \\times s\n\\]\n\nwhere the semiperimeter \\(s\\) is half of the perimeter.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, since all sides are equal, the perimeter is \\(3s\\), so the semiperimeter is \\(\\frac{3s}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the area can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = r \\times \\frac{3s}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut I already have another expression for the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nSo, I can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n\\[\nr \\times \\frac{3s}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\(s\\):\n\n\\[\nr \\times \\frac{3s}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times r \\times \\frac{3s}{2} = \\sqrt{3} s^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times r \\times \\frac{3s}{2} = 4 \\times r \\times \\frac{3s}{2} = 4 \\times r \\times 1.5s = 6 r s\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n6 r s = \\sqrt{3} s^2\n\\]\n\nNow, I can divide both sides by \\(s\\) (assuming \\(s \\neq 0\\), which it can't be for a real triangle):\n\n\\[\n6 r = \\sqrt{3} s\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(s\\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{6 r}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6 r}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6 r}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6 r \\sqrt{3}}{3} = 2 r \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the inradius \\(r = 2\\), I can substitute that in:\n\n\\[\ns = 2 \\times 2 \\sqrt{3} = 4 \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nNow that I have the side length, I can find the area using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (4 \\sqrt{3})^2\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\((4 \\sqrt{3})^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(4 \\sqrt{3})^2 = 16 \\times 3 = 48\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 48 = \\sqrt{3} \\times 12 = 12 \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the area of the equilateral triangle is \\(12 \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 12\u221a3\n\nD. 16\u221a3\n\nThe correct answer is C. 12\u221a3.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the area formulas:\n\n1. Area = (\u221a3)/4 * s\u00b2\n\n2. Area = r * (3s)/2\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nr*(3s)/2 = (\u221a3)/4 * s\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4*r*(3s)/2 = \u221a3 * s\u00b2 \u2192 6 r s = \u221a3 s\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by s:\n\n6 r = \u221a3 s\n\nThen, s = 6 r / \u221a3 = 2 r \u221a3\n\nWith r = 2:\n\ns = 4 \u221a3\n\nArea = (\u221a3)/4 * (4\u221a3)\u00b2 = (\u221a3)/4 * 48 = 12 \u221a3\n\nYes, that checks out. I don't see any errors in the calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}} \\]"
