                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what happens when new firms enter a monopolistically competitive industry. The options are about how this affects existing firms' demand curves, the market price, and the elasticity of demand. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what monopolistic competition is. It's a market structure where there are many firms selling slightly differentiated products. Each firm has a bit of market power because their products aren't perfect substitutes, but they're still pretty competitive since there are lots of options for consumers.\n\nNow, in this type of market, firms can enter and exit relatively easily because there are low barriers to entry. So, if there's an incentive for new firms to enter, like if existing firms are making economic profits, new firms will start popping up, offering their own versions of the product.\n\nOkay, so if new firms are entering, that means the total supply in the market increases. With more firms, there's more production capacity, which should lead to an increase in overall market supply.\n\nGiven that, what happens to the market price? In economics 101, when supply increases, holding demand constant, the price tends to decrease. So, option B says the market price of the product will increase. That seems counterintuitive because with more supply, price should go down, right? Maybe I'm missing something, but I think option B is incorrect.\n\nNext, option A says the demand for existing firms will shift rightward. Hmm, a rightward shift in demand would mean that at any given price, consumers want to buy more. But if new firms are entering, existing firms might lose some of their customers to these new entrants. So, wouldn't that mean that existing firms' demand might actually decrease, not increase? Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption D suggests that the demand for existing firms shifts leftward, which would mean at any given price, consumers buy less from them. That seems more plausible because new firms attract customers away from existing ones. So, if new firms are offering similar products, some customers might switch, leading to a decrease in demand for existing firms' products.\n\nBut wait, in monopolistic competition, products are differentiated. So, maybe the impact isn't just about quantity demanded but also about the price firms can charge. Option C mentions that the demand becomes more inelastic. If demand becomes more inelastic, it means that changes in price lead to smaller changes in quantity demanded. But if new firms are offering similar products, wouldn't that make the demand for existing firms' products more elastic because customers have more alternatives?\n\nLet me see. If there are more substitutes available due to new entrants, then customers can more easily switch if a firm raises its price. So, the demand for each existing firm's product might become more elastic, not less. So, option C seems unlikely.\n\nSo, between options A and D, D seems more plausible. If new firms enter, existing firms might see their demand shift leftward because some customers are being drawn to the new options. But let's double-check.\n\nI recall that in perfect competition, when new firms enter, the market supply increases, leading to a decrease in price, and existing firms end up producing less but at a lower price. But in monopolistic competition, things might be a bit different due to product differentiation.\n\nMaybe I should think about it in terms of long-run equilibrium. In the long run, in monopolistic competition, firms earn zero economic profit. So, if existing firms are making profits, new firms will enter, which will erode those profits over time.\n\nSo, with new firms entering, the market supply increases, price decreases, and existing firms' demand curves shift leftward because some customers are going to the new firms.\n\nWait, but option A says demand shifts rightward, which doesn't align with this logic. Option D says demand shifts leftward, which seems to match.\n\nMoreover, option B says price increases, but as I thought earlier, with more supply, price should decrease, assuming demand remains constant.\n\nOption C says demand becomes more inelastic. But with more substitutes, demand should become more elastic, not less. So, that also doesn't seem right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: the demand for existing firms shifts leftward.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the relationship between the number of firms and the demand faced by each firm. In monopolistic competition, as more firms enter, the demand for each individual firm's product decreases because consumers have more choices. This leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve for existing firms.\n\nAdditionally, because there are more substitutes, the demand curve also becomes more elastic, meaning that if a firm tries to raise its price, it will lose more customers to the substitutes.\n\nSo, in summary, when firms enter a monopolistically competitive industry:\n\n- Market supply increases.\n\n- Market price decreases.\n\n- Demand for existing firms shifts leftward.\n\n- Demand becomes more elastic for existing firms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: the demand for existing firms shifts leftward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
