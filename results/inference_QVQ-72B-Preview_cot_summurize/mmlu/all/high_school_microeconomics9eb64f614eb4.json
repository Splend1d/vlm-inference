                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement is true about monopolistic competition. Let's see, I have four options here:\n\nA. Firms earn long-run economic profits.\n\nI remember that in monopolistic competition, there are many firms, and they produce differentiated products. Because there are so many firms, in the long run, new firms can enter the market if there are profits to be made. This entry should drive down profits to normal levels, right? So, I don't think firms can earn long-run economic profits in this market structure. Maybe this one is not true.\n\nB. P = MR = MC = ATC.\n\nHmm, this seems familiar from perfect competition. In perfect competition, in the long run, price equals marginal revenue, which equals marginal cost, and also equals average total cost. But monopolistic competition is different from perfect competition because firms have some market power due to product differentiation. They face downward-sloping demand curves, so price is greater than marginal revenue. So, I don't think all these equalities hold in monopolistic competition. Probably not this one.\n\nC. Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nYes, that sounds right. In monopolistic competition, firms try to set themselves apart from their competitors by differentiating their products. This could be through branding, design, or advertising. So, they do spend money on these activities to attract customers. This seems plausible.\n\nD. In the long run, the market is allocatively efficient.\n\nAllocative efficiency occurs when resources are allocated in a way that maximizes social welfare, which typically means P = MC. In monopolistic competition, because firms have some market power, price is greater than marginal cost, which suggests there's a deadweight loss. So, I don't think the market is allocatively efficient in the long run. Maybe not this one either.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- A seems incorrect because in the long run, profits should be driven to normal levels due to entry and exit.\n\n- B is likely wrong because in monopolistic competition, P > MR, unlike in perfect competition.\n\n- C seems correct because product differentiation and advertising are key features of monopolistic competition.\n\n- D is probably false because P > MC indicates inefficiency.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it again.\n\nIn monopolistic competition, firms operate under conditions where there are many sellers, differentiated products, and relatively free entry and exit in the long run.\n\n- Long-run economic profits are zero, so A is incorrect.\n\n- P = MR = MC = ATC is characteristic of perfect competition, not monopolistic competition, so B is incorrect.\n\n- Firms do indeed spend resources on differentiating their products and advertising to gain a competitive edge, so C is correct.\n\n- The market is not allocatively efficient in the long run because P > MC, leading to overproduction from a social perspective, so D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
