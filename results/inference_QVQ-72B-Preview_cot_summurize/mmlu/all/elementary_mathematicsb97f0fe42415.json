                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that there's a shape made up of 12 right triangles, all of equal size. Each right triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm. I need to find the total area of this shape in square centimeters. The options are 10, 60, 120, and 240.\n\nAlright, first things first. I know that the area of a triangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nSo, for one right triangle, with base 4 cm and height 5 cm, the area would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 = 10 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\nSo, each triangle has an area of 10 square centimeters.\n\nNow, the shape is made up of 12 of these triangles. To find the total area of the shape, I would think that I just need to add up the areas of all 12 triangles. That is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 12 \\times \\text{area of one triangle}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the area I just calculated:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 12 \\times 10 = 120 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 120 is one of them. But wait, let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that the way the triangles are arranged could affect the total area? For example, if some parts overlap or something like that. The problem says that it's made up of 12 right triangles of equal size, but it doesn't specify how they're arranged. However, it also doesn't mention any overlapping or anything like that, so probably, they're just put together without overlapping areas.\n\nAssuming that, then yes, the total area should be 12 times the area of one triangle, which is 120 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at it. Maybe by visualizing the shape. If I imagine 12 right triangles, each with legs of 4 cm and 5 cm, arranged together, what would that look like?\n\nWell, right triangles can be arranged in various ways to form different shapes, like rectangles or more complex polygons. But unless specified otherwise, I think the problem is just asking for the combined area of these 12 triangles, without considering any subtraction or other operations.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether all the triangles are indeed right triangles with base 4 cm and height 5 cm. The problem states that each right triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm, so I don't think there's any variation in sizes or types of triangles.\n\nWait a minute, in a right triangle, the terms \"base\" and \"height\" are a bit ambiguous. In a right triangle, the two legs are perpendicular, and the area can be calculated using those two legs as the base and height. So, if the legs are 4 cm and 5 cm, then the area calculation I did earlier should hold.\n\nBut actually, in a right triangle, the terms \"base\" and \"height\" can refer to the two legs interchangeably, since they are both perpendicular to each other. So, whether you consider the 4 cm side as the base and the 5 cm side as the height, or vice versa, the area remains the same.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the units. The area is in square centimeters, which makes sense since both base and height are in centimeters.\n\nAlso, checking the other options:\n\n- 10 cm\u00b2: That's the area of just one triangle.\n\n- 60 cm\u00b2: That might be a distractor, perhaps if there are only 6 triangles instead of 12.\n\n- 120 cm\u00b2: Which is 12 times 10, matching our calculation.\n\n- 240 cm\u00b2: That would be if each triangle had an area of 20 cm\u00b2, but that's not the case.\n\nSo, based on this, 120 cm\u00b2 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{120} \\]"
