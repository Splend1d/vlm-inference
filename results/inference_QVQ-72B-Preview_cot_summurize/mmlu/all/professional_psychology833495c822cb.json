So, it's about fairness in the give-and-take between partners.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. perceptions of his/her own contribution/reward ratio and the ratio of his/her partner.\n\nThis seems to align with equity theory. It's about comparing what each person puts into the relationship (contributions) and what they get out of it (rewards). If someone feels they're contributing more but getting less in return compared to their partner, they might feel dissatisfied or taken advantage of.\n\nB. perceptions of the relative utility of the relationship.\n\nThis sounds more like how useful or beneficial the relationship is overall, not specifically comparing contributions and rewards between partners. Equity theory is more about the balance between what each partner gives and receives.\n\nC. comparisons between his/her current relationship and past relationships.\n\nThis is about looking back at previous relationships to evaluate the current one. While personal comparisons over time can influence satisfaction, equity theory focuses more on the fairness between partners in the current relationship, not necessarily comparing to past relationships.\n\nD. comparisons between his/her own relationship outcomes and the relationship outcomes of others.\n\nThis seems related to social comparison, where individuals compare their relationship to those of their friends, family, or others they know. While this can affect satisfaction, equity theory is more concerned with the fairness within the individual's own relationship, not with others'.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems the most accurate description of equity theory in personal relationships. It's all about the perception of fairness based on the contribution and reward ratios of both partners.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Equity theory proposes that people are motivated to maintain relationships that are equitable, where the ratio of inputs to outputs is similar for both partners. So, if both partners feel they're giving and receiving in proportionate amounts, they're more likely to be satisfied with the relationship.\n\nIf one partner feels they're giving more but receiving less, they might feel overexploited and dissatisfied. Conversely, if they feel they're receiving more than they're giving, they might feel guilty or still dissatisfied for not contributing enough.\n\nSo, again, this points back to option A: perceptions of one's own contribution/reward ratio and the ratio of one's partner.\n\nOption B, relative utility, might be related to the overall benefits one gets from the relationship, but it doesn't capture the comparative aspect that equity theory emphasizes.\n\nOption C, comparing to past relationships, is more about individual standards or expectations based on previous experiences, which isn't directly part of equity theory.\n\nOption D, comparing to others' relationships, is more about social comparison, which, while important in relationships, is distinct from equity theory's focus on fairness within the relationship.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. perceptions of his/her own contribution/reward ratio and the ratio of his/her partner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
