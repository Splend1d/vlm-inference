                    "text": "Let's tackle this statistics problem. So, we have a telephone survey of 400 registered voters, and out of those, 256 have not yet made up their minds about the election. We need to figure out how confident we can be that between 60% and 68% of the entire electorate is still undecided.\n\nFirst, I need to find the sample proportion of undecided voters from the survey. The number of undecided voters is 256, and the total number of voters surveyed is 400. So, the sample proportion \\( \\hat{p} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{256}{400} = 0.64 \\text{ or } 64\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, 64% of the surveyed voters are undecided.\n\nNow, we need to determine the confidence level that the true population proportion is between 60% and 68%. This sounds like a confidence interval problem.\n\nSince the sample size is large (n = 400), we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The standard error (SE) for the proportion is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64(1 - 0.64)}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64 \\times 0.36}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2304}{400}} = \\sqrt{0.000576} = 0.024\n\\]\n\nSo, the standard error is 0.024, or 2.4 percentage points.\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores corresponding to the lower and upper bounds of the interval, which are 60% and 68%, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find how many standard errors away from the sample proportion these percentages are.\n\nFor 60%:\n\n\\[\nz_{lower} = \\frac{0.60 - \\hat{p}}{SE} = \\frac{0.60 - 0.64}{0.024} = \\frac{-0.04}{0.024} = -1.6667\n\\]\n\nFor 68%:\n\n\\[\nz_{upper} = \\frac{0.68 - \\hat{p}}{SE} = \\frac{0.68 - 0.64}{0.024} = \\frac{0.04}{0.024} = 1.6667\n\\]\n\nSo, the interval ranges from approximately -1.6667 to +1.6667 standard errors from the sample proportion.\n\nTo find the confidence level, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we can find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nFirst, find the cumulative probability for z = 1.6667.\n\nLooking up z = 1.67 in the standard normal table, we get approximately 0.9525, or 95.25%.\n\nSimilarly, the cumulative probability for z = -1.67 is approximately 0.0475, or 4.75%.\n\nThe probability that the true proportion falls within the interval is the difference between these cumulative probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(-1.6667 < z < 1.6667) = 0.9525 - 0.0475 = 0.905 \\text{ or } 90.5\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none directly match this percentage. Maybe I made a rounding error or misread the z-table.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nThe z-score is approximately 1.6667, which corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.9525 for z = 1.67.\n\nThus, the confidence level for the interval 0.60 to 0.68 is approximately 90.5%, which rounds to 90.4%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2.4%\n\nB. 8.0%\n\nC. 64.0%\n\nD. 90.4%\n\nIt seems that option D, 90.4%, matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should verify this using a different approach.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the margin of error and see if the interval includes the given percentages.\n\nThe margin of error (E) is:\n\n\\[\nE = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is the critical z-value for the desired confidence level.\n\nBut in this case, we're given the interval and need to find the confidence level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the confidence interval and see what confidence level corresponds to the given interval.\n\nGiven that the sample proportion is 0.64 and the standard error is 0.024, and the interval is from 0.60 to 0.68, which is a total width of 0.08.\n\nThe margin of error would then be half of that, which is 0.04.\n\nSo, if E = 0.04, then:\n\n\\[\nE = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.04 = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times 0.024\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz_{\\alpha/2} = \\frac{0.04}{0.024} = 1.6667\n\\]\n\nLooking up z = 1.6667, the corresponding confidence level is approximately 90.4%.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 90.4%.\n\nI think that's solid. No need to consider finite population correction factors since the sample size is less than 10% of the population, and we're dealing with registered voters, presumably a large population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
