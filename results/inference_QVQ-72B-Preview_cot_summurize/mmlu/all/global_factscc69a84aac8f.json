                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"What is the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015?\" And the options are A. 26%, B. 46%, C. 66%, and D. 86%.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to find out the percentage of kids in that age group who have experienced bullying in the recent past, specifically as of 2015. Bullying is a serious issue, and it's important to have accurate information about its prevalence.\n\nI remember that there are various studies and statistics on bullying, but it's been a while since I looked into specific numbers. Let me think about where I can find reliable data on this topic.\n\nOne of the first places that comes to mind is the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which often collects data on student well-being and safety. They might have surveys or reports that include statistics on bullying.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conduct research on youth violence and bullying. They might have some relevant data.\n\nLet me consider looking at the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, which is an international study that includes the United States. It collects data every four years on various aspects of young people's health and well-being, including bullying.\n\nIf I can find the HBSC report from 2015 or around that time, that might give me the information I need.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program's reports, as they also collect data on bullying prevalence.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check the \"Bullying Statistics\" website or other reputable online resources that compile recent data on bullying.\n\nI should also consider checking academic journals or research papers published around 2015 that focus on bullying in early adolescence.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with specific percentage options, it's likely that the answer is one of these four choices: 26%, 46%, 66%, or 86%.\n\nI need to recall or find which of these percentages matches the bullying prevalence among 13-15-year-olds in the U.S. in 2015.\n\nLet me try to eliminate some options based on what I know.\n\nI know that bullying is a common problem, but I don't think it's as high as 86%. That seems too high, as that would mean that almost nine out of ten kids in that age group have been bullied at least once in a couple of months. That just doesn't sound right.\n\nSimilarly, 66% also seems quite high. If two out of every three kids are being bullied, that would be an alarming statistic.\n\nOn the other hand, 26% seems a bit low. I think bullying is more prevalent than that.\n\nSo, maybe 46% is a reasonable estimate. It's almost half of the kids in this age group, which seems plausible.\n\nBut I should rely on actual data rather than just my gut feeling.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was any specific study or report that mentioned this percentage.\n\nI think back to a study that might have reported that around 40-50% of students in middle school experience bullying.\n\nIs that the correct range?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with another statistic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the difference between lifetime bullying experiences and recent bullying.\n\nThe question specifies \"in the past couple of months,\" which suggests it's asking about recent experiences, not overall experiences up to that point.\n\nSo, it's important to find a statistic that refers to bullying within a specific time frame: the last couple of months.\n\nI need to make sure that the data I'm considering matches this timeframe.\n\nI recall that many bullying statistics refer to the school year or the past year, not necessarily the past couple of months.\n\nSo, I need to find a source that specifically asks about bullying in the past couple of months.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nIf the survey asks students how often they have been bullied in the past couple of months, that would be relevant.\n\nAlternatively, if it asks about bullying in the past 30 days or so, that might be comparable.\n\nI need to find a source that has data from around 2015.\n\nMaybe I should look for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) reports from the CDC. They conduct surveys every two years, and the 2015 report might have relevant data.\n\nLet me assume that the YRBSS includes questions on bullying.\n\nIf I can find the 2015 YRBSS report, I can check the percentages there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that in 2015, the YRBSS found that about 46% of students reported being bullied electronically or in person.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nI think I might be confusing it with another statistic.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I should look for international comparisons, as sometimes the HBSC survey provides data across countries, including the U.S.\n\nIf I can find the HBSC report from 2015, it might have the percentage of students who were bullied in the past couple of months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program's reports, as they often cite statistics from their own research.\n\nBut I don't remember the exact percentages from their reports.\n\nLet me consider that the correct answer might be 46%, as it seems to be a commonly cited figure in some bullying statistics.\n\nMoreover, it falls between 25% and 50%, which is a typical range for many health and social issues in populations.\n\nHowever, I should not just guess based on this; I need to verify with actual data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the definition of bullying.\n\nBullying is typically defined as repeated aggressive behavior intended to harm others, often involving an imbalance of power.\n\nGiven that definition, it's possible that a significant portion of children experience some form of bullying, but I need to confirm the exact percentage.\n\nLet me consider that in 2015, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that about 33% of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school.\n\nBut that's a slightly different age group and refers to bullying at school, not necessarily in the past couple of months.\n\nSo, that might not be directly applicable to the question at hand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for surveys that specifically target the 13-15 age group.\n\nI recall that some surveys categorize students as \"early adolescents,\" which often includes ages 10-15.\n\nIf I can find such a survey from around 2015, it might provide the needed data.\n\nWait, maybe I can recall that in 2015, a study found that approximately 46% of students in this age group reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months.\n\nDoes that sound familiar?\n\nI think I might have read something like that in a recent article or report.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was a figure mentioned in a class lecture or a documentary on bullying.\n\nGiven that, I'm starting to lean towards option B: 46%.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any data supporting the other options.\n\nFor instance, 26% seems too low for the prevalence of bullying in this age group.\n\nSimilarly, 66% and 86% seem too high, as that would imply that the majority or an overwhelming majority of kids are being bullied, which doesn't align with my understanding of current research.\n\nTherefore, I think the most plausible answer is 46%.\n\nTo confirm, I'll check if any of the sources I can recall support this percentage.\n\nI remember that in 2015, the CDC reported that about 46% of middle school students had been bullied electronically or in person.\n\nWait, is that accurate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was a different percentage.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf I can't recall the exact percentage from the CDC, maybe I can consider that 46% is a reasonable estimate based on various studies.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option B: 46%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
