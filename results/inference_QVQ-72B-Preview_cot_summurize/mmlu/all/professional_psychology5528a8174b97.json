                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options fits into tertiary prevention in a school setting. I need to first understand what tertiary prevention is. From what I recall, prevention levels are categorized into primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.\n\nPrimary prevention is about promoting health and preventing problems before they start. Secondary prevention is about early detection and intervention when a problem is starting to develop. Tertiary prevention is about managing and reducing the impact of an established problem or disorder.\n\nSo, in a school setting, tertiary prevention would involve interventions that help students who are already experiencing significant issues, to cope and prevent further deterioration.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Individual counseling for students resuming from an institutional care facility.\n\nThis seems like it's targeted at students who have been through some sort of care facility, like maybe a juvenile detention center or a mental health facility. They're coming back to school, and they're getting individual counseling. This sounds like helping them adjust and deal with any issues they might have encountered while they were away. Since they've already been through a significant event, this seems like it could be tertiary prevention.\n\nB. Career guidance offered to students unsure about plans after graduation.\n\nThis seems more like helping students plan for their future, whether that's college, vocational training, or entering the workforce. It's more about exploration and making informed decisions rather than addressing a specific problem or disorder. This might be more along the lines of primary or secondary prevention, helping to prevent future difficulties by preparing them well.\n\nC. Small-group counseling of students affected by the initial stages of divorce.\n\nHere, students are dealing with the early stages of divorce in their families. Divorce can be a stressful time, and small-group counseling could help them cope with the emotions and changes they're experiencing. Since it's the initial stages, this might be more of a secondary prevention intervention, aiming to provide support early on to prevent more serious issues from developing.\n\nD. Large-group programs emphasizing the development of children's self-esteem.\n\nThis sounds like a program designed to build self-esteem in a broader group of students. Self-esteem is important for overall well-being, and boosting it can help prevent various problems, such as depression, anxiety, or behavioral issues. This seems more like primary prevention, aiming to strengthen protective factors before any problems arise.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A seems to be the most fitting for tertiary prevention. It's targeted at students who have already been through a significant event (institutional care) and are likely experiencing ongoing issues as a result. Individual counseling can help them manage and overcome those issues, which aligns with the goal of tertiary prevention: to reduce the impact of an existing problem and prevent further complications.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that another option could also be considered tertiary prevention. For example, option C involves students affected by the initial stages of divorce. While divorce is a significant stressor, the fact that it's the initial stages might suggest that the problems are just beginning to manifest. Therefore, intervening at this stage might be more preventive, aiming to mitigate potential future problems, which would make it secondary prevention.\n\nOption B, career guidance, seems more developmental and preparatory, not directly addressing a specific problem or disorder. And option D, focusing on self-esteem, is a general protective factor and is more in line with primary prevention.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option A is the best fit for tertiary prevention in a school setting.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
