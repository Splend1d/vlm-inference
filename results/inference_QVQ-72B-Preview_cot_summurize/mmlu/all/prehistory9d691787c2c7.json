                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the earliest unequivocal evidence for art as symbolic expression. The options are:\n\nA. 95,000 BP, at Dolni Vestonice.\n\nB. 77,000 BP, at Blombos Cave.\n\nC. 50,000 BP, at Des Moines, IA.\n\nD. 36,000 BP, at Wharton Hill.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"unequivocal evidence for art as symbolic expression\" means. I think it refers to artifacts or artworks that clearly show intentional design and likely had some meaning beyond just their aesthetic appeal. So, these would be items that early humans created to communicate ideas, status, or other symbolic meanings.\n\nNow, I need to look at each option and see which one is the earliest.\n\nOption A: 95,000 BP at Dolni Vestonice.\n\nWait a minute, I thought Dolni Vestonice was a site in the Czech Republic, known for its Upper Paleolithic occupation, which is around 28,000 to 24,000 years ago. But 95,000 BP seems much older. Maybe I'm confusing it with another site. I should double-check that.\n\nOption B: 77,000 BP at Blombos Cave.\n\nI've heard of Blombos Cave in South Africa. It's famous for having some of the earliest evidence of human symbolic behavior, like ochre paintings and engraved stones. If it's dated to 77,000 years ago, that seems pretty early.\n\nOption C: 50,000 BP at Des Moines, IA.\n\nDes Moines is in Iowa, which is in the United States. I'm not sure about prehistoric sites there. I know that North America was inhabited by Indigenous peoples for many thousands of years, but I don't recall any sites from 50,000 years ago. Maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nOption D: 36,000 BP at Wharton Hill.\n\nI'm not familiar with Wharton Hill. It might be another site, possibly in Europe or somewhere else.\n\nAlright, let's try to organize this.\n\nFirst, I need to verify the ages and locations:\n\n- Dolni Vestonice: I thought it was from the Upper Paleolithic, which is generally after 40,000 years ago, but 95,000 BP seems too old for that period. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\n- Blombos Cave: I know this site has yielded early evidence of symbolic behavior, so 77,000 BP seems plausible.\n\n- Des Moines, IA: I'm not sure about the archaeological significance there, especially for such an early date.\n\n- Wharton Hill: No idea.\n\nMaybe I should look up each site to get accurate information.\n\nStarting with Dolni Vestonice:\n\nUpon checking, Dolni Vestonice is indeed a site in the Czech Republic, and it dates back to the Gravettian period, which is around 28,000 to 24,000 years ago. So, option A with 95,000 BP seems incorrect or perhaps misremembered.\n\nNext, Blombos Cave:\n\nThis site in South Africa is well-known for its archaeological findings, including engraved ochre and silcrete blades, which are thought to represent some of the earliest known examples of human symbolic behavior, dating back to around 77,000 years ago. So, option B seems accurate.\n\nNow, Des Moines, IA:\n\nDes Moines is in Iowa, and while there are certainly prehistoric sites in the area, the earliest human presence in North America is generally accepted to be around 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, with some evidence suggesting earlier dates. However, 50,000 BP seems too early for confirmed human presence in North America. Maybe there's a mistake in this option as well.\n\nLastly, Wharton Hill:\n\nI can't find any information about Wharton Hill being an archaeological site. It might be a fictional or misnamed location for the purposes of this question.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that Blombos Cave, with its artifacts dating back to 77,000 BP, is the earliest site listed that provides unequivocal evidence for art as symbolic expression.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there are any other sites not listed here that might be older.\n\nFor example, in recent years, there have been discoveries in Asia, such as the Denisova Cave in Siberia, which has yielded remains of Denisovans and Neanderthals, but I don't recall any specific artistic expressions from that early.\n\nAdditionally, in Indonesia, there are claims of early cave paintings, but I think they are generally dated to around 40,000 years ago, which is still after Blombos Cave.\n\nSimilarly, in Europe, the Chauvet-Pont d'Arc Cave in France has paintings dated to around 36,000 years ago, which is again later than Blombos Cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the options provided and the additional research I've done, it appears that Blombos Cave offers the earliest unequivocal evidence for art as symbolic expression at 77,000 BP.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 77,000 BP, at Blombos Cave.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
