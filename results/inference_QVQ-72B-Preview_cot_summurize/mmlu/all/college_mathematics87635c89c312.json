                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. How many nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices exist?\" And the options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory. A tree is a connected graph without any cycles, which means that there's exactly one path between any two vertices. Now, I need to find out how many different trees I can make with 5 vertices, where these trees are not isomorphic to each other. Isomorphic trees would have the same structure, just with the labels of the vertices rearranged.\n\nSo, my goal is to find all the unique tree structures with 5 vertices, where none of them can be transformed into another by just relabeling the vertices.\n\nI remember that trees can be represented using their degree sequences or their Pr\u00fcfer sequences, but maybe for such a small number of vertices, it's manageable to just draw them out and see.\n\nLet me try to draw all possible trees with 5 vertices and see which ones are nonisomorphic.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the path graph, which is a straight line. So, with 5 vertices, that would be a straight line with 4 edges: A - B - C - D - E. That's one tree.\n\nNext, I can think of a star graph, where one vertex is connected to all others, and those others are only connected to the central vertex. So, for 5 vertices, that would look like: A connected to B, C, D, E, and nothing else. That's another tree.\n\nAre there any other common tree structures with 5 vertices? Let me try to think of something else.\n\nMaybe a tree that's a combination of both. For example, starting with a path of 3 vertices and then attaching the remaining two vertices to one of them.\n\nWait, let's try that. Suppose I have a path of 3 vertices: A - B - C, and then I attach vertex D to B, and vertex E to B. So, it would look like A - B - C, with D and E both connected to B. That seems like a different structure from the path and the star.\n\nAlternatively, I could attach D and E to different vertices. For example, A - B - C, with D connected to B and E connected to C. That might be another distinct tree.\n\nLet me try to visualize these. So, I have:\n\n1. Path: A - B - C - D - E\n\n2. Star: A connected to B, C, D, E\n\n3. One where A - B - C, and B is connected to D and E\n\n4. And one where A - B - C, with B connected to D and C connected to E\n\nWait, is the fourth one actually a tree? Let me check. A - B - C, B - D, C - E. Yes, that's a tree with no cycles and it's connected.\n\nSo, now I have four different trees:\n\n1. Path: A - B - C - D - E\n\n2. Star: A - B, A - C, A - D, A - E\n\n3. A - B - C, B - D, B - E\n\n4. A - B - C, B - D, C - E\n\nAre there any more? Let's see.\n\nIs there a tree where A - B - C, A connected to D, and C connected to E? Wait, that's similar to the fourth one I have, which is A - B - C, B - D, C - E. So, it's just shifting the connections, but it's essentially the same structure, just relabeled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a tree where A - B - C, A - D, B - E. Let's see: A - B - C, A - D, B - E. Is this distinct from the others?\n\nComparing to the third tree: A - B - C, B - D, B - E. In this new one, A is connected to D instead of B being connected to both D and E. So, is this a distinct structure?\n\nHmm, maybe not. It seems like this would be isomorphic to the star graph if we rearrange the labels.\n\nWait, maybe I need a better way to think about this. Perhaps using degree sequences.\n\nLet's consider the degree sequences of the trees I've drawn.\n\nFirst, the path: degrees are 1, 2, 2, 2, 1. So, two leaves and three vertices of degree 2.\n\nSecond, the star: degrees are 4, 1, 1, 1, 1. So, one central vertex of degree 4 and four leaves.\n\nThird, A - B - C, B - D, B - E: degrees are 1 (A), 3 (B), 1 (C), 1 (D), 1 (E). So, one vertex of degree 3 and four vertices of degree 1.\n\nFourth, A - B - C, B - D, C - E: degrees are 1 (A), 2 (B), 2 (C), 1 (D), 1 (E). So, three vertices of degree 2 and two leaves.\n\nWait a minute, the third and fourth trees have different degree sequences, which suggests they are not isomorphic.\n\nThe third tree has degrees 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, while the fourth has degrees 1, 2, 2, 1, 1.\n\nSo, they are distinct in terms of degree sequences.\n\nIs there another tree with a different degree sequence?\n\nLet me try to see. Maybe a tree where A - B - C, A - D, C - E.\n\nSo, A - B - C, A - D, C - E.\n\nDegrees: A has degree 2, B has degree 1, C has degree 2, D has degree 1, E has degree 1.\n\nSo, degrees are 2, 1, 2, 1, 1.\n\nComparing to the fourth tree, which also has degrees 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, it seems similar, just with different labeling.\n\nSo, it's probably isomorphic to the fourth tree.\n\nTherefore, I don't count it as a new one.\n\nAre there any other possible degree sequences for trees with 5 vertices?\n\nLet's see. We have:\n\n- Path: 1, 2, 2, 2, 1\n\n- Star: 4, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\n- Third tree: 1, 3, 1, 1, 1\n\n- Fourth tree: 1, 2, 2, 1, 1\n\nIs there a tree with a different degree sequence?\n\nWait, what about a tree where one vertex has degree 2, another has degree 3, and the rest have degree 1? Wait, that's similar to the third tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a tree where two vertices have degree 2, and three have degree 1, which is like the fourth tree.\n\nIs there a way to have a tree where three vertices have degree 2 and two have degree 1, but arranged differently than the fourth tree?\n\nI don't think so. The only difference would be which vertices are connected, but the structure would still be the same.\n\nSo, based on degree sequences, it seems like there are four nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices:\n\n1. Path: 1, 2, 2, 2, 1\n\n2. Star: 4, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\n3. One central vertex connected to four leaves: 1, 3, 1, 1, 1\n\n4. Two vertices each connected to two others, and two leaves: 1, 2, 2, 1, 1\n\nWait, but I recall that for trees with 5 vertices, there are only three nonisomorphic trees.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me check a standard list of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nI think there are only three nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcounting.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFirst, the path tree: A - B - C - D - E\n\nSecond, the star tree: A - B, A - C, A - D, A - E\n\nThird, the tree where A - B - C, and B - D, C - E\n\nWait, is this last one distinct from the others?\n\nLet me try to see if this tree is isomorphic to the path or the star.\n\nIt's not the path because the path has only two vertices of degree 1 and three of degree 2, while this tree has two vertices of degree 2 and three of degree 1.\n\nIt's not the star because the star has one vertex of degree 4 and four of degree 1, whereas this tree has two vertices of degree 2 and three of degree 1.\n\nSo, it's a distinct tree.\n\nNow, is there another tree that is nonisomorphic to these three?\n\nLet me try to draw another tree.\n\nSuppose I have A - B - C, A - D, C - E.\n\nSo, degrees are A:2, B:1, C:2, D:1, E:1.\n\nIs this isomorphic to the previous tree where A - B - C, B - D, C - E?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn the first tree, A and C have degree 2, while B, D, and E have degree 1.\n\nIn the second tree, A and C have degree 2, while B, D, and E have degree 1.\n\nSo, their degree sequences are the same.\n\nIs there a way to relabel the vertices to make them look the same?\n\nLet me try to relabel the vertices in the second tree.\n\nLet me set vertex A in the first tree to correspond to vertex A in the second tree.\n\nThen, B in the first tree is connected only to A, so in the second tree, B is connected only to A.\n\nSimilarly, C in the first tree is connected to B and E, while in the second tree, C is connected to A and E.\n\nWait, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set A in the first tree to correspond to C in the second tree.\n\nThen, B in the first tree is connected only to A, and in the second tree, C is connected to A and E.\n\nThat doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, set A in the first tree to correspond to C in the second tree, and C in the first tree to correspond to A in the second tree.\n\nThen, B in the first tree is connected to A, and in the second tree, C is connected to A and E.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set A in the first tree to correspond to A in the second tree, B to correspond to C, C to correspond to B, D to correspond to D, and E to correspond to E.\n\nThen, in the first tree, A - B - C, B - D, C - E.\n\nIn the second tree, A - B - C, A - D, C - E.\n\nThese are different connections, so they are not isomorphic.\n\nWait, but in the second tree, A is connected to B and D, while in the first tree, A is connected only to B and C.\n\nSo, they are different.\n\nTherefore, these are distinct trees.\n\nBut earlier, I thought there are only three nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nLet me check a reference or recall if there are indeed only three nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nI recall that for n=5, there are three nonisomorphic trees: the path, the star, and the \"caterpillar\" tree, which is like a path with extra leaves attached.\n\nWait, maybe the fourth tree I drew is isomorphic to one of the others.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFirst tree: path P5: A - B - C - D - E\n\nSecond tree: star: A - B, A - C, A - D, A - E\n\nThird tree: A - B - C, B - D, B - E\n\nFourth tree: A - B - C, A - D, C - E\n\nWait, perhaps the third and fourth trees are isomorphic.\n\nLet me try to relabel the vertices to see if they match.\n\nIn the third tree: A - B - C, B - D, B - E\n\nIn the fourth tree: A - B - C, A - D, C - E\n\nTheir degree sequences are different: third tree has degrees 1,3,1,1,1; fourth tree has 1,2,2,1,1.\n\nSo, their degree sequences are different, which suggests they are not isomorphic.\n\nBut I thought there are only three nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are indeed four nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices, and my initial recollection was wrong.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth tree is isomorphic to one of the first three.\n\nWait, perhaps the fourth tree is just a different labeling of the third tree.\n\nLet me try to relabel the vertices in the fourth tree to see if it matches the third tree.\n\nIn the third tree: A - B - C, B - D, B - E\n\nIn the fourth tree: A - B - C, A - D, C - E\n\nIf I relabel vertex D in the third tree to be E, and E to be D, would that make them the same?\n\nIn the third tree, B is connected to D and E.\n\nIn the fourth tree, A is connected to D, and C is connected to E.\n\nThese are different connections.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to relabel.\n\nIt seems like they are distinct trees.\n\nTherefore, there are four nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 4.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check again.\n\nFirst tree: path P5\n\nSecond tree: star\n\nThird tree: one vertex connected to three others, forming a \"Y\" shape\n\nFourth tree: a \"caterpillar\" tree, with a central path and leaves attached to it.\n\nYes, these seem to be distinct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth tree is isomorphic to the third one, and I'm missing it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider automorphisms.\n\nIn the third tree, B is the central vertex connected to three leaves.\n\nIn the fourth tree, A and C are both connected to two other vertices each.\n\nSo, their structures are different.\n\nTherefore, I think there are indeed four nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
