                    "text": "So I need to find the times-interest-earned ratio for this company. Let me see what information they've given me. There's income after tax of $5.4 million, interest expense of $1 million, depreciation expense of $1 million, and a 40% tax rate. Okay, so the times-interest-earned ratio is a measure of how well a company can cover its interest expenses with its operating income. The formula for this ratio is:\n\nTimes-interest-earned = EBIT / Interest expense\n\nWhere EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. So, I need to find EBIT first.\n\nNow, I have income after tax, which is\u51c0\u5229\u6da6 after tax, right? So, income after tax is $5.4 million. To find EBIT, I need to work backwards from the net income.\n\nLet me recall the basic income statement structure:\n\nRevenue - Costs = Operating income (EBIT)\n\nOperating income - Interest expense = Earnings before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings before tax - Taxes = Net income\n\nSo, if I have net income and I want to find EBIT, I need to add back taxes and interest expense.\n\nNet income = EBT - Taxes\n\nAnd EBT = EBIT - Interest expense\n\nSo, Net income = (EBIT - Interest expense) - Taxes\n\nGiven that, I can rearrange to solve for EBIT:\n\nNet income = EBIT - Interest expense - Taxes\n\nSo, EBIT = Net income + Interest expense + Taxes\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. I have net income, interest expense, and I can calculate taxes.\n\nWait, but they've given me a tax rate of 40%, but I don't have the tax amount directly. Maybe I can find the tax amount from the net income.\n\nLet me see: Net income is $5.4 million, and that's after tax. So, if I had EBT, taxes would be 40% of EBT.\n\nBut I don't have EBT directly. Maybe I need to find EBT first.\n\nAlternatively, since Net income = EBT - Taxes, and Taxes = 0.4 * EBT, then Net income = EBT - 0.4 * EBT = 0.6 * EBT\n\nSo, EBT = Net income / 0.6 = $5.4 million / 0.6 = $9 million\n\nOkay, so EBT is $9 million.\n\nNow, EBT = EBIT - Interest expense\n\nSo, EBIT = EBT + Interest expense = $9 million + $1 million = $10 million\n\nThen, times-interest-earned = EBIT / Interest expense = $10 million / $1 million = 10\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 10\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using depreciation.\n\nDepreciation is given as $1 million. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, and it's included in the operating income. So, in the income statement, operating income is Revenue - Costs (including depreciation), and then EBIT is operating income - Interest expense.\n\nBut in the method I used above, I didn't directly use depreciation. Maybe I should check if depreciation affects the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the cash flow approach. Operating cash flow is Net income + Depreciation - Changes in working capital, but I don't have information about working capital.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the cash coverage ratio, but that's not what's being asked here. The times-interest-earned ratio is specifically EBIT / Interest expense.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct. EBIT is $10 million, interest expense is $1 million, so the ratio is 10.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 5.4\n\nB. 6.4\n\nC. 7.4\n\nD. 10\n\nSo, D. 10 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to calculate this.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula:\n\nEBIT = Net income / (1 - Tax rate) + Interest expense * (1 - Tax rate)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since Net income = EBIT - Interest expense - Taxes, and Taxes = 0.4 * EBT, and EBT = EBIT - Interest expense, then:\n\nNet income = EBIT - Interest expense - 0.4 * (EBIT - Interest expense)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nNet income = EBIT - Interest expense - 0.4EBIT + 0.4 * Interest expense\n\nNet income = (1 - 0.4)EBIT - (1 - 0.4)Interest expense\n\nNet income = 0.6EBIT - 0.6 * Interest expense\n\nSo, EBIT = (Net income + 0.6 * Interest expense) / 0.6\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nEBIT = ($5.4 million + 0.6 * $1 million) / 0.6 = ($5.4 + $0.6) / 0.6 = $6 million / 0.6 = $10 million\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, times-interest-earned = $10 million / $1 million = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 10\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
