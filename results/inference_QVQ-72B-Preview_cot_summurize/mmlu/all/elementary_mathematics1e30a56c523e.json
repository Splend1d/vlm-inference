                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a soccer team has $90.00 to buy soccer balls, and each soccer ball costs $15.60. I need to figure out the greatest number of soccer balls they can buy. The options are 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nAlright, first thing I should do is probably divide the total money by the cost of one soccer ball to see how many they can buy. So, $90 divided by $15.60. Hmm, $15.60 is not a whole number, which might make the division a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nLet me try to do this step by step. Maybe I can convert the dollars to cents to make the numbers whole numbers, since dealing with cents might be easier. So, $90 is 9000 cents, and $15.60 is 1560 cents. Now, dividing 9000 by 1560 should be simpler.\n\nLet me see: 1560 times what equals 9000? Well, 1560 times 5 is 7800, and 1560 times 6 is 9360. Since 9360 is more than 9000, that means they can't buy 6 soccer balls. So, 5 seems like the answer, but let me check if 5 is feasible.\n\n1560 times 5 is 7800 cents, which is $78.00. So, $78.00 is less than $90.00. That means they can buy 5 soccer balls and still have some money left over. But the question is asking for the greatest number of soccer balls they can buy. So, why can't they buy 6?\n\nWell, 1560 times 6 is 9360 cents, which is $93.60, and that's more than $90.00. So, they don't have enough money for 6 soccer balls. Therefore, the maximum they can buy is 5 soccer balls.\n\nWait a minute, but option C is 6. That can't be right because we just saw that 6 soccer balls cost more than $90.00. So, maybe the answer is B, which is 5.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Starting again: total money is $90.00, each soccer ball costs $15.60. So, $90 \u00f7 $15.60 = ?\n\nLet me try dividing 90 by 15.6. Well, 15.6 times 5 is 78, and 15.6 times 6 is 93.6. Since 93.6 is more than 90, they can't buy 6. So, 5 is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to buy more than 5. Let me think about whether there's any discount or something, but no, the problem seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if they can buy a fraction of a soccer ball, but that doesn't make sense because you can't buy a part of a soccer ball. So, they can only buy whole soccer balls.\n\nAnother thought: maybe if they get some discount for buying in bulk, but the problem doesn't mention any discounts. So, I think the answer is indeed 5.\n\nI think I've covered all the possible angles here. The team can buy 5 soccer balls with $90.00 at $15.60 each.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
