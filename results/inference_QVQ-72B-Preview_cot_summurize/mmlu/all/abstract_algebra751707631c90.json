From my algebra class, I remember that a homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. So, in this case, we're looking at groups under addition, right? Z is the group of integers under addition, and Z_2 is the group of integers modulo 2 under addition.\n\nSo, Z is an infinite cyclic group generated by 1, and Z_2 is a finite cyclic group with two elements: [0] and [1].\n\nI need to find all functions f: Z \u2192 Z_2 that satisfy f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all integers a and b.\n\nSince Z is cyclic, any homomorphism is determined by where it sends the generator 1. So, if I can determine f(1), then f(n) for any integer n is just n times f(1).\n\nSo, let's think about where f can send 1. Let's set f(1) = x, where x is an element in Z_2. So, x can be either [0] or [1].\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: f(1) = [0]\n\nThen, for any integer n, f(n) = n * [0] = [0]. So, f is the trivial homomorphism that sends everything in Z to [0] in Z_2.\n\nIs this a valid homomorphism? Let's check.\n\nFor any a, b in Z, f(a + b) = [0], and f(a) + f(b) = [0] + [0] = [0]. So, f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b). Yes, it's a valid homomorphism.\n\nCase 2: f(1) = [1]\n\nThen, for any integer n, f(n) = n * [1] = [n] in Z_2.\n\nWait, in Z_2, [n] is equal to [0] if n is even, and [1] if n is odd.\n\nSo, f(n) = [n], which is [0] if n is even, and [1] if n is odd.\n\nIs this a valid homomorphism? Let's check.\n\nTake a, b in Z. Suppose a and b are both even, then f(a + b) = [0], and f(a) + f(b) = [0] + [0] = [0]. Good.\n\nIf a and b are both odd, f(a + b) = [0] (since a + b is even), and f(a) + f(b) = [1] + [1] = [0]. Good.\n\nIf one is even and one is odd, say a is even and b is odd, then a + b is odd. So, f(a + b) = [1], and f(a) + f(b) = [0] + [1] = [1]. Good.\n\nSo, this is also a valid homomorphism.\n\nAre there any other possibilities? Well, f(1) can only be [0] or [1] in Z_2, and both of these lead to valid homomorphisms.\n\nSo, it seems there are only two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to have infinitely many homomorphisms? Like, could there be homomorphisms that aren't determined just by f(1)?\n\nWell, since Z is cyclic, any homomorphism is determined by where it sends 1, and in Z_2, there are only two choices for f(1), which are [0] and [1]. So, only two possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the kernel of the homomorphism. The kernel is the set of elements in Z that map to [0] in Z_2.\n\nIn the first case, the kernel is all of Z, since everything maps to [0].\n\nIn the second case, the kernel is the set of even integers, since those map to [0], and the odd integers map to [1].\n\nSo, these are two distinct homomorphisms with different kernels.\n\nIs there a way to have more than two distinct homomorphisms? For example, could there be a homomorphism where some even numbers map to [1]? But no, because in Z_2, even numbers are [0], and odd numbers are [1].\n\nWait, no. In Z_2, every even number is congruent to 0 modulo 2, and every odd number is congruent to 1 modulo 2. So, there's no room for variation; it's fixed by the group structure.\n\nTherefore, there are only two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll check if there are any other possible mappings that could be homomorphisms.\n\nSuppose I try to define a homomorphism where f(1) = [0], but then f(2) = 2*[0] = [0], f(3) = 3*[0] = [0], and so on, which is the trivial homomorphism.\n\nIf I set f(1) = [1], then f(2) = 2*[1] = [0], f(3) = 3*[1] = [1], and so on, which is the other homomorphism.\n\nI can't set f(1) to anything else in Z_2, because there are only two elements.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
