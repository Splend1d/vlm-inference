                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out who has the better claim to the land. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a rancher who owns a piece of land in fee simple. That means he has absolute ownership of the property, right? He leaves the property in 1977 to move to the city. Then, in 1978, a man starts occupying the land as an adverse possessor. He stays there from 1978 to 1988, but then he leaves for a year in 1989 to take care of his sick mother. He comes back in 1990 and stays until 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, the rancher dies in 1994 and leaves the property to his son. The son finds out about this in 2010 and wants to eject the man who's been living there. The statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years.\n\nOkay, so adverse possession is when someone who doesn't own the land occupies it continuously and openly for a certain period, and after that period, they can claim ownership. In this case, the period is 20 years.\n\nThe man started occupying in 1978 and left in 1989 for a year, then came back in 1990 and stayed until 2010. So, from 1978 to 1988 is 10 years, then he left for a year, and then was back from 1990 to 2010, which is another 20 years. But does the year he left break the continuity of his possession?\n\nI think it does because adverse possession requires continuous and uninterrupted possession for the entire statutory period. If he left for a year in 1989, that might reset the clock.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some leeway if the absence was temporary and he intended to return. He did come back the following year, in 1990. Maybe the court would consider that a temporary absence and not interrupt the adverse possession period.\n\nBut the statutory period is 20 years, and he was there from 1978 to 1988 (10 years), absent in 1989, and then back from 1990 to 2010 (20 years). So total possession would be 10 + 20 = 30 years, but with a one-year break in between.\n\nDoes that one-year break matter? I think it does. Adverse possession requires uninterrupted possession for the full 20 years. So, even if he had 30 years of possession, but with a one-year break, that might invalidate his claim.\n\nBut maybe the law allows for some interruptions, especially if they're brief and the possessor returns promptly. Perhaps the court would consider the absence as not significant enough to break the continuity of possession.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the possessor can tack on the periods before and after the interruption if he can show that he intended to continue his adverse possession.\n\nWait, I recall that in some jurisdictions, possessors can tack noncontinuous periods of possession if they meet certain conditions.\n\nLet me think about this. If the man was there for 10 years, left for a year, and then came back for another 20 years, maybe he can add those periods together to meet the 20-year requirement.\n\nBut I think the general rule is that any significant interruption resets the clock on adverse possession. So, if he left for a year, that might have reset the period, meaning he would have to start the 20 years over again in 1990.\n\nIf that's the case, then from 1990 to 2010 would be 20 years, so he would have met the statutory period by 2010.\n\nBut the rancher died in 2010, and his son is bringing the ejectment suit that same year. So, the man had been on the property for 20 years from 1990 to 2010, which would mean he acquired title by adverse possession in 2010.\n\nBut the rancher died in 2010, and his son inherited the property that same year. So, did the man acquire title before the son inherited it?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look at when the adverse possession period ended in relation to the transfer of title.\n\nIn general, adverse possession can extinguish the original owner's title, but only if the possessor has met all the requirements, including the statutory period.\n\nIf the man completed his 20 years of adverse possession before the rancher died and the son inherited, then the son wouldn't have any title to inherit because the title would have already passed to the possessor.\n\nBut did the man complete his 20 years before 2010?\n\nHe started in 1978, was there until 1988 (10 years), left in 1989, and came back in 1990 until 2010 (20 years). So, from 1990 to 2010 is exactly 20 years. Therefore, in 2010, he completed his 20 years of adverse possession.\n\nBut did the one-year absence in 1989 reset the clock? If it did, then his 20 years would be from 1990 to 2010, which matches the period he was back on the property.\n\nAssuming that, then in 2010, when the rancher died, the man had already acquired title by adverse possession. Therefore, the son wouldn't have any title to inherit because the title was already with the possessor.\n\nSo, in that case, the son wouldn't have a valid claim to the property, and the man would have a better claim through adverse possession.\n\nBut option A says the son will lose because the man has acquired title by adverse possession. That seems to align with what I just thought.\n\nOption B says the son will win because the statutory period doesn't run against a remainderman until his interest becomes possessory. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. A remainderman is someone who is supposed to get the property in the future, like a life estate plus remainder. But in this scenario, it's a fee simple estate. The rancher owned it in fee simple, and he left it to his son in 1994. But the son didn't take possession until after the rancher's death in 2010. So, perhaps the son is considered a remainderman, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nOption C says the son will win because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year. But as I thought earlier, that one-year absence might or might not interrupt the adverse possession period. If it doesn't, then the man still has a valid claim.\n\nOption D says the son will win because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance. But if the man already had title by adverse possession, then the son wouldn't have received any title from the rancher.\n\nI think the key here is whether the man completed the 20 years of adverse possession before the rancher died and the son inherited. Since he started in 1978, was interrupted in 1989, and then continued from 1990 to 2010, that's a total of 20 years from 1990 to 2010. So, by 2010, he had completed the statutory period and acquired title.\n\nTherefore, the son's ejectment suit would fail because the man already owns the property through adverse possession.\n\nSo, the answer is A: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
