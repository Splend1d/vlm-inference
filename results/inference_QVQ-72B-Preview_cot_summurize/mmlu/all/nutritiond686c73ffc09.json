                    "text": "So I know that obesity is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, and the question is asking which hormone mediates this effect. The options are testosterone, estrogen, insulin-like growth factor-1, and thyroxine. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst off, endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the uterus, right? And obesity is linked to higher levels of certain hormones in the body. So, maybe the hormone that's increased in obesity also increases the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with testosterone. I know that testosterone is primarily a male sex hormone, but women also produce small amounts. Obesity can sometimes affect testosterone levels, but I don't recall a direct link between testosterone and endometrial cancer. Maybe it's not the main mediator here.\n\nNext is estrogen. Now, estrogen is a female sex hormone that plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system, including the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. I've heard that higher levels of estrogen can increase the risk of endometrial cancer, especially if it's not balanced by progesterone. Obese women might have higher estrogen levels because fat tissue can convert androgens into estrogen through a process called aromatization. So, maybe obesity leads to higher estrogen levels, which in turn increase the risk of endometrial cancer. That sounds plausible.\n\nThen there's insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). I know that obesity is often associated with higher levels of IGF-1, which is involved in cell growth and division. Increased IGF-1 could potentially promote cancer development, including endometrial cancer. So, this could also be a possible mediator.\n\nLastly, thyroxine. Thyroxine is a thyroid hormone that regulates metabolism. Obesity can sometimes be associated with thyroid function abnormalities, but I don't think there's a direct link between thyroxine levels and endometrial cancer risk. Maybe not the primary mediator here.\n\nSo, between estrogen and IGF-1, both seem to have a connection to obesity and endometrial cancer. But I need to think about which one is thought to primarily mediate this effect.\n\nI recall that in postmenopausal women, who are at higher risk for endometrial cancer, estrogen levels can remain elevated due to aromatization in adipose tissue. This continued exposure to estrogen without the protective effect of progesterone can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, which can progress to cancer. So, estrogen seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOn the other hand, IGF-1 is involved in various cellular processes and could contribute to cancer development, but I don't think it's the primary mediator in the relationship between obesity and endometrial cancer.\n\nLet me see if I can find any additional information to confirm this. I remember reading that weight loss can reduce estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, which might lower their risk of endometrial cancer. That suggests that estrogen is a key factor.\n\nAlso, in premenopausal women, obesity can lead to irregular periods and anovulation, which results in less frequent drops in estrogen levels, potentially increasing the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that estrogen is the primary hormone that mediates the effect of obesity on endometrial cancer risk.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any evidence suggesting that IGF-1 directly influences endometrial cancer risk independent of estrogen levels. A quick search in my mind brings up some studies that have looked at IGF-1 and endometrial cancer, but I think the evidence isn't as strong as that for estrogen.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that estrogen is the hormone that primarily mediates the effect of obesity on endometrial cancer risk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
