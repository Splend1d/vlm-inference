I need to figure out which one of these is correctly matched with the British English term 'lorry.'\n\nFirst off, I know that 'lorry' is a British English term, and I think it refers to a large vehicle used for transporting goods. Let me confirm that. In American English, we usually call that a truck. So, option B is a truck. Maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider each option:\n\nA. a toaster: That's a kitchen appliance used for toasting bread. In British English, they also call it a toaster. So, that doesn't seem to match with 'lorry.'\n\nC. a babysitter: That's someone who looks after children while their parents are away. In British English, they might say babysitter or baby-sitter. Again, doesn't seem related to 'lorry.'\n\nD. an elevator: In American English, we call it an elevator, but in British English, they call it a lift. So, 'lorry' isn't related to that either.\n\nSo, by elimination, it seems like B. a truck is the correct answer. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that in British English, a lorry is indeed a large vehicle for transporting goods, which corresponds to what we call a truck in American English. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other context where 'lorry' might refer to something else. For example, in some dialects or specific contexts, could 'lorry' mean something different? Well, possibly, but I don't think so. It's pretty standard in British English to refer to a truck as a lorry.\n\nMoreover, I can think of the phrase \"lorry driver,\" which in America would be equivalent to a truck driver. That further reinforces the idea that 'lorry' is equivalent to 'truck' in American English.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. a truck.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
