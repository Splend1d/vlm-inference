                    "text": "Let's see. The problem says that at West Elementary School, there are 20 more girls than boys. And there are 180 girls. I need to find out how many boys there are. It gives me four options: add 20 to 180, subtract 20 from 180, multiply 180 by 20, or divide 180 by 20.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means that there are 20 more girls than boys. That means if I have a certain number of boys, the number of girls is that number plus 20. So, if the number of boys is, let's say, B, then the number of girls is B plus 20.\n\nThe problem tells me that there are 180 girls. So, I can set up an equation: B + 20 = 180.\n\nNow, to find B, I need to solve for B in this equation. If I subtract 20 from both sides of the equation, I get B = 180 - 20.\n\nLet me check that. Starting with B + 20 = 180, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\nB + 20 - 20 = 180 - 20\n\nSo, B = 160.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But just to make sure, let's think about it differently. Maybe I can use the information that there are 20 more girls than boys.\n\nIf there are 180 girls and that's 20 more than the number of boys, then the number of boys should be 180 minus 20, which is 160.\n\nWait, is there another way to look at it? Maybe I can think about the total number of students. But no, the problem doesn't ask for the total number of students, just the number of boys.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other information or if maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. The problem says \"there are 20 more girls than boys,\" and there are 180 girls. So, it seems pretty direct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. add 20 to 180\n\nB. subtract 20 from 180\n\nC. multiply 180 by 20\n\nD. divide 180 by 20\n\nOption B seems correct because subtracting 20 from 180 gives 160, which is the number of boys.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what each option would give:\n\nA. Adding 20 to 180 would give 200, which would be girls plus 20, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nC. Multiplying 180 by 20 would give 3600, which is way beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nD. Dividing 180 by 20 would give 9, which seems too small to be the number of boys when compared to 180 girls.\n\nSo, logically, option B is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other relationship or if the problem is trying to trick me. But no, it seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me try plugging in the numbers. If there are 160 boys and 20 more girls than boys, then girls would be 160 + 20 = 180, which matches the given number of girls.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and option B is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
