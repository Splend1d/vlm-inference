                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about personnel selection and when it's appropriate to ask someone's age. The options are:\n\nA. If employees in a certain age group might not perform as well as some younger employees in the same job.\n\nB. If age is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n\nC. If properly administered intelligence and personality tests suggest that the incumbent is not likely to perform satisfactorily in the future.\n\nD. If standardized test results show that the incumbent does not have all the aptitudes expected for the particular job.\n\nI need to figure out which of these scenarios makes it appropriate to ask for someone's age during the hiring process.\n\nFirst off, I know that age discrimination in employment is generally illegal under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in the United States. This act protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from discrimination based on age in hiring, promotion, termination, compensation, and other aspects of employment.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says that if employees in a given age group may not perform as well as some younger employees in the same job, it's appropriate to ask age.\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit like stereotyping. Just because some younger employees perform better doesn't mean that age should be a factor in hiring. This could lead to age discrimination. I don't think this is a valid reason to ask for age.\n\nOption B says that if age is a bona fide occupational requirement, it's appropriate to ask age.\n\nI've heard of bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQs) under the Civil Rights Act. These are exceptions that allow employers to make employment decisions based on factors like sex, religion, national origin, or age if they are essential to the job's successful performance.\n\nSo, if age is genuinely necessary for the job, maybe for specific roles where age affects job performance or safety, then it could be considered a BFOQ.\n\nFor example, a company hiring models for a clothing line that targets a specific age group might require models to be within that age range. Or, perhaps in some roles where physical capabilities decline with age and are crucial for job performance, age might be a BFOQ.\n\nBut, these are limited exceptions, and employers need to demonstrate that age is indeed essential to the job.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible scenario where asking age might be appropriate, but it's a narrow exception.\n\nOption C says that if intelligence and personality tests suggest that the incumbent is not likely to perform well in the future, it's appropriate to ask age.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Intelligence and personality tests are typically used to assess current abilities and traits, not future performance based on age.\n\nMoreover, using such tests to predict future performance based on age could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nEmployers should base hiring decisions on current qualifications and abilities, not on assumptions about how age might affect future performance.\n\nSo, I don't think this is a valid reason to ask for age.\n\nOption D says that if standardized test results show that the incumbent doesn't have all the aptitudes expected for the job, it's appropriate to ask age.\n\nAgain, standardized tests are meant to measure current skills and aptitudes, not to assess age.\n\nIf someone doesn't have all the required aptitudes, that's about their abilities, not their age.\n\nAsking for age in this scenario could be seen as irrelevant and potentially discriminatory.\n\nEmployers should focus on the required qualifications and abilities for the job, not on age.\n\nSo, this doesn't seem like a proper reason to inquire about age.\n\nAfter considering all the options, it seems that option B is the most appropriate scenario where asking for age is acceptable\u2014when age is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n\nHowever, even in this case, it's important to note that BFOQs are narrowly defined and strictly interpreted, and employers must demonstrate that age is essential to the job's performance.\n\nIn summary, among the given options, B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
