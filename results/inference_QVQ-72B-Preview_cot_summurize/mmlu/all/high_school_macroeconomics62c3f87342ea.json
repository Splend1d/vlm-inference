                    "text": "So I have this question about macroeconomics, using the AD and AS model. It's about what happens in the short run to real GDP, the price level, and unemployment when there's more consumption spending, which is C in economics terms. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what AD and AS stand for. AD is Aggregate Demand, which is the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given time. AS is Aggregate Supply, which is the total supply of goods and services that firms in an economy plan to sell during a certain period.\n\nNow, consumption spending (C) is one component of Aggregate Demand. Other components include Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (NX). So, AD = C + I + G + NX.\n\nIf consumption spending increases, that means people are buying more goods and services. This should lead to an increase in total demand, right? So, the AD curve should shift to the right.\n\nGraphically, in the AD-AS model, the AD curve shifting to the right would mean that at each price level, there's now more demand.\n\nSo, what happens when AD increases?\n\nIn the short run, both real GDP and the price level are expected to increase. Here's why:\n\n- As demand increases, firms respond by producing more to meet that demand, which leads to an increase in real GDP.\n\n- Additionally, as demand outpaces supply at the current price level, prices tend to rise.\n\nSo, the price level increases, and real GDP increases.\n\nBut what about unemployment?\n\nUnemployment is inversely related to real GDP in the short run. When real GDP increases, firms are producing more, which likely means they're hiring more workers, leading to decreased unemployment.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct option should be:\n\nC. Increases Increases Decreases\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nOption A says:\n\nA. Increases Decreases Decreases\n\nThat would suggest that real GDP increases, price level decreases, and unemployment decreases. But according to the AD-AS model, when AD increases, the price level should increase, not decrease. So, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption B:\n\nB. Decreases Increases Increases\n\nThis suggests that real GDP decreases, price level increases, and unemployment increases. That would be more in line with a decrease in AS, not an increase in AD. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C:\n\nC. Increases Increases Decreases\n\nThis aligns with what I thought: real GDP increases, price level increases, and unemployment decreases.\n\nOption D:\n\nD. Decreases Decreases Decreases\n\nThis suggests that real GDP decreases, price level decreases, and unemployment decreases. This doesn't make much sense in the context of increased consumption spending.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that could affect this.\n\nIn the short run, assuming that AS is upward sloping, an increase in AD will indeed lead to higher GDP and higher prices. Unemployment should decrease as firms hire more workers to produce the additional goods and services demanded.\n\nIn the long run, things might be different, but the question specifies the short run.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
