It says that believing a child's misbehavior has one of four goals\u2014attention, revenge, power, or displaying inadequacy\u2014is most consistent with which of the following therapies or theories:\n\nA. Beck\u2019s cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nB. Adler\u2019s individual psychology.\n\nC. Perls\u2019s Gestalt therapy.\n\nD. Mahler\u2019s object relations theory.\n\nHmm, I need to recall which of these approaches focuses on the idea that misbehavior in children is aimed at achieving specific goals like attention, revenge, power, or feeling inadequate.\n\nLet me start by eliminating the ones that don't directly relate to this concept.\n\nFirst, Beck\u2019s cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is primarily about changing negative thoughts and behaviors, especially in adults dealing with depression and anxiety. While it does deal with behavior, I don't recall it specifically outlining these four goals for child misbehavior.\n\nNext, Perls\u2019s Gestalt therapy is more about self-awareness and personal growth, emphasizing the present moment and the individual's experiences. It doesn't seem to fit the description of categorizing misbehavior goals in children.\n\nThen, Mahler\u2019s object relations theory is focused on the child's relationship with primary caregivers and the development of the self as separate from others. While it deals with childhood development and relationships, it doesn't directly align with the idea of misbehavior having specific goals like attention or revenge.\n\nThat leaves Adler\u2019s individual psychology. I think Adler is known for his work on inferiority feelings and the idea that people strive for superiority or perfection to compensate for perceived inadequacies. He also emphasized social interest and the importance of community feeling.\n\nBut does Adler specifically talk about misbehavior in children having goals like attention, revenge, power, or inadequacy? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look this up to confirm.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Alfred Adler, the founder of individual psychology, did indeed write about children's misbehavior and the goals behind it. He suggested that misbehavior is often a way for children to seek attention, power, revenge, or to avoid failure due to feelings of inferiority.\n\nYes, that matches exactly with the options given in the question. So, it seems that Adler\u2019s individual psychology is the approach that aligns with this belief.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if any of the other options might also relate to this concept.\n\nBeck\u2019s CBT does address behavior, but it's more focused on cognitive processes and less on the specific goals of misbehavior in children.\n\nPerls\u2019s Gestalt therapy is more about awareness and acceptance, not specifically about the motives behind misbehavior in children.\n\nMahler\u2019s object relations theory is about the development of the self and object relations, which might touch on behavior indirectly, but it's not centered around the goals of misbehavior.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B. Adler\u2019s individual psychology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
