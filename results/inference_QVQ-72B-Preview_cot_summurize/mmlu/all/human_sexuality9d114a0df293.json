                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation,\" is a famous quote by this former Canadian Prime Minister. And the options are A. Clark, B. Mulroney, C. King, D. Trudeau.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out who said this quote. It sounds like something related to personal liberties and privacy, maybe about decriminalizing certain activities or recognizing individual rights.\n\nLet me think about the context. I recall that in Canadian history, there were significant shifts in social policies, particularly regarding personal freedoms and the role of the government in private lives.\n\nFirst, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Clark \u2013 That's Joe Clark, right? He was a Canadian Prime Minister, but I think his tenure was relatively short. I don't remember any major social policy changes associated with him.\n\nB. Mulroney \u2013 Brian Mulroney. He was known for economic reforms and free trade agreements, but I don't recall anything specific about personal liberties in the bedroom.\n\nC. King \u2013 William Lyon Mackenzie King. He was a long-serving Prime Minister, but that was back in the early 20th century. I doubt he would have made a statement like this during that time.\n\nD. Trudeau \u2013 Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Now, this rings a bell. I think he was involved in modernizing Canada's legal system and promoting individual rights. Plus, the quote sounds like something he might say, given his liberal policies.\n\nLet me double-check. I remember that Trudeau was the Prime Minister who implemented the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects personal liberties. That seems aligned with the idea of keeping the state out of people's private lives.\n\nAlso, I think there were changes under his government regarding laws on homosexuality and other personal matters. There was a famous speech where he discussed the limits of government intrusions into private lives.\n\nWait, maybe I can recall the exact context of the quote. I think it was in relation to the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada. Trudeau argued that the government shouldn't interfere in what adults do in private.\n\nLet me see if I can recall the exact words. Something like, \"There's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.\" That sounds familiar.\n\nLooking back at the options, Trudeau seems the most plausible answer. The other Prime Ministers don't have as strong an association with social liberalization or the protection of personal privacy.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any possibility it could be one of the others.\n\nJoe Clark was Prime Minister briefly in the 1970s and again in the 1980s. While he might have had progressive views, his time in office was too short for major policy changes.\n\nBrian Mulroney focused more on economic issues like free trade and deficit reduction. I don't recall any significant initiatives from his government regarding personal liberties in the bedroom.\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime Minister in a very different era, when social attitudes were conservative, and such progressive views were uncommon.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, Pierre Elliott Trudeau is the most likely answer. His liberal policies and emphasis on individual rights make him the best fit for having made such a statement.\n\nI think I can confidently choose D. Trudeau as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. Trudeau}} \\]"
