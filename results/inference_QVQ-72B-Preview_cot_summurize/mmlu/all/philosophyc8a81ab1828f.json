                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept from Hobbes. The question is saying that according to Hobbes, without a common power to keep people in awe, humans would exist in a state of:\n\nA. peace and harmony.\n\nB. mutual indifference.\n\nC. cautious mistrust.\n\nD. war of every man against every man.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what Hobbes believed about human nature and society. I remember that Thomas Hobbes was a 17th-century philosopher who wrote \"Leviathan,\" which is a pretty famous political treatise. In it, he describes the state of nature, which is the condition people would be in without any government or laws.\n\nHobbes thought that in the state of nature, life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" That sounds pretty grim. So, option A, peace and harmony, doesn't seem to align with Hobbes' view. He definitely didn't think humans naturally lived in peace and harmony without some form of authority.\n\nOption B is mutual indifference. Hmm, I don't think that's what Hobbes believed. In the state of nature, according to Hobbes, people were constantly in competition with one another for resources and power. They weren't indifferent; they were actively trying to survive and prevail over others.\n\nOption C is cautious mistrust. While that might be part of it, I think it's a bit too mild for Hobbes' description. He painted a picture where everyone is essentially at war with everyone else. So, cautious mistrust might be a aspect of that, but it doesn't capture the full intensity of the situation he described.\n\nOption D is war of every man against every man. This rings a bell. I think Hobbes used the phrase \"bellum omnium contra omnes,\" which is Latin for \"war of all against all.\" He believed that without a strong central authority to enforce laws and order, people would be in a constant state of conflict, always fearing and fighting each other for their own self-preservation.\n\nLet me double-check this. In \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, there is no authority to enforce contracts or punish wrongdoers. As a result, people live in fear of being harmed or killed by others. To avoid this, they agree to form a social contract and submit to a sovereign power that can maintain order and peace.\n\nSo, according to Hobbes, without this common power to keep them in awe\u2014meaning, to inspire fear or respect to prevent them from acting against each other\u2014they would exist in a state of perpetual war, where every man is against every man.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. war of every man against every man.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll quickly summarize why the other options are less accurate:\n\nA. peace and harmony: Hobbes believed the opposite; that without a common power, life would be chaotic and violent.\n\nB. mutual indifference: Hobbes saw people as actively competing and fearing one another, not indifferent.\n\nC. cautious mistrust: While mistrust might be present, it doesn't capture the full extent of the conflict and warfare that Hobbes described.\n\nD. war of every man against every man: This aligns perfectly with Hobbes' view of the state of nature without a central authority.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
