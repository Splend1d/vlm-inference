                    "text": "Let's tackle this optometry problem. I'm a bit rusty on some of the optics terms, but I think I can figure this out step by step. So, the question is about myopia and how corrective lenses work for someone who is nearsighted. The person has a prescription of -5 diopters, and I need to figure out what kind of image these lenses create for distant objects. The options are about the nature of the image\u2014whether it's upright or inverted, real or virtual, and how far it is from the eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what diopters measure. Diopters are a unit of measurement for the optical power of a lens. The optical power is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So, if a lens has a focal length of 1 meter, its power is 1 diopter. A negative diopter value, like -5 diopters, indicates a diverging lens, which is what's used to correct myopia.\n\nMyopia, or nearsightedness, means that the person can see nearby objects clearly but has difficulty seeing distant ones. This is because the eye is too long from front to back, causing light from distant objects to focus in front of the retina instead of on it.\n\nCorrective lenses for myopia are designed to bend the light before it enters the eye so that it focuses correctly on the retina. Since myopic eyes require diverging lenses, these lenses will make the light rays spread out before entering the eye, allowing them to focus correctly on the retina when looking at distant objects.\n\nNow, I need to think about what happens to the light rays from a distant object when they pass through a diverging lens. Distant objects are considered to be at infinity optically, meaning the rays coming from them are parallel.\n\nFor a diverging lens, the focal length is negative. Given that the prescription is -5 diopters, the focal length \\(f\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{\\text{power in diopters}} = \\frac{1}{-5} = -0.2 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nA negative focal length indicates that the focal point is on the same side as the object for a diverging lens.\n\nThe lens equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the focal length\n\n- \\(d_o\\) is the object distance\n\n- \\(d_i\\) is the image distance\n\nFor an object at infinity (\\(d_o = \\infty\\)), the term \\(\\frac{1}{d_o}\\) becomes zero, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the focal length:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{-0.2 \\text{ m}} \\implies d_i = -0.2 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nA negative image distance indicates that the image is virtual and located on the same side as the object.\n\nSo, the image formed by the corrective lens is virtual and located 0.2 meters, or 20 cm, in front of the lens.\n\nBut wait, the lens is placed in front of the eye. So, the image formed by the corrective lens serves as the object for the eye's own lens.\n\nNow, I need to consider the eye's optics. In a normal eye, when looking at distant objects, the lens is relaxed, and parallel rays are focused on the retina. However, in a myopic eye, these parallel rays focus in front of the retina.\n\nBy placing a diverging lens in front of the eye, the incoming parallel rays are spread out before entering the eye, so that when the eye's lens focuses them, they meet exactly on the retina.\n\nSo, the corrective lens forms a virtual image at 20 cm in front of the lens, and this virtual image is what the eye sees as if it were at infinity.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn optometry, when we correct myopia with lenses, the goal is to make the eye see distant objects as if they were at a distance where the eye can focus clearly. For reading or close work, we might prescribe different lenses, but for distance vision, the correction is designed to make distant objects appear clear.\n\nGiven that, the corrective lens is placed a certain distance from the eye, typically a few centimeters. The exact distance can vary, but for simplicity, let's assume it's about 2 cm from the eye.\n\nSo, if the corrective lens forms a virtual image at 20 cm in front of the lens, that would place the virtual image at 20 cm - 2 cm = 18 cm in front of the eye.\n\nBut options A and B mention about 20 cm in front of the eyes, while C and D mention 20 cm behind the eyes.\n\nI think there might be some confusion in the options regarding the position relative to the lens or the eye.\n\nLet me consider the standard correction for myopia. A -5 diopter lens would have a focal length of -0.2 meters, as calculated earlier. For an object at infinity, the image would be at -0.2 meters, meaning 0.2 meters in front of the lens.\n\nIf the lens is placed, say, 2 cm from the eye, then the virtual image is 20 cm - 2 cm = 18 cm in front of the eye.\n\nBut the options suggest about 20 cm in front of the eyes, which might be close to this calculation.\n\nNow, regarding the nature of the image: since it's a virtual image formed by a diverging lens, it should be upright and virtual.\n\nSo, among the options, A says \"an upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes,\" but that's incorrect because the image is virtual, not real.\n\nOption B says \"an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes,\" which matches my calculation and understanding.\n\nOption C says \"an inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes,\" which doesn't make sense because the image is virtual, not real, and it's in front of the lens, not behind the eyes.\n\nOption D says \"an inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes,\" which also doesn't match my understanding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the eye's accommodation. In a myopic eye, when looking at distant objects, the eye tries to focus but cannot because the focal point is already in front of the retina. By adding a diverging lens, we move the focal point back onto the retina.\n\nSo, the corrective lens creates a virtual image at a certain distance, which the eye then sees as if it were at infinity.\n\nWait, but in optometry, when we correct myopia, the goal is to make the eye see distant objects clearly without strain, meaning that the image is formed on the retina.\n\nSo, perhaps the corrective lens makes the distant object appear as if it's at a certain distance, and the eye focuses on that.\n\nI might be getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nIn optometry, the prescription in diopters corresponds to the refractive error that needs to be corrected. A -5 diopter lens is used to correct a myopia of -5 diopters.\n\nThe formula to calculate the image distance for a thin lens is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the focal length in meters\n\n- \\(d_o\\) is the object distance in meters\n\n- \\(d_i\\) is the image distance in meters\n\nGiven that the object is at infinity (\\(d_o = \\infty\\)), the term \\(\\frac{1}{d_o}\\) becomes zero, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(f = -0.2\\) meters for a -5 diopter lens, we have:\n\n\\[\nd_i = -0.2 \\text{ meters} = -20 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nA negative image distance indicates that the image is virtual and located on the same side as the object, which is in front of the lens.\n\nSo, the corrective lens forms a virtual image at 20 cm in front of the lens.\n\nNow, considering that the lens is placed a certain distance from the eye, typically a few centimeters, say 2 cm, then the virtual image is effectively at 20 cm - 2 cm = 18 cm in front of the eye.\n\nBut the options say about 20 cm in front of the eyes, which is close enough considering approximations.\n\nMoreover, since it's a virtual image formed by a diverging lens, it should be upright.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any inversion happening.\n\nIn optics, a virtual image formed by a diverging lens is always upright. So, no inversion should occur.\n\nOption C mentions an inverted, real image behind the eyes, which doesn't align with what I've learned about diverging lenses.\n\nOption D mentions an inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes. Again, that doesn't match because the image should be virtual and in front of the lens, not behind the eyes.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any possibility of the image being real or inverted due to the eye's own lens power.\n\nBut in standard corrective lens prescriptions, the idea is that the corrective lens compensates for the eye's refractive error, such that the eye sees the corrected image as if it were at infinity.\n\nSo, in that case, the image formed by the corrective lens serves as the object for the eye's lens, and since it's a virtual image, the eye's lens focuses on it as if it were at that distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should indeed be B: an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
