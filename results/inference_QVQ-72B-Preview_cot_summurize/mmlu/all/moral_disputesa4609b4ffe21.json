                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Aquinas's version of natural law theory. The question is asking which of the following is a basic intrinsic good: human life, human procreation, human sociability, or all of the above. I need to recall what Aquinas considered as basic goods in his natural law theory.\n\nFirst off, I know that Thomas Aquinas was a medieval philosopher and theologian who developed a theory of natural law that tried to identify moral principles based on human nature and reason. According to him, there are certain goods that are good in themselves and are necessary for human flourishing. These are what he called \"basic intrinsic goods.\"\n\nFrom what I remember, Aquinas believed that human life is a fundamental good because it's the foundation for all other goods. Without life, nothing else matters. So, option A, human life, seems like a strong candidate for a basic intrinsic good.\n\nNext, option B is human procreation. I recall that in Aquinas's view, procreation is important because it ensures the continuation of the human species. He saw sexuality and procreation as part of natural law, intended for the reproduction of offspring. So, procreation is another basic good in his framework.\n\nThen, option C is human sociability. Aquinas emphasized that humans are social beings by nature and that living in community is essential for our well-being. He believed that we are meant to live in society, interacting and cooperating with one another. Therefore, sociability seems to be another basic intrinsic good.\n\nGiven that all three options\u2014human life, human procreation, and human sociability\u2014are considered basic intrinsic goods by Aquinas, the answer should be D, all of the above.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check. Aquinas's natural law theory is based on the idea that certain actions are in accord with human nature and promote the common good, while others are contrary to it. The basic goods he identified are universal and necessary for human flourishing.\n\nIn summary, according to Aquinas's version of natural law theory, human life, human procreation, and human sociability are all considered basic intrinsic goods. Therefore, the correct answer is D, all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
