                    "text": "So I have this question here about attachment theory and relationships. It says that Helen is typically uncomfortable feeling close to another person or having that person feel close to her. And I need to figure out which type of lover she would be according to attachment theory. The options are:\n\nA. a secure lover\n\nB. an avoidant lover\n\nC. an anxious-ambivalent lover\n\nD. a passionate lover\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what attachment theory is and how it applies to relationships. Attachment theory, as I recall, is about how our early relationships, especially with caregivers, shape our approach to relationships in adulthood. There are different attachment styles, and each has its own characteristics.\n\nLet me think about the different attachment styles.\n\n1. Secure attachment: These are people who feel comfortable with intimacy and are able to depend on others and allow others to depend on them. They have a positive view of both themselves and others. So, they're not too worried about being abandoned or about getting too close to someone.\n\n2. Avoidant attachment: These are people who are uncomfortable with closeness and intimacy. They might prefer independence and distance in relationships. They often have a positive view of themselves but a more negative view of others, thinking that others are unreliable or unable to be trusted with their emotions.\n\n3. Anxious-ambivalent attachment: These are people who are highly concerned about relationships and seek a lot of reassurance. They might worry a lot about being abandoned and have difficulty feeling satisfied with the closeness they have. They have a negative view of themselves and a positive view of others, so they want to be close but fear that others will not reciprocate their feelings.\n\n4. Disorganized attachment: This is a bit more complex and can involve a mix of avoidant and anxious-ambivalent behaviors. People with disorganized attachment may have conflicting feelings about relationships and may behave in ways that are not consistent.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it seems like Helen is uncomfortable feeling close to another person or having that person feel close to her. That sounds a lot like someone who is avoiding closeness, which aligns with the avoidant attachment style.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Secure lover \u2013 Secure lovers are comfortable with closeness, which doesn't match Helen's discomfort with closeness.\n\nOption C: Anxious-ambivalent lover \u2013 These individuals crave closeness but are also worried about being abandoned. They might be uncomfortable with not being close, which is the opposite of Helen's discomfort with being close.\n\nOption D: Passionate lover \u2013 This isn't a standard attachment style. Passionate love is more about intense emotions and desire, which doesn't directly relate to comfort with closeness in relationships.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting description for Helen based on her discomfort with closeness is that she is an avoidant lover.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider if there's any other information that might influence this. The question specifies \"in all of her relationships,\" which suggests that this is a consistent pattern for her, not just in one particular relationship. That makes it even more likely that it's a core aspect of her attachment style.\n\nAlso, attachment theory often looks at how people manage their emotions and relationships based on their internal working models developed from early interactions with caregivers. So, if Helen has consistently felt uncomfortable with closeness, it might stem from early experiences that led her to develop an avoidant attachment style.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are subtypes within avoidant attachment. For example, some theories divide avoidant attachment into dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant types. But based on the options provided, it seems like the question is using a broader categorization.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best answer is B. an avoidant lover.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
