                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about a 95% t-confidence interval for the mean salary of employees in a county school system. The interval is given as ($15,360, $32,470), but it says that this interval isn't appropriate in this situation. I need to figure out why that is, and choose the correct reason from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what a t-confidence interval is. A t-confidence interval is used to estimate the population mean when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. It relies on the t-distribution, which is similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, especially for smaller sample sizes.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that the salary distribution is right-skewed and that there's an outlier, specifically the superintendent's salary, which is higher. So, the data aren't normally distributed; they're skewed to the right.\n\nOption A says that the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation. Hmm, the total number of employees is 4,752, and the sample size is 20. That seems like a pretty small sample relative to the population, but is that the issue here?\n\nOption B mentions that the skewed salary distribution tells us that the assumption of normality of the sampled population won't be satisfied. So, because the data are skewed, the distribution of the sample means might not be normal, especially with a small sample size like 20.\n\nOption C says that the population standard deviation is not known, which is typically the case when using a t-interval. But actually, t-intervals are used precisely when the population standard deviation is unknown, so this shouldn't be a problem; it's a standard scenario for a t-interval.\n\nOption D mentions that teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent's salary is, so the superintendent's salary should be excluded from the population sampled. I'm not sure about this one. If the superintendent is part of the school system's employees, shouldn't their salary be included? Maybe the fact that it's negotiable makes it an outlier, but that seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, the problem says that the superintendent's salary is an outlier on the higher side, so it's already considered as part of the population. But perhaps, if it's an extreme outlier, it could affect the validity of the t-interval.\n\nBut let's think about this more carefully. The t-distribution is somewhat robust to mild departures from normality, especially with larger sample sizes. However, with a small sample size like 20, and a known outlier and skewness, the normality assumption might be too strongly violated.\n\nI recall that the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach normality as the sample size increases, even if the population distribution isn't normal. But here, the sample size is only 20, which might not be large enough for the CLT to kick in fully, especially with such a skewed distribution.\n\nSo, perhaps the main issue is that the t-interval assumes that the data are normally distributed, or at least that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal, which might not hold in this case due to the skewness and the outlier.\n\nLet me consider this differently. If I were to construct a t-confidence interval, I'd need to calculate the sample mean, the sample standard deviation, and then use the t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the sample size minus one.\n\nBut with skewed data, the sample mean might not be a good estimator of the population mean, and the sample standard deviation might not accurately reflect the variability of the mean.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider using a different type of interval that's more robust to non-normality, like a bootstrap confidence interval or one based on the median.\n\nBut the problem is saying that the t-confidence interval isn't appropriate, and I need to choose the reason why.\n\nOption A suggests that the sample size is too small compared to the population. But actually, in statistics, sample size and population size are somewhat independent. Even with a huge population, a well-chosen sample of 20 can give useful information, provided that the sample is random and representative. So, I don't think this is the main issue.\n\nOption B seems more on point. The skewness of the data violates the normality assumption needed for the t-interval to be valid, especially with a small sample size.\n\nOption C is not a problem because t-intervals are designed for situations where the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nOption D seems like a red herring. The fact that the superintendent's salary is negotiable shouldn't affect the statistical analysis directly. The issue is more about the outlier and skewness in the data, not the negotiability of the salary.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is Option B: the skewed salary distribution tells us that the assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what happens when data are skewed. In such cases, the mean can be heavily influenced by extreme values, and the standard deviation might not be a reliable measure of spread. As a result, the t-distribution, which assumes normality, might not accurately model the sampling distribution of the sample mean.\n\nMoreover, with a small sample size, the t-interval relies heavily on the assumption that the data are normally distributed, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, yeah, I believe Option B is the most appropriate reason why the t-confidence interval isn't suitable in this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
