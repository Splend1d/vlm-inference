                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how many pins you need to knock down to get a strike in bowling. Let's see, I know that in bowling, there are a certain number of pins arranged in a triangle, and you throw a ball to knock them over. A strike happens when you knock down all the pins with one ball, right?\n\nFirst, I need to recall how many pins there are in total. I think it's 10 pins. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if a strike means knocking down all the pins, then it should be 10 pins.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should visualize the bowling lane. There are lanes with pins at the end, and the pins are arranged in triangles. If I remember correctly, there are 4 rows, with each row having one more pin than the previous row. So, 1 pin in the first row, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, and 4 in the fourth. Adding those up: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 pins in total.\n\nThat makes sense. So, there are 10 pins in total. Therefore, to get a strike, you need to knock down all 10 pins with one ball.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider if there are any variations or if sometimes there are different numbers of pins. Hmm, in standard ten-pin bowling, it's always 10 pins. I don't think there's a variation with a different number of pins in professional bowling leagues.\n\nMaybe in some casual or novelty bowling places, they might have different numbers of pins, but in standard bowling, it's 10 pins.\n\nSo, in standard ten-pin bowling, a strike is achieved by knocking down all 10 pins with one ball.\n\nWait a minute, is there such a thing as a spare? Yeah, a spare is when you knock down all the pins in two balls, but that's different from a strike, which is all pins in one ball.\n\nAlso, I recall that in scoring, a strike is worth more points than a spare because it's harder to achieve. So, knocking down all 10 pins in one ball is more impressive and thus scores higher.\n\nAnother thing I remember is that after a strike, the next two balls' pins are added to the strike's score, making it possible to have scores beyond just the pins knocked down.\n\nBut, to answer the question directly, in bowling, you need to knock down 10 pins to get a strike.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. zero\n\nB. 8\n\nC. 10\n\nD. 12\n\nSo, based on what I know, the correct answer should be C. 10.\n\nKnocking down zero pins would be a miss, which is not good. Knocking down 8 pins would be an open frame, which is less than a spare. A spare is all pins in two balls, which is 10 pins but spread over two balls, whereas a strike is all 10 in one ball.\n\nSo, again, confirming that a strike requires knocking down all 10 pins in one ball.\n\nI think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any trick to this question. Is there a scenario where knocking down fewer than 10 pins could be considered a strike? No, I don't think so. A strike is specifically all pins down with one ball.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some bowling games or modes, there are bonuses or something that could change the number, but in standard bowling rules, it's 10 pins.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is C. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
