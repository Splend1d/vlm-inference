There are some privileges mentioned\u2014common-law marital and spousal privileges. I need to understand what these privileges are and how divorce affects them.\n\nFirst off, I think the \"marital privilege\" refers to the privilege against spousal testimony about communications during the marriage. And the \"spousal privilege\" might be about a spouse's right to refuse to testify against the other spouse. But I'm a bit confused about the differences and how they apply here, especially since they're divorced.\n\nLet me try to break this down.\n\nI found that the marital communications privilege generally protects private communications between spouses during their marriage. This means that one spouse can't be forced to testify about what the other spouse said in private conversations during their marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the spousal testimonial privilege allows a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse in a criminal case.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the wife is being called to testify about statements the husband made to her during their marriage regarding his embezzlement. So, this is about communications between them while they were married.\n\nThe question mentions that both privileges are adopted in this jurisdiction, but they're divorced now. Does that change things?\n\nI think that the marital communications privilege generally survives divorce for communications made during the marriage. So, even after divorce, a former spouse can't be compelled to testify about private communications made during the marriage.\n\nBut the spousal testimonial privilege, which is the right of a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse, typically does not survive divorce. So, after divorce, a former spouse can be compelled to testify against the other.\n\nIn this case, the wife is being asked to testify about communications made during the marriage, not about events after the divorce.\n\nSo, under the marital communications privilege, she shouldn't have to testify about those private communications, even after divorce.\n\nBut wait, the options suggest that it might be admissible under one privilege but not the other, or admissible under both, or inadmissible under both.\n\nLet me see.\n\nOption A says admissible under both privileges.\n\nOption B says admissible under spousal privilege but not under marital privilege.\n\nOption C says admissible under marital privilege but not under spousal privilege.\n\nOption D says inadmissible under either privilege.\n\nGiven that the marital communications privilege protects against revealing communications made during the marriage, and the spousal testimonial privilege protects against testifying against the spouse in criminal cases, but both are in the context of being married.\n\nSince they're divorced, I think the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply or is waived.\n\nBut the marital communications privilege might still apply to protect those specific communications.\n\nWait, but the wife is testifying about what the husband said to her during their marriage, which is a communication.\n\nSo, under the marital communications privilege, she shouldn't have to reveal that.\n\nBut the prosecuting attorney is trying to get her to testify about it.\n\nSo, if the marital communications privilege still applies after divorce, then her testimony should be inadmissible under that privilege.\n\nBut maybe there's an exception or something else at play here.\n\nI need to think about whether the marital communications privilege survives divorce.\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, the marital communications privilege does survive divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nSo, even after divorce, a former spouse can't be compelled to reveal private communications made during the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the spousal testimonial privilege, which is the right to refuse to testify against the spouse, generally does not survive divorce.\n\nSo, in this case, since they're divorced, the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply.\n\nBut the testimony in question is about communications made during the marriage, which falls under the marital communications privilege.\n\nTherefore, the wife shouldn't have to testify about those communications, and her testimony should be inadmissible under the marital communications privilege.\n\nBut the options seem to suggest that it might be admissible under one or both privileges.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the perspective of the prosecuting attorney.\n\nThey're trying to get the wife to testify about the husband's admission of embezzlement.\n\nThe husband's attorney objects, probably invoking the marital communications privilege.\n\nBut the prosecuting attorney might argue that since they're divorced, the privilege doesn't apply.\n\nHowever, as I understood, the marital communications privilege can still apply after divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nMaybe I need to look up some case law or specific rules about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some jurisdictions, the marital communications privilege doesn't survive divorce.\n\nI need to consider that possibility.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn some legal systems, the marital communications privilege is only applicable during the marriage and doesn't survive divorce.\n\nIf that's the case here, then the privilege wouldn't apply, and the wife could be compelled to testify.\n\nBut I think in many places, especially those that have adopted the Uniform Rules of Evidence, the privilege does survive divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nFor example, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the marital communications privilege survives divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nSo, in that case, the wife wouldn't have to testify about those communications.\n\nBut if the jurisdiction has different rules, maybe the privilege doesn't survive divorce.\n\nGiven that the question says \"this jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges,\" I need to think about common-law rules.\n\nIn common-law, the marital communications privilege was generally waivable by the spouse who made the communication, and it survived divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nSimilarly, the spousal testimonial privilege allowed a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse, but this privilege typically ended with divorce.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since they're divorced, the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply.\n\nBut the marital communications privilege still protects the confidential communications made during the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the wife shouldn't have to testify about what her husband said to her during their marriage regarding the embezzlement.\n\nSo, her testimony would be inadmissible under the marital communications privilege.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.\n\nB. admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.\n\nC. admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.\n\nD. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n\nGiven my understanding, the correct answer should be D. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n\nBecause under the marital communications privilege, she can't be compelled to testify about those communications, and the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply after divorce.\n\nSo, neither privilege would allow her to be compelled to testify about the communications.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony will be...,\" and then gives options about admissibility under the privileges.\n\nSo, if the husband's attorney is objecting based on the marital communications privilege, then the testimony should be excluded because it's protected by that privilege.\n\nAlternatively, if the prosecuting attorney is arguing that the privilege doesn't apply because they're divorced, then maybe the court would rule differently.\n\nBut based on my research, it seems that in many jurisdictions, the marital communications privilege does survive divorce for communications made during the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the wife's testimony should be inadmissible under the marital communications privilege.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSuppose the marital communications privilege doesn't survive divorce in this jurisdiction.\n\nThen, the wife could be compelled to testify about the communications, and her testimony would be admissible.\n\nBut if it does survive divorce, then her testimony should be excluded.\n\nGiven that the question states that both privileges are adopted, and assuming that includes the survival of the marital communications privilege after divorce, then her testimony should be inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
