Let's see, urbanization is generally the process where more and more people move to cities, right? But 'over-urbanization' sounds like it's taking this a step further, maybe in a negative way.\n\nOption A says that life in modern Western cities is so different from that in the Third World that we find it hard to understand these societies. Hmm, that might be a consequence of urbanization, but it doesn't directly define what over-urbanization is. Maybe it's related, but I don't think it's the main idea.\n\nOption B mentions that in poorer countries, rapidly developing cities are draining resources from rural areas. This sounds plausible. Maybe over-urbanization is when cities grow too quickly, attracting people and resources from the countryside, which could lead to problems both in the cities and in the rural areas. That seems like a possible definition.\n\nOption C suggests that the extent to which urbanization affects development has been exaggerated. Well, if over-urbanization is about overemphasizing the role of cities in development, that could make sense. But I'm not sure if it's specifically about the impact on development or more about the process itself.\n\nOption D talks about governments being so focused on urbanization in the West that they neglect issues in the Third World. That seems more like a policy or attention\u5206\u914d problem rather than a direct definition of over-urbanization. It might be related, but it doesn't seem to capture the essence of the term.\n\nLet me think again. Over-urbanization likely refers to a situation where urban growth is excessive or happens too rapidly, possibly at the expense of rural areas or without adequate planning. So, option B seems to align with that idea: cities in poorer countries are growing quickly and drawing resources away from rural regions. That could lead to over-urbanization, where the growth is perhaps unsustainable or causes imbalances in the distribution of resources and population.\n\nOption A is more about the difference in lifestyles between Western cities and Third World countries, which might be a result of urbanization, but it doesn't directly address the concept of 'over-urbanization.'\n\nOption C suggests that the impact of urbanization on development is overblown, which might be a critical perspective on urbanization, but it doesn't define what over-urbanization is.\n\nOption D points to a prioritization issue in government policies, focusing too much on Western urbanization and ignoring Third World problems. Again, that seems more like a policy bias rather than a definition of over-urbanization.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I think option B is the most accurate description of over-urbanization: in poorer countries, the rapidly developing cities drain resources from the rural areas. This captures the essence of over-urbanization as an excessive or imbalanced process of urban growth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
