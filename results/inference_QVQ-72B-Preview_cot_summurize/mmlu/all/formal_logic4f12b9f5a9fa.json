                    "text": "Let's see. I have this sentence: \"If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier.\" And I need to find out which of the given formulas best symbolizes this sentence in propositional logic (PL). The options are:\n\nA. B \u2283 W\n\nB. W \u2283 B\n\nC. B \u2261 W\n\nD. Both A and B\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol means in propositional logic.\n\n- \u2283 is the material implication. So, P \u2283 Q means \"if P, then Q.\"\n\n- \u2261 is the biconditional. So, P \u2261 Q means \"P if and only if Q.\"\n\nGiven that, the sentence is \"If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier.\"\n\nLet's assign:\n\n- B to \"Beth rides her bike.\"\n\n- W to \"She gets to work earlier.\"\n\nSo, the sentence translates directly to \"If B, then W,\" which is B \u2283 W.\n\nLooking at option A, it's exactly B \u2283 W.\n\nOption B is W \u2283 B, which would mean \"If she gets to work earlier, then Beth rides her bike.\" That's the converse of the original statement, which isn't what the sentence says.\n\nOption C is B \u2261 W, which means \"Beth rides her bike if and only if she gets to work earlier.\" This suggests that both B and W are necessary and sufficient conditions for each other, which is stronger than the original statement.\n\nOption D says both A and B, which would be B \u2283 W and W \u2283 B. That would essentially be B \u2261 W, which is not the same as the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is option A: B \u2283 W.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. In logic, the implication is one-way, whereas the biconditional is two-way. So, if the sentence only asserts one direction, then option A seems correct.\n\nBut sometimes, sentences can be ambiguous, and there might be more implied than what's explicitly stated. However, based on the given sentence, it seems straightforward that riding the bike leads to getting to work earlier, but not necessarily the other way around.\n\nSo, I think option A is the correct choice.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the truth tables.\n\nFor B \u2283 W:\n\n- If B is true and W is true, then B \u2283 W is true.\n\n- If B is true and W is false, then B \u2283 W is false.\n\n- If B is false and W is true, then B \u2283 W is true.\n\n- If B is false and W is false, then B \u2283 W is true.\n\nThis matches the original statement: if she rides her bike (B), then she gets to work earlier (W). It doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't ride her bike; maybe there are other ways to get to work earlier or not.\n\nOption B: W \u2283 B\n\n- If W is true and B is true, true.\n\n- If W is true and B is false, false.\n\n- If W is false and B is true, true.\n\n- If W is false and B is false, true.\n\nThis would mean that if she gets to work earlier, then she must have ridden her bike. But the original sentence doesn't claim that; it only says that riding the bike leads to getting to work earlier, not that getting to work earlier can only be achieved by riding the bike.\n\nTherefore, option B is not correct.\n\nOption C: B \u2261 W\n\n- This means B \u2283 W and W \u2283 B.\n\nGiven that we've established that only B \u2283 W is warranted by the original statement, including W \u2283 B would be going too far. The original sentence doesn't support the converse.\n\nOption D: Both A and B\n\nThat would be B \u2283 W and W \u2283 B, which is the same as B \u2261 W. Again, this is stronger than what the original sentence asserts.\n\nHence, the correct choice is option A: B \u2283 W.\n\nI think that's solid. No need for further confusion here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
