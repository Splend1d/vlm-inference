                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. Pine Co. bought land with an existing building, demolished the building, and then built a new factory on the site. I need to figure out how much Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building. The options are A. $2,005,000, B. $1,975,000, C. $1,945,000, and D. $1,910,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what capitalizing means in this context. Capitalizing an expense means treating it as an asset rather than an expense in the income statement. So, the cost of the factory building should include all the necessary expenditures to get it ready for use.\n\nLet's list out all the costs mentioned:\n\n1. Land purchase: $450,000\n\n2. Cost of razing the old building: $60,000\n\n3. Title insurance and legal fees for land purchase: $30,000\n\n4. Architect's fees: $95,000\n\n5. New building construction cost: $1,850,000\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these costs should be included in the cost of the completed factory building.\n\nStarting with the land purchase: $450,000. Since the land is being used as the site for the factory building, it's directly related to the project. However, sometimes, when land is purchased for a building, the cost of the land is capitalized as part of the building cost, but I think it's more accurate to capitalize the land cost separately from the building cost unless specified otherwise. Maybe I need to allocate the land cost based on the area used, but since it's the entire site, perhaps the entire land cost is relevant.\n\nNext, the cost of razing the old building: $60,000. This is directly related to preparing the site for the new building. In accounting, costs incurred to prepare the site for the asset are typically capitalized as part of the asset's cost.\n\nTitle insurance and legal fees for purchasing the land: $30,000. These are costs associated with acquiring the land. Generally, these costs are capitalized as part of the land's cost, not the building's cost. So, maybe this shouldn't be included in the building's cost directly.\n\nArchitect's fees: $95,000. These are directly related to the design and planning of the new building. This should definitely be capitalized as part of the building's cost.\n\nNew building construction cost: $1,850,000. This is the primary cost of constructing the building and should be included in the building's cost.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these costs should be included in the building's cost.\n\n- Land purchase: $450,000 \u2013 probably separate from the building cost.\n\n- Cost of razing: $60,000 \u2013 should be capitalized as part of the building cost.\n\n- Title insurance and legal fees: $30,000 \u2013 likely part of land acquisition costs, separate from the building.\n\n- Architect's fees: $95,000 \u2013 should be capitalized as part of the building cost.\n\n- New building construction cost: $1,850,000 \u2013 definitely part of the building cost.\n\nSo, adding up the costs that should be capitalized as part of the building:\n\n- Razing cost: $60,000\n\n- Architect's fees: $95,000\n\n- Construction cost: $1,850,000\n\nTotal building cost = $60,000 + $95,000 + $1,850,000 = $2,005,000\n\nWait a minute, that matches option A. But let's double-check if the land cost should be included.\n\nIs the land cost part of the building cost? Generally, land and building are accounted for separately on the balance sheet. Land is considered a separate asset from the building. So, the land cost should not be included in the building's cost.\n\nBut sometimes, especially if the land is specifically for that building and no other use, companies might capitalize the land cost into the building. However, in standard accounting practice, land and building are kept separate.\n\nGiven that, I think the land cost should not be included in the building's cost. Therefore, the total cost to capitalize for the building is $2,005,000.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, companies might allocate the land cost based on the area used by the building. But in this problem, the entire land is being used as the factory site, so perhaps the entire land cost is relevant. However, generally, the land cost is still treated separately from the building cost.\n\nAnother consideration: when an existing building is razed, the cost to raze it is typically capitalized as part of the new building's cost because it's necessary to prepare the site for the new asset.\n\nAlso, architect's fees are clearly related to the building's design and planning, so they should be capitalized as part of the building's cost.\n\nTitle insurance and legal fees for purchasing the land are generally considered land acquisition costs and should be capitalized as part of the land's cost, not the building's cost.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation seems correct: $60,000 (razing) + $95,000 (architect's fees) + $1,850,000 (construction cost) = $2,005,000.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different approach. Perhaps the land cost should be included somehow.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the total project cost includes the land cost, and then I need to allocate it between land and building.\n\nBut no, the question is specifically asking for the cost of the completed factory building, not the total project cost.\n\nSo, according to standard accounting principles, the building's cost should include only the costs directly attributable to the building itself, which are the razing cost, architect's fees, and construction cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $2,005,000, which is option A.\n\nBut let's check again. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any other cost that should be included? For example, interest during construction or other indirect costs? No, the problem doesn't mention any other costs.\n\nAlso, sometimes, companies might include the land cost if the land is integral to the building's use, but as I said earlier, generally, land and building are kept separate.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the razing cost should be deducted from the land cost, but that doesn't make sense because razing is a necessary cost to prepare the site for the new building.\n\nNo, razing costs are capitalized as part of the new building's cost.\n\nSo, sticking to my initial calculation, the answer should be $2,005,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the costs.\n\nWait, maybe someone might think that the land cost should be included, so they add the land purchase price minus the razing cost, plus the other expenses.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the razing cost is directly related to preparing the site for the new building, not to the land itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they think that the land cost should be netted against the razing cost, but that also doesn't make much sense.\n\nNo, I think the correct approach is to capitalize the razing cost, architect's fees, and construction cost into the building's cost, totaling $2,005,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $2,005,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
