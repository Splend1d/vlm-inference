                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the mean of 7 numbers is 15. Then, when an 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. I need to find out what that 8th number is. The options are \u201312, \u20139, 0, and 8.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a mean is. The mean is just the average of the numbers, right? So, if the mean of 7 numbers is 15, that means that the total sum of these 7 numbers is 7 multiplied by 15. Let me calculate that. 7 times 15 is 105. So, the sum of the first 7 numbers is 105.\n\nNow, when an 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. That means the new mean, with 8 numbers, is 12. So, the total sum of these 8 numbers should be 8 multiplied by 12. Let's calculate that. 8 times 12 is 96.\n\nSo, the sum of the 8 numbers is 96. But I already know that the sum of the first 7 numbers is 105. So, the 8th number must be the difference between these sums. That is, 96 minus 105.\n\nLet me do that subtraction: 96 minus 105 is \u20139.\n\nSo, the 8th number is \u20139.\n\nWait a minute, is that possible? Can a number be negative? Well, mathematically, yes, means can include negative numbers, especially if you're dealing with signed numbers. So, \u20139 seems to be a valid answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote the 8th number as x. Then, the sum of the first 7 numbers is 7 times 15, which is 105, as I said before.\n\nWhen x is added, the sum becomes 105 plus x, and the number of numbers is now 8. The new mean is 12, so:\n\n(105 + x) / 8 = 12\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 8:\n\n105 + x = 96\n\nThen, subtract 105 from both sides:\n\nx = 96 - 105\n\nx = \u20139\n\nSo, again, I get x = \u20139.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the change in the mean and see how it affects the sum.\n\nThe mean decreased by 3 points when the 8th number was added. So, the mean went from 15 to 12, which is a decrease of 3.\n\nNow, with 8 numbers, the new mean is 12, so the total sum is 96, as before.\n\nThe sum of the first 7 numbers was 105, so the 8th number must be 96 minus 105, which is again \u20139.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the 8th number is x. The new mean is 12, so:\n\n(105 + x)/8 = 12\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n105 + x = 96\n\nThen, x = 96 - 105 = \u20139\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the total change in the sum.\n\nThe sum decreased from 105 to 96, which is a decrease of 9. So, the 8th number must be 9 less than the previous mean of 15, because adding a lower number decreases the mean.\n\nSo, x = 15 - 9 = 6, but that's not matching my earlier result of \u20139.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If I add 6 to 105, I get 111, and then the mean would be 111/8 = 13.875, which is not 12. So, that can't be correct.\n\nOh, I see my mistake. I was thinking incorrectly about the change.\n\nActually, adding a number lower than the current mean would decrease the mean, but the exact calculation needs to account for the total sum and the number of items.\n\nSo, going back to the correct calculation, x = \u20139.\n\nLooking back at the options, \u20139 is one of the choices, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's plug in x = \u20139 and see if it works.\n\nSum of first 7 numbers: 105\n\nAdd x = \u20139: new sum is 105 + (\u20139) = 96\n\nNumber of numbers is now 8.\n\nMean is 96 / 8 = 12, which matches the given new mean.\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I try x = \u201312, which is another option.\n\nSum would be 105 + (\u201312) = 93\n\nMean would be 93 / 8 = 11.625, which is not 12.\n\nNext, x = 0.\n\nSum would be 105 + 0 = 105\n\nMean would be 105 / 8 = 13.125, not 12.\n\nLastly, x = 8.\n\nSum would be 105 + 8 = 113\n\nMean would be 113 / 8 = 14.125, not 12.\n\nSo, indeed, only x = \u20139 gives the correct new mean of 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u20139.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u201312\n\nB. \u20139\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 8\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. \u20139.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-9} \\]"
