                    "text": "So I have this economics problem here. It says that the real GDP is $200 billion and the price index is 200. I need to find the nominal GDP from these pieces of information. The options are $4 billion, $400 billion, $200 billion, and $2 billion.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what real GDP and nominal GDP are. Real GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, adjusted for price changes. It's measured in constant prices, meaning it's based on the prices from a specific base year. Nominal GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, valued at current market prices. So, nominal GDP doesn't adjust for inflation or deflation.\n\nThe price index is a measure that compares the price of a basket of goods and services in a particular year to the price of the same basket in a base year. If the price index is 200, that means prices have doubled compared to the base year because 200 is twice 100.\n\nSo, the relationship between real GDP and nominal GDP can be expressed using the price index. The formula to convert real GDP to nominal GDP is:\n\nNominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 Price Index / Base Price Index\n\nWhere the base price index is usually 100.\n\nGiven that, if real GDP is $200 billion and the price index is 200, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nBut wait, I need to know what the base price index is. If the base price index is 100, then the formula simplifies to:\n\nNominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (Price Index / 100)\n\nSo, Nominal GDP = $200 billion \u00d7 (200 / 100) = $200 billion \u00d7 2 = $400 billion.\n\nLooking back at the options, $400 billion is one of them. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the real GDP is in constant dollars, based on the base year prices. If the price index has doubled (from 100 to 200), that means prices have increased by a factor of 2. Therefore, to find the nominal GDP, I need to adjust the real GDP by this price factor.\n\nSo, Nominal GDP = Real GDP \u00d7 (Price Index / Base Price Index)\n\nWhich is again, $200 billion \u00d7 (200 / 100) = $400 billion.\n\nThat seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula:\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP / (Price Index / 100)\n\nRearranged from the first formula. Plugging in the values:\n\n$200 billion = Nominal GDP / (200 / 100)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$200 billion = Nominal GDP / 2\n\nTherefore, Nominal GDP = $200 billion \u00d7 2 = $400 billion.\n\nThis confirms the previous result.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, if the price index is 200, does that directly correspond to the multiplier? Yes, because the price index of 200 means prices are twice as high as the base year.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose the base year is year 0 with a price index of 100. In that year, real GDP is $200 billion. Now, in another year, the price index is 200, meaning prices have doubled. So, if real GDP remains the same, nominal GDP should also double from the base year's nominal GDP.\n\nBut in this problem, real GDP is given as $200 billion, which I assume is in constant dollars (base year dollars). So, nominal GDP should be real GDP multiplied by the price index relative to the base year.\n\nAgain, that leads me to the same conclusion: Nominal GDP = $200 billion \u00d7 (200 / 100) = $400 billion.\n\nLet me check the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A is $4 billion. That seems way too low compared to the real GDP of $200 billion. It doesn't make sense because even if I were deflating the real GDP, I wouldn't get a number that small.\n\nOption B is $400 billion, which matches my calculation.\n\nOption C is $200 billion, which is the real GDP. If real GDP equals nominal GDP, that would imply that the price index is 100, which it's not.\n\nOption D is $2 billion, which is also way too low.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be $400 billion.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the relationship between real GDP, nominal GDP, and the price level again.\n\nReal GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for inflation, using the price index. So, Real GDP = Nominal GDP / (Price Index / 100)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n$200 billion = Nominal GDP / (200 / 100)\n\n$200 billion = Nominal GDP / 2\n\nTherefore, Nominal GDP = $200 billion \u00d7 2 = $400 billion.\n\nThis consistent calculation reinforces that the correct answer is $400 billion.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is $400 billion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$400 \\text{ billion}} \\]"
