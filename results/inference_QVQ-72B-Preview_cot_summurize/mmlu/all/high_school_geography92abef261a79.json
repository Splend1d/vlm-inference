                    "text": "So I have this question here about world cities, and I need to figure out which option is not a characteristic of them. Let me see, I've heard of world cities before, but I'm not entirely sure about all their features. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that world cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations. That sounds plausible. I mean, places like New York, London, and Tokyo are known for having lots of corporate headquarters based there. These are all big global cities, so I think this is a valid characteristic.\n\nOption B says that world cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities. This also makes sense. World cities are usually connected through various networks, like financial markets, cultural exchanges, and transportation links. So, they should be well-connected to smaller but still significant cities around the globe.\n\nOption C states that world cities contain many offices of multinational organizations. Again, this seems right. Multinational organizations often set up offices in major world cities to take advantage of their global reach and influence.\n\nNow, Option D says that world cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres. Hmm, I'm a bit suspicious about this one. I know that traditional world cities like London, New York, and Paris are in the Northern Hemisphere, but what about cities like Sydney or Tokyo? Sydney is in the Southern Hemisphere, isn't it? And Tokyo is in the Eastern Hemisphere. Wait, hemispheres are based on geographical coordinates: the Northern and Southern Hemispheres split by the equator, and the Eastern and Western Hemispheres split by the prime meridian.\n\nBut the option specifically says \"northern and western hemispheres.\" So, it's claiming that world cities are only in the Northern and Western Hemispheres. But I know that there are prominent world cities in other hemispheres. For example, Sydney is in the Southern Hemisphere, and so is S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, which is also considered a world city.\n\nMoreover, Tokyo is in the Eastern Hemisphere, although it's in the Northern Hemisphere. But the option says \"northern and western hemispheres,\" which would exclude Tokyo since it's in the Eastern Hemisphere, even though it's a major world city.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Option D is not accurate. World cities are not only found in the Northern and Western Hemispheres; they are also in the Southern and Eastern Hemispheres.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider some more examples. Beijing is a world city, right? It's in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere. Mumbai is another world city, which is also in the Eastern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere. But again, Sydney and S\u00e3o Paulo are in different hemispheres, so the statement in Option D is too restrictive.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that D is the incorrect option. World cities are not limited to the northern and western hemispheres.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
