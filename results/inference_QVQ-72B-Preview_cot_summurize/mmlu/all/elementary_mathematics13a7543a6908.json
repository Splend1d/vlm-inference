                    "text": "So I have this problem here: -40 divided by -8. I need to find the quotient. The options are A. 1 over 5, B. -5, C. -1 over 5, and D. 5.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the rules for dividing negative numbers. I know that when I divide two negative numbers, the result should be positive because the negatives cancel each other out. So, -40 divided by -8 should be positive.\n\nLet me think about the absolute values first. The absolute value of -40 is 40, and the absolute value of -8 is 8. So, 40 divided by 8 is 5. Since both numbers are negative, the result should be positive 5.\n\nWait, but there's an option A which is 1 over 5. That doesn't seem right because 40 divided by 8 is definitely 5, not a fraction less than one.\n\nOption B is -5, but that would be if one of the numbers was positive and one was negative, which isn't the case here. Both are negative, so the result should be positive.\n\nOption C is -1 over 5. That seems way too small; 40 divided by 8 isn't going to be a small fraction.\n\nOption D is 5, which seems correct based on my earlier thinking.\n\nLet me double-check. I know that dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result. For example, -10 divided by -2 is 5. Similarly, -40 divided by -8 should be 5.\n\nI can also think about multiplication. What number times -8 gives -40? Well, -5 times -8 is 40, but that doesn't directly help because we're dealing with division. Wait, actually, if I think about it, -5 times -8 is 40, which is not equal to -40. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, if I consider that dividing by a negative is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, which is also negative. So, -40 divided by -8 is the same as -40 times -1/8, which is 40 times 1/8, which is 5.\n\nThat seems consistent. So, option D. 5 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Is there a possibility of a different answer depending on the context? Well, in mathematics, the division of two negative numbers should indeed result in a positive number, so I don't think there's another interpretation here.\n\nAlso, considering the properties of integers, division is straightforward here since both operands are integers, and there are no zeros or undefined scenarios.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
