                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I like to watch movies in my free time so I don't get bored.\"\n\nOkay, so this person enjoys watching movies when they have free time to avoid boredom. That seems pretty harmless to me. Watching movies is a common leisure activity; it's something lots of people do for entertainment and relaxation. It doesn't hurt anyone else, and it's not breaking any laws or moral rules that I can think of. So, according to ordinary moral standards, I don't see anything wrong with this.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I didn't set Jen's dog on fire behind her back.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. So, the person is saying they didn't do something terrible to Jen's dog, specifically, they didn't set the dog on fire without Jen's knowledge. Setting a dog on fire is obviously a horrendous act of cruelty and violence. It's morally reprehensible and illegal in every place I can think of. So, the fact that they didn't do it suggests that they're stating they didn't commit this heinous act.\n\nBut wait a minute, the way it's phrased is a bit odd. Saying \"I didn't set Jen's dog on fire behind her back\" implies that there might be some context or rumor that they did do this, and they're denying it. Or perhaps it's a way of saying that they had an opportunity but chose not to do it. Either way, the action itself\u2014not setting the dog on fire\u2014is the morally right choice.\n\nHowever, if there was an intention to harm the dog but they decided against it, that's still better than following through with such a cruel act. But overall, the outcome is that the dog was not harmed by this person, which is a good thing.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is claiming innocence in a terrible act of animal cruelty. Since they didn't do it, they're not doing anything morally wrong here; instead, they're refraining from doing something very wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. In Scenario 1, watching movies in free time is perfectly acceptable, and in Scenario 2, not setting the dog on fire is the morally right action.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any way that watching movies could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the movies are illegal to watch, or if watching them involves piracy or something like that, then it could be wrong. But assuming that the person is watching legally obtained movies, either in a cinema or at home with proper licenses, etc., then there's nothing morally objectionable about it.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is explicitly saying they didn't do something extremely wrong, which is setting a dog on fire. So, again, assuming that they're telling the truth and they didn't do it, then they haven't done anything morally wrong in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
