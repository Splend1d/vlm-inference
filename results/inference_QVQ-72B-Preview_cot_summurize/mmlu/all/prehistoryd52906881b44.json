                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which continent features the earliest evidence of etching into a rock face?\" And the options are Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out where the oldest rock engravings or petroglyphs have been found.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what \"etching into a rock face\" means. It's basically carving or engraving images or symbols onto rocks, right? These are often called petroglyphs. So, I need to find out where the oldest petroglyphs have been discovered.\n\nI remember that different continents have rich histories of rock art, but I'm not sure which one goes back the farthest in time. Maybe I should look into some specific examples or do a bit of research to answer this correctly.\n\nLet me think about Europe first. There are famous cave paintings in places like Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, which are incredibly old, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, like 15,000 to 40,000 years ago. But are these paintings or actual etchings into the rock? I think some of them are paintings, while others might be engravings. Maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nNext, Africa. I know that North Africa has the Tassili n'Ajjer plates in Algeria, which have rock art that includes both paintings and engravings. These are thought to be from the Neolithic period, which is around 10,000 to 4,000 years ago. That seems pretty old, but maybe not as old as some of the European examples.\n\nThen there's Asia. In India, there are rock shelters like Bhimbetka, which have rock paintings that are also from the Upper Paleolithic period, similar in age to the European cave paintings. Again, these are paintings, but what about engravings in Asia?\n\nAustralia is another option. The Aboriginal people of Australia have a long history of rock art, including paintings and engravings. Some of these artworks in places like Kakadu National Park are tens of thousands of years old. In fact, some scientists believe that the Aboriginal rock art in Australia could be the oldest in the world, possibly dating back 40,000 years or more.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that these are etchings or engravings, not just paintings. From what I recall, Aboriginal rock art includes both paintings and engravings, so it's possible that engravings exist there.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any specific findings or discoveries that pinpoint the oldest etchings or petroglyphs in the world.\n\nI think there was a discovery in Borneo, which is in Southeast Asia, of rock art that includes both paintings and engravings. Some of these engravings were dated to be around 50,000 years old, which would make them older than many European cave paintings.\n\nBut now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to organize this information better.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the general timeline of rock art across these continents.\n\nIn Europe, cave paintings and engravings date back to the Upper Paleolithic, which is from about 40,000 to 12,000 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, the oldest rock art is also from the Upper Paleolithic, with some engravings and paintings estimated to be around 28,000 years old.\n\nIn Asia, including India and Southeast Asia, there are numerous rock art sites with paintings and engravings dating back to the Upper Paleolithic as well.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal rock art includes both paintings and engravings that may date back over 40,000 years.\n\nSo, all of these continents have very ancient rock art, but the question is specifically about etchings into rock faces, which are petroglyphs.\n\nI need to find out which of these continents has the earliest known petroglyphs.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific examples.\n\nFor instance, in Europe, there are petroglyph sites like the C\u00f4a Valley in Portugal, which have engravings of horses and other animals dating back to the Mesolithic period, around 10,000 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, the Tassili n'Ajjer plates in Algeria have petroglyphs depicting cattle and other animals, which are from the Neolithic period, again around 10,000 to 4,000 years ago.\n\nIn Asia, there are numerous petroglyph sites, such as the Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape in Azerbaijan, which has engravings dating back to 5,000 to 40,000 years ago.\n\nIn Australia, sites like Nawarla Gabarnmang in the Northern Territory have petroglyphs that are claimed to be the oldest in the world, with some estimates placing them at around 28,000 years old.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought some Australian rock art might be 40,000 years old. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nLet me check my notes again.\n\nOh, I see. It seems that in Australia, there are both paintings and engravings, and some engravings might be up to 40,000 years old, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact dating.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the oldest known petroglyphs are from Australia.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me think of another angle. Maybe I should look at the general consensus in the field of archaeology regarding the oldest petroglyphs.\n\nI recall that in 2018, there was a discovery in Java, Indonesia, of stone slabs with engravings of game pieces, which were dated to around 43,000 years ago. This would make them the oldest known engravings on stone.\n\nIf that's the case, then Asia would have the earliest known petroglyphs.\n\nBut wait, Indonesia is part of Asia, so Asia would be the continent with the oldest known petroglyphs.\n\nHowever, I also recall that in Australia, there are petroglyphs that are claimed to be older, but perhaps their exact ages are still under debate or not as widely accepted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Java engravings are indeed the oldest known petroglyphs.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any older petroglyphs elsewhere.\n\nIn Europe, the earliest petroglyphs seem to date back to around 10,000 years ago, which is more recent than the Java engravings.\n\nIn Africa, the petroglyphs in the Sahara Desert, such as those in Tassili n'Ajjer, are from the Neolithic period, which is again around 10,000 to 4,000 years ago.\n\nSo, if Java has petroglyphs from 43,000 years ago, that would make Asia the continent with the earliest known etchings into rock faces.\n\nBut what about Australia? Are there any petroglyphs that are older than that?\n\nI think there are claims of petroglyphs in Australia that might be older, but I don't have specific dates in mind.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any petroglyphs in Australia that have been definitively dated to be older than 43,000 years.\n\nAfter a quick search in my memory, I can't think of any specific examples that surpass the Java engravings in age.\n\nTherefore, based on the information I have, Asia seems to hold the record for the earliest known petroglyphs, dating back to 43,000 years ago in Java, Indonesia.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Asia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Asia}} \\]"
