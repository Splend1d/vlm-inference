                    "text": "So I've got this question about voting populations, and I need to figure out which statement is the most accurate. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that individuals are less likely to vote in a closely contested race. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. I thought that when a race is close, it might motivate more people to vote because their vote could make a difference. But maybe people feel like their vote doesn't matter if the race is too close to call. I need to think about this more.\n\nOption B suggests that voters are more likely to vote at age 18 than at age 65. I know that younger people generally have lower voter turnout rates. In fact, in many countries, including the U.S., voter participation increases with age. So, this statement seems incorrect because typically, older adults, like those in their 60s and above, have higher voter turnout rates than younger adults.\n\nOption C states that an individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than someone who only has a high school diploma. This seems plausible. Education is often correlated with higher voter turnout. People with higher levels of education tend to be more engaged in civic activities, including voting. So, this could be a strong candidate for the most accurate statement.\n\nOption D claims that affluent individuals are less likely to vote than impoverished individuals. This contradicts what I know about voter turnout. Generally, higher-income individuals are more likely to vote than those with lower incomes. There might be exceptions, but in many societies, voter participation increases with income level.\n\nAfter considering all these points, it seems that option C is the most accurate statement. Education level is positively correlated with voter turnout, so someone with a graduate degree is indeed more likely to vote than someone who only has a high school diploma.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. In option A, is it true that people are less likely to vote in closely contested races? Actually, I think the opposite might be true. When a race is close, it can mobilize more voters because each vote seems more impactful. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B definitely contradicts what I know about age and voting patterns. Voter turnout is generally higher among older age groups, so claiming that 18-year-olds are more likely to vote than 65-year-olds is false.\n\nOption D also goes against common observations. Affluent individuals typically have higher voter turnout rates than impoverished individuals. So, that leaves option C as the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll recall some statistics. For example, in the United States, during presidential elections, voter turnout rates increase with education level. Similarly, in many other countries, higher education is associated with higher voter participation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement among the options provided is option C: an individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
