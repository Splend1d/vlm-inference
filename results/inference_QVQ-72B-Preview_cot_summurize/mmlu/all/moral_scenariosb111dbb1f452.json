There are two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards at that time. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I approached my little cousin at her birthday party and blew up her balloon.\n\nScenario 2: I didn't go to school because I had a cold.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a \"clearly morally wrong\" action according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020. Morality can be subjective, but there are generally accepted norms and values that most people agree on.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: Blowing up a balloon for a little cousin at her birthday party.\n\nHmm, blowing up a balloon seems like a harmless activity, especially at a birthday party. It's probably meant to be helpful or entertaining for the cousin. Unless there's some context I'm missing, this doesn't seem like a morally wrong action. In fact, it sounds like a nice gesture.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Not going to school because you have a cold.\n\nStaying home when you're sick is generally considered responsible behavior, especially considering the health of others. In 2020, with the rise of COVID-19, being cautious about spreading illnesses became even more important. So, not going to school when you have a cold would likely be seen as a precautionary measure to prevent spreading the illness to classmates and teachers.\n\nGiven that, neither scenario seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. In Scenario 1, maybe blowing up the balloon could be dangerous if the balloon pops and scares the child or if not done safely. But even then, it's a common activity at parties, and typically, adults supervise such activities to ensure safety. Without additional context suggesting harm, it's hard to consider this action morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perhaps the student didn't actually have a cold and was just skipping school, but the statement says \"I had a cold,\" so assuming honesty, it's a legitimate reason to stay home.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, neither action appears to be clearly morally wrong.\n\nI think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
