Hmm, I need to think about this. I'm not super strong in history, but I do remember learning something about Israel's independence.\n\nLet me see. I think Israel became an independent state in the mid-20th century. Was it before or after World War II? I think it was after World War II. Maybe in the 1940s? Let me try to recall the exact year.\n\nI think the year is 1948. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, if that's the case, then it would be in the 1940s. But just to make sure, let me consider if there was any other significant event that might have led to its independence in another decade.\n\nWait, I remember something about the Balfour Declaration. That was in 1917, which is the 1910s, so that's not relevant here. And then there was the Mandate for Palestine, which was given to Britain by the League of Nations in the 1920s, I think. But that was before Israel's independence.\n\nLet me think about the United Nations. Did the UN have a role in Israel's independence? I think there was a UN partition plan in 1947 that recommended dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. That was in the 1940s, which aligns with my earlier thought.\n\nAlso, I recall that many Jewish people migrated to Palestine after World War II, seeking a homeland, especially after the horrors of the Holocaust. So, the push for an independent Jewish state was strong during that time.\n\nLet me consider if there were any wars or conflicts around that time that might have influenced the establishment of Israel. I think there was the Arab-Israeli War in 1948, right after Israel declared its independence. So, that must have been in the same year, 1948.\n\nWait, but was that the first Arab-Israeli War? Yes, I think so. It was fought between Israel and its Arab neighbors from May to July 1948. So, that reinforces the idea that Israel became independent in 1948.\n\nJust to double-check, I can try to recall if there were any other movements or events in the following decades that might have affected Israel's independence. For example, in the 1950s, there was the Suez Crisis in 1956, but that was after Israel was already established.\n\nIn the 1960s, there was the Six-Day War in 1967, but again, that was after Israel had been independent for nearly two decades. So, those events don't change the fact that Israel became independent in the 1940s.\n\nLet me also consider the role of key figures in Israel's independence. David Ben-Gurion, he was a prominent leader, and I think he declared the establishment of the State of Israel. I believe that happened on May 14, 1948. Yeah, that rings a bell.\n\nSo, putting all this together, it seems pretty clear that Israel became an independent state in 1948, which is in the 1940s. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 1940s.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. 1920s: This was when the British Mandate for Palestine was established, but that was before Israel's independence.\n\nC. 1950s: This decade saw consolidations and conflicts but not the initial declaration of independence.\n\nD. 1960s: This was when Israel was already an established state, and further territorial changes occurred through wars like the Six-Day War.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is B. 1940s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
