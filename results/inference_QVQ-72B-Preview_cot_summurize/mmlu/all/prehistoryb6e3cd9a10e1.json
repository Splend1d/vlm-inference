                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is an example of parietal art? A. beadwork, B. inscribed bone, C. ivory statues, D. cave paintings.\" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what parietal art refers to. I think it has something to do with prehistoric art, maybe from the Paleolithic era. Let me see if I can recall or find out what parietal art is exactly.\n\nFirst off, I know that parietal comes from the Latin word \"paries,\" which means wall. So, parietal art might be art that's created on walls, like murals or paintings on cave walls. That makes me think of those famous cave paintings in Lascaux, France, or Altamira in Spain. Those are prehistoric depictions of animals and abstract forms, right?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. beadwork \u2013 That sounds more like portable art or jewelry. Beads are usually small, decorative objects strung together, which doesn't seem to fit the idea of wall art.\n\nB. inscribed bone \u2013 This also seems portable. People have found bones with markings or carvings on them from ancient times, but again, that's more of an object art rather than something created on a wall.\n\nC. ivory statues \u2013 Statues are three-dimensional objects, and while they can be placed against walls, they're not inherently part of the wall itself. So, probably not considered parietal art.\n\nD. cave paintings \u2013 This seems the most straightforward choice. Cave paintings are directly created on the walls of caves, which aligns perfectly with the concept of parietal art being art on walls.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Could parietal art include other forms besides paintings? For example, engravings or carvings on cave walls? I think those could also be considered parietal art since they're part of the wall surface.\n\nBut looking back at the options, cave paintings are specifically mentioned, which covers the paintings aspect. However, to be thorough, I should consider if parietal art encompasses only paintings or if it includes other forms of wall art.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a technical definition for parietal art. From what I remember, parietal art refers to artistic expressions created on the walls of caves or other vertical surfaces, typically associated with prehistoric times. So, this would include both paintings and engravings, but in this question, only cave paintings are listed as an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe parietal art can also include sculptures or reliefs on walls, but again, in the given options, only cave paintings are directly related to wall art.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is D. cave paintings.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly be considered parietal art.\n\nA. beadwork \u2013 This is more likely to be mobile art, something people could carry with them, not fixed on walls.\n\nB. inscribed bone \u2013 Similarly, bones with inscriptions or carvings are portable objects, not wall art.\n\nC. ivory statues \u2013 Statues are free-standing objects, not part of a wall structure.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the definition of parietal art is D. cave paintings.\n\nI think I've got it right. If I had to choose one, I'd definitely go with D. cave paintings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
