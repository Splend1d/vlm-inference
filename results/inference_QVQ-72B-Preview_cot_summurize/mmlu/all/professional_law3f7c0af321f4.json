                    "text": "So I've got this property law scenario here, and I need to figure out which statement is most accurate regarding the outcome of this lawsuit between the retiree's heirs and his friend over a vacant lot. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a retiree who owns a single-family home in the city, and next to his home is a vacant lot that measures 100 feet by 175 feet. This lot is on the corner of Davis Street and University Way, with 100 feet along Davis Street and 175 feet along University Way. So, the lot is rectangular, with one side on Davis Street and the adjacent side on University Way.\n\nThe retiree deeds this lot to his lifelong friend for $28,000, and the friend records the deed with the county recorder's office. Then, three months after the conveyance, the retiree dies without a will (intestate), and his heirs are now contesting the friend's title to the lot.\n\nThe question is asking which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the outcome of this suit. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions. Hmm, metes and bounds is a system of describing property boundaries using directions and distances from a starting point, often used when there are no streets or when streets aren't reliable indicators of property lines. In this case, the deed describes the property as starting at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way, then going west along Davis Street 100 feet, north 175 feet, west 100 feet, and south 175 feet back to the starting point. This sounds like a metes and bounds description, but it also references streets. So, if the streets are part of the recorded plat, using them in the description might be acceptable. But the option suggests that metes and bounds, not streets, should be used. I need to think about whether referencing streets in a metes and bounds description is problematic.\n\nOption B says that the friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality. This seems to suggest that even if there's some minor error in the deed description, the court will not allow the heirs to take the property back based on that error. Equity generally favors fairness and\u5b9e\u8d28\u5185\u5bb9 over form, so if the description is close enough and the intent is clear, the court might uphold the conveyance. But I need to see if there's a significant discrepancy or just a technicality.\n\nOption C says that the outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision. Subdivisions are typically recorded with official plats showing the exact boundaries of each lot. If the lot was part of a recorded subdivision plan, then the description in the deed might be compared to the plat to determine the exact boundaries. If the deed description matches the plat, that would strengthen the friend's claim. If not, it could be a issue. So, this could be a relevant factor.\n\nOption D says that the outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet). This refers to the order of calls in the metes and bounds description. In metes and bounds descriptions, there can be ambiguity if the calls don't match up perfectly to form a closed polygon. Sometimes, the last call is adjusted to close the tract. But in this case, the description seems straightforward: starting at the northwest corner of Davis and University, go west 100 feet, north 175 feet, west 100 feet, and south 175 feet back to the starting point. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me read it again: \"beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning.\"\n\nSo, starting at the northwest corner (which is the intersection of Davis and University), go west along Davis Street 100 feet, then north 175 feet, then west 100 feet, then south 175 feet along University Way back to the starting point. But wait, if you go west along Davis Street 100 feet from the northwest corner, then north 175 feet, then west another 100 feet, and then south 175 feet along University Way, does that bring you back to the starting point? It seems like it might, but I need to visualize this.\n\nLet me sketch this out. Suppose Davis Street runs east-west, and University Way runs north-south. The northwest corner is where they intersect. So, starting at that point, going west along Davis Street 100 feet would take you further west on Davis Street. Then, turning north 175 feet would take you up 175 feet, then west another 100 feet, and finally south 175 feet along University Way back to the starting point. It seems like it should close, but I need to make sure.\n\nWait a minute, if you go west 100 feet from the northwest corner along Davis Street, then north 175 feet, then west another 100 feet, and then south 175 feet along University Way, does that bring you back to the northwest corner? Actually, no, because after going north 175 feet and then west 100 feet, you'd be 100 feet west and 175 feet north of the northwest corner. Then, going south 175 feet along University Way should bring you back to the northwest corner, assuming University Way runs north-south. So, maybe the description does close properly.\n\nBut perhaps there's some ambiguity or error in the description that could be causing an issue. Maybe the streets aren't perfectly aligned with the metes and bounds description, or perhaps there's a mistake in the directions or distances.\n\nNow, considering all this, I need to think about why the heirs are contesting the friend's title. Is it because they believe the deed description is incorrect, or perhaps that the friend didn't actually pay the $28,000 consideration, or is there some other issue with the conveyance?\n\nThe problem states that the heirs are contesting the friend's title, but doesn't specify the exact grounds. However, since the focus is on the property description in the deed, it's likely that the description is being challenged in some way.\n\nLet me consider possible issues with the deed description:\n\n1. Ambiguity in the starting point: The description starts at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way, which seems clear enough.\n\n2. Inconsistency in the calls: The directions and distances might not form a closed tract, or there might be overlapping boundaries.\n\n3. Reference to streets that may have been widened, relocated, or otherwise changed over time, affecting the actual boundaries.\n\n4. Error in the measurements: Perhaps the lot isn't actually 100 feet by 175 feet, or the distances are miscalculated.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about how courts typically resolve such issues. Generally, when there's ambiguity or conflict in a property description, courts look to the intent of the parties and may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the boundaries.\n\nIn this case, since the lot was described by reference to the streets, and it's a corner lot, the streets might be considered part of the boundary. If the streets have been officially recorded and are part of a platted subdivision, then the description might be sufficient.\n\nOption A suggests that metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate. But in practice, referencing streets in metes and bounds descriptions is common, especially in urban areas where streets define property lines.\n\nOption B mentions equity not permitting forfeiture for a mere technicality. If the description is close but not perfect, equity might favor upholding the conveyance, especially if the friend has taken possession and perhaps made improvements or relied on the conveyance in some way.\n\nOption C mentions whether the tract was plotted as a lot in a subdivision. This is relevant because if it's part of a recorded subdivision plan, the description in the plat would prevail, and the deed description would be interpreted in light of that plan.\n\nOption D refers to which call in the metes and bounds description prevails if there's a conflict. In metes and bounds descriptions, the calls are interpreted in sequence, and if there's an error that prevents the description from closing, the last call is often adjusted to make the description close.\n\nGiven all this, I need to think about which factor is most likely to determine the outcome of the lawsuit.\n\nFirst, if the lot is part of a recorded subdivision, the plat would likely control, and the deed description would be interpreted in light of the plat. If the plat shows a lot that measures 100 feet by 175 feet at the corner of Davis and University, and the deed description matches that, then the friend's title should be valid.\n\nIf, however, the lot was not part of a recorded subdivision, and the deed description is ambiguous or incorrect, then there might be more room for the heirs to challenge the conveyance. But even then, courts often try to give effect to the parties' intentions, and may use extrinsic evidence to determine the boundaries.\n\nOption B mentions equity not permitting forfeiture for a mere technicality. This seems plausible, as courts generally try to avoid unjust enrichment and may reform deeds to reflect the parties' true intentions.\n\nHowever, option C seems particularly relevant because if the lot is part of a recorded subdivision, the plat would likely be the definitive source for the lot's boundaries, and the deed description would be interpreted accordingly.\n\nOption D, about which call prevails in the metes and bounds description, is also relevant if there's a discrepancy in the description that prevents it from closing properly. But in this case, the description seems to close correctly, assuming the streets are straight and the measurements are accurate.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most accurate statement is option C: The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\n\nIf it was part of a recorded subdivision, the plat would likely resolve any ambiguity in the deed description, and the friend's title would be upheld. If not, then other factors, such as the equity considerations mentioned in option B, might come into play.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
