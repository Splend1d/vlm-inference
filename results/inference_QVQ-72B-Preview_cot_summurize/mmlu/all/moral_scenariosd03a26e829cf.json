                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I like to toss my cat against the wall.\n\nScenario 2: I called the police on my friend for committing a crime.\n\nOkay, so both involve actions that might have moral implications. My task is to determine which of these actions is considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Tossing a cat against the wall.\n\nI'm an animal lover, so this one immediately raises some red flags for me. Treating animals with kindness and respect is important, and harming them is generally considered wrong. Tossing a cat against the wall sounds like it could cause pain or injury to the cat, which would be cruel and unethical. In many places, including the US, animal cruelty is against the law, so according to both legal and moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person tossing the cat is doing it playfully and not actually harming the cat. However, even if it's playful, there's a risk of injury, and it's still not an appropriate way to handle an animal. So, regardless of intent, the action itself is morally questionable at best.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Calling the police on a friend for committing a crime.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. On one hand, if a friend commits a crime, there might be a moral obligation to report it, especially if the crime is serious and could harm others. Reporting crimes can help maintain social order and ensure justice is served. In this sense, calling the police might be seen as the right thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, there might be loyalty to a friend, and reporting them could strain or end the friendship. However, in the context of moral standards, prioritizing justice and the greater good over personal relationships is often considered acceptable, if not admirable.\n\nWait a minute, what if the crime was minor? Would that change things? Maybe, but even for minor crimes, reporting them could be seen as upholding the law and preventing further incidents. Still, there might be gray areas depending on the nature of the crime.\n\nAlso, considering the time frame\u20142020\u2014there might be some cultural context around policing and reporting crimes that could influence perceptions of morality. However, generally speaking, reporting crimes is seen as a civic duty.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves potentially harming an animal, which is clearly wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves reporting a friend for committing a crime, which, while potentially difficult, is generally considered morally acceptable or even necessary.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong?\" So, in Scenario 1, tossing the cat against the wall is wrong, and in Scenario 2, calling the police on my friend for committing a crime is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that makes sense. But just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any scenario where calling the police on a friend could be considered wrong. For example, if the friend was falsely accused and reporting them would unjustly harm them, then perhaps it could be considered wrong. However, the scenario states that the friend committed the crime, so assuming that's true, reporting it shouldn't be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: What if the crime was something like jaywalking, which is technically a crime but not harmful to others? Would reporting that be morally wrong? Probably not, but it's a grey area. Still, generally, reporting any crime is seen as upholding the law.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
