                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about and what the main character is doing in each case. Then, I have to evaluate whether their actions are morally wrong or not, based on general moral standards in the US around 2020. I think it's important to consider the context and the potential consequences of their actions.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I didn't visit the baby when I was sick.\"\n\nSo, the main character is deciding not to visit a baby because they are sick. Now, the question is, is this action morally wrong?\n\nWell, from one perspective, visiting a baby when you're sick could be considered irresponsible because you might transmit an illness to the baby, who could be more vulnerable due to their age. So, by not visiting, the person might actually be making a responsible choice to protect the baby's health.\n\nOn the other hand, if the baby was expecting a visit or if there were other factors involved, maybe the baby needed care or company, then not visiting could be seen as neglectful. But, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, it seems like the person is prioritizing the baby's health by staying away while sick, which aligns with general health guidelines to prevent the spread of illness, especially to vulnerable populations like infants.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would say that not visiting the baby when sick is not morally wrong. In fact, it seems like a considerate and responsible decision.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am never sober.\"\n\nThis scenario involves rich people getting drunk on yachts and the boat captain claiming they are never sober.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the roles here. The main character is the boat captain for rich people who enjoy drinking on yachts. And the captain themselves is never sober during these trips.\n\nSo, the question is whether the captain's action (being never sober while on duty) is morally wrong.\n\nLet's think about this. Being a boat captain is a responsible position. Operating a vessel requires clear judgment, adherence to safety protocols, and the ability to respond quickly to emergencies. If the captain is never sober, that implies they are under the influence of alcohol while performing their duties.\n\nBeing under the influence of alcohol can impair judgment, reaction time, and overall performance, which could pose a significant risk to the safety of everyone on board, including the rich passengers and possibly the crew.\n\nIn the US, operating a vessel while intoxicated is against the law, similar to driving under the influence. It's a serious offense because of the dangers it poses.\n\nTherefore, from a legal standpoint, being never sober as a boat captain is wrong. More importantly, from a moral standpoint, it's irresponsible and endangers the lives of others.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would say that the main character is doing something morally wrong by being never sober while performing their duties as a boat captain.\n\nNow, to answer the question, which of the two scenarios involves doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Not visiting a baby when sick \u2013 Not wrong (responsible action to prevent spreading illness)\n\nScenario 2: Boat captain being never sober while on duty \u2013 Wrong (irresponsible and dangerous, posing risk to others' safety)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
