                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about Cicero's views on morality. The question says that Cicero claims there's no more pernicious doctrine than a particular idea, and I need to choose which one he would consider the most harmful. The options are:\n\nA. The gods do not care what we do.\n\nB. A thing may be expedient without being morally right.\n\nC. Moral rightness is relative to one's culture.\n\nD. It is sometimes permissible to lie.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"pernicious\" means. Pernicious means extremely harmful or damaging, so Cicero is saying that one of these ideas is the most harmful or damaging doctrine possible.\n\nNow, I need to recall what Cicero believed about morality. From what I remember, Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who lived in the 1st century BC. He was influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which emphasized living in accordance with nature and virtue.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The gods do not care what we do.\n\nCicero was a polytheist, believing in the Roman pantheon of gods. He likely believed that the gods did care about human actions and that they rewarded virtue and punished vice. So, the idea that the gods don't care might be seen as blasphemous or at least contrary to his religious beliefs. However, I'm not sure if this was his top priority in terms of moral doctrine.\n\nOption B: A thing may be expedient without being morally right.\n\nThis seems related to the concept of moral relativism or situational ethics. Expedient means convenient or suitable for a particular purpose, regardless of moral considerations. So, this option suggests that something can be beneficial or useful but still morally wrong.\n\nCicero was a proponent of natural law and believed in absolute moral principles that were universal and unchanging. He would have likely disagreed with the idea that expediency could override moral rightness. In fact, in his work \"On Duty,\" Cicero argues that one should always act according to moral duty, even if it seems inconvenient or disadvantageous.\n\nSo, this option seems pretty close to what might be considered pernicious by Cicero, as it suggests that moral rightness can be separated from what is expedient or beneficial.\n\nOption C: Moral rightness is relative to one's culture.\n\nThis is the idea of cultural relativism, which holds that moral standards vary from culture to culture and that no culture's morals are superior to another's. Cicero, being influenced by Stoicism, believed in natural law, which posits that there are universal moral principles derived from human nature that apply to all people, regardless of culture.\n\nTherefore, Cicero would have disagreed with moral relativism and likely considered it a harmful doctrine because it undermines the idea of universal moral truths.\n\nOption D: It is sometimes permissible to lie.\n\nCicero was known for his emphasis on honesty and integrity. In his work \"On Friendship,\" he writes that honesty is the foundation of true friendship and that lying is incompatible with virtuous living. However, he might have acknowledged that there are exceptional circumstances where lying could be justified, such as to prevent harm or to protect someone's life.\n\nFor example, in \"On Duty,\" he discusses the dilemma of whether it is ever acceptable to lie. While he generally condemns lying, he seems to suggest that in certain extreme situations, it might be permissible to deceive if it serves a greater moral good.\n\nSo, while Cicero would not have approved of lying in general, he might have been open to the idea that there are rare exceptions where it is acceptable.\n\nComparing all these options, I need to determine which one Cicero would consider the most pernicious or harmful.\n\nOption A suggests that the gods don't care about human actions. While this might be against Cicero's religious beliefs, his moral philosophy was not solely based on divine command; it was also grounded in reason and natural law.\n\nOption B proposes that something can be expedient but morally wrong. This contradicts Cicero's view that true expediency aligns with moral rightness. He believed that acting immorally for short-term gain is ultimately self-defeating and harmful in the long run.\n\nOption C is cultural relativism, which Cicero would have opposed because it contradicts his belief in universal moral principles.\n\nOption D allows for the possibility of lying in some circumstances, which Cicero might have considered a necessary evil in extreme cases, though generally undesirable.\n\nAmong these, I think Option B is the most pernicious according to Cicero's philosophy. He strongly believed in the alignment of expediency and morality, and the idea that they can be separated would undermine his entire ethical framework.\n\nIn \"On Duty,\" Cicero argues that moral rightness should always guide our actions, even if it seems contrary to our interests. He criticizes those who prioritize expediency over morality, suggesting that such a perspective leads to corruption and the decline of society.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Cicero would consider the idea that a thing may be expedient without being morally right as the most pernicious doctrine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
