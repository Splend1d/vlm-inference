Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms means rejecting or being indifferent to religion.\n\nLet me start by understanding what each term means. I know that:\n\nA. Polytheism is a belief in multiple gods. So, that's actually a form of religion, not a rejection of it. Maybe not the right choice.\n\nB. Animism is a belief that objects, animals, and other entities have spirits. It's another type of religious belief, right? So, again, not a rejection of religion.\n\nC. Secularism is when a country doesn't favor any particular religion and separates church and state. That sounds like it could be related to indifference or rejection of religion, but I should double-check.\n\nD. Monotheism is belief in one god, like in Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. That's definitely a religious stance, so probably not the answer.\n\nWait a minute, the question is about a rejection of or indifference to religion in a country. So, it's not about believing in multiple gods (polytheism) or one god (monotheism), or even attributing spirits to natural things (animism). It's about not caring about religion or rejecting it altogether.\n\nSecularism seems the closest because it's about separating religion from government and not favoring any religion. That could imply indifference or rejection of religious influences in public life.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is secularism just about separation, or does it also involve rejection or indifference?\n\nI think secularism primarily aims to keep religion out of state affairs, but it doesn't necessarily reject religion altogether. It allows for personal belief but keeps it private.\n\nOn the other hand, atheism is the rejection of belief in any deities, but the question is about a country's attitude, not individuals.\n\nMaybe secularism is the best fit here because it's about a country's approach to religion in its governance.\n\nLet me consider if there's another term that might fit better. What about irreligion? Is that a word? It sounds like it means the absence of religion, but I'm not sure if it's commonly used.\n\nComparing to the options given, secularism seems the most appropriate.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the definition of secularism to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to standard definitions, secularism is the principle of separating government institutions from religious influences and treating all religious views equally in public affairs.\n\nThat does align with indifference to specific religious beliefs in the context of a country's governance.\n\nBut is it also about rejection of religion? Maybe indirectly, by not giving any religious viewpoint preferential treatment.\n\nI think the key here is that secularism doesn't promote or reject any particular religion; it's neutral.\n\nSo, in that sense, it can be seen as indifference to religion in the context of governing a country.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. secularism.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. secularism}} \\]"
