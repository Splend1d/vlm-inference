                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Alto Co. splitting its common stock 5 for 1 on July 1. The fair value was $100 per share before the split, and before the split, there were 10,000 shares of $10 par value common stock issued and outstanding. The question is asking what the par value of the stock is after the split. The options are:\n\nA. Remained at $10.\n\nB. Was reduced to $8.\n\nC. Was reduced to $5.\n\nD. Was reduced to $2.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a stock split does to the par value of the stock. A stock split increases the number of outstanding shares by a certain ratio, but it doesn't change the total shareholder equity. Usually, when a company does a stock split, the par value per share is adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo, in this case, it's a 5 for 1 split. That means for every one share previously held, the shareholder now gets five shares. So, the number of shares outstanding will increase from 10,000 to 50,000.\n\nNow, the par value is currently $10 per share. If the total par value doesn't change, then the new par value per share should be adjusted based on the split ratio.\n\nLet me calculate the total par value before the split:\n\nTotal par value = 10,000 shares * $10/share = $100,000.\n\nAfter the split, the number of shares is 50,000. If the total par value remains the same, then:\n\nNew par value per share = Total par value / New number of shares = $100,000 / 50,000 shares = $2 per share.\n\nWait a minute, that would suggest option D: reduced to $2.\n\nBut I've heard that sometimes companies don't adjust the par value proportionally. Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nLet me think about this again. The par value is a nominal value assigned to the stock, and it doesn't really affect the market price. In many cases, when a company does a stock split, they adjust the par value per share downward in proportion to the split ratio to keep the total par value the same.\n\nSo, if we have a 5 for 1 split, the par value per share should be divided by 5 to keep the total par value constant.\n\n$10 per share / 5 = $2 per share.\n\nThat seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any reason why the par value wouldn't be adjusted like that. Maybe there are state laws or company bylaws that prevent the par value from being reduced below a certain amount. But generally, in corporate finance, the par value is adjusted proportionally in a stock split to maintain the total par value.\n\nI don't recall any specific exceptions where the par value isn't adjusted proportionally in a stock split. So, I think it's safe to assume that the par value per share is reduced to $2 after the 5 for 1 split.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Was reduced to $2.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the market value aspect. Before the split, the fair value was $100 per share. After the split, with five times as many shares, the per-share price should be one-fifth of the original price, which would be $20 per share, assuming the company's total market capitalization remains the same.\n\nBut this doesn't directly affect the par value, which is a separate concept from the market value.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the par value is reduced to $2 per share after the 5 for 1 stock split.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
