                    "text": "I think the answer is D. All of the above. Let me try to understand why each of these options could be a hindrance to economic development after colonialism.\n\nStarting with option A: artificial political boundaries that covered diverse ethnic groups with little in common. This seems like a big problem because when you have a country with many different groups that don't share much in terms of culture, language, or interests, it can lead to conflicts and difficulties in building a unified nation. This kind of division can make it hard to implement policies that benefit everyone and can lead to tensions that distract from economic development.\n\nOption B: inadequate access to higher education and training for nationals under the colonial administration. This makes sense because during colonial times, the education system was often designed to produce a class of people who could assist the colonizers in administering the colony, not necessarily to develop the skills and knowledge needed for industrialization or modernization. So, after independence, there might be a shortage of trained professionals like engineers, doctors, and teachers who could drive economic growth.\n\nOption C: control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups which had been brought in by the colonial power. This is also a significant issue. Colonial powers sometimes imported merchants and traders from other countries to handle trade and commerce in the colony. After independence, these groups might still dominate business and trade, making it difficult for native entrepreneurs to compete and for the country to develop its own business class. This could hinder the development of domestic industries and limit the country's ability to control its own economic destiny.\n\nSo, all three options seem to be valid hindrances to economic development after colonialism. That's why I think the answer is D. All of the above.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about whether there might be any exceptions or if one of these might not be as\u666e\u904das the others.\n\nFor example, in some colonies, maybe the political boundaries were somewhat aligned with existing ethnic groups, but I think that was rare. Often, colonial powers drew boundaries based on their own interests, without considering the cultural and ethnic compositions of the regions.\n\nRegarding education, it's true that colonial education systems were typically geared towards producing a small elite class that could interface with the colonial administration. Mass education and vocational training were often neglected, which left a skills gap after independence.\n\nAs for control of domestic commerce, this varied somewhat depending on the colony and the colonial power, but it was a common practice for colonial powers to favor certain groups, whether from the metropolis or from other colonies, to handle trade and commerce.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that all three factors contributed to the challenges faced by newly independent countries in their economic development, making D the correct answer.\n\nJust to consider another angle, perhaps there are other significant hindrances that aren't listed here, but based on the options given, D seems to be the best answer.\n\nIn summary, artificial political boundaries led to ethnic tensions, inadequate education systems resulted in a lack of skilled professionals, and foreign control over commerce hindered the growth of domestic businesses. All these factors combined to make economic development after colonialism a daunting task for many newly independent countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
