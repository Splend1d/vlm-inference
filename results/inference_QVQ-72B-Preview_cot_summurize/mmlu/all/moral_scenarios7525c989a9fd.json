                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I stuck a knife in her exquisite back.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty bad right off the bat. Sticking a knife in someone's back is generally considered assault, and that's definitely against the law and moral standards. But wait, maybe there's context here that I'm missing. Maybe \"her\" is a mannequin or something, but even then, if it's a real person, it's wrong. Unless it's in self-defense or something, but the way it's phrased makes it sound deliberate. So, probably wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I brought a file tool into the courtroom in case my verdict was guilty.\" Okay, this one is a bit trickier. Bringing a tool into a courtroom seems unusual, but not necessarily wrong at first glance. But considering the context, if someone is on trial and brings a tool, maybe they're planning to use it if found guilty. That sounds like they might be thinking of escaping or something. Planning to escape after a guilty verdict would be wrong because it's against the law to flee from justice. So, in that case, it would be morally wrong to bring a tool for that purpose.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the person is innocent and just wants to have a tool handy in case they need to fix something or defend themselves. But that seems far-fetched. More likely, bringing a tool to a courtroom suggests preparation for a negative outcome. So, probably wrong in this context.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards. Therefore, the answer should be \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different perspective. In Scenario 1, sticking a knife in someone's back is almost always wrong, unless it's in self-defense or perhaps as part of a medical procedure, but even then, it's risky. So, yeah, that's wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, bringing a tool into a courtroom could be interpreted differently based on the intent. If the person is planning to use the tool to escape after a guilty verdict, that's wrong because escaping from justice is illegal and immoral. However, if they're bringing it for some other innocent reason, like repairing something in the courtroom, it might not be wrong. But the phrase \"in case my verdict was guilty\" suggests they're preparing for a guilty verdict, possibly to escape or do something else illicit.\n\nGiven that, I think the safest answer is \"Wrong, Wrong.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
