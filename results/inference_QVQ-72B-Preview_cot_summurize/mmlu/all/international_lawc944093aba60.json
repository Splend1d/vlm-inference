                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of collective security. It sounds like it's about countries coming together to ensure the safety and security of all, right? Let's see, the question is asking for the meaning of collective security, and there are four options. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nOption A says it's the right to self-defence by more than one nation acting in concert. Hmm, self-defence is important, but is that the main idea behind collective security? Maybe it's part of it, but I think there's more to it.\n\nOption B mentions the right of one's allies to defend the victim State. This seems related to alliances, like NATO, where if one member is attacked, others come to its aid. But is that the broad definition of collective security, or just a specific instance?\n\nOption C is about the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council. That sounds significant. The UN Security Council has the power to authorize military action in the name of maintaining international peace and security. Maybe that's a key aspect of collective security.\n\nThen there's Option D, which talks about the authorization of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly. Wait, I thought peacekeeping missions were typically authorized by the UN Security Council, not the General Assembly. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nAlright, let's think this through. Collective security seems to be about a group of nations working together to maintain peace and security, perhaps by agreeing to defend each other or by allowing an international body to take action when needed.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The right to self-defence by more than one nation acting in concert.\n\nB. The right of one's allies to defend the victim State.\n\nC. The authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council.\n\nD. The authorization of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly.\n\nI think Option C might be the most accurate. The UN Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, and it can authorize the use of armed force if necessary. This seems to align closely with the idea of collective security, where the international community comes together under the auspices of the UN to address threats to peace.\n\nOption A is about self-defence, which is a right under international law, but it's more about individual states defending themselves rather than a collective approach led by the UN.\n\nOption B is similar, focusing on alliances and the defence of an ally. While alliances like NATO are examples of collective security arrangements, they are not the same as the broader concept of collective security under the UN.\n\nOption D refers to the UN General Assembly authorizing peacekeeping missions. I'm a bit unsure about this because I thought peacekeeping missions were typically authorized by the Security Council, not the General Assembly. Maybe in some cases, the General Assembly has a role, but generally, it's the Security Council that handles such matters.\n\nLet me check that. Yes, according to the UN Charter, the Security Council is the primary organ responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It has the authority to authorize the use of force, including peacekeeping operations. The General Assembly, while it can discuss and make recommendations on international peace and security, does not have the power to authorize the use of force directly.\n\nSo, based on this, Option C seems to be the most accurate description of collective security. It's about the UN Security Council authorizing armed force when necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that another option could also be correct. For example, perhaps collective security encompasses both self-defence and alliance defence.\n\nWell, the concept of collective security does involve the idea that an attack on one is an attack on all, which is the principle behind mutual defence alliances. However, the term \"collective security\" is often used in a broader sense, referring to international cooperation through organizations like the UN to maintain peace and security for all states, not just members of a particular alliance.\n\nGiven that, the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council seems to be a core aspect of collective security, as it represents the international community's collective decision to take action in response to threats to peace and security.\n\nOn the other hand, self-defence and alliance defence are more about individual or group responses to specific attacks, rather than a collective international response.\n\nTherefore, I believe Option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look up the definition of collective security. According to various international relations theories, collective security is a system where states agree to resolve their differences through arbitration or other peaceful means, and to join together to sanction or use force against aggressors.\n\nThis definition aligns well with the role of the UN Security Council, which is designed to provide a platform for member states to resolve conflicts peacefully and, if necessary, to authorize collective action, including the use of force, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the meaning of collective security is the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
