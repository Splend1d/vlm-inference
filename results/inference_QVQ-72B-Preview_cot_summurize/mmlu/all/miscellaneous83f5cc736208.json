I know that sports can vary a lot in their structure, but I think hockey is divided into several periods. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I recall that in some sports, like soccer, there are two halves. But I don't think that's the case with hockey. Maybe it's different.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the professional level. Like, in the NHL, how many periods are there? I think there are three periods in a regular season game. Each period is usually 20 minutes long, right? So, three periods would make sense.\n\nBut then, I also recall that in some leagues, maybe there are overtime periods or something like that. But I think that's only in certain situations, like playoff games or if the game is tied after regulation time.\n\nSo, for a standard, regular-season game, it should be three periods. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nLet me double-check this. Maybe I can think about the structure of the game. There's the first period, then the second period, and the third period. That makes three periods in total.\n\nI don't think it's four periods in a standard game. Maybe in some amateur leagues or something, but not in professional hockey.\n\nWait, could it be different in other countries? Like, maybe in international hockey, they have different rules? I'm not sure, but I think the structure is pretty standard across most leagues, especially at the professional level.\n\nI think the answer is C. Three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
