                    "text": "Alright, let's dive into this case. So, we've got a 40-year-old female secretary who's been feeling fatigued for the past two months. She's also experiencing generalized aching and weakness in the proximal muscles of all four limbs. Proximal muscles are the ones closer to the trunk, like the muscles in the upper arms and thighs. That's an important detail.\n\nShe first noticed this weakness when getting in and out of her car, but now it's progressed to the point where she has difficulty combing her hair. That suggests the weakness is getting worse over time. She also mentions joint aching in her hands, which has improved somewhat with ibuprofen. Interesting.\n\nHer family history isn't known because she was adopted, but her two teenage children are healthy. That might not be directly relevant, but it's good to know.\n\nLet's look at her physical examination. She appears uncomfortable, which makes sense given her symptoms. She's 170 cm tall and weighs 68 kg, with a BMI of 24 kg/m2, which is within the normal range. Her vital signs show a slight fever of 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), a pulse of 90/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. Nothing too out of the ordinary there.\n\nDuring the exam, there's cracking of the skin on both hands, particularly on the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. That could be indicative of some skin condition, maybe related to her muscle issues. The muscles in her upper arms and legs are tender to pressure, which aligns with her reports of aching and weakness.\n\nLab tests show a creatine kinase (CK) level of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 800 U/L. Both of these enzymes are typically elevated in muscle damage or inflammation. CK is especially indicative of muscle breakdown, and LDH can be elevated in various conditions, including muscle disease. Her complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits, which is good; no anemia or other blood abnormalities.\n\nNow, let's consider the differential diagnosis. The options given are fibromyalgia, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and scleroderma.\n\nStarting with fibromyalgia (option A). Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, often accompanied by fatigue and sleep disturbances. However, unlike polymyositis, fibromyalgia doesn't typically cause objective muscle weakness or elevated muscle enzymes. So, while our patient does have muscle pain and tenderness, the presence of elevated CK and LDH suggests actual muscle inflammation or damage, which isn't a feature of fibromyalgia.\n\nNext, myasthenia gravis (option B). Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease that causes muscle weakness, often starting in the muscles that control eye movements and then spreading to other parts of the body. It's caused by antibodies attacking acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. However, in myasthenia gravis, the muscle weakness fluctuates and is often exacerbated by activity. Muscle enzymes like CK and LDH are typically normal unless there's significant muscle use or crisis. Given that our patient has elevated CK and LDH, myasthenia gravis is less likely.\n\nThen, polymyositis (option C). Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inflammation, primarily affecting the proximal muscles. Symptoms include difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a seated position, and lifting objects. Patients may also experience joint pain and skin changes, such as a rash. The elevation of muscle enzymes like CK and LDH is a hallmark of polymyositis. The presence of skin cracking on her hands could be related to another condition like dermatomyositis, which is similar to polymyositis but has more prominent skin involvement. However, dermatomyositis typically affects children and young adults more commonly, whereas polymyositis is more common in adults, especially women around this age.\n\nFinally, scleroderma (option D). Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that causes hardening and thickening of the skin and can affect internal organs. Symptoms can include joint pain, Raynaud's phenomenon (finger discoloration in response to cold), and gastrointestinal issues. While scleroderma can affect the muscles, causing myositis, it's less common than in conditions like polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Additionally, the skin changes in scleroderma are more widespread and involve thickening and hardening, not necessarily cracking as described in our patient.\n\nConsidering all this, polymyositis seems to fit the patient's symptoms and lab findings best. The proximal muscle weakness, muscle aching, tender muscles, elevated muscle enzymes, and skin cracking on the hands are all consistent with polymyositis. While dermatomyositis also presents with skin changes and muscle weakness, the age of onset makes polymyositis more likely.\n\nSo, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC. Polymyositis"
