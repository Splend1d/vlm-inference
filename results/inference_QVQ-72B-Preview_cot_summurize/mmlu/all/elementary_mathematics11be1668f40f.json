                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Chris sells roses for $16.99 a bunch, and at the end of the day, he has collected $339.80. I need to figure out how many bunches of roses he sold. The options are 22, 18, 20, or 16 bunches.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step. He sells each bunch for $16.99, and he made a total of $339.80 from selling these bunches. So, basically, I need to find out how many times $16.99 goes into $339.80. That sounds like a division problem.\n\nSo, I should divide the total amount collected by the price per bunch to get the number of bunches sold.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of bunches = Total sales / Price per bunch\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of bunches = $339.80 / $16.99\n\nOkay, now I need to do this division. But, hmm, dividing 339.80 by 16.99 might be a bit tricky because both numbers have cents. Maybe I can make it easier by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals.\n\nSo, multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 100:\n\n= 33980 / 1699\n\nThat might be a bit easier, but I'm still not sure how to divide 33980 by 1699 quickly. Maybe I can estimate first to get an idea of what the answer should be.\n\nLet me round $16.99 to $17 and $339.80 to $340. Then, 340 divided by 17.\n\nLet's see, 17 times 20 is 340. So, in this approximation, the answer would be 20 bunches.\n\nLooking back at the options, 20 is one of them. But I should check if this is exact.\n\nMaybe I can try multiplying 16.99 by 20 to see what I get.\n\n16.99 times 20:\n\nWell, 17 times 20 is 340, but since 16.99 is 0.01 less than 17, I need to subtract 0.01 times 20.\n\nSo, 17 * 20 = 340\n\n0.01 * 20 = 0.20\n\nTherefore, 16.99 * 20 = 340 - 0.20 = 339.80\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly $339.80, which is the total amount collected.\n\nSo, Chris sold 20 bunches of roses.\n\nBut let me double-check to be sure.\n\nIf he sold 20 bunches at $16.99 each, then 20 times 16.99 is indeed 339.80.\n\nLet me verify that again:\n\n20 \u00d7 16.99 = (20 \u00d7 17) - (20 \u00d7 0.01) = 340 - 0.20 = 339.80\n\nYes, that matches the total amount collected.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 20.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nMaybe using fractions or other methods, but given the decimal amounts, division seems like the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the other options to see if they make sense.\n\nFor example, if he sold 18 bunches:\n\n18 \u00d7 16.99 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 18 \u00d7 17 = 306\n\nThen, 18 \u00d7 0.01 = 0.18\n\nSo, 18 \u00d7 16.99 = 306 - 0.18 = 305.82\n\nBut that's not equal to $339.80.\n\nSimilarly, 22 bunches:\n\n22 \u00d7 16.99 = ?\n\n22 \u00d7 17 = 374\n\n22 \u00d7 0.01 = 0.22\n\nSo, 22 \u00d7 16.99 = 374 - 0.22 = 373.78\n\nThat's more than $339.80.\n\nAnd 16 bunches:\n\n16 \u00d7 16.99 = ?\n\n16 \u00d7 17 = 272\n\n16 \u00d7 0.01 = 0.16\n\nSo, 16 \u00d7 16.99 = 272 - 0.16 = 271.84\n\nThat's less than $339.80.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, only 20 bunches gives the exact total of $339.80.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
