                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a spinning sphere. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.\n\nWe have a solid sphere with a moment of inertia I = 0.06 kg\u00b7m\u00b2, and it's spinning freely around an axis through its center at an angular speed of 20 rad/s. We want to bring it to rest by applying a friction force of 2.0 N to its outer surface, which is 0.30 m from the center. The question is, how much time will it take for the sphere to come to rest?\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall some concepts about rotational motion. Since the sphere is spinning, its angular momentum is changing when we apply a friction force. I think torque is involved here because torque is what changes angular momentum.\n\nTorque \u03c4 is defined as the force times the lever arm, which in this case is the force applied times the distance from the center, which is 0.30 m. So, \u03c4 = F * r = 2.0 N * 0.30 m = 0.60 N\u00b7m.\n\nNow, torque is also equal to the rate of change of angular momentum, which is \u03c4 = I * \u03b1, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.\n\nSo, if I have \u03c4 = I * \u03b1, and I know \u03c4 and I, I can solve for \u03b1.\n\n\u03b1 = \u03c4 / I = 0.60 N\u00b7m / 0.06 kg\u00b7m\u00b2 = 10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nAlright, so the angular acceleration is 10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long it takes for the sphere to come to rest. Initially, it's spinning at 20 rad/s, and it's decelerating at 10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nI can use the rotational motion equation that relates angular velocity, time, and angular acceleration.\n\nThe equation is \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1*t, where \u03c9 is the final angular velocity, \u03c9\u2080 is the initial angular velocity, \u03b1 is the angular acceleration, and t is time.\n\nWe want the sphere to come to rest, so \u03c9 = 0 rad/s.\n\nSo, 0 = 20 rad/s + (-10 rad/s\u00b2) * t.\n\nSolving for t, I get t = 20 rad/s / 10 rad/s\u00b2 = 2 seconds.\n\nWait, but the options include 2 s, but also 4 s, 0.06 s, and 0.03 s. Did I do something wrong?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, torque \u03c4 = F * r = 2.0 N * 0.30 m = 0.60 N\u00b7m. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \u03c4 = I * \u03b1, so \u03b1 = \u03c4 / I = 0.60 / 0.06 = 10 rad/s\u00b2. That also seems correct.\n\nThen, using \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1*t, and setting \u03c9 = 0, we get t = \u03c9\u2080 / \u03b1 = 20 / 10 = 2 s.\n\nHmm, but maybe I need to consider the direction of the force. Is the friction force opposing the motion?\n\nYes, so the angular acceleration should be negative, meaning it's decelerating.\n\nSo, \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1*t, where \u03b1 = -10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, 0 = 20 + (-10)*t, which still gives t = 2 s.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Maybe there's another way to look at it to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the power equation, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the work done by the friction force.\n\nWork done by friction is force times distance, but since it's a rotating object, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using energy conservation.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy is (1/2)*I*\u03c9\u2080\u00b2, and final kinetic energy is zero.\n\nSo, work done by friction equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nWork = - (1/2)*I*\u03c9\u2080\u00b2.\n\nBut work is also equal to the force times the distance over which it acts, but in rotation, it's torque times angular displacement.\n\nWait, this might be more complicated. Maybe my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friction force is applied at the rim, and maybe there's a moment of inertia adjustment needed, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, no, the moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)*m*r\u00b2, but in this problem, they've given I directly as 0.06 kg\u00b7m\u00b2, so I don't need to calculate it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the friction force is constant, and the torque is constant, which seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the sphere is slowing down uniformly, which seems to be the case, given constant torque and constant angular acceleration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the angular displacement during this time, but I don't think that's necessary for finding time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the equation \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u2080\u00b2 + 2*\u03b1*\u03b8, but again, that involves angular displacement \u03b8, which I don't have and don't need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should stick with my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friction force is providing a constant torque, leading to a constant angular acceleration, which I've already used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the sphere is a solid sphere and think about its radius, but they've given the distance from the center as 0.30 m, which should be the radius, assuming it's applied at the rim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friction force is causing a linear deceleration as well, but since it's rotating, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the linear velocity and relate it to angular velocity.\n\nWait, for a solid sphere rolling without slipping, v = \u03c9 * r.\n\nBut in this case, it's spinning freely around its axis, so maybe linear motion isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friction force is applied tangentially, providing a torque.\n\nYes, that's what I did initially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friction force is constant, leading to constant torque and constant angular acceleration, which again brings me back to my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the power dissipated by friction equals the rate of change of kinetic energy.\n\nPower P = \u03c4 * \u03c9, and rate of change of kinetic energy is d(KE)/dt = - (1/2)*I*\u03b1*\u03c9, but this seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the time by considering the angular impulse.\n\nAngular impulse is \u03c4 * t = I * \u03c9.\n\nSo, \u03c4 * t = I * \u03c9\u2080, because final \u03c9 is zero.\n\nSo, t = (I * \u03c9\u2080) / \u03c4 = (0.06 kg\u00b7m\u00b2 * 20 rad/s) / 0.60 N\u00b7m = (1.2 kg\u00b7m\u00b2\u00b7rad/s) / 0.60 N\u00b7m = 2 seconds.\n\nOkay, this confirms my initial calculation.\n\nSo, it seems that the time taken for the sphere to come to rest is 2 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 2\\ \\text{s}} \\]"
