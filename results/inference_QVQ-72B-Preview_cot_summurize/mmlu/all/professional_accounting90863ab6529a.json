                    "text": "So I have this question about the due date for a federal estate tax return, specifically Form 706. The taxpayer passed away on May 15 of year 2, and there's no extension being requested. I need to figure out when the estate tax return is due from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general due date for a federal estate tax return. I think it's nine months after the date of death. Is that right? Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, according to IRS regulations, the estate tax return, Form 706, is generally due nine months after the date of death. So, starting from the date of death, which is May 15, year 2, I need to add nine months to that.\n\nNow, calculating nine months from May 15, year 2. Let's see:\n\n- May has 31 days, so May 15 to May 31 is 16 days.\n\n- June has 30 days.\n\n- July has 31 days.\n\n- August has 31 days.\n\n- September has 30 days.\n\n- October has 31 days.\n\n- November has 30 days.\n\n- December has 31 days.\n\nAdding up the days in these months:\n\nFrom May 15 to May 31: 16 days\n\nJune: 30 days\n\nJuly: 31 days\n\nAugust: 31 days\n\nSeptember: 30 days\n\nOctober: 31 days\n\nNovember: 30 days\n\nDecember: 31 days\n\nTotal days: 16 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = Let's calculate that.\n\n16 + 30 = 46\n\n46 + 31 = 77\n\n77 + 31 = 108\n\n108 + 30 = 138\n\n138 + 31 = 169\n\n169 + 30 = 199\n\n199 + 31 = 230 days.\n\nSo, nine months from May 15, year 2, would be around February 15 of year 3. Because starting from May 15, adding 230 days would take us to February 15.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I know that each month has a different number of days, but for estate tax purposes, does the due date roll over to the next month if the ninth month falls on a weekend or holiday? I think the due date is the 15th of the month following the nine-month period.\n\nSo, nine months from May 15 would be February 15 of the following year.\n\nLet me see: May to December is seven months (May to December), which is 213 days (30.4 days per month on average), but that might not be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to think that the due date is nine months after the date of death, and that's generally considered to be the 15th day of the month following the nine-month period.\n\nSo, May 15 to February 15 of the next year.\n\nTherefore, the due date would be February 15, year 3.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. September 15, year 2.\n\nB. December 31, year 2.\n\nC. January 31, year 3.\n\nD. February 15, year 3.\n\nSo, option D is February 15, year 3, which aligns with my calculation.\n\nBut I should check if there are any exceptions or special rules that might change this due date.\n\nFor instance, if the estate files for an extension, the due date can be extended, but the question states that no extension is being filed. So, that shouldn't affect the due date.\n\nAlso, sometimes due dates can be affected by weekends or legal holidays. For example, if February 15 falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the due date might be extended to the next business day. However, since the question doesn't specify any extension request or any such complications, I think we can assume that the due date is February 15, year 3.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that for estates that don't timely file Form 706 and pay the tax due, penalties may apply. But since the question is about the due date and not about the consequences of missing it, this shouldn't affect the answer.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is February 15, year 3.\n\nJust to make sure, let me cross-reference this with IRS instructions or publications.\n\nI remember that IRS Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators, provides information on estate taxes and filing requirements. It states that the estate tax return is due nine months after the date of death, unless an extension is requested.\n\nAlso, IRS Form 4768, Application for Extension of Time to File a Return and/or Pay U.S. Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Taxes, is used to request an extension, but again, the question specifies that no extension is being filed.\n\nTherefore, without any extension, the due date remains February 15 of the year following the death.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is February 15, year 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
