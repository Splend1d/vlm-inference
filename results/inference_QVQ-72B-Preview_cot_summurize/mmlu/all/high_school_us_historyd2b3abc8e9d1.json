I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration?

                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about Albert Beveridge's speech from 1898, titled \"The March of the Flag.\" He's talking about governing new possessions, like Hawaii and the Philippines, and comparing America's ability to govern these places to that of England and Germany. He also mentions California and New Mexico, which had savage and alien populations, and were remote when they came under U.S. control. He seems to be arguing that if the U.S. could handle those places, it can handle the new territories.\n\nThe question is asking which theme of Beveridge's speech can be most directly compared to another option: the Monroe Doctrine, containment, manifest destiny, or the ideology of states' rights.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Beveridge is saying. He's advocating for the U.S. to govern these new territories, emphasizing that America has the capability to do so, just like other imperial powers. He's also drawing a parallel to the expansion of the U.S. in the past, like acquiring California and New Mexico, suggesting that this is a continuation of that expansion.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these options is:\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine: This was a policy stated by President James Monroe in 1823, basically saying that Europe should stay out of the Americas, and the U.S. would stay out of European affairs. It was about non-interference and keeping the New World separate from the Old World.\n\nB. Containment: This is a policy from the Cold War era, where the U.S. tried to prevent the spread of communism by containing it to the countries where it already existed. It involved supporting anti-communist governments and movements around the world.\n\nC. Manifest Destiny: This is the idea that the United States was destined to expand across North America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was a driving force behind the acquisition of territories like Texas, Oregon, and California in the 19th century.\n\nD. The ideology of states' rights: This is the principle that individual states have rights and powers that the federal government cannot infringe upon. It's about limiting federal power and enhancing state sovereignty.\n\nLooking back at Beveridge's speech, he's talking about expanding American influence and governance to new territories beyond the continental United States, such as Hawaii and the Philippines. He's justifying this expansion by comparing it to previous expansions, like acquiring California and New Mexico.\n\nManifest Destiny (option C) was about expanding across North America, which does include places like California and New Mexico. However, Manifest Destiny was primarily focused on the continent of North America, whereas Beveridge is talking about acquiring overseas territories.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine (option A) was about preventing European intervention in the Americas, not about acquiring new territories or governing overseas possessions.\n\nContainment (option B) is a 20th-century policy related to the Cold War and communism, which isn't directly related to the acquisition of territories in 1898.\n\nStates' rights (option D) is about the power of individual states within the United States, not about acquiring or governing territories outside the continental U.S.\n\nSo, none of these options seem to perfectly match Beveridge's theme of acquiring and governing overseas territories. However, the question is asking for the most direct comparison.\n\nManifest Destiny is the closest in spirit because it involves expansionism, but it was primarily about continental expansion. Beveridge is extending that idea to include overseas possessions.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the theme is about American exceptionalism or the belief in American superiority in governance, which could be compared to manifest destiny in its confidence in American capabilities and destiny to lead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Monroe Doctrine can be interpreted as asserting American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, which could include overseas territories like Puerto Rico or the Philippines, but that feels like a stretch.\n\nContainment doesn't fit because it's about ideological battles during the Cold War, and states' rights are about internal governance within the U.S.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C. Manifest Destiny, as it's the most similar in terms of expansionist ideology, even if it was originally about continental expansion.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that Beveridge is extending the concept of manifest destiny beyond North America. He mentions that the U.S. is \"pitching the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward,\" which could imply a continuation of the expansionist ideology beyond the continental limits.\n\nAdditionally, he refers to \"the march of the flag,\" which suggests a continued expansion and spread of American influence and values, similar to manifest destiny.\n\nTherefore, even though manifest destiny was primarily about North America, Beveridge seems to be broadening that idea to include other territories.\n\nSo, I think the most direct comparison is to manifest destiny.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
