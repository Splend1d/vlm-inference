Spoiling the grandchildren\n\nC. Having others to wait on you\n\nD. Remembering when they were grandchildren\n\nAnd I need to pick which one is NOT one of the most rewarding aspects, based on what grandparents themselves have reported.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option means in the context of being a grandparent.\n\nStarting with A: Feelings of immortality. I think this refers to the idea that grandparents see a part of themselves living on in their grandchildren. Like, they're passing on their genes or maybe their values and knowledge to the next generation, which gives them a sense that a part of them will live beyond their own lifetime. That sounds like a pretty deep and meaningful reward for being a grandparent.\n\nOption B: Spoiling the grandchildren. This one seems straightforward. Grandparents often enjoy pampering and indulging their grandkids without having to worry about the day-to-day parenting responsibilities. It's a chance to give them treats or experiences that they might not get otherwise, and it can be a lot of fun for both parties. So, this also sounds like a common and enjoyable aspect of being a grandparent.\n\nMoving on to C: Having others to wait on you. Hmm, this one feels a bit different. Normally, being a grandparent is about giving to your grandchildren, not receiving service from them. Grandchildren are usually quite young and wouldn't be in a position to wait on their grandparents. Maybe in some cases, older grandchildren might help out or assist their grandparents, but that doesn't seem like a primary or universal rewarding aspect of being a grandparent.\n\nLastly, option D: Remembering when they were grandchildren. This seems nostalgic. Grandparents might enjoy reflecting on their own childhood and youth as they watch their grandchildren grow up. It could bring back fond memories and give them a sense of continuity and connection through the generations. So, this also appears to be a rewarding aspect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C: Having others to wait on you seems out of place. The other options focus on emotional connections, passing on legacy, and enjoying interactions with grandchildren, whereas this option suggests receiving service, which isn't typically a central part of the grandparent-grandchild relationship.\n\nI think the answer is C. Having others to wait on you.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
