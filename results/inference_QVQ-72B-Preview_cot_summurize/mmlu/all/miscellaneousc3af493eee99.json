Hmm, I think I remember that the equinoxes and solstices are related to the seasons, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Earth orbits the Sun once a year, and because of the tilt of the Earth's axis, we have different seasons. The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, the winter solstice is the shortest, and the equinoxes are when day and night are roughly the same length.\n\nI think the vernal equinox, which is the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, happens around March 20th or 21st. Let me see if that's consistent across different years. I recall that the exact date can vary a bit due to leap years and other factors, but generally, it's around March 20th or 21st.\n\nLet me check online to confirm this. Oh, wait, I don't have internet access right now. Okay, maybe I can think of another way.\n\nI remember that in the Northern Hemisphere, spring starts around March 20th or 21st, summer around June 21st or 22nd, autumn around September 22nd or 23rd, and winter around December 21st or 22nd. So, for spring, it's definitely around late March, not in February, April, or May.\n\nBut let's make sure about the specific date for the United States. Maybe there's some variation based on time zones or something.\n\nI think the vernal equinox occurs at a specific moment in time, and it's the same worldwide. So, regardless of the time zone, the date will be similar, give or take a day depending on where you are in the time zone.\n\nConsidering that the United States spans multiple time zones, from the East Coast to the West Coast, the date might be the same for the equinox, but the exact time could differ.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll consider the general date for the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSo, based on my recollection, March 21st is the most likely answer.\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is February 21st. Is there any chance that the first day of spring could be in February?\n\nI don't think so. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring starts in March, not in February. February is typically still winter.\n\nApril 21st seems too late; by then, spring is already well underway, and I think the equinox is earlier.\n\nMay 21st is even later, which would be into summer.\n\nTherefore, March 21st seems the most plausible answer.\n\nMaybe I can think about it another way. If I consider the astronomical definition, the vernal equinox marks the beginning of spring, and that occurs around March 20th or 21st each year.\n\nI think the exact date can vary slightly due to leap years and the Gregorian calendar adjustments, but it generally falls on March 20th or 21st.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have their seasons opposite to each other. So, when it's spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it's autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBut since the question specifies the United States, which is in the Northern Hemisphere, March 21st is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll try to recall if there's any variation based on geographical location within the U.S.\n\nI don't think so. The equinox occurs at the same time for everyone on Earth, even though local time zones might affect the exact date and time.\n\nFor example, if the equinox occurs at midnight Eastern Time, it might still be March 20th in California, which is three hours behind.\n\nBut in general, the date is considered to be around March 20th or 21st.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that March 21st is the correct answer.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 21-Mar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 21-\\text{Mar}} \\]"
