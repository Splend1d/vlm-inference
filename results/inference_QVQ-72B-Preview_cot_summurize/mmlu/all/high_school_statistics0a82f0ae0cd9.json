                    "text": "So I've got this problem here involving two sets of numbers: X and Y. Both sets have the same number of elements, seven each, and they share some common values, but there are differences too. The question is asking which of the statements A, B, or C is false, or if none of them are false. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the sets again for clarity:\n\nX = {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}\n\nY = {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}\n\nOkay, so both sets have seven elements. I need to check their medians, means, and ranges to see if any of these statements are false.\n\nStarting with the median (statement A):\n\nThe median is the middle value when the numbers are ordered from least to greatest. Since both sets have seven elements, the median will be the fourth smallest number in each set.\n\nFor set X: 10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90. The fourth number is 50.\n\nFor set Y: 10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90. The fourth number is also 50.\n\nSo, both sets have the same median of 50. Therefore, statement A is true.\n\nNext, the means (statement B):\n\nThe mean is the average of the numbers in the set. To find the mean, I need to sum all the numbers in each set and then divide by the number of elements, which is seven for both sets.\n\nFirst, sum of set X:\n\n10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n10 + 30 = 40\n\n40 + 45 = 85\n\n85 + 50 = 135\n\n135 + 55 = 190\n\n190 + 70 = 260\n\n260 + 90 = 350\n\nSo, the sum of set X is 350. Mean of X is 350 \u00f7 7 = 50.\n\nNow, sum of set Y:\n\n10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n10 + 30 = 40\n\n40 + 35 = 75\n\n75 + 50 = 125\n\n125 + 65 = 190\n\n190 + 70 = 260\n\n260 + 90 = 350\n\nWait, the sum of set Y is also 350. So, mean of Y is also 350 \u00f7 7 = 50.\n\nTherefore, both sets have the same mean of 50. Statement B is true.\n\nNow, the ranges (statement C):\n\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest numbers in the set.\n\nFor set X: highest is 90, lowest is 10. Range is 90 - 10 = 80.\n\nFor set Y: highest is 90, lowest is 10. Range is 90 - 10 = 80.\n\nSo, both sets have the same range of 80. Statement C is also true.\n\nGiven that all three statements A, B, and C are true, the answer should be D: none of the above are false.\n\nBut wait a minute, the question is asking which of the following is false. Since all three are true, the correct answer is D: none of the above are false.\n\nI think that's the conclusion here. But just to be thorough, let me double-check each point.\n\nMedian: both sets have median 50 \u2013 that's correct.\n\nMean: both sums are 350, divided by 7 gives 50 \u2013 correct.\n\nRange: both have range 80 \u2013 correct.\n\nYes, all statements are true, so none are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
