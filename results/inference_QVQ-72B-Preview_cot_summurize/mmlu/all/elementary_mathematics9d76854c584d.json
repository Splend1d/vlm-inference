                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Sonia and Negin together have $27.00. Sonia spends $12.35 on a shirt, and Negin spends $10.11 on a pair of sandals. I need to figure out how much money they have left after these purchases. The options are A. $4.46, B. $4.54, C. $5.36, and D. $5.76.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. They have a total of $27.00 together. Then Sonia spends some money on a shirt and Negin spends some on sandals. I need to subtract those expenses from their total money to find out what's left.\n\nSo, total money is $27.00.\n\nSonia spends $12.35 on a shirt.\n\nNegin spends $10.11 on sandals.\n\nMoney spent in total is $12.35 plus $10.11.\n\nI need to add those two amounts together.\n\n$12.35 + $10.11 = ?\n\nLet's add $12.35 and $10.11.\n\nFirst, I'll add $12.35 and $10.00, which is $22.35.\n\nThen, add the remaining $0.11 to that sum.\n\n$22.35 + $0.11 = $22.46.\n\nSo, they spent a total of $22.46.\n\nNow, I need to subtract that from the total money they had, which is $27.00.\n\n$27.00 - $22.46 = ?\n\nLet's do this subtraction.\n\n$27.00 minus $22.46.\n\nI can think of this as 27.00 minus 22.46.\n\nFirst, subtract $22.00 from $27.00, which gives $5.00.\n\nThen, subtract $0.46 from $5.00.\n\n$5.00 minus $0.46 is $4.54.\n\nSo, the remaining money is $4.54.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option B. $4.54.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that subtraction to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n$27.00 minus $22.46.\n\nAlternatively, I can align the decimals and subtract directly.\n\n27.00\n\n-22.46\n\n------\n\n4.54\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. $4.54.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to add the expenses and then subtract from the total.\n\nTotal money: $27.00.\n\nExpenses: $12.35 + $10.11 = $22.46.\n\nRemaining money: $27.00 - $22.46 = $4.54.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider if they are sharing the expenses or something, but the problem seems straightforward: they have a total amount, they spend certain amounts individually, and we need to find out what's left.\n\nI don't think there's more to it.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. $4.54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 4.54} \\]"
