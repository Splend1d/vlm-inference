                    "text": "Let's see. The problem is about dropping and throwing a ball downward, and it's asking about the acceleration immediately after leaving your hand, assuming no air resistance. So, when you drop a ball from rest, it accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2. That's straightforward because the only force acting on it is gravity.\n\nNow, if you throw it downward instead, still assuming no air resistance, what happens? The options are:\n\nA. 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nB. More than 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nC. Less than 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nD. Cannot say unless the speed of throw is given.\n\nHmm. When you throw something, you're applying a force to it, right? But once it leaves your hand, the only force acting on it is gravity, assuming no air resistance. So, the acceleration should just be due to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. When you throw it downward, you're giving it an initial velocity, but the acceleration is still just due to gravity. So, the acceleration shouldn't change just because you gave it an initial push downward.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose I'm standing on a cliff and I drop a rock. It falls with acceleration g. If I throw it downward instead, does the acceleration change? No, because once it's left my hand, only gravity is acting on it.\n\nSo, it seems like the acceleration should still be 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward. That would make the answer A. 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect the acceleration. For example, if there was air resistance, that would affect the acceleration, but the problem specifies no air resistance. So, only gravity is acting on the ball.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the equations of motion. The acceleration due to gravity is constant and equal to g, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface, regardless of the initial velocity.\n\nSo, whether you drop it from rest or throw it downward with some initial velocity, the acceleration is still g.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. When you throw it downward, you're applying a force during the throw, which gives it an initial velocity. But once it leaves your hand, the only acceleration is due to gravity.\n\nSo, the acceleration immediately after leaving your hand should indeed be just g, which is 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that acceleration is about the change in velocity over time due to net forces acting on the object. Once the ball leaves your hand, the only force acting on it is gravity, so the acceleration is g.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider the free-body diagram. The ball is in free fall, and the only force acting on it is the weight, which is mg downward. So, the acceleration is g, which is 9.8 m/s\u00b2 downward.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any other force that would change this acceleration. So, I'm confident that the answer is A. 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
