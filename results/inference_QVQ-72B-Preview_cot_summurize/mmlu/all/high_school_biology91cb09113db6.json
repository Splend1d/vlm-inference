                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about osmosis and dialysis bags. So, the student has a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution inside, and it's placed into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. But the question is asking what would happen if the bag was instead placed into a beaker of distilled water. Okay, so I need to think about osmosis here.\n\nFirst, osmosis is the movement of solvent molecules across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. In this case, the dialysis bag is the semipermeable membrane, and it's containing a 0.5 M solution. Distilled water has a 0 M solution, right? So, the solute concentration outside the bag is 0 M, and inside it's 0.5 M.\n\nSince osmosis moves water from low solute to high solute, water should move into the bag because outside there's pure water (0 M solute), and inside there's 0.5 M solute. So, water will flow into the bag to dilute the solute inside.\n\nOption B says there will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size. That sounds right based on my reasoning.\n\nOption A says water will flow out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size. But that's the opposite of what I think should happen.\n\nOption C says the bag will remain the same size because no water will move at all. That can't be right because there's a concentration gradient.\n\nOption D mentions that the solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker. Well, dialysis bags are typically designed to allow small molecules like solutes to pass through, but I need to focus on the osmosis part here.\n\nWait, but the question is about water movement, not solute movement. So, even though solutes might move, the primary focus is on water movement via osmosis.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option B seems correct. Water will flow into the bag, causing it to swell.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the bag has a 0.5 M solution and it's placed in distilled water (0 M), then the water potential outside is higher (since there are more water molecules relative to solute) and will move into the bag to equalize the solute concentrations.\n\nYes, that reinforces my initial thought. So, the answer should be option B: there will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
