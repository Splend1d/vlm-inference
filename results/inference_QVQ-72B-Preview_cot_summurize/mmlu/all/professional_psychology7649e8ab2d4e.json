                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. It says that an employee expects greater consistency in the behavior of his boss than is warranted. And I need to choose which of the given options\u2014overjustification hypothesis, self-serving bias, fundamental attribution bias, or self-verification theory\u2014best accounts for this expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is getting at. The employee is expecting their boss to be more consistent in behavior than is actually the case. So, the employee is overestimating the consistency of the boss's behavior.\n\nNow, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Overjustification hypothesis.\n\nI remember learning about the overjustification hypothesis in the context of motivation. It suggests that when external rewards are provided for an activity that is already intrinsically motivating, it can actually reduce the person's intrinsic motivation for that activity. So, it's about the effect of rewards on motivation, not really about attributing consistency to someone's behavior. Seems like this isn't the right fit for the scenario described.\n\nOption B: Self-serving bias.\n\nThis is when people tend to take credit for their successes but blame external factors for their failures. It's a type of cognitive bias where individuals attribute positive outcomes to their own abilities and efforts, but negative outcomes to things outside their control. Again, this doesn't seem directly related to expecting consistency in others' behavior. Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't appear to fit the situation here.\n\nOption C: Fundamental attribution bias.\n\nThis one sounds promising. The fundamental attribution bias is the tendency to overattribute other people's behavior to their internal characteristics or dispositional factors, while underemphasizing the role of situational factors. In other words, we tend to think that people act the way they do because of who they are, not because of the situation they're in.\n\nIn the context of the employee expecting the boss to be consistent, this could mean that the employee is attributing the boss's behavior to their personality or character, assuming that the boss is just a consistent person by nature. The employee might not be considering that the boss's behavior could vary based on different situations or pressures at work. So, this seems like a possible explanation for why the employee expects more consistency than is warranted.\n\nOption D: Self-verification theory.\n\nThis theory suggests that people have a desire to confirm their existing self-views, whether they are positive or negative. People seek feedback that verifies their self-concept and may even prefer information that confirms their self-image over information that contradicts it. While this can influence how people perceive themselves and seek validation, it doesn't directly explain why an employee would expect consistency in their boss's behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the fundamental attribution bias seems to be the most fitting explanation. It accounts for the employee's tendency to attribute the boss's behavior to stable, dispositional factors rather than considering situational influences that might cause inconsistency in behavior.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check each option against the scenario.\n\n- Overjustification hypothesis: Relates to motivation and rewards, not directly to perceiving consistency in behavior.\n\n- Self-serving bias: Concerns how people attribute their own successes and failures, not how they perceive others' behavior.\n\n- Fundamental attribution bias: Directly relates to attributing others' behavior to dispositional factors and ignoring situational contexts, which could lead to expecting more consistency than is warranted.\n\n- Self-verification theory: Focuses on individuals seeking to confirm their own self-views, not on perceiving consistency in others.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: fundamental attribution bias.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
