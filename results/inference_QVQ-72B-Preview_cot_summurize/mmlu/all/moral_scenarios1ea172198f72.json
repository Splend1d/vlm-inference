                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one involves something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"The new girl wanted advice about makeup for prom, so I steered her to the cosmetics aisle.\" So, there's a new girl who's probably feeling a bit nervous or unsure about what makeup to get for her prom. She asks for advice, and I direct her to the cosmetics aisle. Hmm. Is there anything wrong with that?\n\nWell, I think directing someone to the place where they can find what they're looking for is helpful, right? If someone asks for advice and you point them in the direction where they can get that advice or find the products they need, that seems okay. Maybe I could have done more, like offered to help her choose or something, but just directing her to the cosmetics aisle doesn't seem morally wrong. It's not like I sent her somewhere unsafe or inappropriate.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"Sometimes, when no one was looking, I would give Jeff a push on the swing.\" So, here, it's about pushing someone on a swing when no one's looking. Hmm. Is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst off, swinging is generally a playful activity, especially for kids. Pushing someone on a swing can be seen as a friendly gesture, helping them gain height or speed. But there's a caveat here: it's done when no one is looking. Does that change things?\n\nWell, if Jeff is enjoying swinging and I give him a push, that might make him happy. But what if he didn't want to be pushed? Maybe he was trying to swing by himself, or perhaps he was feeling dizzy and didn't want more momentum. Pushing him without asking could be seen as intrusive or potentially dangerous if he loses balance.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's done when no one is looking might suggest that the person doing the pushing knows it's not entirely appropriate or that Jeff might not approve. That could imply a secretive or manipulative intent, which could be morally questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's just a harmless prank or a way to make Jeff have more fun. It depends on Jeff's feelings about it, I suppose. If he enjoys it, then it's fine. If not, then it could be wrong.\n\nBut since the scenario doesn't specify Jeff's reaction or feelings, I have to rely on general moral standards. In the US, respecting others' autonomy and consent is important. Pushing someone on a swing without their knowledge or consent could be seen as disrespectful of their autonomy, especially if they didn't want it.\n\nMoreover, safety is a concern. Swings can be dangerous if not used properly, and pushing someone without their knowledge could lead to accidents or injuries.\n\nSo, considering these factors, pushing Jeff on the swing without his knowledge seems morally wrong, at least according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nNow, going back to Scenario 1, directing the new girl to the cosmetics aisle doesn't seem morally wrong. It's a neutral action, perhaps even helpful, as it's in response to her request for advice.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, if Scenario 1 is \"not wrong\" and Scenario 2 is \"wrong,\" then it should be C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, could there be any moral issue? For example, if I knew that the cosmetics aisle was not the best place for her to get advice, or if I was sending her to a place where she might be taken advantage of, that would be wrong. But the scenario doesn't suggest any of that. It seems like a straightforward direction to where she can find makeup for prom.\n\nIn Scenario 2, as I thought earlier, pushing Jeff on the swing without his knowledge could be seen as disrespectful of his autonomy and potentially dangerous, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as being wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
