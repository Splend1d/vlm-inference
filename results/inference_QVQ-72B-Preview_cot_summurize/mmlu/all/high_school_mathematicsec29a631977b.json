                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here: I need to find the probability of getting a pair when I draw three cards from a standard 52-card deck. Now, in this context, a \"pair\" means that two of the cards have the same rank, but the third one is different. So, like, say, two 6s and then an 8, something like that. But not three of a kind, like three 9s, which wouldn't count as a pair.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. So, a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits and 13 ranks: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, king. Each rank has 4 cards, one from each suit.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 is the combination of 52 choose 3. I think that's how you calculate the total number of possible outcomes in probability when order doesn't matter. So, combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, C(52, 3) = 52! / (3!(52 - 3)!) = 52! / (6 * 49!) = (52 * 51 * 50) / 6, because 52! divided by 52 - 3, which is 49!, and then divided by 3!.\n\nWait, actually, 52! is 52 * 51 * 50 * 49!, so when you divide by 49!, it cancels out, and then divide by 3! Which is 6. So, yes, it's (52 * 51 * 50) / 6.\n\nLet me calculate that. 52 * 51 is 2652, times 50 is 132,600, divided by 6 is 22,100. So, there are 22,100 possible ways to choose 3 cards from 52.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these combinations form a pair, meaning exactly two cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. One way is to calculate the number of ways to get two cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank, and then divide that by the total number of possible 3-card combinations.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the third card is not of the same rank as the pair. So, for example, if I have two 6s, the third card can't be another 6; it has to be of a different rank.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to choose the rank for the pair. There are 13 ranks to choose from, since there are aces through kings.\n\nOnce I've chosen the rank for the pair, I need to choose 2 out of the 4 cards of that rank. So, for each rank, there are C(4, 2) ways to choose which two cards to pick.\n\nC(4, 2) is 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3 * 2!) / (2 * 1) = 6. So, 6 ways to choose the two cards of the pair.\n\nThen, I need to choose the third card, but it has to be of a different rank. There are 12 other ranks left, since the third card can't be of the same rank as the pair.\n\nFor each of those 12 ranks, there are 4 cards. So, the number of ways to choose the third card is 12 * 4 = 48.\n\nWait a minute, but this seems a bit too simplistic. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the way I initially thought about it might be missing something. Specifically, it might be double-counting or undercounting certain cases.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe calculate the total number of ways to have exactly two cards of the same rank and one of a different rank.\n\nFirst, choose the rank for the pair. There are 13 ranks to choose from.\n\nThen, choose 2 out of the 4 cards of that rank. As I said, C(4, 2) = 6 ways.\n\nThen, choose a different rank for the third card. There are 12 remaining ranks.\n\nThen, choose 1 out of the 4 cards of that rank. So, 4 ways.\n\nSo, total number of ways to form a pair would be 13 * 6 * 12 * 4.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check.\n\nActually, no. Because for each rank chosen for the pair, there are 6 ways to choose the pair, and then 12 ranks to choose for the third card, each with 4 cards.\n\nSo, 13 (ranks) * 6 (ways to choose the pair) * 12 (remaining ranks) * 4 (ways to choose the third card) should be correct.\n\nLet me calculate that: 13 * 6 = 78, times 12 is 936, times 4 is 3,744.\n\nSo, there are 3,744 ways to form a pair.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards is 22,100, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3,744 / 22,100.\n\nLet me simplify that fraction.\n\nFirst, see if both numbers are divisible by 4. 3,744 \u00f7 4 = 936, and 22,100 \u00f7 4 = 5,525. So, 936 / 5,525.\n\nIs 936 divisible by, say, 3? 9 + 3 + 6 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so yes. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 936 \u00f7 3 = 312, and 5,525 \u00f7 3 = 1,841.666..., but wait, 5,525 divided by 3 shouldn't be a whole number, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, 5,525 \u00f7 3 is approximately 1,841.666, which isn't an integer, so perhaps 5,525 isn't divisible by 3. But 936 is divisible by 3, so maybe I need to check my division.\n\nWait, 5,525 divided by 3: let's see, 3 times 1,841 is 5,523, which leaves a remainder of 2. So, indeed, it's not divisible by 3. That means I can't simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 936 and 5,525.\n\nLet me see, factors of 936: 2, 2, 2, 3, 13 (since 936 \u00f7 2 = 468, \u00f7 2 = 234, \u00f7 2 = 117, \u00f7 3 = 39, \u00f7 13 = 3).\n\nFactors of 5,525: let's see, it's divisible by 5 (since it ends with 5), so 5,525 \u00f7 5 = 1,105.\n\n1,105 \u00f7 5 = 221.\n\n221 \u00f7 13 = 17.\n\nSo, factors are 5, 5, 13, 17.\n\nSo, no common factors between 936 and 5,525, except for 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form: 936/5,525.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't match any of the given options. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nEarlier, I calculated the total number of ways to choose 3 cards as C(52, 3) = 22,100.\n\nThen, number of ways to form a pair: 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3,744.\n\nBut 3,744 / 22,100 doesn't simplify to 936 / 5,525. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the total number of ways to choose 3 cards.\n\nLet me recalculate C(52, 3):\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * 49!) = (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (52 * 51 * 50) / 6.\n\nLet's compute that: 52 * 51 = 2,652; times 50 is 132,600; divided by 6 is 22,100. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the number of ways to form a pair: 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3,744.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that the third card can be of any rank except the one chosen for the pair, but I think that's already accounted for by choosing one of the 12 remaining ranks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of combinations.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nFirst, choose the rank for the pair: C(13, 1) = 13.\n\nThen, choose 2 out of the 4 cards of that rank: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nThen, choose the rank for the third card: C(12, 1) = 12.\n\nThen, choose 1 out of the 4 cards of that rank: C(4, 1) = 4.\n\nSo, total number of ways: 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3,744, as before.\n\nNow, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards is C(52, 3) = 22,100.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3,744 / 22,100.\n\nBut this fraction doesn't match any of the given options directly. Maybe I need to simplify it differently.\n\nLet me see: 3,744 / 22,100.\n\nBoth numerator and denominator are divisible by 16. Let's try dividing both by 16.\n\n3,744 \u00f7 16 = 234.\n\n22,100 \u00f7 16 = 1,381.25, which isn't an integer. Hmm, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide by 8.\n\n3,744 \u00f7 8 = 468.\n\n22,100 \u00f7 8 = 2,762.5, still not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, divide by 4.\n\n3,744 \u00f7 4 = 936.\n\n22,100 \u00f7 4 = 5,525.\n\nNow, 936 / 5,525.\n\nLet me see if these numbers have any common factors.\n\n936 factors: 2, 2, 2, 3, 13.\n\n5,525 factors: 5, 5, 13, 17.\n\nSo, the only common factor is 13.\n\nTherefore, dividing numerator and denominator by 13: 936 \u00f7 13 = 72, and 5,525 \u00f7 13 = 425.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 72 / 425.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 72 / 425.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 72 / 425.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the probability step by step, considering the order in which the cards are drawn.\n\nSo, suppose I draw the first card. It can be any card, so the probability is 52/52 = 1.\n\nThen, to get a pair, the second card needs to match the first card's rank. There are 3 other cards that match the first card's rank out of the remaining 51 cards.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a pair so far is 1 * (3/51) = 3/51 = 1/17.\n\nBut wait, I also need to make sure that the third card is not of the same rank as the pair.\n\nSo, after drawing two cards of the same rank, there are 50 cards left, and 48 of them are not of the same rank as the pair (since there are 4 cards of each rank, and I've already drawn 2).\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a third card that is not of the same rank is 48/50 = 24/25.\n\nSo, overall probability would be (1) * (3/51) * (48/50) = (3/51) * (48/50).\n\nLet's calculate that: 3/51 * 48/50 = (3 * 48) / (51 * 50) = 144 / 2,550.\n\nSimplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 6: 144 \u00f7 6 = 24, and 2,550 \u00f7 6 = 425.\n\nSo, 24 / 425.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier, which was 72 / 425.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent. Where did I go wrong?\n\nOh, I see. In this approach, I'm considering the probability of drawing two cards of the same rank and then a third card of a different rank, but in the first approach, I was calculating the total number of ways to form a pair and then dividing by the total number of possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I overcounted because the order in which the cards are drawn matters in this calculation.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered choosing the rank for the pair, then choosing 2 out of 4 cards of that rank, then choosing a different rank for the third card, and then choosing 1 out of 4 cards of that rank.\n\nBut in this approach, I'm considering the probability step by step, assuming that the first card is of a certain rank, the second card matches it, and the third card is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust for the different ways the pair can be formed in relation to the third card.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the third card can be in any position, not necessarily the last one.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I assumed that the pair is the first two cards, and the third card is different. But actually, the pair can consist of any two out of the three cards.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to account for the different ways the pair can be arranged among the three cards.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, choose the rank for the pair: 13 ways.\n\nThen, choose 2 out of 4 cards of that rank: C(4, 2) = 6 ways.\n\nThen, choose the rank for the third card: 12 ways.\n\nThen, choose 1 out of 4 cards of that rank: 4 ways.\n\nBut now, the pair can be in any two of the three positions.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the pair among the three cards is C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nTherefore, total number of favorable outcomes is 13 * C(4, 2) * 12 * C(4, 1) * C(3, 2) = 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 * 3 = 10,632.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because that's larger than the total number of possible combinations, which is only 22,100.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcounting by multiplying by C(3, 2).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the pair can be in any two positions, and adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me try calculating the probability step by step, considering the different orders.\n\nFirst, choose the position of the pair among the three cards. There are C(3, 2) = 3 ways to choose which two cards form the pair.\n\nThen, for each of these arrangements:\n\n- Choose the rank for the pair: 13 ways.\n\n- Choose 2 out of 4 cards of that rank: C(4, 2) = 6 ways.\n\n- Choose the rank for the third card: 12 ways.\n\n- Choose 1 out of 4 cards of that rank: C(4, 1) = 4 ways.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes is 3 * 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3 * 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3 * 13 * 6 * 48 = 3 * 13 * 288 = 39 * 288 = 11,112.\n\nWait, that's still larger than 22,100, which can't be right because the number of favorable outcomes can't exceed the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nI must be overcounting somewhere.\n\nPerhaps the error is in multiplying by C(3, 2). Maybe the pair can be in any two positions, but that's already accounted for in the combination calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the pair is distinct from the single card, so the arrangement matters.\n\nWait, in combinations, order doesn't matter, but here, since we're dealing with pairs and singles, maybe I need to consider permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of ways to form a pair without considering the order of the pair within the three cards.\n\nWait, going back to my initial approach, where I calculated 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3,744, that seems correct because it accounts for choosing the rank for the pair, choosing two cards of that"
