Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I know that wedding anniversaries are celebrated in different ways, and sometimes there are traditional gifts associated with specific years. For example, I think the first anniversary is often paper, and then like, every five years or so, there's a different material.\n\nLet me see, the first anniversary is paper, that's a common one. Then, the fifth anniversary is supposed to be wood or something like that. And I think silver is for the 25th anniversary, is that right? Wait, maybe it's the 10th?\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused now. I thought silver was for the 25th, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me try to recall.\n\nI remember that the 10th anniversary is usually tin or aluminum, and the 20th is supposed to be china. Is that right? Let me think about it differently.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern or a common theme in these anniversary gifts. For instance, paper at one year symbolizes the initial fragility of the relationship, and over time, the materials get stronger, like wood, then silver, and so on.\n\nFollowing that logic, the 20th anniversary would be a significant milestone, and china might make sense as it's durable and valuable.\n\nBut wait, option D is silver, which I thought was for the 25th anniversary. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nI think the 25th anniversary is indeed silver, as in silver jubilee or something like that. So maybe the 20th is different.\n\nLet me consider the options again: A. paper, B. leather, C. china, D. silver.\n\nPaper is definitely the first anniversary, so that can't be it.\n\nLeather might be for another year, maybe the third or something?\n\nActually, I think leather is for the third anniversary, but I'm not sure.\n\nChina seems plausible for the 20th, and silver for the 25th.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cultures, silver is for the 20th, but I think generally, silver is associated with the 25th anniversary.\n\nMaybe I should think about it in terms of traditional practices or cultural significance.\n\nI recall that in some traditions, each anniversary corresponds to a specific material that represents the strength and durability of the marriage at that point.\n\nFor example, paper at one year symbolizes that the marriage is still forming, and china at 20 years would suggest a well-established and refined relationship.\n\nThat makes sense, but I still need to confirm which one is correct for the 20th anniversary.\n\nLet me try to recall if there's a standard list of traditional anniversary gifts by year.\n\nI think there is a traditional list, and a modern one as well, but for this question, I assume it's referring to the traditional one.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the traditional gifts are:\n\n1st - Paper\n\n2nd - Cotton\n\n3rd - Leather\n\n4th - Fruit or Flowers\n\n5th - Wood\n\n10th - Tin or Aluminum\n\n15th - Crystal\n\n20th - China\n\n25th - Silver\n\n30th - Pearl\n\n40th - Ruby\n\n50th - Gold\n\n60th - Diamond\n\nSo, according to this, the 20th anniversary is china.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check another source.\n\nI think in some cultures or perhaps in modern interpretations, the gifts might vary slightly, but generally, china is accepted for the 20th anniversary.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might refer to different lists, like the modern or the traditional ones, which could lead to confusion.\n\nIn the traditional list, china is indeed the gift for the 20th anniversary, while silver is for the 25th.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. china.\n\nWait a minute, option C is china, which matches what I've recalled.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could be correct.\n\nOption A is paper, which is definitely the first anniversary.\n\nOption B is leather, which is typically the third anniversary.\n\nOption D is silver, which is the 25th anniversary.\n\nTherefore, none of these are correct for the 20th anniversary, except for option C, china.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the traditional 20th wedding anniversary gift is china.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. china}} \\]"
