Let's see, the question is asking what the aim of universal jurisdiction is, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, option A says that its aim is to establish certain offences as universal. Hmm, that seems a bit circular. Like, universal jurisdiction is about applying universal principles, but I think it's more about the idea that some crimes are so heinous that any country can prosecute them, regardless of where they were committed. So, maybe not the best answer.\n\nOption B says its aim is to deter the commission of certain international crimes. That makes sense. If countries can prosecute these crimes no matter where they happen, it might make people think twice before committing them, knowing they can be caught anywhere.\n\nOption C states that its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes. This seems closely related to what I understand about universal jurisdiction. It's about giving all countries the right to prosecute certain crimes, like piracy or genocide, even if they didn't happen within their borders.\n\nLastly, option D says its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of all international crimes. This seems too broad. Not all international crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction. There must be specific crimes that qualify for this principle.\n\nSo, comparing these options, I think option C is the most accurate. It specifies that universal jurisdiction provides all states the right to prosecute particular crimes, which aligns with what I know about this concept.\n\nWait a minute, but option B is about deterrence, which is a goal, but maybe not the primary aim. The primary aim is probably more about establishing the legal framework to prosecute certain crimes, which would be option C. Deterrence might be a consequence, but not the main objective.\n\nOption A seems too vague, and option D is too encompassing. So, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Universal jurisdiction is a principle in international law that allows states to prosecute individuals for certain crimes, regardless of where the crime was committed and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. The crimes typically subject to universal jurisdiction are those considered to be of concern to the international community as a whole, such as piracy, slavery, genocide, war crimes, and perhaps torture.\n\nSo, yes, the aim is to provide jurisdiction to all states for these specific crimes, which matches option C. Option B is more about the desired outcome\u2014deterrence\u2014but that's not the direct aim of the jurisdiction itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
