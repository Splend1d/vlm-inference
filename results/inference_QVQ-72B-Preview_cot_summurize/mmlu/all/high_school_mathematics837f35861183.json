                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"Express as a common fraction the reciprocal of $0.\\overline{7}$.\" And then there are some multiple-choice options, but I want to make sure I understand how to do this step by step without just guessing.\n\nFirst off, what does $0.\\overline{7}$ mean? The bar over the 7 means that the digit 7 repeats indefinitely. So, $0.\\overline{7}$ is the same as 0.7777..., where the 7 goes on forever.\n\nNow, I need to find the reciprocal of this number. Reciprocal means 1 divided by that number. So, reciprocal of $0.\\overline{7}$ is 1 / $0.\\overline{7}$.\n\nBut dealing with repeating decimals can be tricky. I remember that repeating decimals can be expressed as fractions, and maybe that will help here.\n\nLet me try to express $0.\\overline{7}$ as a fraction first.\n\nLet's let x = $0.\\overline{7}$. So, x = 0.7777...\n\nNow, if I multiply both sides by 10, I get 10x = 7.7777...\n\nThen, if I subtract the original equation x = 0.7777... from this new equation, I get:\n\n10x - x = 7.7777... - 0.7777...\n\nWhich simplifies to 9x = 7.\n\nSo, x = 7/9.\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{7}$ is equal to 7/9.\n\nNow, I need the reciprocal of that, which is 1 / (7/9). To divide by a fraction, I can multiply by its reciprocal. So, 1 / (7/9) = 1 * (9/7) = 9/7.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\frac{7}{2}\n\nB. \\frac{7}{9}\n\nC. \\frac{9}{2}\n\nD. \\frac{9}{7}\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. \\frac{9}{7}.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the decimal $0.\\overline{7}$ as 0.7 repeating forever, which is equivalent to 7/9, as I just found. Then, the reciprocal would indeed be 9/7.\n\nAnother way: if I consider that 1 / 0.7 repeating is the same as 1 divided by 0.777..., which is the same as 1 / (7/9), which again is 9/7.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that I might have made a mistake in assuming that $0.\\overline{7}$ is 7/9?\n\nLet me verify that again.\n\nLet x = $0.\\overline{7}$.\n\nThen, 10x = 7.777...\n\nSubtracting x from 10x: 9x = 7.\n\nSo, x = 7/9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, reciprocal of 7/9 is 9/7.\n\nI think the answer is D. \\frac{9}{7}.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach that might lead to a different conclusion.\n\nPerhaps using infinite series. $0.\\overline{7}$ can be written as an infinite geometric series:\n\n0.7777... = 7/10 + 7/100 + 7/1000 + ...\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nHere, a = 7/10, and r = 1/10.\n\nSo, S = (7/10) / (1 - 1/10) = (7/10) / (9/10) = 7/9.\n\nAgain, confirming that $0.\\overline{7}$ = 7/9.\n\nThen, reciprocal is 9/7.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 1 / (7/9) = 9/7, directly.\n\nI can't see any other way that would lead to a different answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D. \\frac{9}{7}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}} \\]"
