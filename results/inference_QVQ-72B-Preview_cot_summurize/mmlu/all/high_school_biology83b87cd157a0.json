                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this question about a population of birds that's been blown to an isolated island by a hurricane and started a new colony. The question is asking what the gene pool of this new population is likely to reflect in terms of evolutionary processes. The options are directed mutation, genetic drift, adaptive radiation, and disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. A small group of birds from a larger population is transported to a new location, probably with a limited number of individuals. This scenario sounds like a founder effect, where a small number of individuals establish a new population in a new area, leading to genetic changes in the new population compared to the original one.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Directed mutation: This is a bit of a tricky one. I think it refers to mutations that are specifically aimed at producing beneficial traits. However, in standard evolutionary theory, mutations are generally considered random and not directed towards a particular outcome. So, I'm not sure if this is the best fit for the scenario.\n\nB. Genetic drift: This is the change in allele frequencies in a population due to random sampling events. It's particularly significant in small populations. Since the new colony on the island started with a small number of birds, genetic drift would likely play a bigger role here compared to larger populations.\n\nC. Adaptive radiation: This is a process where a single species gives rise to multiple new species, each adapted to different niches in a new environment. It often occurs when a species moves into an area that was previously unoccupied or has many available niches.\n\nD. Disruptive selection: This is a type of natural selection where intermediate forms are selected against, and extreme forms are favored. This can lead to increased variation in the population.\n\nGiven the scenario, the population started small, and it's on an isolated island, which suggests that it's a separate group from the main population. The gene pool of this new population would be influenced by the genetic composition of the founding birds and the random events that occur in a small population, like genetic drift.\n\nAdaptive radiation might occur over time as the birds adapt to different niches on the island, but that seems like a process that would happen after the initial establishment of the population. Similarly, disruptive selection might be a factor in the new environment, but it's more about how the population adapts over time rather than the initial setup.\n\nDirected mutation doesn't seem to fit well here because mutations are generally considered random, not directed towards a specific outcome.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate factor affecting the gene pool of this new population is likely genetic drift, due to the founder effect and the small population size.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Genetic drift.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
