                    "text": "So I have this problem here about proportions. It asks which pair of ratios can form a proportion. The options are:\n\nA. 2 over 5 and 8 over 10\n\nB. 2 over 5 and 10 over 15\n\nC. 2 over 5 and 4 over 25\n\nD. 2 over 5 and 6 over 15\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what a proportion is. From what I recall, a proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. So, if I have two fractions that are equal, like a/b = c/d, then they form a proportion.\n\nMy task is to check which of these pairs of ratios are equal.\n\nLet's start with option A: 2/5 and 8/10.\n\nI can simplify 8/10 to see if it equals 2/5.\n\n8 divided by 2 is 4, and 10 divided by 5 is 2, so 8/10 simplifies to 4/5.\n\nWait, that doesn't equal 2/5. 4/5 is greater than 2/5.\n\nSo, option A is not a proportion.\n\nNext, option B: 2/5 and 10/15.\n\nLet's simplify 10/15.\n\n10 and 15 are both divisible by 5.\n\n10 \u00f7 5 = 2, 15 \u00f7 5 = 3, so 10/15 simplifies to 2/3.\n\nIs 2/5 equal to 2/3? No, because 2/3 is larger than 2/5.\n\nSo, option B is also not a proportion.\n\nOption C: 2/5 and 4/25.\n\nHmm, let's see.\n\n4/25... 4 divided by 25 is 0.16, and 2 divided by 5 is 0.4.\n\n0.16 is not equal to 0.4, so no.\n\nAlternatively, to check if they form a proportion, I can cross-multiply.\n\nCross-multiplying: 2 * 25 = 5 * 4.\n\nIs 50 equal to 20? No.\n\nSo, option C is not a proportion.\n\nLastly, option D: 2/5 and 6/15.\n\nSimplify 6/15.\n\n6 and 15 are both divisible by 3.\n\n6 \u00f7 3 = 2, 15 \u00f7 3 = 5, so 6/15 simplifies to 2/5.\n\nSo, 2/5 equals 2/5.\n\nYes, that means they form a proportion.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying: 2 * 15 = 5 * 6.\n\nIs 30 equal to 30? Yes.\n\nSo, option D is a proportion.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the others to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOption A: 2/5 and 8/10.\n\nSimplified, 8/10 is 4/5, which is not equal to 2/5.\n\nNot a proportion.\n\nOption B: 2/5 and 10/15.\n\n10/15 simplifies to 2/3, which is not equal to 2/5.\n\nNot a proportion.\n\nOption C: 2/5 and 4/25.\n\nCross-multiplying, 2*25=50 and 5*4=20. 50\u226020.\n\nNot a proportion.\n\nOption D: 2/5 and 6/15.\n\n6/15 simplifies to 2/5, which matches 2/5.\n\nProportion.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying, 2*15=30 and 5*6=30. 30=30.\n\nYes, proportion.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
