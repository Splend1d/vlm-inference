                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what happens when a psychologist is subpoenaed to testify at a deposition about a current therapy client. The options are:\n\nA. must testify about the client as requested.\n\nB. must appear at the deposition as requested.\n\nC. must provide the requested documents.\n\nD. can expect to receive a court order within 60 days.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a subpoena is. A subpoena is a legal document that orders someone to appear in court or to provide specific documents. So, in this case, it's asking the psychologist to testify at a deposition.\n\nA deposition is part of the pre-trial discovery process where witnesses are questioned under oath outside of the courtroom. The testimony can be used in court later.\n\nNow, the psychologist has been asked to testify about a current therapy client. That sounds sensitive because therapy sessions are generally confidential. There are laws and ethical guidelines that protect client confidentiality.\n\nSo, does the psychologist have to just go ahead and testify about the client? Option A says \"must testify about the client as requested.\" But I think there might be more to it due to confidentiality ethics and laws.\n\nOption B says \"must appear at the deposition as requested.\" This seems straightforward, but again, what about the confidentiality of the client's information?\n\nOption C is \"must provide the requested documents.\" Similar to testifying, providing documents about a client could also breach confidentiality.\n\nOption D says \"can expect to receive a court order within 60 days.\" I'm not sure about the timeline here. A subpoena is usually accompanied by a court order, but I don't know about the 60-day part.\n\nI think I need to look into the legal and ethical obligations of psychologists when it comes to subpoenas and client confidentiality.\n\nI recall that psychologists are bound by ethical principles, like the American Psychological Association's (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, which emphasize the importance of confidentiality unless there are specific exceptions.\n\nOne of the exceptions is when required by law. So, if a psychologist receives a subpoena, it's a legal requirement to comply, but they also have to consider the confidentiality of their clients.\n\nMaybe the psychologist needs to balance their legal obligations with their ethical responsibilities. Perhaps they need to seek to protect client confidentiality unless the court orders otherwise.\n\nI found that in some cases, psychologists may move to quash the subpoena if they believe it violates client confidentiality. Moving to quash means asking the court to cancel or modify the subpoena.\n\nAlternatively, they might try to limit the scope of the testimony or documents to only what is necessary and relevant to the case.\n\nSo, going back to the options, it seems that the psychologist must appear at the deposition as requested (Option B), but they might not necessarily have to provide all the requested information or documents without first addressing the confidentiality concerns.\n\nOption A says \"must testify about the client as requested,\" but perhaps they can testify to some extent but not disclose confidential information without a court order specifically authorizing it.\n\nOption C is \"must provide the requested documents.\" Again, confidentiality might prevent them from doing so without proper legal authorization.\n\nOption D seems unrelated to the immediate situation of being subpoenaed. Receiving a court order within 60 days doesn't directly address what the psychologist must do upon receiving the subpoena.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is Option B: must appear at the deposition as requested. However, they would likely take steps to protect client confidentiality while complying with the legal requirement to appear.\n\nBut I'm a bit torn because I know that psychologists have an ethical duty to maintain confidentiality unless there's a legal duty to disclose. So, perhaps they must appear but can refuse to answer specific questions that would breach confidentiality unless there's a valid court order compelling them to do so.\n\nLet me see if I can find more specific information about this scenario.\n\nUpon researching, I found that when a psychologist receives a subpoena to testify, they are generally required to appear unless the subpoena is quashed or modified by a court. However, they can assert privileges, such as the psychotherapist-patient privilege, to protect confidential communications.\n\nThis privilege allows the psychologist to refuse to disclose confidential communications made during therapy unless the client waives that privilege.\n\nSo, in practice, the psychologist would appear at the deposition but could refuse to answer questions that would reveal confidential information unless the client has waived the privilege or there's a court order requiring disclosure.\n\nGiven that, Option B seems the most accurate: the psychologist must appear at the deposition as requested. What they can or cannot say once there depends on the specific circumstances and legal protections in place.\n\nOptions A and C suggest that the psychologist must testify about the client or provide documents without consideration for confidentiality, which isn't accurate due to ethical and legal protections.\n\nOption D doesn't seem relevant to the immediate situation of being subpoenaed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: must appear at the deposition as requested.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
