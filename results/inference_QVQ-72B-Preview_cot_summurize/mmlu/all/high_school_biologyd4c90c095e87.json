                    "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these phyla have organisms with a true coelom. The options are Platyhelminthes, Porifera, Annelida, and Nematoda. I remember that a coelom is like an internal body cavity that's lined with mesoderm and is completely enclosed. It's important because it allows for more complex organ systems.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these phyla is known for.\n\nStarting with Platyhelminthes, which are the flatworms. I think they don't have a coelom. Instead, they have a pseudocoelom or maybe just a solid mesoderm without a true coelom. Wait, no, actually, Platyhelminthes are acelomates, meaning they lack a coelom altogether. So, they don't have a true coelom.\n\nNext is Porifera, which are the sponges. Sponges are pretty simple organisms; they don't have tissues or organs as such. They have pores and channels for water to pass through, but they don't have a coelom. So, probably not here either.\n\nThen there's Annelida, the segmented worms, like earthworms and leeches. I think these do have a true coelom. Let me confirm that. Annelids have a well-developed coelomic cavity that surrounds their internal organs, providing space for them to function properly. So, yes, Annelida have a true coelom.\n\nLastly, Nematoda, which are the roundworms. I recall that nematodes have a pseudocoelom, which is a body cavity that's not entirely lined with mesoderm. It's sort of like a coelom, but not quite the same. So, they don't have a true coelom.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be C. Annelida.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let's think about it again. Platyhelminthes are acelomates, Porifera have no coelom, Annelida have a true coelom, and Nematoda have a pseudocoelom. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nJust to double-check, what exactly defines a true coelom? It's a body cavity that's completely lined with mesoderm and is separate from the digestive tract. It provides space for internal organs and allows for more efficient circulation and nervous system development.\n\nIn Annelida, the coelom is divided into segments, corresponding to their segmented bodies, which makes sense for their structure and function.\n\nSo, I'm confident that Annelida is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Annelida}} \\]"
