                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a strip of magnesium metal being oxidized by a solution of chromium(III) nitrate. We need to find the net ionic equation that correctly represents this reaction.\n\nFirst, let's recall what oxidation and reduction are. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. In this scenario, magnesium is being oxidized, which means it's losing electrons, and the chromium(III) ion is being reduced, gaining electrons.\n\nThe given options are a bit messy, so I need to sort through them carefully.\n\nOption A: Mg(s) + Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + Cr3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)\n\nWait a minute, if magnesium is being oxidized, it should form Mg2+, which is correct. But chromium(III) nitrate is Cr(NO3)3, which dissociates into Cr3+ and 3 NO3-. So, in solution, we have Cr3+ and NO3- ions.\n\nIn the reaction, Mg is oxidized to Mg2+, and Cr3+ is reduced to Cr(s). But in option A, Cr3+ is still present on the right side, which doesn't make sense because it should be reduced to Cr(s).\n\nAlso, the nitrate ions (NO3-) are spectator ions and shouldn't appear in the net ionic equation. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+ \u2192 3Mg2+ + 2Cr(s)\n\nThis looks better. Magnesium is being oxidized to Mg2+, and Cr3+ is being reduced to Cr(s). Let's check the stoichiometry.\n\nBalancing the equation:\n\n- Magnesium: 3 atoms on both sides.\n\n- Chromium: 2 atoms on both sides.\n\n- Charge: On the left, 3(0) + 2(+3) = +6; on the right, 3(+2) + 2(0) = +6.\n\nSo, the charges are balanced as well. This seems like a plausible net ionic equation.\n\nOption C: Mg(s) + Cr3+ \u2192 Mg2+ + Cr(s)\n\nThis is similar to option B but not balanced. We have one Mg reacting with one Cr3+, but the charges don't add up.\n\nOn the left: Mg(0) + Cr3+(+3) = +3\n\nOn the right: Mg2+(+2) + Cr(0) = +2\n\nSo, there's a charge imbalance of one unit. Therefore, this can't be correct.\n\nOption D: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 3Mg2+(aq) + 2Cr(s) + NO3-(aq)\n\nHmm, this seems off. First, Cr(NO3)3 is already dissociated in solution into Cr3+ and 3 NO3- ions. So, writing it as Cr(NO3)3 in the net ionic equation is incorrect because we should be considering the ions present in solution.\n\nAlso, the nitrate ions are spectator ions and shouldn't appear in the net ionic equation. Additionally, the equation isn't balanced.\n\nLet me try to balance it:\n\n- Magnesium: 3 atoms on both sides.\n\n- Chromium: 2 atoms on both sides.\n\n- Nitrate: 6 NO3- on the left (from 2Cr(NO3)3) but only 1 NO3- on the right. That doesn't balance.\n\nMoreover, since NO3- is a spectator ion, it shouldn't be present in the net ionic equation.\n\nSo, option D is incorrect.\n\nComparing back to option B, which is balanced and shows the oxidation of Mg to Mg2+ and reduction of Cr3+ to Cr(s), I think option B is the correct net ionic equation representing the reaction.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the half-reactions:\n\nOxidation half-reaction:\n\nMg(s) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + 2e-\n\nReduction half-reaction:\n\nCr3+(aq) + 3e- \u2192 Cr(s)\n\nTo balance the electrons, we need to multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2:\n\n3[Mg(s) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + 2e-] \u2192 3Mg(s) \u2192 3Mg2+(aq) + 6e-\n\n2[Cr3+(aq) + 3e- \u2192 Cr(s)] \u2192 2Cr3+(aq) + 6e- \u2192 2Cr(s)\n\nAdding both half-reactions:\n\n3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+(aq) \u2192 3Mg2+(aq) + 2Cr(s)\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
