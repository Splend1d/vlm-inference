                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out why this student from Sudan, who just arrived in Britain, is having abdominal cramps and diarrhea after drinking milk. It sounds like he might have a problem digesting milk, specifically lactose, which is the sugar found in milk.\n\nFirst, let's understand what lactose is and how it's digested. Lactose is a disaccharide that needs to be broken down into glucose and galactose by an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme is usually present in the small intestine. If someone doesn't have enough lactase, lactose can't be properly digested, and it may cause gastrointestinal issues like cramps and diarrhea.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Bacterial and yeast overgrowth in the small intestine: While overgrowth can lead to digestive issues, it's not directly related to lactose intolerance. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nB. Lack of pancreatic amylase: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starches, not lactose. So, this shouldn't directly cause problems with milk digestion.\n\nC. Lack of small intestinal lactase: This directly relates to lactose digestion. If the student doesn't have enough lactase, he can't break down lactose properly, which can lead to the symptoms he's experiencing.\n\nD. Lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase: This enzyme breaks down sucrose and maltose, not lactose. So, again, this shouldn't directly affect lactose digestion.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most plausible cause of his problem. Lack of small intestinal lactase would lead to undigested lactose in the gut, which can cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea, especially after consuming milk.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any other context that might make another option more likely. For instance, if the student had a recent illness that could lead to bacterial or yeast overgrowth, option A might be relevant. However, the scenario doesn't mention any recent illnesses or conditions that would suggest that.\n\nAlso, pancreatic amylase is involved in breaking down carbohydrates like starches, not lactose. So, unless there's something specific about his diet or pancreatic function, option B doesn't seem directly relevant.\n\nSimilarly, sucrase-isomaltase is responsible for breaking down sucrose and maltose, which are different sugars from lactose. So, again, this wouldn't directly cause issues with milk consumption.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that lactose intolerance is common in many adult populations, especially in parts of Africa and Asia, due to genetic factors. Since the student is from Sudan, it's possible that he has primary lactase non-persistence, which is a normal decrease in lactase production after weaning.\n\nHowever, the scenario mentions that he has recently arrived in Britain, which might imply that he's been exposed to different types of food or perhaps different forms of milk that his system isn't used to. But even so, if he has lactose intolerance, consuming milk would still cause the same symptoms regardless of location.\n\nLet me think about whether there could be any secondary causes for lactose intolerance. For example, certain gastrointestinal infections or inflammatory conditions can temporarily reduce lactase production, leading to lactose intolerance. But again, the scenario doesn't mention any recent illnesses or conditions that would suggest that.\n\nAlso, pancreatic insufficiency can sometimes affect lactase production indirectly, but that seems less likely, and option B specifically mentions lack of pancreatic amylase, which, as I said earlier, is involved in starch digestion, not lactose.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple factors contributing to his symptoms. For instance, maybe he has both lactose intolerance and some form of intestinal overgrowth. But without more information, it's speculative to assume multiple issues.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most straightforward and direct cause of his symptoms after drinking milk is a lack of small intestinal lactase, leading to lactose intolerance.\n\nSo, my answer would be option C: lack of small intestinal lactase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
