                    "text": "Let's see here. Mr. Lucci has 5 bags of pens. Each bag has 19 black pens and 12 red pens. I need to find the total number of pens he put into the bags. So, first, I should figure out how many pens are in one bag and then multiply that by the number of bags.\n\nAlright, one bag has 19 black pens and 12 red pens. So, the total pens in one bag is 19 plus 12. Let me add those together. 19 plus 12. 19 plus 10 is 29, and then 29 plus 2 is 31. So, one bag has 31 pens.\n\nNow, there are 5 bags. So, I need to multiply the number of pens in one bag by the number of bags. That is, 5 times 31. Let me calculate that. 5 times 30 is 150, and then 5 times 1 is 5, so total 155 pens. So, the total number of pens is 155.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to see which expression represents this calculation.\n\nOption A is (5 \u00d7 19) + 12. Let's see, 5 times 19 is 95, and then adding 12 makes it 107. That's not equal to 155, so this can't be the correct expression.\n\nOption B is 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12). First, add 19 and 12, which is 31, then multiply by 5, which is 155. That matches my earlier calculation. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C is 5 + (19 \u00d7 12). First, 19 times 12. Let's calculate that. 19 times 10 is 190, and 19 times 2 is 38, so total 228. Then add 5, which makes 233. That's not 155, so this is incorrect.\n\nOption D is (5 + 19) \u00d7 12. First, add 5 and 19, which is 24, then multiply by 12. 24 times 12. 24 times 10 is 240, and 24 times 2 is 48, so total 288. That's not 155 either.\n\nSo, the only expression that matches my total of 155 pens is option B: 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12).\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check the other options quickly.\n\nOption A: (5 \u00d7 19) + 12 = 95 + 12 = 107 \u2260 155.\n\nOption C: 5 + (19 \u00d7 12) = 5 + 228 = 233 \u2260 155.\n\nOption D: (5 + 19) \u00d7 12 = 24 \u00d7 12 = 288 \u2260 155.\n\nYes, option B is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of distribution, multiplying the sum of pens per bag by the number of bags makes sense, which is exactly what option B does.\n\nSo, I'm confident that option B is the correct expression representing the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into the bags.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
