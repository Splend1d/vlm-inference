                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a reactor starting up where the number of neutrons doubles each minute, and it reaches one billion neutrons in 10 minutes. The question is asking when the number of neutrons reached half a billion. The options are 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 9 minutes.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on. So, the number of neutrons is doubling every minute. That means, if you have a certain number of neutrons at one minute, the next minute you'll have twice that amount, and so on.\n\nGiven that at 10 minutes, the number of neutrons is one billion, I need to find out when it was half a billion, which is 500 million.\n\nFirst, since it's doubling every minute, the number of neutrons at any minute can be represented as:\n\nNeutrons = Initial neutrons * (2)^time\n\nAnd we know that at time = 10 minutes, neutrons = 1,000,000,000.\n\nSo, 1,000,000,000 = Initial neutrons * 2^{10}\n\nFrom that, I can solve for Initial neutrons:\n\nInitial neutrons = 1,000,000,000 / 2^{10}\n\nNow, 2^{10} is 1024, so:\n\nInitial neutrons = 1,000,000,000 / 1024 \u2248 976,562.5\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because if you start with almost a million neutrons, and it doubles every minute to reach one billion in 10 minutes, but maybe that's correct. Let's check.\n\nBut actually, in exponential growth, starting with a small number and doubling each time, it's like the classic rice and chessboard problem, where even starting with a small number, it quickly becomes very large.\n\nBut let's focus on the question: when did the number of neutrons reach half a billion?\n\nSo, we need to find the time when neutrons = 500,000,000.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n500,000,000 = Initial neutrons * 2^{time}\n\nWe already have Initial neutrons \u2248 976,562.5\n\nSo, plugging that in:\n\n500,000,000 = 976,562.5 * 2^{time}\n\nLet's solve for time.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 976,562.5:\n\n500,000,000 / 976,562.5 = 2^{time}\n\nCalculating that:\n\n500,000,000 / 976,562.5 = 512\n\nSo, 2^{time} = 512\n\nNow, 2^{9} = 512\n\nSo, time = 9 minutes.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Did I do something wrong?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven that at time = 10 minutes, neutrons = 1,000,000,000\n\nAnd at time = 9 minutes, neutrons = 500,000,000\n\nThat makes sense because it's doubling every minute.\n\nBut let's confirm with the initial neutrons.\n\nInitial neutrons = 1,000,000,000 / 1024 \u2248 976,562.5\n\nThen at time = 1:\n\nNeutrons = 976,562.5 * 2 = 1,953,125\n\nTime = 2:\n\n1,953,125 * 2 = 3,906,250\n\nTime = 3:\n\n3,906,250 * 2 = 7,812,500\n\nAnd so on, up to time = 10:\n\n976,562.5 * 2^{10} = 976,562.5 * 1024 = 1,000,000,000\n\nAnd time = 9:\n\n976,562.5 * 2^{9} = 976,562.5 * 512 = 500,000,000\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the number of neutrons reached half a billion at 9 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 9 minutes.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since it's doubling every minute, the number of neutrons at each minute is:\n\nMinute 0: Initial neutrons\n\nMinute 1: 2 * Initial neutrons\n\nMinute 2: 4 * Initial neutrons\n\n...\n\nMinute n: Initial neutrons * 2^{n}\n\nAnd we know that at minute 10, neutrons = 1,000,000,000\n\nSo, Initial neutrons * 2^{10} = 1,000,000,000\n\nAnd at the time when neutrons = 500,000,000\n\nThat is, Initial neutrons * 2^{time} = 500,000,000\n\nSo, 2^{time} = 500,000,000 / Initial neutrons\n\nBut we have Initial neutrons = 1,000,000,000 / 2^{10} = 1,000,000,000 / 1024 = 976,562.5\n\nSo, 2^{time} = 500,000,000 / 976,562.5 = 512\n\nAnd 2^{9} = 512\n\nTherefore, time = 9 minutes.\n\nSame conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of half-life or doubling time.\n\nSince it's doubling every minute, the number of neutrons at any time is half of what it will be in the next minute.\n\nSo, if at 10 minutes it's 1,000,000,000, then at 9 minutes it's half of that, which is 500,000,000.\n\nAgain, confirming that it's 9 minutes.\n\nI think the answer is clearly D. 9 minutes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\nSuppose the doubling time isn't exactly one minute, but that's what the problem states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's decay or other factors, but the problem specifies that the number of neutrons doubles each minute during startup.\n\nSo, no, that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
