                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about process costing, and I need to find the cost per equivalent whole unit for April. Here's what I know:\n\n- No work in process on April 1.\n\n- 10,000 units were started during April.\n\n- 9,000 units were completed and transferred out.\n\n- The ending work in process is complete as to materials (100%) and 50% complete as to conversion.\n\n- Direct materials cost: $114,000.\n\n- Direct labor cost: $38,000.\n\n- Manufacturing overhead is assigned at 50% of direct materials.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total manufacturing costs for April. That includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.\n\nDirect materials are $114,000.\n\nDirect labor is $38,000.\n\nManufacturing overhead is 50% of direct materials, so that's 0.50 * $114,000 = $57,000.\n\nNow, total manufacturing costs = direct materials + direct labor + manufacturing overhead = $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $209,000.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many equivalent units were produced in April.\n\nSince there was no beginning work in process, and 10,000 units were started, with 9,000 completed and transferred out, that means the ending work in process is 10,000 - 9,000 = 1,000 units.\n\nNow, for materials, the ending work in process is 100% complete, so all 1,000 units have received their full complement of materials.\n\nFor conversion costs (which include direct labor and manufacturing overhead), the ending work in process is 50% complete.\n\nSo, equivalent units for materials:\n\nUnits completed and transferred out: 9,000\n\nEnding work in process: 1,000 units * 100% = 1,000 equivalent units\n\nTotal equivalent units for materials: 9,000 + 1,000 = 10,000 equivalent units\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs:\n\nUnits completed and transferred out: 9,000\n\nEnding work in process: 1,000 units * 50% = 500 equivalent units\n\nTotal equivalent units for conversion costs: 9,000 + 500 = 9,500 equivalent units\n\nNow, I need to allocate the total manufacturing costs to these equivalent units.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"cost per equivalent whole unit.\" I think this refers to the cost per whole unit completed, considering the equivalent units for both materials and conversion costs.\n\nFirst, let's allocate the costs.\n\nDirect materials cost is $114,000, and equivalent units for materials are 10,000.\n\nSo, cost per equivalent unit for materials: $114,000 / 10,000 = $11.40 per unit.\n\nDirect labor and manufacturing overhead are considered conversion costs.\n\nTotal conversion costs: direct labor + manufacturing overhead = $38,000 + $57,000 = $95,000.\n\nEquivalent units for conversion costs: 9,500.\n\nSo, cost per equivalent unit for conversion: $95,000 / 9,500 \u2248 $10 per unit.\n\nNow, the total cost per whole unit would be the sum of the cost per equivalent unit for materials and the cost per equivalent unit for conversion.\n\nSo, total cost per whole unit \u2248 $11.40 + $10 = $21.40.\n\nLooking back at the options, $21.40 is option B.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total manufacturing costs:\n\nDirect materials: $114,000\n\nDirect labor: $38,000\n\nManufacturing overhead: 50% of $114,000 = $57,000\n\nTotal: $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $209,000. That seems correct.\n\nEquivalent units:\n\nMaterials:\n\n- Completed: 9,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 (100% for materials)\n\nTotal equivalent units: 9,000 + 1,000 = 10,000\n\nConversion costs:\n\n- Completed: 9,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 * 50% = 500\n\nTotal equivalent units: 9,000 + 500 = 9,500\n\nCost per equivalent unit:\n\nMaterials: $114,000 / 10,000 = $11.40\n\nConversion: $95,000 / 9,500 \u2248 $10\n\nTotal cost per unit: $11.40 + $10 = $21.40\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in process costing, we calculate the cost per equivalent unit for materials and conversion separately and then apply them to the units to find the total cost, but since the question asks for the cost per equivalent whole unit, $21.40 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, but option A is $23.22, which might be calculated differently. Let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the total costs and the equivalent units produced, but perhaps using the weighted average method.\n\nHowever, since there was no beginning work in process, the weighted average method would essentially be the same as the FIFO method in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the cost per unit based on the units completed and transferred out plus the equivalent units in ending work in process.\n\nBut I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that manufacturing overhead is 50% of direct materials, which is $57,000, and direct labor is $38,000, but perhaps I need to verify if overhead is included in conversion costs correctly.\n\nWait, in process costing, conversion costs typically include direct labor and manufacturing overhead, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the total costs and divide by the total equivalent units for both materials and conversion combined.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because materials and conversion costs are different components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the total costs and divide by the total units accounted for, considering their completion percentages.\n\nBut that seems similar to what I already did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the ending work in process has materials fully completed, so the cost of materials is fully allocated to the units, regardless of their conversion status.\n\nSo, the cost of materials is $114,000 for 10,000 equivalent units, which is $11.40 per unit.\n\nConversion costs are $95,000 for 9,500 equivalent units, which is approximately $10 per unit.\n\nTotal cost per unit: $11.40 + $10 = $21.40.\n\nYes, I keep arriving at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in calculating the equivalent units for conversion costs.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nUnits started: 10,000\n\nUnits completed and transferred out: 9,000\n\nEnding work in process: 10,000 - 9,000 = 1,000 units\n\nFor conversion costs, these 1,000 units are 50% complete, so equivalent units are 500.\n\nPlus the 9,000 completed units: total equivalent units for conversion = 9,500.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the total manufacturing costs and divide by the total equivalent units for materials, but that wouldn't make sense because materials and conversion costs are separate components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the cost per equivalent unit for materials and conversion separately and then sum them up for a whole unit.\n\nBut that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the cost per equivalent unit for total manufacturing costs, considering the equivalent units for conversion costs only.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the materials are 100% complete in ending work in process, so the cost of materials is fully assigned to the 10,000 units started, regardless of their conversion status.\n\nSo, the cost of materials per unit is $11.40, and the conversion cost per equivalent unit is $10, so for a unit that is fully completed, the total cost is $11.40 + $10 = $21.40.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach in process costing that I'm not considering, but based on the information given, $21.40 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: $21.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
