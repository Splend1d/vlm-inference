                    "text": "So I have this question about GDP and how it's affected by unsold goods. It says that in 2005, 200 computers were domestically produced with a retail value of $100,000, but they weren't sold until 2006. And the question is, what happens to GDP in 2005 because of these computers?\n\nFirst, I need to remember what GDP is. GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. So, it's measuring what's being produced, not necessarily what's being sold.\n\nNow, the key here is that these computers were produced in 2005 but sold in 2006. So, when do we count their value in GDP?\n\nOption A says GDP in 2005 is $100,000 higher because of the computers. Option B says it's 200 higher because of the computers. Option C says GDP in 2005 is unaffected and it's only in 2006 when the computers are sold that it affects GDP, and then the figure for 2005 might be revised. Option D says GDP is higher by the wholesale value of the computers.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think there's a typo in option B. It probably should say \"$200 higher\" instead of \"200 higher.\" But assuming it's $200 higher, that doesn't make much sense because the retail value is $100,000. So, maybe it's a mistake, and it was meant to say $200,000 or something else. But as it is, option B seems unlikely.\n\nOption A says $100,000 higher in 2005. That seems plausible because the computers were produced in 2005, and their retail value is $100,000. So, if we're measuring production, which is what GDP is based on, then adding $100,000 to 2005 GDP makes sense.\n\nOption C suggests that GDP isn't affected until 2006 when they're sold, and then maybe 2005 GDP is revised. But I thought that GDP is based on production, not on sales. So, if the computers were produced in 2005, they should be counted in 2005 GDP, regardless of when they're sold. Unless there's some inventory adjustment that affects future GDP calculations, but the question is specifically about 2005 GDP.\n\nOption D mentions the wholesale value. I need to think about whether GDP is measured at wholesale or retail prices. Actually, GDP is measured at market prices, which typically means the price at which final goods are sold to consumers, which is the retail price. So, if the retail value is $100,000, that's the value that should be added to GDP, not the wholesale value.\n\nWait, but maybe the wholesale value is different from the retail value. If the computers were produced at a wholesale cost of, say, $80,000 and sold at retail for $100,000, then the value added would be the retail value, right? But I think in GDP calculations, we use the retail value, because that's the final sale price to the consumer.\n\nLet me double-check that. GDP includes the full value of final goods and services at market prices, which should be the retail price. So, if the computers are produced and valued at $100,000 retail, that's the amount that should be added to GDP in the year of production, which is 2005.\n\nBut option D says \"higher by the wholesale value of the computers.\" If the wholesale value is different from the retail value, then this would be incorrect. However, without knowing the wholesale value, it's hard to judge. But since the question provides the retail value, and GDP is based on retail prices, option A seems more accurate.\n\nOption C mentions that GDP isn't affected until 2006 when the computers are sold, and then the 2005 figure might be revised. But I don't think that's how GDP works. GDP is a measure of the economy's performance in a specific year, based on the production in that year. So, if the computers were produced in 2005, their value should be added to 2005 GDP, regardless of when they're sold. The sale in 2006 would affect 2006 GDP only if there was some inventory adjustment, but that's not directly related to the production in 2005.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option A: GDP in 2005 is $100,000 higher because of the computers.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose a car is produced in 2005 but not sold until 2006. In 2005, the car is part of the inventory of the manufacturer or dealer. Its production increases GDP in 2005 because it's considered part of the economy's output that year. When it's sold in 2006, it's a sale from inventory, so it doesn't add to 2006 GDP; instead, it might affect the inventory levels, but the production value was already counted in 2005.\n\nSimilarly, with the computers, their production in 2005 adds $100,000 to 2005 GDP, and their sale in 2006 doesn't add to 2006 GDP but might affect inventory levels or something similar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $100,000 higher because of the computers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
