                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which culture, previously-known as the temple-mound builders, based their subsistence primarily on maize and squash agriculture?\" And the options are A. Ancestral Puebloan, B. Hohokam, C. Mississippian, and D. Adena.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a temple-mound builder is. From what I recall, temple-mound builders were ancient civilizations in North America that built large earthen mounds, often for ceremonial or burial purposes. These mounds sometimes had temples on top of them.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of these cultures was known for building these mounds and also relied mainly on farming maize and squash.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Ancestral Puebloan. I remember the Ancestral Puebloans were a pre-Columbian culture in the American Southwest, known for building cliff dwellings and pueblos. They did practice agriculture, growing crops like corn, beans, and squash. However, I don't recall them being known specifically as \"temple-mound builders.\" Maybe they built some mounds, but I think their structures were more like stone pueblos and cliff dwellings rather than large earthen mounds.\n\nMoving on to B. Hohokam. The Hohokam culture was also in the American Southwest, particularly in what is now Arizona. They were known for their irrigation canals and built structures like platform mounds and ballcourts. They did cultivate maize and other crops. But again, I'm not sure if they were referred to as temple-mound builders in the same way that some eastern cultures were.\n\nNext is C. Mississippian. The Mississippian culture was based in the southeastern United States, and they are well-known for building large ceremonial mounds. These mounds often had temples on top of them, which sounds exactly like the description of temple-mound builders. They also practiced agriculture, growing maize, beans, and squash. This seems to fit the bill pretty closely.\n\nLastly, D. Adena. The Adena culture was located in the Ohio River valley and is known for building large earthworks, including mounds and enclosures. They did engage in agriculture, but I think their economy was more based on a combination of farming and hunting and gathering. However, the question specifies \"temple-mound builders\" who primarily relied on maize and squash agriculture.\n\nComparing all four options, the Mississippian culture seems to be the best fit. They are known for building large ceremonial mounds with temples on top, and their agriculture was primarily based on maize and squash.\n\nWait a minute, the question mentions that the culture was previously known as temple-mound builders. That suggests that this term was once used to refer to this specific culture, but perhaps it's now considered outdated or too broad.\n\nI should check if the term \"temple-mound builders\" was ever used specifically for the Mississippian culture or if it was a more general term for multiple cultures.\n\nAfter a quick search in my notes, I find that the term \"temple-mound builders\" was sometimes used to refer to the Mississippian culture, especially their practice of building large earthen mounds that often supported wooden temples.\n\nMoreover, the Mississippian culture was indeed primarily dependent on agriculture, with maize and squash being major crops.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nAncestral Puebloans and Hohokam both built structures, but their architecture was more focused on pueblos and platform mounds rather than the large ceremonial mounds described here.\n\nThe Adena culture did build mounds, but their agricultural practices were perhaps not as heavily reliant on maize and squash as the Mississippian culture was.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the answer should be C. Mississippian.\n\nWait, but the question says \"previously-known as the temple-mound builders.\" That might imply that the name has changed, but it's still referring to the same culture.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the Mississippian culture is the one that was formerly referred to as temple-mound builders, and they were indeed dependent on maize and squash agriculture.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Mississippian}} \\]"
