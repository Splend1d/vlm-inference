The Mask'. Alright, let's see. I'm pretty familiar with Jim Carrey's filmography, but sometimes I might miss a movie or two.\n\nFirst off, I know that Jim Carrey is known for his comedic roles, but he's also done some dramatic work. So, I need to recall which of these four movies he was actually in.\n\nStarting with \"Patch Adams' \u2013 wait, hold on. I remember that \"Patch Adams\" is a movie about a doctor who brings humor to medicine or something like that. But who starred in that? Let me think. I think it was Robin Williams. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Robin Williams in \"Patch Adams.\" So, that would mean Jim Carrey was not in that one. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nNext is \"The Truman Show.\" I definitely remember Jim Carrey starring in that one. He played Truman Burbank, who's the main character in this reality TV show that he doesn't know he's part of. So, that's definitely him. That was a pretty popular movie, and it showcased his acting range beyond just comedy.\n\nThen there's \"Dumb and Dumber.\" This is a classic comedy movie. I know Jim Carrey was in this one; he played Lloyd Christmas, one of the two main characters who are, well, dumb and dumber. It's a hilarious film, and it's definitely one of his signature roles.\n\nLastly, \"The Mask.\" Another comedy where Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a magical mask that gives him superpowers and transforms him into this cartoonish character. It's another iconic role for him.\n\nSo, based on this, \"Patch Adams\" seems to be the one that Jim Carrey did not star in. I think Robin Williams was the lead in that movie. Yeah, that makes sense because Robin Williams often did roles that combined comedy and drama, similar to \"Patch Adams.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly recap:\n\n- Patch Adams': Robin Williams\n\n- The Truman Show': Jim Carrey\n\n- Dumb and Dumber': Jim Carrey\n\n- The Mask': Jim Carrey\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Patch Adams'.\n\nWait a minute, but I should confirm if there's any possibility of Jim Carrey having a role in \"Patch Adams\" that I might have forgotten. Maybe he had a small part or something. But no, I don't recall that being the case. I think he was not in that movie at all.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with this answer. So, the final answer is A. Patch Adams'.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Patch Adams'}} \\]"
