                    "text": "I'm trying to factor the polynomial \\( x^4 + 4 \\) into linear factors over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\). I'm not super familiar with factoring in modular arithmetic, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) is the integers modulo 5, so all calculations will be done modulo 5. That means that, for example, 7 is the same as 2, because 7 - 2 = 5, which is divisible by 5.\n\nSo, I need to find all the linear factors of \\( x^4 + 4 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\). That would mean finding all the roots of the polynomial in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), because each root will give me a linear factor of the form \\( (x - r) \\), where \\( r \\) is a root.\n\nLet me try to find the roots of \\( x^4 + 4 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\). The possible candidates are \\( x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\), since these are all the elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nLet's test \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0^4 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4 \\), which is not zero in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nNext, \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\), but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), 5 is congruent to 0. So, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root.\n\nTherefore, \\( (x - 1) \\) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nNow, since \\( x = 1 \\) is a root, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out \\( (x - 1) \\).\n\nLet me try synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients of \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4 \\) are 1, 0, 0, 0, 4.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1, add to 0: 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1, add to 0: 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1, add to 0: 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1, add to 4: 5, which is 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nSo, the quotient is \\( x^3 + x^2 + x + 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^3 + x^2 + x \\).\n\nWait, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), the coefficients are modulo 5, so the division seems to give a quotient of \\( x^3 + x^2 + x \\), and a remainder of 0, which is good.\n\nSo, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x - 1)(x^3 + x^2 + x) \\).\n\nNow, I need to factor \\( x^3 + x^2 + x \\) further.\n\nFirst, I can factor out an \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x^3 + x^2 + x = x(x^2 + x + 1) \\).\n\nNow, I need to see if \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) can be factored in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\).\n\nTo check for roots of \\( x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \\):\n\nTest \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\), not zero.\n\n\\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\), not zero.\n\n\\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\), which is 2 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), not zero.\n\n\\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 \\), which is 3 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), not zero.\n\n\\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 \\), which is 1 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), not zero.\n\nSince there are no roots, \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x - 1)x(x^2 + x + 1) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for a factorization into linear factors. Since \\( x^2 + x + 1 \\) is irreducible, it can't be factored further into linear terms in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\).\n\nSo, perhaps I need to look at the options again.\n\nOption A is \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\).\n\nOption B is \\( (x + 1)^4 \\).\n\nOption C is \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)^3 \\).\n\nOption D is \\( (x - 1)^3(x + 1) \\).\n\nBased on my earlier work, I have \\( x^4 + 4 = (x - 1)x(x^2 + x + 1) \\).\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options directly.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that \\( x = 1 \\) is a root.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\n\\( 1^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\), which is 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\). So, yes, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), negative numbers wrap around.\n\nFor example, \\( x = -1 \\) is the same as \\( x = 4 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nLet me check \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 4^4 + 4 = 256 + 4 = 260 \\), which modulo 5 is \\( 260 \\div 5 = 52 \\), remainder 0. So, \\( x = 4 \\) is also a root.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought only \\( x = 1 \\) was a root, but now \\( x = 4 \\) also satisfies the equation.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to reconsider my approach.\n\nPerhaps I should check all possible values in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\):\n\n\\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0 + 4 = 4 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 2 \\): \\( 16 + 4 = 20 \\equiv 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) (since 20 mod 5 is 0)\n\n\\( x = 3 \\): \\( 81 + 4 = 85 \\equiv 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) (85 / 5 = 17, remainder 0)\n\n\\( x = 4 \\): \\( 256 + 4 = 260 \\equiv 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\) (260 / 5 = 52, remainder 0)\n\nSo, all roots are \\( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). There are no repeated roots here yet; each root appears once.\n\nBut wait, if I have four distinct linear factors, the factorization would be \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\), but that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), negative numbers can be used interchangeably.\n\nFor example, \\( x - 4 \\) is the same as \\( x + 1 \\), since \\( -4 \\equiv 1 \\) mod 5.\n\nSimilarly, \\( x - 3 \\) is the same as \\( x + 2 \\), since \\( -3 \\equiv 2 \\) mod 5.\n\nSo, \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 1) \\).\n\nThis looks similar to option A, which is \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\).\n\nBut the order doesn't matter since multiplication is commutative.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are repeated roots.\n\nLet me check if any of these roots are repeated.\n\nI have \\( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\), all satisfying \\( x^4 + 4 \\equiv 0 \\) mod 5, and none of them are repeating.\n\nTherefore, the factorization should be \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\), which simplifies to \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 1) \\), since \\( -3 \\equiv 2 \\) and \\( -4 \\equiv 1 \\) mod 5.\n\nRearranging, this is \\( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\), which matches option A.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any repeated factors.\n\nGiven that all roots are distinct, and none are repeating, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the polynomial might have multiple roots if it's not separable, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5[x] \\), it's possible.\n\nWait, but in my calculations, each root is distinct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored differently.\n\nLet me try to factor it as a difference of squares:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nWait, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), 2 is the same as 2.\n\nNow, I need to see if these quadratic factors can be factored further.\n\nFirst, consider \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\).\n\nCheck for roots:\n\n\\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root.\n\nSimilarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\):\n\n\\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0 - 0 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 1 \\): \\( 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 2 \\): \\( 4 - 4 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0 \\)\n\n\\( x = 3 \\): \\( 9 - 6 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( x = 3 \\) is a root.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \\( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\) are roots, each once.\n\nBut according to this, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root of both quadratics, which would mean it's a repeated root, but earlier calculations didn't show that.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake in assuming that \\( x = 1 \\) is a root of both quadratics.\n\nWait, let's check \\( x = 1 \\) in \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\):\n\n\\( 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \\neq 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) is only a root of \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), not of \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( x = 3 \\) is a root of \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\):\n\n\\( 9 - 6 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nAnd \\( x = 3 \\) in \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\):\n\n\\( 9 + 6 + 2 = 17 \\equiv 2 \\neq 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nSo, no repeated roots.\n\nTherefore, the factorization is \\( (x - 1)(x - 3)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nBut this doesn't help directly, as I need linear factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the quadratic factors in terms of their roots.\n\nFor \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), the roots are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\) (since \\( -1 \\equiv 4 \\) mod 5).\n\nWait, let's solve \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\).\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nDiscriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4 \\equiv 1 \\) mod 5.\n\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 1}{2} \\).\n\nThus, \\( x = \\frac{-2 + 1}{2} = \\frac{-1}{2} \\equiv 4 \\) mod 5, and \\( x = \\frac{-2 - 1}{2} = \\frac{-3}{2} \\equiv 1 \\) mod 5.\n\nSo, \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\):\n\nDiscriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4 \\equiv 1 \\) mod 5.\n\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 1}{2} \\).\n\nThus, \\( x = \\frac{2 + 1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\equiv 4 \\) mod 5, and \\( x = \\frac{2 - 1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\equiv 3 \\) mod 5.\n\nTherefore, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \\).\n\nSo, going back to the original factorization:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\).\n\nWait, but \\( x - 4 \\) appears twice, which would imply that \\( x = 4 \\) is a repeated root, but earlier I thought it was only once.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to collect all distinct roots.\n\nFrom the quadratics:\n\n\\( x^2 + 2x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\)\n\n\\( x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \\)\n\nSo, overall:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\)\n\nWhich can be written as \\( (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 4)^2 \\)\n\nBut this suggests that \\( x = 4 \\) is a repeated root, which contradicts my earlier findings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in factoring the quadratics.\n\nLet me double-check the factorization of \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\).\n\nIf \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \\), then expanding:\n\n\\( (x - 3)(x - 4) = x^2 - 4x - 3x + 12 = x^2 - 7x + 12 \\equiv x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) mod 5.\n\nYes, that's correct because \\( -7 \\equiv -2 \\) and \\( 12 \\equiv 2 \\) mod 5.\n\nSimilarly, \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which expands to \\( x^2 - 4x - x + 4 = x^2 - 5x + 4 \\equiv x^2 - 0x + 4 \\equiv x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) mod 5.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) = x^2 - 4x - x + 4 = x^2 - 5x + 4 \\equiv x^2 + 0x + 4 \\equiv x^2 + 4 \\) mod 5, but earlier I had \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\).\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nI must have made a mistake in factoring.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nWe have \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\).\n\nTo factor this, we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\) and add to 2.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\), the numbers are small, so let's list possible pairs:\n\n1 and 1: sum is 2, product"
