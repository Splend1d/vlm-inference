                    "text": "So I have this question: \"Who was the mother of the Greek god Zeus?\" and the options are Gaia, Phoebe, Rhea, and Hera. Okay, I need to recall some Greek mythology here.\n\nFirst off, I know that Zeus is a major figure in Greek mythology. He's like the king of the gods, right? He's the one who rules Mount Olympus and is in charge of the sky and thunder. So, he's pretty important.\n\nNow, I need to remember who his mother is. Let me think about the family tree of the Greek gods. Zeus is a Titan, or is he an Olympian? Wait, actually, the Titans are the generation before the Olympians. So, the Titans are like Cronus and Rhea, and their children are the Olympians, including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Demeter, and Hestia.\n\nSo, Cronus and Rhea are the parents of Zeus. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. I think Cronus was the son of Gaia and Uranus, and he married his sister Rhea. They had several children, and Zeus was the youngest among them.\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, Rhea would be the mother of Zeus. But just to be sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nGaia is the Greek goddess of the Earth. She's one of the first deities in Greek mythology, emerging at the beginning of time. She gave birth to Uranus, who then became her husband, and together they had the Titans, including Cronus. So, Gaia is actually the grandmother of Zeus, not his mother.\n\nPhoebe is another Titaness, the daughter of Coeus and Primordial Earth (Gaia). She's sometimes associated with the moon or prophecy. But I don't recall her being the mother of Zeus. I think she was married to Poseidon, but that's a different branch of the family.\n\nHera is Zeus's sister and wife. She's the goddess of marriage and women. But she's not his mother; she's his sibling.\n\nSo, based on this, Rhea seems to be the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I should think about another perspective. Perhaps there are different versions of the myth?\n\nLet me see. In some myths, there might be variations, but from what I recall, Rhea is consistently mentioned as the mother of Zeus. She swallowed her other children because Cronus was afraid they would overthrow him, but she hid Zeus and raised him in secret.\n\nYes, that story rings a bell. So, that reinforces that Rhea is indeed Zeus's mother.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any confusion with the Roman equivalent. In Roman mythology, Zeus is Jupiter, and his mother would be Maia, but that's a different figure from the Greek Phoebe.\n\nNo, wait, Maia is actually the mother of Mercury (Hermes in Greek), not Jupiter (Zeus). So, that doesn't apply here.\n\nAlright, I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be Rhea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Rhea}} \\]"
