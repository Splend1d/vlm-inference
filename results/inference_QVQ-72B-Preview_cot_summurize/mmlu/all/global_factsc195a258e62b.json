                    "text": "Let's tackle this question. It's about child labor statistics, specifically for children aged 5 to 14, as of 2012. The options are:\n\nA. 5 million\n\nB. 30 million\n\nC. 150 million\n\nD. 500 million\n\nFirst off, I know that child labor is a significant issue on a global scale, and organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO) work hard to combat it and collect data on it. Given that, I need to find out how many children in the 5-14 age range were working in 2012.\n\nI recall that the ILO has been conducting surveys and publishing reports on child labor every few years. In fact, they have a series called the \"Global Estimates of Child Labour\" which provides up-to-date statistics.\n\nLet me think about the most recent data available around 2012. I believe that in 2012, the ILO released a report on child labor based on statistics from around the world.\n\nTo get a better sense, maybe I should look back at some key reports or data sources. Since this is a multiple-choice question, and I don't have internet access right now, I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nI remember that in 2012, the ILO estimated that there were about 168 million children aged 5-14 engaged in child labor globally. But wait, that's not matching any of the options here. Maybe my memory is a bit fuzzy.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any other figures. I think that in 2016, the ILO reported that there were 152 million children in child labor, but that might be for a different age group or a different year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number includes both child labor and those at risk. No, the question is specifically about children who are working.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 5 million \u2013 That seems too low. Given the global population and the prevalence of child labor, especially in developing countries, 5 million seems underestimate.\n\nB. 30 million \u2013 Still, this seems quite low. I think the number should be higher.\n\nC. 150 million \u2013 This seems more plausible. I recall reading figures around this number in various reports.\n\nD. 500 million \u2013 This seems high, considering the total population of children in this age group worldwide.\n\nMaybe I should think about the total population of children aged 5-14 globally. According to the United Nations, in 2012, the global population of children aged 5-14 was around 1.2 billion. So, if 150 million were in child labor, that would be about 12.5% of that age group. That seems reasonable, considering efforts to reduce child labor.\n\nIf it were 500 million, that would be over 40% of the age group, which seems too high, given global initiatives against child labor.\n\nOn the other hand, 5 million or 30 million seems too small a percentage to align with the known issues of child labor.\n\nPerhaps I should consider regional data. For example, in some regions, child labor rates are higher than in others. Asia and Africa have higher incidences compared to Europe and North America.\n\nBut since the question is about the global total, regional variations should already be factored into the overall number.\n\nLet me try to recall any specific reports or numbers from around 2012. I think that in 2012, the ILO reported that about 1 in 10 children were in child labor, which would align with the 150 million figure if the total population is around 1.5 billion, but earlier I thought it was 1.2 billion.\n\nWait, perhaps my population figure is off. Let me double-check that.\n\nUpon recalling, I think the global population of children aged 5-14 was approximately 1.2 billion in 2012. If 150 million were in child labor, that would be about 12.5%, which is roughly 1 in 8 children, not 1 in 10.\n\nMaybe my figures are not precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps the definition of child labor includes different activities or hours worked, which could affect the numbers.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the figure includes only economic activities or also hazardous work. The ILO defines child labor as work that deprives children of their childhood, potential, and dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the number is higher or lower depending on the specific definition applied.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is referring to the number of children in child labor or the number employed in economic activities.\n\nI think the term \"worked\" in this context means they are engaged in economic activities, which could include both beneficial and harmful work, but generally, when discussing child labor, it refers to work that is exploitative or harmful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"worked\" here refers to any work, including small chores, which could inflate the number.\n\nBut considering the seriousness of the issue, I doubt that; it's likely referring to work that interferes with education and healthy development.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, I still lean towards 150 million, which is option C.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way to approach this. Perhaps looking at trends over time. For example, in 2000, the number of children in child labor was higher, around 215 million, and there has been progress since then.\n\nIf that's the case, then by 2012, the number might have decreased, which would make 150 million a plausible figure.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the population growth, the number might have increased, but I think global efforts have led to a decrease in child labor rates.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the percentage decrease. From 2000 to 2012, if the number decreased from 215 million to 150 million, that would be a reduction of about 30%, which aligns with some of the global targets set by the ILO.\n\nTherefore, option C, 150 million, seems the most reasonable answer based on the information I can recall.\n\nTo confirm, I'll go with option C: 150 million children between the ages of 5-14 worked globally as of 2012.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
