                    "text": "Let's dive into this logic problem. I've got three premises and four options to choose from. I need to figure out which one of these options is an immediate consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:\n\n1. (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q)\n\n2. P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\n3. N \u2283 P\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. P\n\nB. N \u2283 ~O\n\nC. O \u2228 Q\n\nD. ~P\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what it means for something to be an immediate consequence. In PL, this usually means that using one step of a standard rule of inference, I can derive one of the options from the premises. So, I should recall some of the basic rules of inference like modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, etc.\n\nLet me list out the rules I know:\n\n1. Modus Ponens: If P \u2283 Q and P, then Q\n\n2. Modus Tollens: If P \u2283 Q and ~Q, then ~P\n\n3. Hypothetical Syllogism: If P \u2283 Q and Q \u2283 R, then P \u2283 R\n\n4. Disjunctive Syllogism: If P \u2228 Q and ~P, then Q\n\n5. Simplification: If P \u2227 Q, then P\n\n6. Conjunction: If P and Q, then P \u2227 Q\n\n7. Addition: If P, then P \u2228 Q\n\n8. Composition: If P \u2283 Q and Q \u2283 R, then P \u2283 R\n\n9. De Morgan's Laws: ~(P \u2227 Q) \u2261 ~P \u2228 ~Q and ~(P \u2228 Q) \u2261 ~P \u2227 ~Q\n\n10. Double Negation: ~~P \u2261 P\n\n11. Contraposition: P \u2283 Q \u2261 ~Q \u2283 ~P\n\nOkay, now with these in mind, let's look at the premises again:\n\n1. (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q)\n\n2. P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\n3. N \u2283 P\n\nI need to see which option can be derived directly from these premises using one of the above rules.\n\nLet's consider option C: O \u2228 Q\n\nLooking at premise 1: (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q)\n\nIf I can establish (N \u2283 ~O), then by modus ponens, I can get (O \u2228 Q). So, do I have (N \u2283 ~O) directly from the premises?\n\nLooking at premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\nAnd premise 3: N \u2283 P\n\nHmm, if I have N, then by premise 3, I get P. Then, by premise 2, if I have P, I get (N \u2283 ~O). But I already have N, so this seems a bit circular. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use hypothetical syllogism. Premise 2 is P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), and premise 3 is N \u2283 P. If I combine these, by hypothetical syllogism, I get N \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), which simplifies to N \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O). That seems redundant. Maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can assume one of the premises and see where it leads.\n\nSuppose I have N. Then, by premise 3, N \u2283 P, so I get P. Then, by premise 2, P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), so I get (N \u2283 ~O). Now, with (N \u2283 ~O), and from premise 1, (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q), I can use modus ponens to get (O \u2228 Q). So, starting from N, I can derive (O \u2228 Q) through these steps. But the question is about immediate consequences, which should ideally involve just one step. So, maybe this is not the most direct path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to apply one of the rules directly without assuming any additional statements.\n\nLet me look at premise 2 and premise 3. Premise 2 is P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), and premise 3 is N \u2283 P. If I have N, then by premise 3, I get P, and then by premise 2, I get (N \u2283 ~O). But again, this seems like two steps.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can chain them differently. If I have premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), and premise 3: N \u2283 P, perhaps I can use hypothetical syllogism to get N \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), which again seems redundant.\n\nMaybe I need to consider premise 1 more carefully. Premise 1 is (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q). If I have (N \u2283 ~O), then I can get (O \u2228 Q). But do I have (N \u2283 ~O) directly from any premise? Not really.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to derive one of the options directly from one of the premises using a single inference rule.\n\nLet's consider option B: N \u2283 ~O\n\nLooking back, if I have premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), and if I had P, then by modus ponens, I could get (N \u2283 ~O). But I don't have P as a premise; I only have P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O). So, unless I can derive P from the other premises, I can't directly get (N \u2283 ~O) from premise 2 alone in one step.\n\nSimilarly, for option A: P\n\nIs there a way to derive P directly from the premises in one step? Looking at premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), which is a conditional, so I can't directly get P from it. Premise 3: N \u2283 P, which again is a conditional. Unless I have N, I can't derive P from premise 3 alone.\n\nOption D: ~P\n\nIs there a way to derive ~P from the premises in one step? Not directly, because the premises are all conditionals leading to other statements, not negating P.\n\nOption C: O \u2228 Q\n\nAs I considered earlier, if I can get (N \u2283 ~O) from somewhere, then from premise 1, I can get (O \u2228 Q). But again, getting (N \u2283 ~O) seems to require more than one step.\n\nMaybe I need to think about it differently. Perhaps there's a way to combine premises 1 and 2 directly.\n\nPremise 1: (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q)\n\nPremise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\nIf I have P, then by premise 2, I get (N \u2283 ~O), and then by premise 1, I get (O \u2228 Q). So, combining them, it's like P \u2283 (O \u2228 Q). But again, this is more than one step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the exportation rule, which states that (P \u2283 (Q \u2283 R)) is equivalent to (P \u2227 Q) \u2283 R.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the structure of the premises and see if there's a way to apply modus ponens or modus tollens directly.\n\nLet me try to list out all possible immediate inferences from each premise:\n\nFrom premise 1: (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q)\n\nIf I have (N \u2283 ~O), then I can get (O \u2228 Q).\n\nFrom premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\nIf I have P, then I can get (N \u2283 ~O).\n\nFrom premise 3: N \u2283 P\n\nIf I have N, then I can get P.\n\nBut none of these seem to lead directly to one of the options in a single step, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider option C: O \u2228 Q\n\nIs there a way to get (O \u2228 Q) directly from one of the premises?\n\nLooking back, premise 1 is (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q). If I have (N \u2283 ~O), which I don't directly from the premises, then I can get (O \u2228 Q). But since I don't have (N \u2283 ~O) as a premise, I can't directly get (O \u2228 Q) from premise 1 alone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to derive (O \u2228 Q) without needing (N \u2283 ~O).\n\nLet me think about the contrapositive or other logical equivalences.\n\nThe contrapositive of premise 1 is: ~ (O \u2228 Q) \u2283 ~ (N \u2283 ~O), which is equivalent to ~ (O \u2228 Q) \u2283 (N \u2227 O). Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider option B: N \u2283 ~O\n\nIf I can derive that, then from premise 1, I can get (O \u2228 Q). But again, how to derive (N \u2283 ~O) directly from the premises in one step?\n\nLooking back at premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\nIf I have P, then by modus ponens, I can get (N \u2283 ~O). But I don't have P as a premise; I only have P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O). So, unless I can derive P from the other premises in one step, I can't get (N \u2283 ~O) directly.\n\nSimilarly, for option A: P\n\nIf I could derive P, then from premise 2, I could get (N \u2283 ~O), and from premise 1, (O \u2228 Q). But again, deriving P in one step seems challenging.\n\nOption D: ~P\n\nIs there a way to derive ~P directly? Not obviously from the given premises in one step.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that none of the options are immediate consequences, but that seems unlikely for an exam question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to derive one of the options using a different rule that I haven't considered yet.\n\nLet me think about the chain of implications.\n\nFrom premise 3: N \u2283 P\n\nFrom premise 2: P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O)\n\nCombining these, by hypothetical syllogism, I get N \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O), which is N \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O). That seems tautological and not particularly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the structure of the premises and see if there's a way to apply disjunctive syllogism or another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the contrapositive of premise 2: ~ (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 ~P, which is equivalent to (N \u2227 O) \u2283 ~P.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me derive any of the options directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a way to derive one of the options by assuming its negation and seeing if that leads to a contradiction, but that seems more involved than a one-step inference.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess.\n\nLooking back, the only option that seems remotely derivable in one step is option C: O \u2228 Q, by assuming (N \u2283 ~O) from somewhere and then using premise 1.\n\nHowever, since I don't have (N \u2283 ~O) directly from the premises, I'm not confident about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A: P is the answer, because if I can derive P, then from premise 2, I can get (N \u2283 ~O), and from premise 1, (O \u2228 Q). But again, I don't have a direct way to derive P from the premises in one step.\n\nOption D: ~P seems unlikely because the premises don't provide a way to negate P directly.\n\nOption B: N \u2283 ~O requires having P, which I don't have directly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the correct answer is option C: O \u2228 Q, because it's the only option that can be derived from premise 1 if I can establish (N \u2283 ~O), even if it takes more than one step.\n\nBut the question specifies an \"immediate (one-step) consequence,\" so maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of the options are immediate consequences, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, I'll go with option C: O \u2228 Q as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
