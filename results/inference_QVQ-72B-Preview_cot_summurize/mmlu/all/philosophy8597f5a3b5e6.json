                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Anscombe's view on Sidgwick's perspective on the badness of an action. The options are:\n\nA. its actual consequences.\n\nB. its expected consequences.\n\nC. whether it violates any duties.\n\nD. whether it violates divine law.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Anscombe and Sidgwick are and what their views on ethics are.\n\nSidgwick was an English philosopher who lived in the 19th century. He's known for his work in ethics, particularly \"The Methods of Ethics,\" where he developed a form of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the idea that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, specifically by the amount of happiness or utility it produces.\n\nAnscombe was a 20th-century philosopher who made contributions to various areas of philosophy, including ethics. She was known for her critique of modern moral philosophy, particularly her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" where she challenged the prevailing views on moral obligation and the concept of duty.\n\nGiven that Sidgwick was a utilitarian, it's likely that he believed the badness of an action should be judged based on its consequences, particularly the amount of happiness or utility it produces.\n\nNow, the question is about how Anscombe interprets Sidgwick's view on this. It says, \"Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of...\"\n\nOption A is \"its actual consequences.\" But utilitarianism typically focuses on the expected or probable consequences rather than the actual ones, because we often don't know the actual consequences until after the action has been performed.\n\nOption B is \"its expected consequences.\" This seems more in line with utilitarian thought, as utilitarians would consider the likely outcomes of an action when determining its moral worth.\n\nOption C is \"whether it violates any duties.\" This sounds more like a deontological approach, where duties and rules are primary, rather than consequences. Sidgwick was a utilitarian, so this doesn't seem to fit his view.\n\nOption D is \"whether it violates divine law.\" This suggests a divine command theory, which also doesn't align with Sidgwick's utilitarianism.\n\nGiven this, it seems that option B, \"its expected consequences,\" is the most appropriate choice. Utilitarianism is concerned with maximizing happiness or utility, and decisions are made based on the anticipated outcomes.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any specific context from Anscombe's work that might suggest otherwise. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe critiques the notion of duty and moral obligation, arguing that these concepts are tied to a legalistic view of morality that doesn't align well with utilitarianism.\n\nShe might argue that on Sidgwick's utilitarian view, the badness of an action is determined by its expected consequences rather than any intrinsic duty or divine law.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I should think about Sidgwick's own writings. In \"The Methods of Ethics,\" Sidgwick develops a version of utilitarianism that emphasizes the importance of both hedonistic and ideal utilitarianism, considering both pleasure and the realization of certain ideals.\n\nHowever, at its core, utilitarianism is consequentialist, meaning that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. Therefore, whether it's actual or expected consequences, utilitarianism would prioritize the latter, as actual consequences are often unknown at the time of decision-making.\n\nTherefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Anscombe would claim that on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of its expected consequences.\n\nSo, the answer is B. its expected consequences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
