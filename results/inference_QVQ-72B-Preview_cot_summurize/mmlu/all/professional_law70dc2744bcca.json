The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

                    "text": "Okay, this is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, there's a retiree who owns 1,000 acres of farmland but can't farm it anymore, so he decides to sell it in parcels of 250 acres each. A development company president buys three of these parcels from the retiree. There's a deed provision that binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, stating that any further subdivisions must be restricted to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only.\n\nSo, the development company buys three 250-acre parcels and immediately subdivides two of them into lots of three, four, and five acres, and starts building homes there, calling it Tract 1. The original deed restrictions were included in the special warranty deeds given to the buyers in Tract 1.\n\nTwo years later, the president sells the remaining 250-acre parcel to a contractor. This deed also includes the same restriction about two-acre minimum lots. The contractor then drafts a subdivision plan for this last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots and starts building single-family dwelling units in Tract 2. However, the deeds to the buyers in Tract 2 don't mention the restriction for two-acre minimum lots.\n\nNow, some of the current owners in Tract 1 are trying to stop the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots. They're bringing an action to enjoin the contractor's actions. The question is, what's the most probable judicial determination in this case?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. That the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\n\nHmm, standing to sue generally requires that the plaintiffs have a direct interest in the outcome, meaning they're affected by the actions they're trying to stop. In this case, the Tract 1 owners are likely affected by the development in Tract 2, especially if it violates restrictions that affect their property values or the character of the neighborhood. So, it seems like they would have standing. Maybe not the strongest argument.\n\nB. That the action should be dismissed because there's no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in Tract 1 and the contractor.\n\nPrivity of estate usually refers to the relationship between successive owners of the same property. Here, the Tract 1 owners and the contractor are dealing with different parcels of land, so there might not be direct privity. However, since all the land originally belonged to the retiree and was subject to the same deed restrictions, there might be horizontal privity or some other doctrine that allows the restrictions to run with the land. Not sure if that's a strong defense.\n\nC. That the action would be successful if Tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\n\nA common development scheme typically involves a developer creating a unified plan for a subdivision with shared restrictions and amenities. If Tract 2 is part of the same overall development plan as Tract 1, then the restrictions might apply uniformly. However, since the contractor is developing Tract 2 independently and the deeds to Tract 2 buyers don't mention the two-acre lot restriction, it's unclear how the court would view this.\n\nD. That the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n\nThis seems promising. The original deed had a provision binding all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns, which means that the restrictions were intended to run with the land. Since all the parcels sold by the retiree were subject to this restriction, any further subdivisions were supposed to adhere to the two-acre lot minimum.\n\nNow, the contractor is subdividing the last parcel into one-acre lots, which violates the restriction. Even though the deeds to Tract 2 buyers don't mention the restriction, the original deed's provision should still bind the contractor as a subsequent grantee.\n\nBut wait, the contractor's deed from the president included the same restriction, so the contractor was explicitly bound by it. Therefore, the contractor should be enjoined from violating the restriction.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that in a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor, the most probable judicial determination would be... and the options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is D: that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n\nThe restrictions were expressly binding on all subsequent grantees, and the contractor, as a subsequent grantee, is bound by them, regardless of whether the Tract 2 buyers were notified via their deeds.\n\nSo, the court would likely enforce the restriction and enjoin the contractor from subdividing into one-acre lots.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
