                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about two identical capacitors hooked in parallel to an external circuit. And I need to figure out which of the following quantities must be the same for both capacitors: the charge stored, the voltage across the capacitor, or the capacitance.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some basics about capacitors and parallel circuits. I know that a capacitor stores charge, and the relationship between charge, voltage, and capacitance is given by the formula Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.\n\nNow, the problem says that the capacitors are identical and hooked in parallel. Since they're identical, that means they have the same capacitance, right? So, C is the same for both.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same because they're connected across the same points in the circuit. So, the voltage across both capacitors should be the same.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"hooked in parallel to an external circuit.\" Does that mean they're connected in parallel to each other and to some other components, but for now, I can consider just the two capacitors in parallel.\n\nSo, in parallel connection, the voltage across both capacitors is the same. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, what about the charge stored? Well, since Q = CV, and both capacitors have the same C and the same V, then Q should also be the same.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. In parallel connection, the voltage is the same across both, but the charge can be different if the capacitances are different, but here, the capacitances are the same, so Q should be the same.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose I have two identical capacitors in parallel, and I connect them to a voltage source. Since they're in parallel, both are directly connected to the voltage source, so both will have the same voltage.\n\nGiven that they have the same capacitance, C, and the same voltage, V, then Q = CV is the same for both.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's something about the external circuit that could affect this.\n\nThe problem says \"hooked in parallel to an external circuit.\" So, perhaps there are other components in the circuit that could influence the charges on the capacitors.\n\nBut, since the capacitors are identical and in parallel, and assuming no other paths for charge, I think the charges would be the same.\n\nWait, but maybe if there's a battery or something, it would supply charge to both capacitors equally, assuming symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scenario where the charges could be different even if the capacitors are identical and in parallel, but I can't think of one right now.\n\nLet me consider the formulas for capacitors in parallel. When capacitors are in parallel, the equivalent capacitance is just the sum of the individual capacitances. So, if both are identical with capacitance C, the equivalent capacitance is 2C.\n\nBut in this problem, I'm not dealing with the equivalent capacitance; I'm looking at each capacitor individually.\n\nSo, given that, and knowing that in parallel, the voltage is the same across both, and since they're identical, their capacitances are the same, and thus their charges should be the same.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"identical capacitors,\" so C is the same for both, and in parallel, V is the same for both. Therefore, Q = CV is the same for both.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nSuppose the external circuit has a battery that supplies a certain voltage. Then, both capacitors would be charged to that voltage.\n\nSince they have the same C and V, Q is the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the external circuit is more complex, maybe with other components, but the problem specifies that the capacitors are hooked in parallel to the external circuit, so unless there's something unusual happening, I think the conclusion holds.\n\nMaybe to be thorough, I should consider the conservation of charge. If the battery supplies a certain charge, how is it distributed among the capacitors?\n\nIn parallel connection, the voltage is the same across both, and since C is the same, Q is the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the capacitors are being charged through resistors or something, but the problem doesn't specify any resistors, so I think it's safe to assume that the charges are the same.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nI. The charge stored on the capacitor\n\nII. The voltage across the capacitor\n\nIII. The capacitance of the capacitor\n\nGiven that the capacitors are identical and in parallel, both C and V should be the same for both, and consequently, Q should be the same.\n\nSo, all three quantities are the same for both capacitors.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there any scenario where, even if the capacitors are identical and in parallel, their charges could differ?\n\nWell, if there were some external influence or if one capacitor was initially charged differently, but the problem states they are hooked in parallel to an external circuit, so presumably, they are being charged simultaneously.\n\nUnless there's some non-ideal behavior, like one capacitor having a different voltage due to internal resistance or something, but the problem doesn't mention any of that.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that all three quantities are the same for both capacitors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
