                    "text": "So I've got this question about the U.S. House of Representatives, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that all revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House. Hmm, I thought it was the other way around. I recall that in the Constitution, it says that all revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives. So, I think this statement is incorrect.\n\nOption B states that representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population. Wait a minute, that seems backwards. From what I remember, the House of Representatives is based on population, so states with larger populations have more representatives. Whereas, in the Senate, each state gets two senators, regardless of population. So, this option seems to have it reversed.\n\nOption C claims that the Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate. Let's see, the Speaker of the House is a pretty powerful position. They preside over the House, appoint members to committees, and have a lot of influence over the legislative agenda. The president pro tempore of the Senate is mostly a ceremonial position, usually held by the most senior member of the majority party. They can preside over the Senate, but in practice, it's often done by junior senators. So, I think the Speaker of the House has more power than the president pro tempore.\n\nOption D mentions that the House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not. I know that the House Committee on Ways and Means is responsible for taxation and other financial matters. Does the Senate have a similar committee? Well, the Senate has the Committee on Finance, which handles similar issues. But is it exactly the same as the House's Ways and Means Committee? Maybe not in name, but perhaps in function. Wait, but the question is specifically about the Committee on Ways and Means in the House and whether the Senate has something comparable.\n\nUpon checking, the House does have a Committee on Ways and Means, which is exclusive to the House. The Senate has the Committee on Finance, which deals with similar matters but isn't identical in scope or name. So, while the Senate has a comparable committee, it's not called the Committee on Ways and Means.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be correct. The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate does not have an equivalent committee by that name.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because revenue bills originate in the House, not the Senate.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because House representation is based on population, not equal among states, and Senate representation is equal per state, not proportional to population.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because the Speaker of the House has more power than the president pro tempore of the Senate.\n\n- Option D is correct because the House has the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate does not have a committee by that name.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
