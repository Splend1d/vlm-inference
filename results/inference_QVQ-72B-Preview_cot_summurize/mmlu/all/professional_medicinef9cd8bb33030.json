                    "text": "So I've got this patient who's been having headaches for the past two weeks. He's 36 years old and says that these headaches are moderately severe and present when he wakes up in the morning. They seem to get better when he takes over-the-counter painkillers. Interestingly, he doesn't have a history of headaches before this, which makes me wonder what might be causing them now.\n\nHe also mentioned that about eight months ago, he got a promotion to an upper-level managerial position at his accounting firm and had to relocate because of it. That might be relevant, maybe stress-related, but I need to think beyond just stress.\n\nOn examination, everything looks normal except for his eyes. Specifically, there's blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. That means both optic discs\u2014the spots where the optic nerve enters the eye\u2014are blurred. This could be a sign of increased pressure in the brain, maybe from something called papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc due to raised intracranial pressure.\n\nGiven that, I need to think about what could be causing increased pressure in his head. The fact that the headaches are worse in the morning and improve during the day sometimes aligns with papilledema, because fluid pressure in the brain can be higher when lying down and decreases when sitting or standing.\n\nNow, considering his recent promotion and relocation, there might be a lot of stress in his life, but the blurring of the optic discs suggests something more than just stress. It could be a tumor pressing on the brain, causing increased pressure, or maybe some other condition like a cyst or fluid buildup.\n\nI need to rule out serious causes first. A brain tumor, for example, could cause these symptoms, especially if it's located near the optic nerves or chiasm. Another possibility is idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is increased pressure in the skull without an obvious cause, but that's usually more common in young, overweight women, and this patient is a man.\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation, I think ordering a CT scan of the head is the most appropriate next step. A CT scan can quickly show if there's any mass or significant abnormality pressing on the brain that might be causing the increased pressure and the headaches.\n\nAlternatively, an MRI might be even better for detailing soft tissues and detecting smaller abnormalities, but a CT scan is faster and more widely available, and it's crucial to act quickly in cases where increased intracranial pressure is suspected because it can lead to vision loss or other severe complications if not treated promptly.\n\nReferring him to a neurologist is also a good idea, but I think ordering a CT scan first would provide valuable information that the neurologist would need to make a diagnosis and plan treatment.\n\nStarting a trial of a beta-blocking medication might be considered for migraine prevention, but given the presence of papilledema and the potential for serious underlying causes, it's more important to investigate the cause of the headaches and the optic disc blurring rather than just treating the symptoms.\n\nAn EEG, which measures electrical activity in the brain, might be useful for detecting seizures or other electrical abnormalities, but in this case, the primary concern is increased intracranial pressure, which isn't directly assessed by an EEG.\n\nSo, my recommendation would be to order a CT scan of the head urgently to evaluate for any mass lesion or other cause of increased intracranial pressure, and to refer the patient to a neurologist for further evaluation and management based on the scan results.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
