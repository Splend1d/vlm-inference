                    "text": "So I'm dealing with a situation where, as an accountant reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer, I've found that several leases should be capitalized but aren't. These leases are material, meaning their omission could influence the decisions of users of the financial statements. Management isn't willing to correct this error, so I need to modify my review report accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to capitalize a lease. In accounting, capitalizing a lease means recognizing it as an asset and a corresponding liability on the balance sheet, rather than treating it as an operating expense. This is required under certain circumstances to provide a more accurate representation of the company's financial position.\n\nSince these leases are material and not being capitalized, it indicates a departure from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP is the set of standards and principles that govern financial reporting in the United States, and companies are expected to follow them to ensure their financial statements are comparable and reliable.\n\nGiven that management won't correct this error, I have to consider how to reflect this issue in my review report. A review engagement is less extensive than an audit and doesn't provide assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Instead, it provides a conclusion that nothing has come to the accountant's attention that causes them to believe the financial statements are not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.\n\nHowever, since I've identified a material departure from GAAP, I need to modify my report to reflect this. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Issue an adverse opinion because of the departure from GAAP.\n\nB. Express no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements.\n\nC. Emphasize that the financial statements are for limited use only.\n\nD. Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\nFirst, option A suggests issuing an adverse opinion. An adverse opinion is typically issued in audit reports when the auditor concludes that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with GAAP. However, in a review engagement, the level of assurance is different, and the terminology might vary.\n\nOption B suggests expressing no assurance at all. But in a review engagement, the accountant does provide limited assurance that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe the financial statements are materially misstated. Disclaiming all assurance seems too strong and might not be appropriate in this context.\n\nOption C mentions emphasizing that the financial statements are for limited use only. This might be relevant if the financial statements are intended for a restricted audience, but in this case, the issue is a material departure from GAAP, not the intended use of the statements.\n\nOption D suggests disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report. This seems plausible because it allows the accountant to draw attention to the specific issue while still providing limited assurance on the financial statements.\n\nI need to think about the appropriate course of action. In a review engagement, when the accountant becomes aware of a material misstatement or a departure from GAAP that management refuses to correct, the accountant should modify the review report to include a description of the departure and its effect on the financial statements.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D seems to align with this guidance. Disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph would allow the accountant to explain the issue and its impact on the financial statements, while still providing limited assurance on the statements as a whole.\n\nOption A, issuing an adverse opinion, might be more applicable in an audit context, where the auditor is required to express an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. In a review engagement, the accountant provides a conclusion rather than an opinion, and the terminology might differ.\n\nOption B, expressing no assurance, is similar to issuing a disclaimer in an audit, but again, in a review engagement, it's important to use terminology that fits the level of assurance provided.\n\nOption C, emphasizing that the financial statements are for limited use only, might be relevant if there are restrictions on who can use the financial statements, but that doesn't directly address the departure from GAAP.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate action seems to be option D: disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report. This approach ensures that users of the report are aware of the material misstatement and can consider its implications when evaluating the financial statements.\n\nTo summarize, when an accountant reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer identifies a material departure from GAAP due to leases that should be capitalized but aren't, and management refuses to correct the error, the accountant should modify the review report to include a disclosure of the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph. This action provides transparency about the issue while maintaining the limited assurance nature of the review engagement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
