                    "text": "So I've got this question here about moral theories. It says, \"A moral theory explains _____.\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. why an action is right or wrong\n\nB. why one moral event caused another\n\nC. where a moral agent got her values\n\nD. why people do what they do\n\nHmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, what is a moral theory? Well, in philosophy, a moral theory is basically a system of ideas that tries to explain what's right and wrong, and often how we should make decisions about ethical issues. So, it's about understanding morality.\n\nOption A says, \"why an action is right or wrong.\" That sounds pretty central to moral theories, right? After all, moral theories are supposed to help us determine the morality of actions.\n\nOption B is, \"why one moral event caused another.\" This seems a bit different. It sounds more like it's about causality in moral events, maybe how one event leads to another. But is that really what moral theories are primarily concerned with? I'm not so sure. Moral theories might touch on this, but it's not their main focus.\n\nOption C is, \"where a moral agent got her values.\" A moral agent is someone who can make moral decisions, usually a person. So, this would be about where their moral values come from\u2014maybe their upbringing, culture, education, and so on. While moral theories might discuss how values are formed, their primary aim is more about evaluating actions or decisions based on those values, not necessarily explaining the origin of the values themselves.\n\nOption D is, \"why people do what they do.\" This seems broad and could encompass a lot, including psychological or sociological explanations. Moral theories might influence why people do things, but again, their main focus isn't to explain human behavior in general. They're more specifically about the moral aspects of actions.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option A seems to be the most straightforward and direct answer. Moral theories are primarily concerned with explaining why actions are right or wrong. The other options touch on related but distinct areas, such as the causes of moral events, the origin of moral values, or general human behavior.\n\nI think the best answer is A. why an action is right or wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
