                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what term describes the smallest change in a measured variable that an instrument can respond to. The options are resolution, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, resolution. I think resolution refers to how finely something can be measured. Like, if you have a ruler that marks every millimeter, the resolution is high because it can measure small changes. So, maybe resolution is about the smallest change the instrument can detect.\n\nAccuracy, on the other hand, is about how close the measurements are to the true or actual value. If an instrument is accurate, it gives you the right answer consistently. But this doesn't necessarily relate to detecting small changes; it's more about the correctness of the measurement.\n\nPrecision is about how repeatable the measurements are. If you measure the same thing multiple times, precise measurements will be close to each other, regardless of whether they're accurate or not. So, precision isn't directly about detecting small changes in the variable.\n\nSensitivity seems related to how much the instrument responds to changes in the measured variable. A sensitive instrument might give a bigger response to a small change in the variable. Maybe sensitivity is about how well it can detect small changes.\n\nWait, but sensitivity can also be about the magnitude of the response relative to the change in the variable. Like, if a small change in temperature causes a large change in the instrument's reading, it's sensitive. But is that the same as resolution?\n\nLet me see. Resolution is often expressed in terms of the smallest increment the instrument can display or detect, like the number of digits on a digital display. For example, a digital scale that shows 0.1 kg has a higher resolution than one that shows 1 kg increments.\n\nSensitivity, in some contexts, is the slope of the instrument's response curve. It's how much the output changes for a given change in the input. So, it's more about the magnitude of the response to a change, not necessarily the smallest change it can detect.\n\nPrecision, in terms of measurement, is about the variability or spread of measurements under the same conditions. It's about consistency, not about detecting small changes.\n\nAccuracy is about whether the measurements are correct, compared to the true value.\n\nSo, going back to the question: the smallest change in the measured variable to which the instrument will respond is likely its resolution. That's the smallest increment it can detect or display.\n\nLet me check online or in a textbook to confirm.\n\nOkay, I found that resolution is indeed the smallest change in the measured variable that the instrument can detect and represent. So, it matches the definition in the question.\n\nAccuracy is about how close the measurements are to the actual value.\n\nPrecision is about the repeatability of the measurements.\n\nSensitivity is about how much the instrument's output changes in response to changes in the input variable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. resolution.\n\nWait, but in some sources, sensitivity is also described as the minimum detectable change. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nLet me look up the definition of sensitivity in measurement instruments.\n\nSensitivity is defined as the ratio of the change in the instrument's indication to the change in the measured variable. So, it's about the slope of the response.\n\nResolution, on the other hand, is about the smallest increment that the instrument can display or detect.\n\nSo, sensitivity is about the responsiveness or gain of the instrument, while resolution is about the granularity of the measurement.\n\nTherefore, the smallest change that the instrument can respond to is more accurately described as resolution.\n\nI think the answer is A. resolution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ resolution}} \\]"
