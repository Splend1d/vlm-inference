                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's about a song called \"The Hayseed\" and how it relates to social developments in the late 1800s. The options are pretty detailed, so I need to understand the song first to see which one fits best.\n\nSo, the song mentions being a \"tool of oppression\" and being \"green as a sucker could be,\" which probably means the speaker was naive or inexperienced, maybe easily taken advantage of. Then, there's talk about monopolies banding together and railroads and party bosses agreeing to beat down a \"poor hayseed like me.\" A hayseed is a country person, often portrayed as simple or unsophisticated. So, the song seems to be about a rural person being exploited by powerful interests like monopolies and political bosses.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n\nThis seems relevant because the song mentions monopolies and political bosses working together, which suggests corruption. The public demanding reform aligns with the idea that people were realizing they were being taken advantage of and wanted change.\n\nB. A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\n\nThis option mentions a movement involving farmers and factory workers, which could include rural people like the \"hayseed\" in the song. However, it specifies exerting leverage over federal legislation, which might be a bit too broad or advanced for the context of the song.\n\nC. The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\n\nThis is interesting. In the late 1800s, there was the Populist Party, which arose in response to the struggles of farmers against big business and banks. Did they win control of Congress within ten years of founding? I think they had some success but maybe not to the extent of controlling Congress.\n\nD. Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n\nThis option focuses on conflicts with American Indians, which might not directly relate to the themes of the song about being exploited by monopolies and political bosses.\n\nGiven the context of the song, option A seems the most directly related because it talks about corruption in government and big business, which is exactly what the song is railing against. The speaker feels oppressed by these powerful entities and seems to be part of a movement against them.\n\nBut let me think more deeply. The song seems to be from the perspective of a farmer or rural person who is being taken advantage of by larger economic and political forces. In the late 1800s, there was a significant movement among farmers called the Populist Party, which advocated for reforms to protect farmers from the excesses of monopolies and banks.\n\nOption B mentions a large-scale movement of farmers and urban workers influencing federal legislation. While that could include the Populists, the song seems more focused on the rural perspective, especially the line about being a \"hayseed.\"\n\nOption C refers to the two-party system breaking down and a new party emerging and taking control of Congress. The Populist Party did have some success in the 1890s, but I don't think they ever controlled Congress. So, this might be a stretch.\n\nOption D is about frontier conflicts, which isn't directly addressed in the song. The song is more about economic oppression than about conflicts with indigenous peoples.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Corruption in government\u2014especially as it related to big business\u2014energized the public to demand increased popular control and reform of local, state, and national governments.\n\nThis aligns closely with the themes in the song and the historical context of the late 1800s, where there was growing awareness and resistance against the influence of monopolies and political corruption affecting ordinary people, particularly farmers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
