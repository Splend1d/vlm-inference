                    "text": "So I've got this passage here from \"Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History,\" and it's about Sultan Musa and his kingdom. He's talking about a town called ZKRY where they have a copper mine, and they send the copper to BYTY. He says they don't levy duty on anything else except this crude copper, and they sell it to the pagan Sudan for two-thirds of its weight in gold. Also, he mentions that there are pagan nations in his kingdom whom he doesn't collect jizya from but instead employs them to extract gold from deposits. They dig pits about a man's height deep and find gold embedded in the sides or at the bottom.\n\nAlright, so this seems to be describing some economic activities in West Africa during the 14th century, based on the date of Al-Umari. Now, the question is asking which statement about the period from 600 to 1450 C.E. is supported by this passage.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nC. Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nD. Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nFirst, I need to see which of these is directly supported by the information in the passage.\n\nStarting with option A: Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nThe passage mentions that Sultan Musa doesn't collect jizya from certain pagan nations but employs them to extract gold. Jizya is a tax historically levied on non-Muslims in Islamic states. So, Musa is interacting with pagan nations without imposing this tax, and instead, they work for him extracting gold. Does this suggest that religion was spread through warfare in this period? Not directly. It seems more like a system of cooperation or employment rather than forced conversion through war. So, I don't think this passage supports the idea that religions were spread through warfare during this period.\n\nMoving on to option B: International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThe passage talks about trading copper for gold with the pagan Sudan. It also mentions that copper is brought to BYTY, and they sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold. This sounds like an established trade route and exchange system. However, the wording of the option suggests that trade connections were still being developed during this period. The passage doesn't provide information about whether these trade connections were new or still developing. It just describes an existing trade relationship. So, while it shows that trade was happening, it doesn't indicate whether it was being developed or expanded at that time.\n\nOption C: Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nThere's no mention of diseases or health issues in the passage. It's entirely about trade and mining activities. So, this option isn't supported by the information provided.\n\nOption D: Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't mention anything about nomadic migrations or the creation of empires. It's focused on the economic activities and trade practices of Sultan Musa's kingdom.\n\nSo, none of the options seem directly supported by the passage. But wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps there's a broader context that I'm missing.\n\nLet me read the passage again to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\n\"Al-Zawawi also said, 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. 'There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.'\"\n\nOkay, so definitely trade and mining are key themes here. But none of the options are directly about trade or mining; they're about broader historical processes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the passage is hinting at something else. Perhaps the interaction between Musa and the pagan nations suggests some form of religious tolerance or cooperation that wasn't always present, indicating that relations between different groups were evolving.\n\nBut that's speculative. The passage simply states that he doesn't collect jizya from them but employs them to extract gold. It doesn't provide context about why he doesn't collect the tax or what the historical background is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trade described is part of a larger network that was still developing during this period. But again, the passage doesn't give enough information to confirm that the trade connections were still being developed.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the time period more carefully. From 600 to 1450 C.E. covers a lot of history, including the rise of Islam, the expansion of trade routes like the Silk Road and the Trans-Saharan trade routes, and various migrations and empire-building.\n\nGiven that Al-Umari was writing around the 14th century, and the passage is about Sultan Musa, who was a famous West African ruler from the Mali Empire, known for his wealth and pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, which attracted a lot of attention due to the vast amount of gold he spent.\n\nSo, in historical context, the Mali Empire was involved in extensive trade, especially in gold and salt, across the Sahara Desert with North Africa and beyond.\n\nBut bringing this historical context in, perhaps some of the options could be supported indirectly.\n\nFor example, option A: Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nWell, Islam did spread across North Africa and into West Africa during this period, but the passage doesn't provide direct evidence of warfare being used to spread religion. Musa was a Muslim ruler who had good relations with pagan nations, employing them to extract gold without collecting jizya, which was a tax on non-Muslims. This seems more like accommodation than forced conversion through warfare.\n\nOption B: International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nGiven that the Mali Empire was a major player in the Trans-Saharan trade, and considering that trade with the Mediterranean world had been ongoing for centuries but was perhaps expanding during this period, it's possible that trade connections were still being developed. However, the passage only describes an existing trade relationship and doesn't indicate whether it was expanding or being developed further.\n\nOption C: Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nAgain, there's no mention of diseases in the passage. While it's known that diseases could spread along trade routes, such as the Black Death along the Silk Road, this specific passage doesn't provide any evidence for that.\n\nOption D: Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nWhile nomadic migrations did play a role in the formation of some empires, like the Mongol Empire in Asia, the passage is about the Mali Empire in West Africa, which was more sedentary with agricultural bases and mining activities. So, again, no direct support from the passage for this option.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that none of the options are directly supported by the passage alone. However, if I had to choose one that's most closely related to the content of the passage, I would lean towards option B: International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThis is because the passage describes a trade relationship involving copper and gold with the pagan Sudan, which suggests that there were ongoing trade connections, possibly being expanded or solidified during this time. Additionally, the mention of selling copper for gold at a specific rate indicates an established trade practice, which could be part of a larger network of trade connections being developed.\n\nBut honestly, none of the options are strongly supported by the passage without making some assumptions or bringing in outside historical knowledge. So, based solely on the information provided in the passage, it's challenging to definitively choose one of these statements.\n\nPerhaps the key here is to recognize that the passage is primarily about trade and economic activities, and among the options, option B is the one that most closely relates to trade connections, even if it doesn't directly confirm that they were still being developed during the period.\n\nTherefore, I would select option B as the statement supported by the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
