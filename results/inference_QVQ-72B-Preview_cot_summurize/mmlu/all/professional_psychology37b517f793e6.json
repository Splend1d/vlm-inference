                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this House's Path-Goal Theory of Leadership. It sounds like it's all about making sure that subordinates are satisfied and motivated by feeling supported by their leader. The question is asking about the instrumental leadership style within this theory.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I grasp what instrumental leadership means in this context. The options are:\n\nA. Establishes supportive relationships with subordinates\n\nB. Includes subordinates in decision-making\n\nC. Provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures\n\nD. Sets challenging goals and encourages higher levels of performance\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A talks about building supportive relationships. That seems important for making subordinates feel valued and heard, which could certainly contribute to their satisfaction and motivation. But is that the main focus of instrumental leadership?\n\nOption B is about including subordinates in decision-making. This could make them feel more invested and motivated because they have a say in how things are done. But again, is this the primary characteristic of instrumental leadership?\n\nOption C mentions providing specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures. This sounds like it's about structure and clarity in how work should be performed. It might help subordinates know exactly what's expected of them, which could reduce confusion and increase efficiency. Maybe this is what instrumental leadership is about\u2014providing clear direction and structure.\n\nOption D is about setting challenging goals and encouraging high performance. This could be motivating for some people who thrive on challenges, but it might also be stressful for others. Still, it's a way to push teams to achieve more.\n\nNow, considering the Path-Goal Theory, which emphasizes that leaders should clear paths and set goals for their subordinates, helping them see the connection between their efforts and rewards, I think option C aligns best with instrumental leadership.\n\nProviding specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures (option C) would help subordinates understand exactly what they need to do to reach those goals and get the desired outcomes. It's like giving them a map or a set of instructions to follow, which can make the path to success clearer and less daunting.\n\nOption A, establishing supportive relationships, is more aligned with a considerate or supportive leadership style, where the leader focuses on the well-being and satisfaction of the subordinates.\n\nOption B, including subordinates in decision-making, sounds more like a participative leadership style, where the leader involves team members in the decision-making process, which can enhance motivation and commitment.\n\nOption D, setting challenging goals and encouraging higher performance, might be closer to an achievement-oriented leadership style, where the leader motivates the team to excel and reach higher standards.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the correct answer is C: provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider the term \"instrumental\" in this context. Instrumental leadership might refer to the leader's role in providing the tools, resources, and directions needed for subordinates to perform their tasks effectively. This aligns with providing guidelines and rules, which are instrumental in achieving objectives.\n\nAlso, in the Path-Goal Theory, leaders are expected to clarify the path to goals and make the journey smoother. Providing clear guidelines and rules is a direct way to achieve that clarity.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
