                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the least common multiple of two integers is 240, and their greatest common divisor is 24. One of the integers is 48, and I need to find the other one. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what LCM and GCD are. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that both of them divide evenly into. The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, given that LCM is 240 and GCD is 24, and one of the numbers is 48, I need to find the other number, which I'll call N.\n\nI think there's a relationship between LCM and GCD of two numbers. I remember that for two numbers A and B, the product of their LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. In other words, LCM(A, B) * GCD(A, B) = A * B.\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm. If I take two numbers, say 12 and 18, their GCD is 6, and their LCM is 36. And 12 * 18 = 216, and 36 * 6 = 216. It matches. Okay, so this seems to be a general property.\n\nSo, if I apply this to my problem, I have LCM = 240 and GCD = 24, and one number A = 48. So, according to the property, LCM * GCD = A * B.\n\nPlugging in the values: 240 * 24 = 48 * B.\n\nSo, I can solve for B: B = (240 * 24) / 48.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 240 * 24. Well, 240 * 20 = 4800, and 240 * 4 = 960, so total is 4800 + 960 = 5760.\n\nNow, 5760 divided by 48. Hmm, let's see. I can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 16. 5760 \u00f7 16 = 360, and 48 \u00f7 16 = 3. So, B = 360 / 3 = 120.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, one of them is 120. So, that seems to be a possible answer. But let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, if B is 120, then GCD of 48 and 120 should be 24, and LCM should be 240.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD of 48 and 120. I can factor both numbers: 48 = 16 * 3 = 2^4 * 3^1, and 120 = 16 * 7.5, no, wait, 120 divided by 10 is 12, and 10 is 2*5, so 120 = 2^3 * 5^1 * 3^0, I think.\n\nWait, better to factor properly: 120 = 2^3 * 3^0 * 5^1, since 120 \u00f7 8 = 15, and 15 is 3*5.\n\nSo, 48 is 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^0, and 120 is 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1.\n\nThe GCD would be the minimum exponents for each prime: min(4,3) for 2, which is 3; min(1,1) for 3, which is 1; and min(0,1) for 5, which is 0.\n\nSo, GCD is 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 8 * 3 = 24. That matches the given GCD.\n\nNow, the LCM is the maximum exponents for each prime: max(4,3) for 2, which is 4; max(1,1) for 3, which is 1; and max(0,1) for 5, which is 1.\n\nSo, LCM is 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 16 * 3 * 5 = 240. That also matches the given LCM.\n\nTherefore, B = 120 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options quickly.\n\nOption A is 1. If B were 1, then LCM would be 48 (since 48 and 1 have LCM 48), and GCD would be 1. But the problem states LCM is 240 and GCD is 24, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is 20. Let's check GCD and LCM of 48 and 20.\n\nFactorizing: 48 = 2^4 * 3, 20 = 2^2 * 5.\n\nGCD: min exponents: 2, 0 for 3, so GCD is 2^2 = 4.\n\nLCM: max exponents: 4, 0 for 3, 1 for 5, so LCM is 2^4 * 3 * 5 = 16 * 3 * 5 = 240.\n\nWait, so GCD is 4, but the problem says GCD is 24. So, this doesn't match.\n\nOption D is 12. Let's check GCD and LCM of 48 and 12.\n\nFactorizing: 48 = 2^4 * 3, 12 = 2^2 * 3.\n\nGCD: min exponents: 2, 1 for 3, so GCD is 2^2 * 3^1 = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nLCM: max exponents: 4, 1 for 3, so LCM is 2^4 * 3 = 16 * 3 = 48.\n\nThis doesn't match the given GCD of 24 and LCM of 240.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits is B, which is 120.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
