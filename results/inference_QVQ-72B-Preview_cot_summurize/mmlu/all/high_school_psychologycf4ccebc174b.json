                    "text": "So I have this question here about people who didn't get along before but are able to put aside their differences when there's a mutual crisis. The question is asking what this need to work together is often referred to as, and the options are a communal goal, a superordinate goal, a subordinate goal, or alliance formation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in this context.\n\nStarting with \"communal goal,\" I think this refers to a shared objective within a community where everyone works together for the common good. Like, everyone in the neighborhood coming together to clean up a park or something. So, in this scenario, if people with past conflicts are working together during a crisis, it might be because they have a communal goal to overcome the crisis.\n\nNext, \"superordinate goal\" sounds familiar. I think it's a concept in social psychology where there's a higher-level objective that overrides smaller conflicts. So, in the face of a bigger problem, people put aside their differences to achieve this superordinate goal. This seems similar to the idea of a communal goal but maybe more specifically about overriding previous conflicts.\n\nThen there's \"subordinate goal.\" I'm a bit less clear on this one. Subordinate usually means lower in rank or importance, so a subordinate goal might be a smaller or less important objective compared to larger ones. In the context of a mutual crisis, it seems like the crisis would be the main goal that everyone is focusing on, so maybe subordinate goals are the smaller tasks within that bigger picture. But I'm not sure if that fits well with the scenario described.\n\nLastly, \"alliance formation\" seems straightforward. It's about people coming together to form a coalition or alliance to achieve a common purpose. This could be in response to a crisis, where former adversaries team up because they share a common enemy or challenge.\n\nSo, considering the scenario where people who haven't gotten along in the past are now working together due to a mutual crisis, which of these terms best fits?\n\nA communal goal seems relevant because it's about working together for the common good, but it feels a bit too general. A superordinate goal seems more precise because it specifically refers to a higher-level objective that brings people together despite their differences. Subordinate goals seem opposite to what's being described, as they relate to lesser objectives. Alliance formation is also a possibility, as it involves forming partnerships to achieve a common aim.\n\nBut between superordinate goal and alliance formation, which one is more accurate?\n\nI recall that in social psychology, the concept of superordinate goals is part of a theory about reducing intergroup conflict. Essentially, when groups have a superordinate goal that they must cooperate to achieve, it can help overcome their previous conflicts and lead to improved relations.\n\nAlliance formation, on the other hand, is more of a general term for groups coming together for a common purpose, which could be temporary and based on the specific crisis at hand.\n\nGiven that the question is referring to a mutual crisis that requires people to work together, and considering the psychological aspect of overcoming past conflicts, I think superordinate goal is the most appropriate term here.\n\nLet me double-check this.\n\nI remember reading about an experiment where children who were in conflict over toys were brought together to work on a project that benefited everyone, like fixing a wagon that they all could use. This helped them overcome their previous disagreements and work cooperatively. That sounds a lot like the scenario described in the question.\n\nSo, in that case, the need to work together in the face of a mutual crisis would be referred to as a superordinate goal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. superordinate goal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
