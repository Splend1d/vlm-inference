No storage check in the external memory C. No processing power check D. No database check.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to understand why C and C++ are susceptible to buffer overflows and which of these options correctly explains that.\n\nFirst off, I know that C and C++ are programming languages that give developers a lot of control over system resources. They're known for their efficiency and flexibility, but with that comes responsibility. One of the downsides is that they don't provide built-in mechanisms to prevent certain types of errors, like buffer overflows.\n\nSo, what is a buffer overflow? It's when a program tries to store more data in a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can handle. This can cause data to overflow into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting other data or code. If a program isn't properly protected, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code or cause the program to crash.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. No string boundary checks in predefined functions\n\nI recall that in C, functions like `strcpy()` and `strcat()` don't automatically check the size of the buffer they're copying or concatenating into. So, if the destination buffer isn't big enough, these functions can write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. C++ inherits a lot from C and doesn't have built-in checks for this either, although some safer string classes are available.\n\nB. No storage check in the external memory\n\nThis seems a bit vague. External memory could refer to anything outside the program's immediate control, like disk storage or network resources. But I don't think this directly relates to buffer overflows. Buffer overflows are more about how data is handled within the program's memory, not about external storage checks.\n\nC. No processing power check\n\nThis one seems off-track. Processing power refers to the computational capabilities of the machine running the program. Buffer overflows are about memory corruption due to overwriting buffers, not about the processing capabilities of the system. So, I don't think this is relevant here.\n\nD. No database check\n\nAgain, this seems unrelated to buffer overflows in C and C++. Database checks would involve ensuring data integrity, query safety, etc., but buffer overflows are more about how data is stored and manipulated in memory, not specifically about database interactions.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most directly relevant. C and C++ don't perform automatic boundary checks on strings, which can lead to buffer overflows if developers aren't careful with functions like `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, and others that handle strings without checking the buffer sizes.\n\nBut, I should think about whether there are other factors at play. For example, in C++, there are safer string classes like `std::string` that handle memory management automatically and include bounds checking. However, it's still possible to use unsafe C-style strings in C++, and not all C++ code uses the standard library's string class.\n\nAdditionally, even with `std::string`, if not used properly, there could be issues. But generally, `std::string` is designed to be safer regarding buffer overflows.\n\nSo, perhaps the main issue is that C and C++ don't inherently provide string boundary checks in their basic string manipulation functions, which can lead to buffer overflows if developers aren't cautious.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Buffer overflows can also occur due to incorrect use of dynamic memory allocation or due to stack-based buffer overflows. For example, allocating a fixed-size buffer on the stack and then writing more data into it than it can handle.\n\nIn C and C++, developers have to manage memory manually, which can lead to such issues if not done correctly. Unlike higher-level languages like Java or Python, which have built-in mechanisms for bounds checking and automatic memory management, C and C++ require explicit management.\n\nHowever, in the context of the given options, none of the other options directly address the issue of buffer overflows related to memory management practices.\n\nTherefore, I believe option A is the correct answer: no string boundary checks in predefined functions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could be indirectly related.\n\nOption B: no storage check in external memory. This might refer to reading or writing data to external storage without proper validation, but that's more about input validation and not specifically about buffer overflows.\n\nOption C: no processing power check. This seems entirely unrelated to buffer overflows. Processing power affects how quickly a program can execute, but buffer overflows are about memory corruption, not processing speed.\n\nOption D: no database check. This would relate more to SQL injection attacks or data integrity issues in databases, not directly to buffer overflows in application development.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the options, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
