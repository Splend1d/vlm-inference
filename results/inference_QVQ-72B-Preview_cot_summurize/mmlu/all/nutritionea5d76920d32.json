                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Supplementation with long-chain fatty acids EPA and DHA during pregnancy and infancy will likely benefit the following: A. Visual performance, B. Motor performance, C. Behaviour disorders, D. Memory.\" I need to figure out which of these options are likely to be benefited by supplementing with EPA and DHA during pregnancy and infancy.\n\nFirst off, I know that EPA and DHA are types of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain and eye development. Since pregnancy and infancy are critical periods for growth and development, it makes sense that supplementing with these fatty acids could have positive effects on various aspects of development.\n\nLet me start by looking up some information about the roles of EPA and DHA in development, especially during pregnancy and infancy.\n\nI recall that DHA is a major component of the retina in the eye and the gray matter in the brain. So, during pregnancy and early life, when the brain and eyes are developing rapidly, getting enough DHA is probably crucial.\n\nOption A is visual performance. Given that DHA is a key component of the retina, it's likely that supplementing with DHA during pregnancy and infancy could benefit visual development and performance.\n\nOption B is motor performance. Motor skills develop a lot during infancy and early childhood. I wonder if EPA and DHA play a role in motor skill development. Maybe indirectly, since they are involved in brain function, and the brain controls motor movements. But I'm not as sure about this one.\n\nOption C is behavior disorders. There's been some research suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids might help with behavior issues, like ADHD, but I'm not sure how strong the evidence is, especially in infants.\n\nOption D is memory. Memory starts developing early in life, and since EPA and DHA are important for brain function, including learning and memory, it's possible that supplementation could benefit memory development.\n\nBut I need to find more specific information to support these ideas.\n\nLet me see if there are any studies or reviews on this topic.\n\nI found that a systematic review looked at the effects of maternal omega-3 LCPUFA (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which include EPA and DHA) supplementation during pregnancy on visual and cognitive development in infants and children. The review found that supplementation may have a small but significant positive effect on visual acuity and some measures of cognitive development, but the evidence was inconsistent for other outcomes.\n\nAnother study suggested that higher maternal DHA intake during pregnancy is associated with better visual and neural development in infants.\n\nRegarding motor performance, I found less direct evidence. However, since motor skills are closely tied to neural development, and DHA is important for neural function, it's possible that supplementation could influence motor development indirectly.\n\nFor behavior disorders, there is some research indicating that omega-3 supplements might help reduce symptoms of ADHD in children, but the evidence isn't definitive, and it's not clear how applicable this is to infants or to prevention during pregnancy.\n\nAs for memory, DHA is known to be important for synaptic function and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory. Therefore, it's plausible that adequate DHA during development could support memory functions.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that visual performance (Option A) and memory (Option D) are the most directly supported by the evidence regarding the benefits of EPA and DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infancy.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the question is asking for the most likely benefit or for all possible benefits.\n\nIf I have to choose among the options, I would say that visual performance and memory are both likely to benefit from EPA and DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infancy.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if there's any specific evidence for motor performance or behavior disorders.\n\nUpon further checking, I found a study that suggests that DHA supplementation during the last trimester of pregnancy may improve motor development in infants. So, maybe Option B is also a likely benefit.\n\nAs for behavior disorders, the evidence seems more mixed, and it's not as strongly linked to early supplementation during pregnancy and infancy as it is to later interventions.\n\nGiven this, I think that Options A, B, and D are all likely to be benefited by EPA and DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infancy, with perhaps less certainty for Option C.\n\nBut if I have to pick one, based on the strength of the evidence, I would go with Option A: visual performance, as it seems to be the most consistently supported by research in this context.\n\nAlternatively, if the question allows for multiple answers, I might choose A, B, and D.\n\nHowever, since the question says \"the following,\" and it's phrased to select one option, I'll go with A: visual performance as the most straightforward benefit supported by research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
