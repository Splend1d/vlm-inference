Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these terms fits the description.\n\nFirst off, let's think about what each term means. Starting with option A, hedonist. I remember that a hedonist is someone who believes in pursuing pleasure and minimizing pain as the primary or most important principle in life. So, it's more about a lifestyle or philosophy centered on pleasure rather than a belief about the existence of God. Doesn't seem to directly address whether someone believes in God or not. Maybe not the right choice here.\n\nNext, option B, deist. I think deism is a belief in a higher power or God who created the universe but does not interfere with it directly. So, a deist believes in God but doesn't necessarily follow any particular religion or believe in divine intervention. That means they do believe in God, just not in the traditional sense maybe. But still, they believe in some form of divine creator. So, this doesn't fit the description of someone who does not believe in the existence of God.\n\nOption C, agnostic. This one can be a bit tricky. Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God or the divine is unknown or cannot be known. So, agnostics are not necessarily atheists or theists; they're more about the knowledge aspect. They might say, \"I don't know if God exists, and maybe it's impossible to know for sure.\" So, they're not actively believing in God but also not dismissing the possibility entirely. They're more uncertain about it.\n\nFinally, option D, atheist. This is the term I think directly fits the description. An atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of God or gods. It's a positive assertion that there is no God. So, unlike agnostics who are uncertain, atheists are certain that there is no God.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other context to this question. Is there a chance that any of these terms could indirectly relate to not believing in God? For example, could a hedonist be an atheist? Well, yes, but hedonism isn't specifically about belief in God; it's about the pursuit of pleasure. Similarly, a deist believes in God, so that's out, and an agnostic is uncertain, which isn't the same as not believing.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is D. atheist. It's the term that specifically describes someone who does not believe in the existence of God.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. atheist}} \\]"
