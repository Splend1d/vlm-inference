                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these words is an adverb? A. hurried, B. fast, C. speedy, D. quickly.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is an adverb. I remember that adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They often end with \"-ly,\" but not always. Let me look at each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A is \"hurried.\" I think \"hurried\" is usually an adjective, like in the phrase \"a hurried meal,\" meaning done quickly or in a rush. But sometimes, it can be used as a verb, like \"she hurried to finish,\" meaning she moved quickly. But in that case, it's acting more like a verb. Wait, but the question is about adverbs.\n\nOption B is \"fast.\" \"Fast\" can be both an adjective and an adverb. As an adjective, it describes something moving quickly, like \"a fast car.\" As an adverb, it describes how something is done, like \"she runs fast.\" So, \"fast\" can be both, depending on how it's used.\n\nOption C is \"speedy.\" \"Speedy\" seems like an adjective to me, describing something that is fast or quick, like \"a speedy recovery.\" I don't think I've heard \"speedy\" used as an adverb often, but maybe in some contexts, it could be. Let me think about that.\n\nOption D is \"quickly.\" This one definitely looks like an adverb because it ends with \"-ly.\" It's commonly used to modify verbs, like \"he worked quickly\" or \"she ate quickly.\" So, this seems like a clear adverb.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these words is an adverb. Since \"quickly\" is clearly an adverb, I'm tempted to choose D. But maybe I should double-check if any of the others could also be considered adverbs.\n\nLet me consider \"hurried\" again. While it can be used in a way that seems like an adverb, like \"she did it hurried,\" I think that's more of a colloquialism or a specific usage. Generally, \"hurried\" functions as an adjective.\n\n\"Fast\" is definitely both an adjective and an adverb, so it could be considered an adverb in certain contexts. However, the question might be looking for the primary function of the word or perhaps the most common usage.\n\n\"Speedy\" seems primarily an adjective to me, describing the quality of speediness. While it might be used adverbially in some sentences, I don't think it's primarily an adverb.\n\n\"Quickly,\" on the other hand, is unmistakably an adverb. It's derived from the adjective \"quick,\" but the \"-ly\" suffix turns it into an adverb.\n\nI think the best answer is D. quickly, as it is unambiguously an adverb, whereas the others can be either adjectives or adverbs depending on context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
