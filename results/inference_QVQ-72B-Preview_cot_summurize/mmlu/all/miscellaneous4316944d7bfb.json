                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the presidential election of 1932. It's asking how many states FDR, that's Franklin D. Roosevelt, did not carry in that election. The options are six, seven, eight, or ten states. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I know that in the 1932 presidential election, FDR ran against the incumbent president, Herbert Hoover. It was a time of the Great Depression, and FDR won in a landslide. But I don't remember exactly how many states he didn't carry. Maybe if I think about the electoral map from that time, I can figure it out.\n\nI recall that FDR was very popular during that election because of his New Deal policies, which aimed to help the country recover from the economic crisis. He won a large majority of the electoral votes, but there were still some states that went to Hoover.\n\nLet me try to recall the geographical distribution. Hoover was from California and had support in some western states. Also, the Northeast was traditionally Republican back then, so maybe some states there went to Hoover.\n\nWait, but FDR was a Democrat from New York, and New York was a big state that he likely carried. But there might have been some northeastern states that stayed loyal to the Republican Party.\n\nLet me see if I can list out the states that Hoover might have won. Starting from the Northeast: Vermont and New Hampshire were pretty Republican back then, so maybe they went to Hoover. Pennsylvania was a big industrial state that might have gone to Hoover, but I think FDR won Pennsylvania in that election.\n\nHmm, maybe not. I think FDR did very well in the industrial North because of his promises to reform the economy. So perhaps Pennsylvania went to FDR.\n\nMoving to the Midwest, states like Ohio, Indiana, Illinois\u2014these were important industrial states as well. I think FDR carried Illinois, but Ohio might have been closer. I think he won Ohio too, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the electoral map from 1932 to get a better idea. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nLet me consider the South. The South was traditionally Democratic back then, part of the \"Solid South,\" so I think FDR carried all the southern states. Is that right? I think so.\n\nIn the West, states like California, Oregon, and Washington\u2014Hoover was from California, so maybe he carried his home state. But I think FDR won California in 1932. Wait, maybe not. I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nLet me think about it differently. I know that in 1932, FDR won 42 states, and Hoover won 6. Wait, is that right? Let me see.\n\nIf FDR won 42 states, and there are 50 states now, but in 1932, there were fewer states, I think. Wait, Alaska and Hawaii weren't states yet, so there were 48 states in 1932.\n\nSo, if FDR won 42 states, then 48 minus 42 would be 6 states that he didn't carry. So, the answer would be six.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my initial assumption is correct. Let me verify this.\n\nI remember that FDR did win 42 states in 1932, losing only 6 to Hoover. The six states were Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Wait, no, that can't be right because I thought FDR won Pennsylvania.\n\nMaybe I'm confusing it with a later election. Let me try to recall the electoral map again.\n\nAfter some reflection, I think that in 1932, FDR won 42 states, while Hoover won 6 states and 1 district. Wait, no, I think it's 6 states in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's different. Let me see if I can recall the list of states Hoover won in 1932.\n\nI think Hoover won Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. That's six states in total.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because I thought FDR won Pennsylvania. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let me try to think of another way to confirm this.\n\nI know that FDR won the election overwhelmingly, so if he won 42 states out of 48, that seems plausible. The remaining 6 would be the ones Hoover won.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be six states that FDR did not carry in the 1932 presidential election.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. six\n\nB. seven\n\nC. eight\n\nD. ten\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there were any other states that might have gone to Hoover.\n\nWait, in some elections, third-party candidates could win states, but in 1932, it was primarily FDR versus Hoover.\n\nI don't recall any third-party victories in that election, so it should just be FDR and Hoover.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be six states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
