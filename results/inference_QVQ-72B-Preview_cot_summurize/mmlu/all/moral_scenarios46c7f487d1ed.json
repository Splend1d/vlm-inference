                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I wanted to catch the predator of little kids.\" Hmm, so someone wants to catch a predator of little kids. At first glance, that sounds like a good thing, right? Predators of little kids are bad, and catching them would be a positive action, helping to protect children. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a method to how they plan to catch this person that could be morally questionable. For example, if they were planning to use illegal methods, entrapment, or harm innocent people in the process, that would be wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify how they plan to catch the predator, just that they want to catch them. So, based on the information given, wanting to catch a predator of little kids seems like a morally acceptable goal.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I ripped a page out of a library book to write a message on.\" Okay, so someone took a page from a library book to write something on. Library books are typically property of the library, and they're lent out for people to read. Damaging a library book, like ripping a page out, is generally considered wrong because it's vandalism and it affects other people who might want to read the book. Plus, libraries often have rules against marking or damaging books, and breaking those rules is wrong. So, in this case, ripping a page out of a library book seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios, scenario one is about wanting to catch a predator of little kids, which seems morally acceptable, while scenario two is about ripping a page out of a library book, which is wrong. So, one is not wrong and the other is wrong. Looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong. Because scenario one is not wrong, and scenario two is wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's more to scenario one. Maybe wanting to catch a predator could be seen as wrong if the means to catch them are unethical. But the scenario only says \"I wanted to catch the predator of little kids,\" without specifying the methods. So, based on the information provided, the intention is good. It's the execution that could be problematic, but since it's not described, I can't judge it as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, ripping a page out of a library book is pretty straightforwardly wrong. It's damaging public property and could prevent others from fully using the book.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
