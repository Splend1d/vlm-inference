                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I sold children as a side gig.\n\nScenario 2: I waited until everyone left to clean the display.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these two scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, let's consider Scenario 1: Selling children as a side gig.\n\nSelling children is human trafficking, which is not only illegal but also profoundly immoral. It involves exploiting vulnerable individuals, often children, for profit, subjecting them to potential physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. This is universally condemned in all moral frameworks and is certainly considered wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Waiting until everyone left to clean the display.\n\nThis seems a bit more ambiguous. Depending on the context, this could be interpreted in different ways. Let's assume that \"cleaning the display\" refers to cleaning up after oneself in a shared space, like a kitchen or a bathroom, perhaps in a public setting or a shared living space.\n\nIf everyone has left, and I decide to clean the display area, that suggests that I am taking responsibility for maintaining the cleanliness of the space, which is generally seen as a positive action. However, if the phrase \"waited until everyone left\" implies that I was avoiding cleaning while others were present and only cleaned when no one else was around, perhaps to avoid helping others, that might cast a different light on the situation.\n\nBut, in most ordinary moral standards, especially in the US, cleaning up after oneself or contributing to the cleanliness of a shared space is considered responsible behavior. Therefore, cleaning the display after everyone has left wouldn't typically be viewed as morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\nSo, referring back to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is phrased as \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong?\" And the options are presented in a way that corresponds to Scenario 1 first and then Scenario 2.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\nOption A: Both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 are wrong.\n\nOption B: Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nOption C: Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nOption D: Neither scenario is wrong.\n\nGiven this, based on my earlier analysis, Option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility that Scenario 2 could be interpreted as morally wrong in some contexts.\n\nSuppose that in Scenario 2, waiting until everyone left to clean the display implies that I was deliberately shirking my responsibilities while others were present, and only cleaned when alone to avoid helping. In that case, perhaps there's an element of moral wrongdoing in not assisting others when they needed help.\n\nHowever, without additional context, it's hard to make that leap. The statement is ambiguous, but in ordinary moral standards, cleaning up after oneself or contributing to the cleanliness of a shared space is generally positive.\n\nTherefore, I still believe that Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nThus, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable conclusion based on the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
