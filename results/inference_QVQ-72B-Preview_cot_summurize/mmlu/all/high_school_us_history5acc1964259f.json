Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's a bit tricky because it involves connecting a historical testimony from 1865 with ideas from Alexander Hamilton in Federalist #15. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the excerpt is from Colonel Samuel Thomas's congressional testimony in 1865, right after the Civil War. It's about the treatment of freed slaves and the persistent racism in Southern society. He describes how white people still view Black people as property, not as equals with rights, and that there's a widespread attitude that once whites regain control, they'll make life very difficult for Blacks.\n\nNow, the question is asking which factor Alexander Hamilton believed was a source of problems, as mentioned in Federalist #15. Federalist #15 is part of The Federalist Papers, written to support the ratification of the United States Constitution. Hamilton, along with James Madison and John Jay, argued for a stronger central government.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Economic class divisions preventing a unified vision among the American people.\n\nB. Failure to abandon mercantilist principles and embrace laissez-faire trade.\n\nC. A weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession with religion and individual salvation, hindering practical problem-solving.\n\nGiven that Federalist #15 is focused on the need for a stronger national government to handle issues like taxation and public credit, option C seems relevant. Hamilton was a strong advocate for a more powerful central government that could address the economic and political challenges facing the young nation.\n\nBut let's look at each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: Economic class divisions.\n\nWhile Hamilton was aware of economic differences, his primary concern in The Federalist Papers was the structure of government, particularly the need for a stronger central government to manage issues like debt and defense. So, while class divisions might be a problem, it's not the main issue he addresses in Federalist #15.\n\nOption B: Failure to embrace laissez-faire trade.\n\nHamilton was known for his economic views, and in some of his writings, he did advocate for a more active role for the government in the economy, particularly in manufacturing and trade. However, Federalist #15 is more about the constitutional structure and the need for a strong central government to manage financial affairs, not specifically about trade policies.\n\nOption C: A weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\nThis seems spot on. Federalist #15 is part of a series of essays that make the case for a stronger federal government. Hamilton argues that the Articles of Confederation were insufficient and that a more robust constitutional framework was necessary to handle the complexities of governing the nation.\n\nOption D: An unhealthy obsession with religion and individual salvation.\n\nThis doesn't align with the focus of The Federalist Papers. While Hamilton was a person of his time and may have had views on religion, The Federalist Papers are political documents focused on the mechanics of government, not on religious matters.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider the context of Federalist #15.\n\nFederalist #15 is titled \"The Same Subject Continued: The Union as a Defense against Foreign Danger\" and discusses the importance of a united states system to defend against external threats. It also touches on the need for a strong central government to manage financial obligations and prevent economic crises.\n\nIn this context, the weak central government (option C) would indeed be a source of problems, as it wouldn't be able to effectively defend the country or manage its finances.\n\nOption A, economic class divisions, might be a problem, but it's not the primary focus of Federalist #15.\n\nOption B, trade policies, is related to economics but again not the main thrust of the essay.\n\nOption D, religion and individual salvation, is entirely unrelated to the subject matter of Federalist #15.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\nBut wait a minute, the question says \"which of the following factors did Alexander Hamilton believe was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15?\" The excerpt, however, is from Colonel Samuel Thomas's congressional testimony in 1865, not from Federalist #15.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe the question is asking which factor Hamilton believed was a source of problems, in general, based on his writings, particularly Federalist #15.\n\nGiven that, and considering that Hamilton advocated for a stronger central government to address issues like defense and finance, option C still seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to link Hamilton's views with the issues faced after the Civil War, suggesting that Hamilton would have seen the weak central government as a root cause of the persistent racism and mistreatment of freed slaves.\n\nThat could be a stretch, but it's plausible that a stronger central government, as advocated by Hamilton, might have been better equipped to enforce civil rights and protections for freed slaves.\n\nIn any case, based on Hamilton's writings in The Federalist Papers, particularly Federalist #15, his main concern was the need for a stronger central government to handle national defense and financial stability.\n\nTherefore, the factor he believed was a source of problems is a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues\u2014option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
