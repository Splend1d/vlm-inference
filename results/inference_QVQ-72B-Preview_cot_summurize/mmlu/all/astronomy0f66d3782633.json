                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about figuring out how far away a rock is from the rover on Mars. The rock is supposed to be about 5 cm tall, and it has an angular size of about 0.5 degrees, which is roughly 30 pixels. I need to find out the distance to this rock. The options are about 6 meters, 6 feet, 10 meters, or 10 feet.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how angular size relates to actual size and distance. I think there's a formula for that. Let me see... angular size, actual size, and distance are related in a right triangle, where the tangent of the angular size is equal to the opposite side (the height of the rock) divided by the adjacent side (the distance to the rock).\n\nSo, mathematically, that's:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = opposite / adjacent\n\nIn this case, \u03b8 is the angular size, which is 0.5 degrees. The opposite side is the height of the rock, which is 5 cm, and the adjacent side is the distance to the rock, which I need to find.\n\nWait a minute, but angular size is usually measured in radians for these formulas. So, I should convert degrees to radians first.\n\nI know that 180 degrees is \u03c0 radians, so 0.5 degrees is (0.5 * \u03c0) / 180 radians.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.5 degrees * (\u03c0 / 180) = 0.5 * 3.1416 / 180 = 0.5 * 0.0174533 = approximately 0.00872665 radians.\n\nNow, using the small angle approximation, where for small angles, tan(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 (in radians), especially since 0.5 degrees is a small angle.\n\nSo, tan(0.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.00872665 \u2248 \u03b8 (in radians).\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = opposite / adjacent = 5 cm / distance in cm.\n\nSo, distance in cm = 5 / \u03b8 \u2248 5 / 0.00872665 \u2248 573.5 cm.\n\nWait, that seems too far. Let me check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for angular size:\n\nangular size (in radians) = (actual size) / (distance)\n\nSo, \u03b8 = s / d, where s is the size of the object, and d is the distance.\n\nRearranged, d = s / \u03b8.\n\nGiven that, with s = 5 cm and \u03b8 \u2248 0.00872665 radians, then d \u2248 5 / 0.00872665 \u2248 573.5 cm.\n\nThat's about 5.735 meters, which is roughly 6 meters.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the distance is about 6 meters.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the pixel size.\n\nIt says the angular size is about 30 pixels. So, if 30 pixels correspond to 0.5 degrees, then each pixel corresponds to 0.5 / 30 = approximately 0.01667 degrees per pixel.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I need to relate the pixel size to the actual size.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula:\n\nangular size (in radians) = (pixel size) * (field of view in radians) / (number of pixels)\n\nBut I don't have information about the field of view or the number of pixels in the image.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the angular size corresponds to the height of the rock in the image.\n\nIf the rock is 5 cm tall and has an angular size of 0.5 degrees, then the distance can be calculated as before, which is about 6 meters.\n\nBut let's double-check if the units are consistent.\n\nThe height of the rock is given in centimeters, and the angular size in degrees. The distance should be in centimeters, which then converts to meters.\n\nYes, 573.5 cm is 5.735 meters, which rounds to about 6 meters.\n\nSo, option A, about 6 meters, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other factor I should consider, like the curvature of Mars or something, but given the small size and distance, I think that's negligible.\n\nAlso, the other options are 6 feet, 10 meters, and 10 feet.\n\n6 feet is approximately 1.8288 meters, which is close to 6 meters but not exactly the same.\n\n10 meters is obviously more than 6 meters, and 10 feet is about 3.048 meters.\n\nGiven that my calculation points to about 6 meters, and considering the options, I think A. About 6 meters is the closest answer.\n\nSo, I'll go with A. About 6 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ About } 6 \\text{ meters}} \\]"
