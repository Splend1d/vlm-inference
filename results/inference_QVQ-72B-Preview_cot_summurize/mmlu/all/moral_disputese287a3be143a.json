                    "text": " So I'm reading this question about Singer and his views on the principle of equal consideration of interests. It's asking which historical philosopher recognized that this principle applies not just to humans but also to other species. The options are Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what \"equal consideration of interests\" means in this context. I think it's about treating the interests of different beings equally, without giving extra weight to the interests of one species over another just because of species membership. So, it's about recognizing that a non-human animal's interests are just as important as a human's interests if they are capable of similar experiences.\n\nNow, let's think about each philosopher:\n\nStarting with Immanuel Kant. I know Kant is famous for his ethics, particularly his categorical imperative. He emphasized rationality as the basis for moral worth. In fact, he argued that only rational beings have intrinsic value, and since animals aren't rational, they don't have intrinsic value in his ethical system. So, according to Kant, animals don't have rights or interests in the same way humans do. That seems to suggest that he didn't extend equal consideration of interests to other species. So, probably not him.\n\nNext, Aristotle. He's often considered the father of Western philosophy. His view of the world was hierarchical, with humans at the top of the natural order. He believed in a teleological view, where each being has a purpose or function. For Aristotle, animals were created to serve human needs, and slavery was also justified based on natural differences. So, his philosophy doesn't seem to support equal consideration for the interests of other species. Probably not him either.\n\nThen there's Jeremy Bentham. He's known for his utilitarianism, which proposes that the moral worth of an action is determined by its utility in maximizing happiness and reducing suffering. A famous quote from Bentham is, \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" This suggests that he recognized the capacity to suffer as the relevant criterion for moral consideration, not species membership. So, he seems to be advocating for considering the interests of animals on par with humans, as long as they can suffer. That sounds promising.\n\nLastly, John Stuart Mill. He was also a utilitarian, building on Bentham's ideas. Mill believed in individual liberty and the greatest happiness principle. However, when it comes to animals, while he did express concern for their welfare, his primary focus was on human happiness. I don't recall him explicitly extending equal consideration to the interests of other species in the same way Bentham did.\n\nGiven this brief overview, Bentham seems to be the one who most clearly recognized that the principle of equal consideration of interests applies to both humans and other species. So, my answer would be C. Jeremy Bentham.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Kant prioritized rationality, which animals lack; Aristotle had a hierarchical view with humans on top; Mill, while he cared about animals, primarily focused on human welfare. Bentham, on the other hand, based moral consideration on the ability to suffer, which he saw as a universal capacity among sentient beings, including animals.\n\nYeah, I think Bentham is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
