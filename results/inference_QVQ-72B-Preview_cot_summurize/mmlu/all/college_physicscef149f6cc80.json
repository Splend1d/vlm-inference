                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about radioactive decay measurements. So, a student measures the disintegration of a long-lived radioactive isotope for 10 seconds, with each measurement being 1 second long. The counts are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. I need to figure out how long the student should count to determine the decay rate with an uncertainty of 1%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The decay rate is the number of disintegrations per unit time, right? And since it's a random process, there's some statistical uncertainty in the measurements. The uncertainty should be within 1% of the actual rate.\n\nI recall that for counting statistics, the uncertainty in the count rate is given by the square root of the number of counts. So, if I have a count of N, the uncertainty \u03c3 is \u03c3 = \u221aN. To express this as a percentage of the count rate, I can use \u03c3/N.\n\nGiven that, I need the relative uncertainty to be 1%, so \u03c3/N = 0.01.\n\nSo, \u221aN / N = 0.01.\n\nSimplifying that, \u221aN / N = 1 / N^(1/2) / N = N^(-1/2) / N = N^(-3/2).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's try again.\n\nActually, \u221aN / N = (N^(1/2)) / N = N^(1/2 - 1) = N^(-1/2).\n\nSo, N^(-1/2) = 0.01.\n\nTo solve for N, I can take both sides to the power of -2:\n\n(N^(-1/2))^-2 = N = 0.01^-2 = 10000.\n\nSo, N = 10000 counts.\n\nNow, I need to find out how long to count to accumulate 10000 counts.\n\nBut first, let's find the average count rate from the initial 10 measurements.\n\nThe counts are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5.\n\nThe total count is 3+0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5 = Let's add them up step by step:\n\n3 + 0 = 3\n\n3 + 2 = 5\n\n5 + 1 = 6\n\n6 + 2 = 8\n\n8 + 4 = 12\n\n12 + 0 = 12\n\n12 + 1 = 13\n\n13 + 2 = 15\n\n15 + 5 = 20\n\nSo, total counts in 10 seconds is 20.\n\nThe average count rate is total counts divided by total time, which is 20 counts per 10 seconds, or 2 counts per second.\n\nSo, if the average count rate is 2 counts per second, to get 10000 counts, I need to count for 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 80 s\n\nB. 160 s\n\nC. 2,000 s\n\nD. 5,000 s\n\nSo, 5000 seconds seems to be option D.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the relative uncertainty is \u03c3/N = \u221aN / N = 1/\u221aN, and we set this equal to 0.01.\n\nSo, 1/\u221aN = 0.01\n\nThen, \u221aN = 1/0.01 = 100\n\nTherefore, N = (100)^2 = 10000\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, with an average count rate of 2 counts per second, time T = N / rate = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the count rate is really constant or if there's any systematic error, but the problem states it's a long-lived radioactive isotope, so the decay rate should be constant over the measurement time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the uncertainty in the average count rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the standard deviation of the mean to get a better estimate of the count rate uncertainty.\n\nLet me recall that the standard deviation of the mean is \u03c3/\u221an, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the individual measurements, and n is the number of measurements.\n\nFirst, I need to find the standard deviation of the counts.\n\nThe counts are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWait, no, the actual counts are: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean count per second.\n\nMean \u03bc = total counts / number of measurements = 20 / 10 = 2 counts per second.\n\nNow, the variance \u03c3\u00b2 is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.\n\nSo, \u03c3\u00b2 = [(3-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (5-2)^2 ] / 10\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1)^2 = 1\n\n(-2)^2 = 4\n\n(0)^2 = 0\n\n(-1)^2 = 1\n\n(0)^2 = 0\n\n(2)^2 = 4\n\n(-2)^2 = 4\n\n(-1)^2 = 1\n\n(0)^2 = 0\n\n(3)^2 = 9\n\nNow, sum of these squares: 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 9 = Let's add them up:\n\n1 + 4 = 5\n\n5 + 0 = 5\n\n5 + 1 = 6\n\n6 + 0 = 6\n\n6 + 4 = 10\n\n10 + 4 = 14\n\n14 + 1 = 15\n\n15 + 0 = 15\n\n15 + 9 = 24\n\nSo, \u03c3\u00b2 = 24 / 10 = 2.4\n\nThus, \u03c3 = \u221a2.4 \u2248 1.549 counts per second.\n\nNow, the standard deviation of the mean is \u03c3/\u221an = 1.549 / \u221a10 \u2248 1.549 / 3.162 \u2248 0.49\n\nSo, the uncertainty in the mean count rate is approximately 0.49 counts per second.\n\nBut the problem is about establishing the rate to an uncertainty of 1%, not about the uncertainty in the mean count rate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nThe question is about the uncertainty in the total count, not about the uncertainty in the mean count rate.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to myself.\n\nWe have 10 one-second measurements of disintegrations: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5.\n\nTotal counts: 20 in 10 seconds, so average count rate is 2 counts per second.\n\nWe need to determine how long to count to get a total count with an uncertainty of 1%.\n\nThe total count N should be such that \u221aN / N = 1/\u221aN = 0.01, so \u221aN = 100, thus N = 10000.\n\nGiven the average count rate is 2 counts per second, time T = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 5,000 s.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe considering the standard error in the mean or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the relative uncertainty in the mean count rate.\n\nIf I have n measurements, each with their own uncertainty, the relative uncertainty in the mean is \u03c3/\u221an, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the individual counts.\n\nBut in this case, each count is a Poisson process, and \u03c3 = \u221aN.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn Poisson statistics, the variance is equal to the mean.\n\nSo, for each one-second measurement, the mean and variance are both equal to the count rate per second, which we've estimated as 2 counts per second.\n\nThe relative uncertainty in a single measurement is \u221aN / N = 1/\u221aN.\n\nBut since we're making multiple measurements, the total count over T seconds is N_total = rate * T, with \u03c3_total = \u221a(rate * T).\n\nThe relative uncertainty is then \u03c3_total / N_total = (\u221a(rate * T)) / (rate * T) = 1 / \u221a(rate * T).\n\nWe want this relative uncertainty to be 0.01.\n\nSo, 1 / \u221a(rate * T) = 0.01\n\nThen, \u221a(rate * T) = 100\n\nSquare both sides: rate * T = 10000\n\nSo, T = 10000 / rate\n\nFrom earlier, rate = 2 counts per second, so T = 10000 / 2 = 5000 seconds.\n\nAgain, this points to answer D.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that the initial 10 measurements are just a sample, and the true count rate might be different.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, and assuming that the sample is representative, 5000 seconds seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the uncertainty in the mean count rate and propagate that uncertainty to the total count.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nThe mean count rate is 2 counts per second, with a standard deviation \u03c3 = \u221a2 \u2248 1.414 counts per second.\n\nWait, no.\n\nEach measurement is a count in one second, so the variance of each measurement is equal to the mean count rate, which is 2 counts per second.\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of each measurement is \u221a2 \u2248 1.414 counts.\n\nWith n = 10 measurements, the standard deviation of the mean is \u03c3_mean = \u03c3 / \u221an = 1.414 / \u221a10 \u2248 0.447 counts per second.\n\nNow, if I want the uncertainty in the total count over T seconds to be 1%, I need to consider the total count N = rate * T, with uncertainty \u03c3_N = \u221a(rate * T).\n\nBut I also need to account for the uncertainty in the rate estimate.\n\nThis is getting complicated, and I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nPerhaps the simplest and most straightforward approach is to consider that the total count N should have a relative uncertainty of 1%, so N = 10000 counts, and with a rate of 2 counts per second, T = 5000 seconds.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with answer D. 5,000 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
