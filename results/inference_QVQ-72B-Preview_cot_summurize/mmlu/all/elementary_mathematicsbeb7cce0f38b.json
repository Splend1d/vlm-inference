                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here: Roya paid $48 for 12 cartons of orange juice. I need to find the unit rate per carton. The options are $3, $4, $6, and $12. Hmm, unit rate usually means how much one unit costs, right? So, in this case, it should be the cost per carton.\n\nAlright, to find the cost per carton, I need to divide the total cost by the number of cartons. That makes sense. So, total cost is $48, and there are 12 cartons. Let me divide 48 by 12.\n\nLet's do that division: 48 divided by 12. Well, 12 times 4 is 48, so 48 divided by 12 equals 4. So, each carton costs $4.\n\nLet me double-check that. Maybe I can think of it another way to be sure. If each carton costs $4, then 12 cartons would cost 12 times 4, which is $48. Yes, that matches the total amount Roya paid. So, it seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the question. It says \"unit rate per carton of orange juice that Roya paid.\" I don't think there are any tricks here; it seems straightforward. It's just about finding the cost per single carton.\n\nI should also consider the units to make sure I'm answering correctly. The total cost is in dollars, and the number of cartons is given, so dividing them should give the cost per carton in dollars per carton. Yes, that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll look at the options again: A. $3, B. $4, C. $6, D. $12. Since I calculated $4, that should be the correct answer. But let's see what would happen if I made a mistake.\n\nIf I mistakenly divided 48 by 12 incorrectly, say, thinking 12 times 3 is 36, which is less than 48, so that can't be right. Or 12 times 5 is 60, which is more than 48. So, 4 is indeed the correct quotient.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that maybe there's a discount or something, but the problem doesn't mention any discounts or additional costs. So, I think it's safe to assume that the total cost is simply the product of the unit price and the number of cartons.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for unit rate, which is total cost divided by the number of units. So, unit rate = total cost / number of cartons = $48 / 12 cartons = $4 per carton. Yep, that's straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that the correct answer is $4 per carton.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ \\$4} \\]"
