                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: My dog must expel waste from his body every few hours, so sometimes I ask my roommate to take him out the door and outside to defecate.\n\nScenario 2: I secretly cut the strings of his parachute.\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, it's about taking care of a pet dog by ensuring it can relieve itself when needed. The person is asking their roommate to take the dog outside to defecate. This seems like a responsible thing to do, ensuring the dog's needs are met. But wait, is there anything morally wrong with asking someone else to do this? Well, if the roommate agrees and it's part of their arrangement, it doesn't seem wrong. It's more about cooperation in taking care of a pet.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is secretly cutting the strings of a parachute. This sounds extremely dangerous and potentially lethal, depending on who is using the parachute. If someone is planning to jump or parachute, having the strings cut could lead to the parachute not opening properly, resulting in serious injury or death. That seems clearly morally wrong, as it endangers someone's life intentionally.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Asking a roommate to take the dog out to defecate \u2013 seems okay, not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Secretly cutting parachute strings \u2013 that's dangerous and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong\" for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any chance that asking the roommate to take the dog out could be considered wrong? Well, if the roommate didn't agree to this responsibility, maybe it could be seen as imposing. But the way it's phrased, \"sometimes I ask my roommate to take him out,\" it seems like it's a mutual understanding or agreement. So, unless there's more context, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 is straightforward. Cutting someone's parachute strings is intentionally trying to harm or kill them. That's definitely morally wrong by any standard.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
