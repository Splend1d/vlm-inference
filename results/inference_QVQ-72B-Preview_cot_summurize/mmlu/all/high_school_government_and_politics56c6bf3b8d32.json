                    "text": "So I have this question about the House Committee on Ways and Means. I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me see, I know that committees in Congress are responsible for specific areas, like infrastructure or banking. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of each committee's responsibilities.\n\nFirst, option A says that its primary role is to appropriate spending for infrastructure projects. Hmm, I thought that appropriations committees handled spending, but I'm not sure if Ways and Means is one of them. Maybe I should look into that.\n\nOption B says it's the primary author of congressional banking reform legislation. I recall that banking is more related to financial services and regulation, which might fall under another committee. Maybe the Financial Services Committee? I need to confirm that.\n\nOption C mentions that it allocates funding for canals and waterways. That sounds like it might be related to transportation or public works. Again, I'm not sure if Ways and Means is directly responsible for that.\n\nOption D states that its jurisdiction includes the tax system. Now, that rings a bell. I think Ways and Means is involved with taxes, but I should make sure.\n\nLet me try to recall what the House Committee on Ways and Means is all about. I think \"ways and means\" refers to finding ways to generate revenue, which would involve taxes. So, that aligns with option D. But just because it makes sense doesn't mean it's definitely correct. I should double-check.\n\nI remember that in the House of Representatives, the Ways and Means Committee is one of the oldest and most powerful committees. It has jurisdiction over all taxes, tariffs, and other income measures. So, that definitely includes the tax system. That seems to confirm option D.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options again. Option A talks about appropriating spending for infrastructure. I think appropriations committees are separate and handle spending, but I need to verify if Ways and Means is involved in that.\n\nUpon thinking more, I recall that appropriations committees are responsible for allocating federal funds to various government agencies and programs. Infrastructure spending would likely fall under one of those committees, perhaps the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. So, probably not directly under Ways and Means.\n\nOption B mentions banking reform legislation. I think the Financial Services Committee is more involved with banking and financial institutions. In fact, I believe they oversee banking regulations and reforms. So, again, that seems less likely to be under Ways and Means.\n\nOption C is about allocating funding for canals and waterways. That sounds like it could be related to transportation or public works. Maybe the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee handles that? I think they deal with infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, and waterways.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D seems to be the correct answer. The House Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction over the tax system. The other options describe responsibilities that likely fall under different committees.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about a recent example. I recall that the Ways and Means Committee was heavily involved in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a major tax reform bill. That further supports the idea that they handle tax-related matters.\n\nTherefore, the true statement is option D: its jurisdiction includes the tax system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
