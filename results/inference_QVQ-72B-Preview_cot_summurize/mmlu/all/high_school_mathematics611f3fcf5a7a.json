                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. Ben rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and I need to find the probability that exactly two of them show an even number. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four 20-sided dice. Since each die has 20 faces and they're all fair, each die is independent, and the total number of possible outcomes is 20^4. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many ways exactly two of the four dice can show an even number. So, for each die, there are even and odd possibilities. Let's think about the probability of getting an even number on a single die first.\n\nA 20-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 20. Half of these numbers are even, right? So, there are 10 even numbers and 10 odd numbers on each die. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on one die is 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, since there are four dice, and I want exactly two of them to show an even number, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. The number of ways to choose which two dice show even numbers is given by the combination formula C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of trials and k is the number of successful trials.\n\nHere, n = 4 dice and k = 2 dice showing even numbers. So, the number of ways to choose which two dice show even numbers is C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2!) / (2! \u00d7 2!) = 6 ways.\n\nNow, for each of these 6 ways, the probability for each specific combination is (1/2)^4, since each die is independent and the probability for each die is 1/2.\n\nWait a minute, but not quite. Actually, for each specific combination, the probability should be (1/2)^4, but in binomial probability, the overall probability is C(n,k) * (p^k) * (q^{n-k}), where p is the probability of success (even number), and q is the probability of failure (odd number).\n\nIn this case, p = 1/2, q = 1/2, n = 4, and k = 2.\n\nSo, the probability is C(4,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^{4-2} = 6 * (1/2)^4.\n\nCalculating (1/2)^4 = 1/16, and 6 * (1/16) = 6/16, which simplifies to 3/8.\n\nSo, the probability should be 3/8.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is 3/8, but there's also option A, which is 5/24, and others. I need to make sure I haven't made any mistakes here.\n\nLet me double-check. The total number of outcomes is 20^4, which is 160000.\n\nNow, for favorable outcomes, I need exactly two dice to show even numbers and two to show odd numbers.\n\nNumber of ways to choose which two dice show even numbers: C(4,2) = 6.\n\nThen, for those two dice, each has 10 even numbers, so number of ways for them is 10^2 = 100.\n\nFor the other two dice, they must show odd numbers, and each has 10 odd numbers, so number of ways for them is 10^2 = 100.\n\nTherefore, total favorable outcomes are 6 * 100 * 100 = 6 * 10000 = 60000.\n\nTotal possible outcomes are 20^4 = 160000.\n\nTherefore, probability is 60000 / 160000 = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this, maybe to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of binomial probability, as I did before.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly k successes (even numbers) in n independent trials (dice rolls) is C(n,k) * p^k * q^{n-k}, where p is the probability of success on a single trial, and q is 1 - p.\n\nHere, n = 4, k = 2, p = 1/2, q = 1/2.\n\nSo, probability = C(4,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6 * 1/16 = 3/8.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the probability for each die and how they combine.\n\nFirst die: even or odd, each with probability 1/2.\n\nSecond die: even or odd, each with probability 1/2.\n\nAnd so on for the third and fourth dice.\n\nBut I need exactly two even and two odd.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange two even and two odd is C(4,2) = 6.\n\nEach arrangement has probability (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\n\nSo, total probability is 6 * 1/16 = 3/8.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nMaybe I should consider the problem in terms of dependent or independent events, but in this case, since each die roll is independent, the binomial probability approach seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, I could list all possible combinations and count the favorable ones, but that would be time-consuming with 20 sides on each die.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think about it in terms of the number of even and odd outcomes.\n\nEach die has 10 even and 10 odd numbers.\n\nSo, for four dice, the total number of ways to get exactly two even and two odd is:\n\nNumber of ways to choose positions for even numbers: C(4,2) = 6.\n\nNumber of even number possibilities for those two positions: 10^2 = 100.\n\nNumber of odd number possibilities for the other two positions: 10^2 = 100.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes: 6 * 100 * 100 = 60000.\n\nTotal possible outcomes: 20^4 = 160000.\n\nProbability: 60000 / 160000 = 3/8.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/8, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but option D is 5/8. Is there any chance I missed something?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I calculate the probability that a single die shows an even number, which is 1/2, as established.\n\nThen, for four independent dice, the probability that exactly two show even numbers follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=4 and p=1/2.\n\nThe probability is C(4,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/16) = 3/8.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the complement rule, but that might not be helpful here since the complement involves cases where fewer than two or more than two dice show even numbers, which seems more complicated.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 3/8, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
