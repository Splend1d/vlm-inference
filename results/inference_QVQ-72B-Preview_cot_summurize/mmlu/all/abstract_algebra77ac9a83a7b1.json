                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Hmm, 0 doesn't seem right because that would imply the fields are equal, which they're not. So, probably not A.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what this extension is. We have \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) as our base field, and we're adjoining \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) to it. So, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) is the smallest field containing \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{18}\\).\n\nFirst, I should recall that the degree of a field extension \\([L:K]\\) is the dimension of \\(L\\) as a vector space over \\(K\\). So, I need to find the dimension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nOne approach is to use the tower law for field extensions. If I can express the extension as a tower of simpler extensions, I can multiply their degrees to get the total degree.\n\nSo, let's consider the extensions step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p = 2\\). So, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}): \\mathbb{Q}] = 2\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is \\(x^2 - 3\\), assuming that \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{2}^2 = 2\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) can't be expressed in terms of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) without introducing \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), I think this is okay. So, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}): \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2\\). Therefore, by the tower law, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}): \\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\). I need to find \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18}): \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})]\\).\n\nFirst, let's see if \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\). \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), since \\(\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 2} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNow, since \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) contains \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), and rational numbers like 3, it certainly contains \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{18}\\). Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), so adjoining it doesn't increase the degree of the extension.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), and thus \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18}): \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}): \\mathbb{Q}] = 4\\).\n\nWait a minute, but one of the options is 6, which might be tempting if I didn't realize that \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) was already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\). So, it's good that I checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at this. Let's consider the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), but that might be more complicated.\n\nAnother approach: since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), and both 3 and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Wait, but 3 is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), so their product is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). But earlier, I had \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), not just \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Wait, perhaps I need to be more careful.\n\nLet me re-examine this. \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\). Since 3 is a rational number, and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). But wait, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) contains all elements of the form \\(a + b\\sqrt{2}\\), where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). So, \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). However, in the earlier step, I considered \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), which already contains \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and thus \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) as well, since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), and 3 is rational.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to compute the degree directly.\n\nLet me consider the basis of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), and both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) are involved, perhaps I can express the extension in terms of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) only.\n\nWait, but \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is already involved through \\(\\sqrt{18}\\), since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), but 3 is rational, so it's already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). But \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), unless \\(\\sqrt{3} = a + b\\sqrt{2}\\) for some rationals \\(a, b\\), which would require \\(3 = (a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2b^2\\). Equating rational and irrational parts, we get \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 3\\) and \\(2ab = 0\\). This implies either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(b = 0\\). If \\(a = 0\\), then \\(2b^2 = 3\\), so \\(b^2 = 3/2\\), which isn't rational. If \\(b = 0\\), then \\(a^2 = 3\\), which also isn't rational. Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), so \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) is a proper extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), and indeed, as I had earlier, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}): \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2\\).\n\nNow, since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), and both 3 and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), but wait, no. \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) contains \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and all rationals, so \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). But earlier, I considered \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), which includes both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), which is already there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nWe have \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\), and both 3 and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). However, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), as shown earlier. Therefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), because \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), which is a subfield of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nSo, the degree is \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}): \\mathbb{Q}] = 4\\), as previously determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), but that might not be necessary since I've already determined the degree via the tower law.\n\nLet me just double-check by considering the basis elements. A basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}\\). A basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is \\(\\{1, \\sqrt{3}\\}\\), so a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(\\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\}\\), which has 4 elements. Therefore, the degree is 4.\n\nIncluding \\(\\sqrt{18}\\), which is \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\), doesn't add any new elements beyond what's already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\), since \\(3\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{18}\\).\n\nTherefore, the degree is 4.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is B. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
