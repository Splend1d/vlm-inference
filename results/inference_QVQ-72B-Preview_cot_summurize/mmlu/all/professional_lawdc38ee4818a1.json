                    "text": "So I've got this scenario where Jan is suing the Chicago Times for defamation in a Florida circuit court over an allegedly libelous article. At trial, Jan wants to introduce a copy of the newspaper containing the article as evidence. The question is asking what Jan must do before the newspaper can be admitted as evidence.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Call as a witness an employee of the Times to testify that the proffered newspaper was in fact published by the Times.\n\nB. Have a certification affixed to the newspaper signed by an employee of the Times attesting to its authenticity.\n\nC. Establish that the newspaper has been properly certified under the law of the jurisdiction where the newspaper was published.\n\nD. Do nothing because the newspaper is self-authenticating.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall the rules of evidence regarding authentication of documents. In general, to introduce a document into evidence, it needs to be authenticated or identified to show that it's what it purports to be.\n\nOption A suggests calling a witness from the Chicago Times to testify that the newspaper is authentic. This seems like a straightforward way to authenticate the document through direct testimony.\n\nOption B proposes having a certification signed by a Times employee attesting to the newspaper's authenticity. This is another common method of authentication, especially for official documents or records.\n\nOption C mentions establishing proper certification under the law of the jurisdiction where the newspaper was published. Since the Chicago Times is published in Illinois, this would involve ensuring that the newspaper is certified according to Illinois law, which might be relevant for public records or official documents.\n\nOption D claims that the newspaper is self-authenticating, meaning that no additional proof is required to establish its authenticity. Self-authenticating documents are generally those that are inherently trustworthy, like official government publications or documents bearing official seals.\n\nNow, considering that the Chicago Times is a reputable newspaper, but not necessarily an official government publication, I'm not sure if it would be considered self-authenticating. I think some form of authentication is required.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I need to figure out which one is most appropriate for authenticating a copy of the newspaper in this specific context.\n\nOption A involves live testimony from a Times employee, which can be effective but might also be time-consuming and potentially costly, especially since the Times is based in Chicago and the trial is in Florida.\n\nOption B suggests a certification signed by a Times employee. This seems efficient and is often accepted in court for authenticating documents, especially if the certification is properly executed and the signer is in a position to know about the newspaper's authenticity.\n\nOption C refers to certification under the law of the jurisdiction where the newspaper was published, which is Illinois in this case. This might be relevant if the newspaper is being used as an official record or if there are specific requirements under Illinois law for authenticating such documents.\n\nGiven that the newspaper is being used in a defamation case in Florida, I need to consider the rules of evidence in Florida courts. In Florida, as in many jurisdictions, there are rules about authenticating documents. Florida Evidence Code Section 90.902 deals with self-authenticating documents, but newspapers are not explicitly listed as self-authenticating.\n\nHowever, Florida Evidence Code Section 90.902 does include \"official publications\" and \"records of regularly conducted activity\" as self-authenticating, but newspapers might not fall neatly into these categories.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that some form of authentication is required beyond just producing the newspaper.\n\nBetween options A and B, both are acceptable methods of authentication. Calling a witness might be more intrusive and time-consuming, while a certification could be a simpler and more efficient method.\n\nOption C seems a bit more involved, as it requires ensuring compliance with the laws of Illinois regarding certification, which might be necessary if the newspaper is being used as an official record, but in this case, it's being used for the content of the article, not as an official record.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option B is the most practical and straightforward method for authenticating the newspaper. Having a certification signed by a Times employee attesting to its authenticity should suffice for the purposes of admission into evidence in a Florida circuit court.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any specific rule or precedent that would require something different.\n\nI recall that in federal courts, Federal Rule of Evidence 902 allows for self-authentication of certain documents, including domestic public documents and certain business records, but newspapers are not included in that list. Similarly, in Florida, newspapers aren't listed as self-authenticating documents.\n\nTherefore, some form of authentication is necessary.\n\nAnother consideration is that the newspaper is being offered in a defamation case. In defamation cases, the allegedly defamatory statement is a key element, and the authenticity of the publication is crucial to establish that the statement was indeed made and in the manner claimed by the plaintiff.\n\nSo, authenticating the newspaper helps establish that the article was published by the Chicago Times and that the content is accurate.\n\nIn summary, while there are multiple ways to authenticate the newspaper, option B\u2014having a certification affixed to the newspaper signed by an employee of the Times attesting to its authenticity\u2014seems to be the most efficient and straightforward method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
