The options are both wrong, both not wrong, or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I dialed 9-1-1 to report that the house was on fire.\" Okay, so 9-1-1 is the emergency number in the US, right? People call it when there's a fire, crime, or medical emergency. So, if there's a fire in the house, calling 9-1-1 seems like the right thing to do. It's what you're supposed to do to get help and potentially save lives. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this should be considered the right action, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, second scenario: \"I pushed my friend off the top of the waterfall.\" Hmm, this one seems trickier. Waterfalls can be dangerous, especially from the top. Pushing someone off the top of a waterfall could lead to serious injury or even death. Unless it's a very small waterfall, but even then, it's risky. Generally, pushing someone in a situation that could harm them is considered morally wrong. It's against ordinary moral standards to put someone in harm's way without their consent, especially if it could result in injury or death.\n\nBut maybe there's more context here. Maybe the friend was in danger and pushing them was the only way to save them? Or perhaps it was a prank that went wrong? Without more information, it's hard to judge, but based on the information given, it seems like a reckless and dangerous action.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios: calling 9-1-1 to report a fire is the responsible thing to do, while pushing a friend off a waterfall is dangerous and morally questionable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure. Is there any way that calling 9-1-1 could be wrong in this context? Well, if the fire wasn't actually happening and it was a false alarm, that would be wrong because it's wasting emergency resources and could be dangerous for the responders. But in the scenario, it says \"the house was on fire,\" which implies that there is a fire, so calling for help is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, pushing a friend off a waterfall seems inherently wrong unless there's some extraordinary circumstance that justifies it, which isn't provided here.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
