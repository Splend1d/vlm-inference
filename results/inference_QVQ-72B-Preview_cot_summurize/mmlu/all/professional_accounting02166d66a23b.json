                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what an auditor would most likely do when performing substantive tests on the granting of stock options to senior management of an issuer. The options are:\n\nA. Confirm with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders.\n\nB. Verify the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records.\n\nC. Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.\n\nD. Review the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what substantive tests are. Substantive tests are procedures performed by an auditor to assess the correctness of transactions and balances in the financial statements. They are designed to detect material misstatements.\n\nNow, specifically, we're dealing with the granting of stock options to senior management. Stock options are a form of compensation where the company gives the right to buy company stock at a certain price within a certain time frame. For senior management, this is a significant aspect of their compensation package and can have substantial implications for the company's financial statements.\n\nSo, the auditor's role here is to ensure that these options are being granted appropriately, in accordance with the company's policies and any regulatory requirements, and that they are properly accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nLet's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Confirm with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders.\n\nHmm, this seems relevant. Confirming directly with management whether they hold options could be a way to verify the option holdings. However, auditors typically rely on independent sources for confirmation rather than the subjects of the audit themselves to maintain objectivity and reliability. So, while it's important to know who holds options, confirming directly with management might not be the most effective approach.\n\nOption B: Verify the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records.\n\nThis seems plausible. Payroll and HR records should contain information about all employees, including their compensation packages, which may include stock options. By verifying the existence of option holders in these records, the auditor can ensure that only actual employees are receiving options. However, this might not capture options granted to senior management who might not be included in standard payroll systems or who have special arrangements.\n\nOption C: Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.\n\nThis appears to be a key aspect. In most companies, granting stock options to senior management requires board approval due to the significance of such transactions. Therefore, tracing the authorization back to the board's minutes or resolutions would provide evidence that these grants were properly approved and authorized. This helps ensure that the options are being granted in accordance with the company's policies and possibly shareholder approvals.\n\nOption D: Review the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported.\n\nThis is also important. Companies listed in the United States are required to report material information, including executive compensation like stock options, to the SEC. Reviewing these public filings can help the auditor confirm that the options have been properly disclosed and reported. This is crucial for transparency and compliance with securities laws.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these actions the auditor is most likely to perform.\n\nOption A seems less likely because confirming directly with management may not provide sufficient independent evidence.\n\nOption B is important for verifying that option holders are actual employees, but it might not fully address the granting process and approvals.\n\nOption C focuses on the authorization and approval process, which is fundamental to ensuring that the options are granted legitimately.\n\nOption D involves checking external disclosures, which is also crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nBetween options C and D, I need to think about which one is more directly related to the substantive testing of the granting of stock options.\n\nAuthorizing the options is about ensuring that the grants are approved properly, while reporting them to the SEC is about disclosing the grants appropriately.\n\nBoth are important, but perhaps the authorization is a prerequisite for proper reporting. Without proper authorization, the reporting might be flawed.\n\nMoreover, tracing authorization to the board's approval is a direct way to confirm that the grants are valid and in line with company policies and regulations.\n\nReviewing SEC filings (Option D) would be more about ensuring that the grants are disclosed correctly to the public and shareholders, which is also important, but perhaps a step after ensuring that the grants are properly authorized and recorded in the company's books.\n\nTherefore, I think that tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval (Option C) is the most likely action an auditor would take when performing substantive tests on the granting of stock options to senior management.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's more to this.\n\nMaybe the auditor would do all of these things, but the question is asking for the most likely action.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the auditor would consider confirming with an independent third party, like a stock transfer agent or the company's legal counsel, to verify the option holdings.\n\nHowever, none of the options mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the auditor would review the option grant agreements to ensure they match the board's approvals.\n\nThat could be another substantive test.\n\nBut again, none of the options mention that directly.\n\nGiven the choices provided, I still think that tracing the authorization to the board's approval is the most direct and fundamental substantive test in this context.\n\nSo, my answer is Option C: Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
