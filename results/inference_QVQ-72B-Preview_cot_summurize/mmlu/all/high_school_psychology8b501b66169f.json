                    "text": "So I have this question about Mayella and her belief that getting a good grade on an AP exam is a matter of luck. I need to figure out which of these options best describes her likely perspective: high academic self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, an external locus of control, or high achievement motivation.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with academic self-efficacy: I think this refers to how confident a student is in their ability to succeed in an academic setting. So, if someone has high academic self-efficacy, they believe they can do well in school or on tests because of their own abilities and efforts.\n\nNext, locus of control is about where a person believes the source of control over their life or situations lies. An internal locus of control means that a person thinks they have control over their outcomes through their own actions and choices. An external locus of control, on the other hand, means that a person believes external factors, like luck or other people, determine their outcomes.\n\nAchievement motivation is about how driven a person is to achieve goals or succeed in tasks. High achievement motivation would mean that someone is strongly motivated to achieve success and excel in what they do.\n\nGiven that Mayella believes getting a good grade on an AP exam is a matter of luck, let's see which of these fits.\n\nIf she thinks luck is the main factor, that suggests she doesn't see her own abilities or efforts as determining the outcome. So, she might not have high academic self-efficacy because she's not confident that her own abilities will lead to success.\n\nAs for locus of control, believing in luck suggests an external locus of control because she's attributing the outcome to something outside of herself rather than her own efforts or abilities.\n\nInternal locus of control would involve believing that her own study habits, intelligence, or preparations determine her grades, which isn't the case here.\n\nAchievement motivation is about being driven to succeed, but if she thinks success is mostly due to luck, she might not be highly motivated to put in the effort since she feels it won't make a difference.\n\nSo, based on this, the most straightforward answer seems to be an external locus of control.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: high academic self-efficacy \u2013 but if she thinks luck determines her grade, she probably doesn't have high confidence in her own ability to achieve a good grade through her own efforts.\n\nOption B: an internal locus of control \u2013 this would involve believing that she has control over her grades through her own actions, which contradicts her belief in luck being the determining factor.\n\nOption C: an external locus of control \u2013 this aligns perfectly with her belief that luck, an external factor, determines her grades.\n\nOption D: high achievement motivation \u2013 if she believes luck determines her success, she might not be highly motivated to achieve because she feels her efforts won't influence the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is C. an external locus of control.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
