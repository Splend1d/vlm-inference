                    "text": "So I have this question about fishing rights in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of a state. The options are a bit confusing, but let me try to understand them one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that when the coastal state can't harvest the 'total allowable catch', it should give other states access to that surplus, and priority should be given to developing and land-locked states. Hmm, that sounds like there's some provision for other states to fish in another's EEZ under certain conditions.\n\nOption B states that third states may never have access to fisheries within another state's EEZ. That seems pretty absolute, but I suspect international law might allow for some exceptions or specific circumstances where access is permitted.\n\nOption C mentions that the coastal state is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighboring states. So, this is suggesting that only nearby countries can fish in another's EEZ, not any third state.\n\nLastly, option D says that third states are free to fish within another's EEZ, except from certain designated areas. This seems to imply that generally, fishing is allowed, but there are restrictions in specific zones.\n\nNow, I need to recall what international law says about fishing in another state's EEZ. I know that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs these matters. According to UNCLOS, coastal states have sovereign rights over their EEZ for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving, and managing natural resources, both living and non-living.\n\nHowever, regarding fishing rights for third states, I think there are some provisions for cooperation and access under certain conditions, especially if the coastal state cannot fully utilize its resources.\n\nLet me think about option A again. It mentions 'total allowable catch', which is a concept in fisheries management where a scientific assessment determines the maximum amount of a species that can be caught without threatening its long-term sustainability. If a coastal state can't harvest that amount, perhaps due to lack of capacity or resources, it might be obligated to allow other states to fish the surplus.\n\nThe priority to developing and land-locked states also makes sense because these states might not have their own coastal areas or may face challenges in accessing fisheries. Giving them priority could be a way to support their development and food security.\n\nOption B seems too absolute. I doubt that third states can never have access to fisheries within another state's EEZ. There must be some mechanisms for access, perhaps through bilateral agreements or international conventions.\n\nOption C limits access only to neighboring states. While it's possible that neighboring states might have preferential access due to geographical proximity and existing relationships, I don't think it's the only case where access is granted. For example, distant water fishing nations might also have agreements to fish in another state's EEZ.\n\nOption D suggests that third states are generally free to fish in another's EEZ except for certain areas. This seems contrary to the general principles of EEZs, which are established to give coastal states exclusive rights over natural resources in those zones.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look up the specific articles of UNCLOS related to fishing in EEZs. Let me try to recall.\n\nUNCLOS Article 61 addresses the duty of a coastal state to encourage participation in the development of living resources by other states when the coastal state lacks the capacity to harvest the allowable catch. It also mentions that such participation should be on a basis of mutual benefit and that developing states and states with economies in transit should be given priority.\n\nThis seems to align with option A, which talks about giving access to the surplus catch to other states, with priority to developing and land-locked states.\n\nOption C, which limits access only to neighboring states, doesn't seem to be the accurate choice based on UNCLOS provisions, which mention priority to developing and land-locked states, not necessarily neighboring ones.\n\nOption B is too restrictive, as UNCLOS clearly provides for access to other states under certain conditions.\n\nOption D contradicts the exclusive nature of EEZs, as coastal states have sovereign rights to manage and control fishing activities within their EEZs, and third states cannot freely fish there unless there is a specific agreement allowing it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: when the coastal state cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', it is to give other states access to that surplus, with priority to be given to developing and land-locked states.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check UNCLOS Article 61.\n\nArticle 61(1) states: \"Where a coastal State does not harvest the surplus of the allowable catch available in its exclusive economic zone, it shall, through agreements or other arrangements, give other states access to the surplus of the allowable catch.\"\n\nAnd Article 61(2): \"Such access shall be on terms and conditions to be agreed by the coastal State and the other states concerned, having particular regard to the special requirements of developing states and states with economies in transit.\"\n\nSo, this confirms that option A is accurate, and the other options are either too restrictive or incorrect based on international law.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
