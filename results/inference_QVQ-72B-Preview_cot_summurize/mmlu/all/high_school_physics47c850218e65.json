                    "text": "So I have this problem here: A stone is thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of 5 m/s. I need to find out what its velocity is 3 seconds later. The options are given, but I want to understand how to get to the answer myself.\n\nFirst, I know that when you throw something upwards, it slows down as it goes up because gravity is pulling it down. The acceleration due to gravity is about -9.8 m/s\u00b2 (negative because it's acting downwards). So, the stone is decelerating as it rises.\n\nSince it's moving upwards, its initial velocity is positive, +5 m/s. Now, I need to find its velocity after 3 seconds.\n\nI remember there's an equation for motion under constant acceleration that relates velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. The formula is:\n\nv = u + at\n\nWhere:\n\n- v is the final velocity\n\n- u is the initial velocity\n\n- a is the acceleration\n\n- t is the time\n\nIn this case:\n\n- u = +5 m/s (upward)\n\n- a = -9.8 m/s\u00b2 (downward due to gravity)\n\n- t = 3 seconds\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\nv = 5 + (-9.8) \u00d7 3\n\nv = 5 - 29.4\n\nv = -24.4 m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is downward.\n\nSo, the velocity of the stone after 3 seconds is 24.4 m/s downward.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 25 m/s, upward\n\nB. 25 m/s, downward\n\nC. 35 m/s, upward\n\nD. 35 m/s, downward\n\nNone of these match my calculation. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the time it takes for the stone to reach its highest point and then fall back down.\n\nThe time to reach the highest point can be calculated using the formula:\n\nt = (u - v)/a\n\nWhere v is 0 m/s at the highest point.\n\nSo, t = (5 - 0)/9.8 = 5/9.8 \u2248 0.51 seconds\n\nSo, it takes about 0.51 seconds to reach the highest point.\n\nNow, 3 seconds is much longer than that, so the stone has already reached the top and is falling back down.\n\nFrom 0.51 seconds to 3 seconds is 3 - 0.51 \u2248 2.49 seconds of falling back down.\n\nDuring this time, the stone is accelerating downwards at 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nThe velocity at the highest point is 0 m/s, and after 2.49 seconds, it would be:\n\nv = u + at = 0 + 9.8 \u00d7 2.49 \u2248 24.4 m/s downward\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the velocity after 3 seconds is 24.4 m/s downward, which isn't exactly one of the options. The closest option is B, 25 m/s downward, but my calculation gives 24.4 m/s.\n\nMaybe the options are approximate, or perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nGiven:\n\nu = 5 m/s\n\na = -9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nt = 3 s\n\nv = u + at = 5 + (-9.8)(3) = 5 - 29.4 = -24.4 m/s\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider only the magnitude and direction, rounding to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, 24.4 m/s downward rounds to 25 m/s downward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 25 m/s, downward.\n\nI think that's the case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
