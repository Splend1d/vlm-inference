                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, the theory suggests that pollen grains, which are too big to enter the airways, release starch granules when exposed to water during a thunderstorm due to osmotic shock. These starch granules are smaller and can trigger asthma attacks. We need to figure out which statement is correct based on this theory.\n\nFirst, let's recall what osmotic shock is. Osmotic shock occurs when a cell or particle is suddenly exposed to a significantly different solute concentration, leading to rapid changes in water content and potentially causing the cell to burst or undergo other structural changes.\n\nIn this case, the pollen grains are exposed to water during a thunderstorm, which likely changes the osmotic environment around them. The theory states that this leads to the release of starch granules due to osmotic shock.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** \"The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\"\n\nHypotonic means that the interior has a lower solute concentration than the outside. If the interior was hypotonic, we'd expect water to move into the pollen grains, causing them to swell, not release contents outward. But according to the theory, they're releasing starch granules, which might suggest that water is entering and causing some disruption. However, if the interior was hypotonic, water would be coming in, which might cause swelling, not release of contents. So, this doesn't seem directly aligned with osmotic shock leading to release of contents.\n\n**Option B:** \"The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\"\n\nOsmotic pressure is directly related to solute concentration. If the interior has higher osmotic pressure, it means it's hypertonic compared to the outside. In this case, water would be moving into the pollen grains, again causing swelling. But the theory suggests that water is being taken up, leading to osmotic shock and release of contents. However, if the interior is hypertonic, taking up water makes sense, but the release of contents might not directly follow from this. Maybe the increased internal pressure causes rupture and release of contents. Hmm.\n\n**Option C:** \"The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\"\n\nPlasmolysis is when a plant cell loses water to a hypertonic environment, causing the cell membrane to pull away from the cell wall. But in this scenario, the pollen grains are exposed to water during a thunderstorm, which is likely adding water to the environment around them. So, plasmolysis would occur if the exterior is hypertonic relative to the interior, causing water to leave the grain. But the theory suggests that water is being added, leading to osmotic shock. This seems contradictory to plasmolysis, which involves water loss.\n\n**Option D:** \"The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\"\n\nThis suggests that the pollen grains first shrank and then ruptured. But if they're taking up water due to osmotic shock, they would likely swell before rupturing, not shrink. So, this seems unlikely based on the theory presented.\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the options seem to perfectly align with the theory as stated. However, perhaps there's a better fit among them.\n\nLet me think differently. Osmotic shock typically occurs when there's a rapid change in osmotic pressure across a membrane, leading to sudden influx or efflux of water. In this case, the pollen grains are exposed to water during a thunderstorm, which likely makes the external environment more hypotonic (lower solute concentration) compared to their usual environment.\n\nIf the pollen grains have a higher solute concentration inside than outside due to this change, water would rush in, causing them to swell and potentially burst, releasing their contents like starch granules.\n\nGiven this, option B says that the interior had a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment. If that's the case, water would move into the pollen grains, causing them to swell and possibly burst, which aligns with the release of starch granules.\n\nHowever, option A says the interior was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. If the interior was hypotonic, meaning lower solute concentration than outside, water would move out of the pollen grains, causing them to shrink, not burst.\n\nWait a minute, but if the surrounding environment is even more hypotonic (lower solute concentration) due to the added water from the thunderstorm, then perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's consider that before the thunderstorm, the pollen grains were in an environment with a certain solute concentration. During the thunderstorm, water is added to the environment, making it more hypotonic relative to the pollen grains. So, compared to their previous environment, the external environment is now more hypotonic, meaning the pollen grains are now in a hypotonic environment relative to their internal solute concentration.\n\nIn this scenario, water would move into the pollen grains, causing them to swell and potentially burst, releasing their contents.\n\nSo, in this context, the interior of the pollen grains was hypertonic compared to the new, more hypotonic surrounding environment due to the added water.\n\nWait, but option A says \"the interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\" If the surrounding environment became more hypotonic due to the thunderstorm water, then the interior would need to be hypertonic to have water move in.\n\nI think there's some confusion in the wording of the options.\n\nLet's rephrase:\n\n- Hypotonic: lower solute concentration than outside.\n\n- Hypertonic: higher solute concentration than outside.\n\n- Isotonic: same solute concentration as outside.\n\nGiven that, if the interior of the pollen grains is hypertonic relative to the new, more hypotonic surrounding environment, water will move into the grains, causing them to swell and potentially burst.\n\nSo, option A says the interior was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. If the interior was hypotonic, water would move out, causing the grains to shrink, not burst.\n\nOption B says the interior had a higher osmotic pressure than the surrounding environment, which means the interior is hypertonic relative to the surroundings.\n\nGiven that, option B seems more accurate because if the interior has higher osmotic pressure, water will move in, causing swelling and potential bursting.\n\nBut according to the theory, the grains are exposed to water during a thunderstorm, which likely makes the external environment more hypotonic relative to the interior, assuming the interior has some solutes.\n\nTherefore, if the interior is hypertonic relative to the new, more hypotonic surroundings, water will move in, causing swelling and potential bursting.\n\nSo, option B seems to align with this scenario.\n\nOption A suggests the interior was hypotonic, which would mean water moves out, contrary to what's needed for bursting due to water influx.\n\nOption C, plasmolysis, involves water loss and cell membrane detachment, which again doesn't fit with the scenario of water influx.\n\nOption D suggests shrinking before rupturing, which again aligns with water loss, not influx.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is likely option B: \"The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
