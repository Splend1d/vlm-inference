                    "text": "So I'm reading this passage by Herbert Spencer, and it's about government's role in helping the poor. He seems to have some strong opinions on this topic. Let me try to understand what he's saying.\n\nFirst, he says that the government taking on the role of a \"Reliever-general\" to help the poor is forbidden by the principle that a government should only protect its citizens. So, he thinks that governments should only protect people and nothing more.\n\nHe goes on to say that demanding contributions from citizens to help alleviate distress is the government reversing its function. That sounds like he disapproves of the government collecting taxes to help the poor because he thinks that's not the government's job.\n\nThen, he explains that the government's proper role is to enforce the law and ensure that everyone has the freedom to do as they please, as long as they don't infringe on others' freedoms. So, it's about maintaining order and liberty, not about making sure everyone is satisfied or happy.\n\nHe also mentions that poverty, distress, and starvation can be seen as part of a larger, beneficial plan for humanity. That seems a bit harsh, but I think he's saying that these hardships are necessary for the greater good, maybe following the idea of \"survival of the fittest\" since the book is called \"Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind.\"\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor\n\nThis seems to align with what he's saying. He doesn't think the government should collect taxes to help the poor because it's not their role to ensure people's satisfaction or well-being beyond protecting their freedoms.\n\nB. challenged the government's right to tax the people\n\nWell, he does mention that demanding contributions from citizens to alleviate distress is the government reversing its function, but he doesn't directly say that the government has no right to tax people in general. He seems to be specifically\u53cd\u5bf9using taxes for relieving poverty.\n\nC. believed that the government should do more than merely protect its people\n\nThis is the opposite of what he says. He clearly states that the government should only protect and nothing more.\n\nD. believed that working people should unite for a common cause\n\nThere's nothing in the passage that suggests he believed in workers uniting for a common cause. He seems to be focusing on individual responsibility and the government's limited role.\n\nSo, based on the passage, option A seems to be the correct inference: Spencer opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nHe says that the government cannot rightly do anything more than protect, and that helping the poor by taxing citizens is reversing its function. So, yes, he's against using tax money for that purpose.\n\nHe also mentions that poverty and distress are decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence, implying that they serve a higher purpose, perhaps in the natural order of things.\n\nSo, again, this reinforces that he doesn't think the government should interfere with that natural order by providing aid to the poor using tax money.\n\nTherefore, option A is the best answer.\n\nOption B is too broad; he's not challenging the government's right to tax in general, just to use taxes for relieving poverty.\n\nOption C is the opposite of his view.\n\nOption D is not supported by the passage.\n\nSo, I'm confident that A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
