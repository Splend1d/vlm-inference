                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a man who bought a house that needed repairs. He borrowed money from a bank to buy the house and secured that loan with a mortgage. Then, he borrowed more money from his credit union to fix up the house, and that loan was also secured with a mortgage on the same house. Both mortgages were recorded in the order they were given.\n\nNow, the man defaulted on the bank loan, and the bank started a foreclosure process. They sold the house, paid off the bank's debt and the sale expenses, and there's $5,000 left from the sale proceeds. The credit union still has an outstanding balance of $20,000 on their loan, and both the man and the credit union are claiming this remaining $5,000.\n\nI need to figure out who gets this $5,000. The options are:\n\nA. The credit union, because they have priority.\n\nB. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.\n\nC. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\n\nD. The man, because the outside party who bought the house at the foreclosure sale got title subject to the second mortgage.\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the priority of the mortgages. Generally, in real estate law, the first mortgage has priority over subsequent mortgages. This is based on the \"first in time, first in right\" principle. So, the bank's mortgage, being the first one recorded, has priority over the credit union's mortgage, which was recorded later.\n\nIn a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are distributed in order of priority. So, the bank gets paid first from the sale proceeds, then any other liens or mortgages are paid in the order they were recorded.\n\nIn this case, after paying the bank and the sale expenses, there's $5,000 left. The credit union is the next in line to be paid, since their mortgage is second.\n\nOption A says the credit union gets the $5,000 because they have priority. But wait, the bank's mortgage has higher priority, and the credit union has secondary priority. However, since there's only $5,000 left and the credit union is owed $20,000, they wouldn't be fully paid off with just $5,000.\n\nSo, if the credit union is next in line, they should get the $5,000, but that doesn't satisfy their entire debt of $20,000. Maybe that's why they're claiming it.\n\nBut the man is also claiming it, and he's personally liable on both loans. So, does that change anything?\n\nOption B says the credit union gets it because the man is personally liable on the debt. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the distribution of the foreclosure proceeds. The personal liability might come into play after the foreclosure, if there's a deficiency judgment, but for now, during the foreclosure sale, the proceeds are supposed to go to the mortgage holders in order of their priority.\n\nOption C mentions the man's equitable right of redemption. I need to recall what that is. In many jurisdictions, a borrower has the right of redemption, which allows them to pay off the mortgage debt and reclaim their property before or after a foreclosure sale, depending on the laws. However, in this scenario, the house has already been sold at the foreclosure sale, and the proceeds are being distributed. So, unless there's a period of redemption after the sale where the borrower can still pay off the debt and get the property back, I don't think this applies here. Maybe I need to look into that.\n\nOption D says the man gets the $5,000 because the outside party who bought the house at the foreclosure sale got title subject to the second mortgage. Hmm, I need to think about that.\n\nWhen a property is sold at a foreclosure sale, the first mortgage is satisfied, and the title is free and clear of any prior liens, unless specified otherwise. But sometimes, if the foreclosure is only for the first mortgage, the second mortgage might still attach to the property, depending on state laws.\n\nWait, in some states, a foreclosure sale extinguishes all junior liens, meaning the second mortgage would be wiped out. In other states, the second mortgage might still exist as a lien on the property.\n\nI need to consider which is the case here. The problem says there's no applicable statute, so maybe I have to rely on general principles.\n\nAssuming that the foreclosure sale extinguishes junior liens, then the second mortgage is wiped out, and the buyer at the foreclosure sale gets clear title.\n\nIn that case, the credit union's mortgage is wiped out, and they can't claim any further interest in the property.\n\nBut they still have a debt owed to them of $20,000, which is now unsecured since the mortgage is wiped out.\n\nSo, the $5,000 from the sale proceeds would be part of the equity in the property. Since the bank's mortgage is fully satisfied, and the credit union's mortgage is wiped out, perhaps any remaining proceeds should go to the borrower, the man who owned the house.\n\nBut wait, the credit union still has a claim against the man personally, since he signed a note and is personally liable on the loan.\n\nSo, perhaps the $5,000 should go to the credit union to partially satisfy their debt.\n\nBut then again, the man is also personally liable, so maybe it should go to him.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to rephrase.\n\nIn a foreclosure sale, the proceeds are distributed in the following order:\n\n1. Costs of the foreclosure sale.\n\n2. Payment of the first mortgage (the bank's loan).\n\n3. Payment of any junior liens, like the second mortgage (credit union's loan).\n\n4. Any remaining proceeds go to the borrower (the man who owned the house).\n\nIn this case, after paying the bank and the sale expenses, there's $5,000 left. Since the credit union has a second mortgage, they should be next in line to receive this amount, even though it won't cover their entire debt.\n\nBut the problem is that the credit union's mortgage was recorded after the bank's, and both were promptly recorded in the order granted. So, the bank has priority over the credit union.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the proceeds from a foreclosure sale are distributed to satisfy the mortgages in the order of their priority. So, the bank gets paid first, then the credit union gets paid next, and any remaining proceeds go to the borrower.\n\nTherefore, the $5,000 should go to the credit union, even though it's less than their total debt.\n\nBut option A says the credit union gets it because they have priority, but actually, the bank has priority, and the credit union has secondary priority.\n\nSo, option A might be misleading.\n\nOption B says the credit union gets it because the man is personally liable on the debt. But again, I don't see how personal liability affects the distribution of the foreclosure proceeds directly.\n\nOption C mentions the man's equitable right of redemption. If the man has the right to redeem the property by paying off the debt before a certain period after the sale, perhaps he could claim the remaining proceeds. But since the sale has already happened, and the problem doesn't specify a redemption period, I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nOption D says the man gets the $5,000 because the outside buyer got title subject to the second mortgage. If the second mortgage still attaches to the property after the sale, then perhaps the buyer has title subject to that mortgage, and the $5,000 should go to the man.\n\nBut again, in a typical judicial foreclosure, the second mortgage is wiped out, and the buyer gets clear title.\n\nSo, I'm a bit torn here.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the foreclosure sale was a \"strict foreclosure,\" where the bank takes title to the property and the borrower retains any equity above the debt. But in this case, it's a judicial foreclosure with a sale, so that might not apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale was conducted in a way that the second mortgage was not extinguished, meaning the buyer gets the property subject to the second mortgage.\n\nBut that seems unlikely in a standard judicial foreclosure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up some case law or general principles about the distribution of foreclosure proceeds when there are multiple mortgages.\n\nIn general, in a judicial foreclosure, the court oversees the distribution of the proceeds. The first mortgage is paid off, then any junior liens are paid, and any remaining funds go to the borrower.\n\nSo, in this case, the bank is paid off, the credit union is next, and there's only $5,000 left, which is less than the credit union's $20,000 debt.\n\nTherefore, the credit union would get the $5,000, and the remaining $15,000 of their debt would be a personal liability of the man, since he signed a note.\n\nSo, the credit union would have a deficiency claim against the man for the remaining $15,000.\n\nTherefore, the $5,000 should go to the credit union.\n\nBut option A says the credit union gets it because they have priority, but actually, the bank has priority, and the credit union has secondary priority.\n\nSo, perhaps the wording is a bit off, but the essence is that the credit union is next in line to receive the proceeds.\n\nOption B mentions the man's personal liability on the debt, but again, that's more about the credit union's ability to pursue the man for the remaining debt, not about the distribution of the foreclosure proceeds.\n\nOption C's reference to the equitable right of redemption seems irrelevant here, as the sale has already occurred.\n\nOption D suggests that the man gets the $5,000 because the buyer took title subject to the second mortgage. But if the foreclosure sale extinguished the second mortgage, that wouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some jurisdictions, the second mortgage is not extinguished, and the buyer takes title subject to it, meaning the second mortgage remains in place.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the $5,000 should go to the man, and the credit union would still have their mortgage on the property.\n\nBut that seems unusual in a judicial foreclosure.\n\nI think the standard procedure is that the foreclosure sale satisfies the first mortgage, and any remaining proceeds are applied to junior liens, with any excess going to the borrower.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the credit union should get the $5,000, even though it's less than their total debt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the credit union is entitled to the $5,000.\n\nBut none of the options directly say that. Option A says the credit union gets it because they have priority, which isn't entirely accurate, as the bank has higher priority.\n\nOption B mentions the man's personal liability, which is relevant for the remaining debt, but not for the distribution of the proceeds.\n\nOption C refers to the right of redemption, which doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nOption D suggests the man gets the $5,000 because the buyer took title subject to the second mortgage, which I think is incorrect in this scenario.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A, despite the wording, because the credit union is next in line to receive the proceeds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B, because the man is personally liable on the debt, and the credit union can pursue him for the remaining $15,000, but that doesn't directly address the $5,000 in question.\n\nI think the best answer is A, even though the reasoning might not be perfectly accurate, because in reality, it's the priority of the mortgages that determines the distribution, not that the credit union has priority per se, but that they're next in line after the bank.\n\nSo, I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
