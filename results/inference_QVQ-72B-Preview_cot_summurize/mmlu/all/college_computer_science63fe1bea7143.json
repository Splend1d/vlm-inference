                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Ethernets, and I need to find out which statement is typically false. I'm not an expert on Ethernets, but I do know some basics about networking. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages. Hmm, I thought Ethernets were more about packet switching, but maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think. Circuit switching is what they use in telephone systems, where a dedicated path is established between two endpoints for the duration of the communication. In contrast, packet switching breaks data into packets that are sent independently over any available path to the destination. I recall that Ethernet is a type of local area network (LAN) technology that uses packet switching. So, this might be a false statement.\n\nOption B says that Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. I remember that Ethernet was originally based on a bus topology, where all devices are connected to a single cable. In this topology, any device can transmit data, and other devices listen for that data. The term \"multiple masters\" might refer to multiple devices being able to initiate transmissions, which is indeed the case in Ethernet. However, there is a protocol to manage access to the bus to prevent too many devices from transmitting at once. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C states that Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly. I've heard of CSMA/CD, which stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection. This is a method used in Ethernet to manage how devices access the network and handle collisions when two devices transmit at the same time. So, this seems like it's true.\n\nOption D says that networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters. I know that Ethernet has evolved over the years, and different standards have different maximum cable lengths. For example, the original Ethernet had specific limits, but modern Gigabit Ethernet can support longer distances with fiber optics. However, for twisted-pair copper cables, which are commonly used in Ethernet networks, the maximum segment length is around 100 meters. But with repeaters or switches, you can extend the network further. So, it's a bit vague, but generally, Ethernet networks can span more than just a few hundred meters, especially with the use of modern technologies.\n\nPutting it all together, Option A seems likely to be false because Ethernets use packet switching, not circuit switching. Option B seems true because Ethernet does use a bus topology with multiple devices that can transmit. Option C is also true, as CSMA/CD is a fundamental part of Ethernet's operation. Option D is a bit tricky because it depends on the specific Ethernet standard and the type of cabling used, but generally, Ethernet networks can exceed a few hundred meters in length with the right infrastructure.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, Option A is the statement that is typically false regarding Ethernets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
