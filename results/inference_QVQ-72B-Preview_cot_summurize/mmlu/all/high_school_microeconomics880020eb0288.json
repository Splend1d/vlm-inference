                    "text": "So I have this question here about taxes, and I need to figure out which category a sales tax on food would fall into. The question mentions that people with lower incomes spend a bigger percentage of their income on food compared to people with higher incomes. And it's asking whether a sales tax on food would be progressive, proportional, regressive, or neutral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of taxes:\n\nA. Progressive: This means that as a person's income increases, the percentage of their income that they pay in taxes also increases. So, higher-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower-income earners.\n\nB. Proportional: This is when everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes, regardless of how much they earn. It's a flat rate across the board.\n\nC. Regressive: This is the opposite of progressive. In this case, as a person's income increases, the percentage of their income that they pay in taxes decreases. So, lower-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income earners.\n\nD. Neutral: I think this would mean that the tax doesn't favor any particular income group and doesn't increase or decrease based on income levels.\n\nNow, the question is about a sales tax on food. Sales taxes are usually added to the price of goods and services when you buy them. So, if there's a sales tax on food, it means that when you buy food, you have to pay an additional percentage of the purchase price as tax.\n\nThe key point here is that people with lower incomes spend a larger percentage of their income on food. So, if they're spending a bigger portion of their income on food to begin with, and there's a tax on food, that means they're paying more of their total income in taxes compared to higher-income people who spend a smaller portion of their income on food.\n\nLet me try to illustrate this with an example:\n\nSuppose there's a 10% sales tax on food.\n\nPerson A earns $20,000 a year and spends $5,000 on food.\n\nPerson B earns $50,000 a year and spends $3,000 on food.\n\nFor Person A:\n\nTax paid on food = 10% of $5,000 = $500\n\nAs a percentage of their income, that's $500 / $20,000 = 2.5%\n\nFor Person B:\n\nTax paid on food = 10% of $3,000 = $300\n\nAs a percentage of their income, that's $300 / $50,000 = 0.6%\n\nSo, even though Person A has a lower income, they're paying a higher percentage of their income in food sales tax compared to Person B.\n\nThis suggests that a sales tax on food is regressive because lower-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income earners.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check if this is always the case. Maybe in some situations, it could be different.\n\nLet me take another example:\n\nPerson C earns $10,000 a year and spends $4,000 on food.\n\nPerson D earns $40,000 a year and spends $2,000 on food.\n\nAgain, assuming a 10% sales tax on food.\n\nFor Person C:\n\nTax paid on food = 10% of $4,000 = $400\n\nAs a percentage of income: $400 / $10,000 = 4%\n\nFor Person D:\n\nTax paid on food = 10% of $2,000 = $200\n\nAs a percentage of income: $200 / $40,000 = 0.5%\n\nAgain, the lower-income earner is paying a higher percentage of their income in food sales tax.\n\nIt seems consistent in these examples. But maybe there are cases where higher-income earners spend more on food proportionally.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose Person E earns $80,000 a year and spends $5,000 on food.\n\nPerson F earns $20,000 a year and spends $3,000 on food.\n\nAgain, 10% sales tax on food.\n\nFor Person E:\n\nTax paid = 10% of $5,000 = $500\n\nPercentage of income: $500 / $80,000 = 0.625%\n\nFor Person F:\n\nTax paid = 10% of $3,000 = $300\n\nPercentage of income: $300 / $20,000 = 1.5%\n\nAgain, the lower-income earner pays a higher percentage of their income in food sales tax.\n\nSo, based on these examples, it seems that a sales tax on food is regressive because lower-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income earners.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in some tax systems, there are exemptions or rebates for essential items like food to make the tax system fairer. If that's the case, maybe the situation changes.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about a sales tax on food without any exemptions or rebates.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems that the answer is C. Regressive.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nA. Progressive: This would require that higher-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in food sales tax, which isn't the case based on the examples above.\n\nB. Proportional: This would require that all income groups pay the same percentage of their income in food sales tax, which also isn't the case based on the examples.\n\nD. Neutral: This would imply that the tax doesn't affect different income groups differently, which isn't true in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate category for a sales tax on food, given the information provided, is C. Regressive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Regressive}} \\]"
