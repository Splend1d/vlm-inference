                    "text": "So I have this genetics problem here about minks and their fur color. It says that the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). I need to figure out which set of genotypes for the parents could produce offspring with silver fur, even though both parents have brown fur.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the basics of dominant and recessive traits. Since brown (B) is dominant over silver (b), if a mink has at least one B allele, it will have brown fur. Only if it has two b alleles will it have silver fur.\n\nSo, if both parents have brown fur, they must each have at least one B allele. But if they both have at least one B, how can they produce an offspring with silver fur, which requires two b alleles?\n\nLet me think about this. If both parents are heterozygous, meaning they both have one B and one b allele, then it's possible to get an offspring with two b alleles.\n\nLet me recall what each genotype would look like:\n\n- BB: both alleles are B, so the mink has brown fur.\n\n- Bb: one B and one b, so brown fur.\n\n- bb: both alleles are b, so silver fur.\n\nNow, if both parents are BB, all their gametes will have a B allele. So, the offspring will always have at least one B, meaning they'll have brown fur. No silver offspring possible from this cross.\n\nNext, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, let's see:\n\n- BB parent can only produce gametes with B.\n\n- Bb parent can produce gametes with either B or b.\n\nSo, the offspring will either be BB or Bb, both resulting in brown fur. No silver offspring here either.\n\nNow, option C is Bb and Bb. Both parents are heterozygous.\n\nLet's do a Punnett square for this cross:\n\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b.\n\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b.\n\nCombining them:\n\n- B from parent 1 and B from parent 2: BB \u2192 brown.\n\n- B from parent 1 and b from parent 2: Bb \u2192 brown.\n\n- b from parent 1 and B from parent 2: Bb \u2192 brown.\n\n- b from parent 1 and b from parent 2: bb \u2192 silver.\n\nSo, in this cross, there's a possibility of getting offspring with bb genotype, which is silver fur.\n\nWhat about option D: Bb and bb.\n\nWait, the question says both parents have brown fur. If one parent is bb, that would have silver fur, which contradicts the condition that both parents have brown fur. So, option D is out because one parent has silver fur.\n\nOption A: BB and BB.\n\nAs I thought earlier, all offspring will be BB or Bb, both brown.\n\nOption B: BB and Bb.\n\nAll offspring will be BB or Bb, both brown.\n\nOption C: Bb and Bb.\n\nOffspring can be BB, Bb, Bb, or bb. So, there's a chance of getting silver offspring here.\n\nOption D: Bb and bb.\n\nBut one parent has silver fur, which doesn't meet the condition of both parents having brown fur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: Bb and Bb.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any other way for both parents to have brown fur and produce silver offspring?\n\nLet's consider if one parent is BB and the other is bb, but that would mean one parent has silver fur, which isn't allowed.\n\nOr, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, again, one parent has silver fur.\n\nAlternatively, if both are BB, they can't produce bb offspring.\n\nSo, yes, only option C fits: both parents are Bb, heterozygous, and can produce offspring with bb genotype.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Bb Bb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
