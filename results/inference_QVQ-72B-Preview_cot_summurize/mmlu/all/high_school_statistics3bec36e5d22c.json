                    "text": "So I have this question about confidence intervals for a population proportion. It's asking what happens when I change from a 90% confidence interval to a 99% confidence interval, assuming everything else stays the same. The options are about increasing or decreasing the interval size by a certain percentage. Hmm, I need to understand how the confidence level affects the size of the confidence interval.\n\nFirst, I remember that a confidence interval for a population proportion is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion,\n\n- \\(z^*\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level,\n\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nFrom this formula, I can see that the margin of error, which determines the width of the confidence interval, is proportional to \\(z^*\\). So, if \\(z^*\\) increases, the interval gets wider, and if it decreases, the interval gets narrower.\n\nNow, I need to find out how \\(z^*\\) changes when we go from a 90% confidence level to a 99% confidence level.\n\nFor a 90% confidence level, the critical \\(z\\) value is approximately 1.645.\n\nFor a 99% confidence level, the critical \\(z\\) value is approximately 2.576.\n\nSo, the percentage change in the \\(z^*\\) value would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\frac{2.576 - 1.645}{1.645} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n2.576 - 1.645 = 0.931\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.931}{1.645} \\times 100\\% = 56.5\\% \\approx 57\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the \\(z^*\\) value increases by approximately 57% when moving from 90% to 99% confidence.\n\nBut wait, does this directly translate to the interval size increasing by 57%? The interval width is twice the margin of error, since it's \\(\\hat{p} \\pm z^* \\times \\text{SE}\\). So, the width is \\(2 \\times z^* \\times \\text{SE}\\). Since SE is the same in both cases (assuming sample proportion and sample size don't change), the width is proportional to \\(z^*\\).\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in the interval width should be approximately the same as the percentage increase in \\(z^*\\), which is about 57%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increases the interval size by 9%.\n\nB. decreases the interval size by 9%.\n\nC. increases the interval size by 57%.\n\nD. decreases the interval size by 57%.\n\nGiven this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this. Maybe consider the formula more carefully.\n\nThe margin of error \\(E\\) is:\n\n\\[\nE = z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} - E \\text{ to } \\hat{p} + E\n\\]\n\nThe width of the interval is:\n\n\\[\n2E = 2 z^* \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nIf we increase the confidence level from 90% to 99%, \\(z^*\\) increases from approximately 1.645 to 2.576, as mentioned.\n\nSo, the new width is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 2.576 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} = 5.152 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nThe original width was:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1.645 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} = 3.29 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the new width to the original width is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5.152}{3.29} \\approx 1.566 \\text{ or } 156.6\\%\n\\]\n\nThis means the new width is 156.6% of the original width, which is a 56.6% increase, roughly 57%.\n\nSo, this confirms that the interval size increases by approximately 57% when moving from 90% to 99% confidence level, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. increases the interval size by 57%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could affect this percentage.\n\nI know that the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) and the sample size \\(n\\) are held constant, as stated in the question. So, the only variable is the confidence level.\n\nIs there any approximation here that might make the exact percentage differ slightly? Well, the \\(z^*\\) values are approximate, but in practice, these are standard values from the normal distribution table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the exact percentage increase.\n\nLet me calculate the exact percentage increase in \\(z^*\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{2.576 - 1.645}{1.645} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{0.931}{1.645} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 56.58\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 56.58%, which rounds to 57%.\n\nTherefore, the interval size increases by approximately 57% when the confidence level is increased from 90% to 99%, with all other things being equal.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. increases the interval size by 57%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
