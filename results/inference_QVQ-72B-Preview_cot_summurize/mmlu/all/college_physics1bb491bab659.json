                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about thin-film interference. There's a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33, and on top of it floats a thin layer of oil with an index of refraction 1.5 and a thickness of 500 nanometers. White light is shining straight down onto this setup, and I need to figure out which wavelength gets reflected the most strongly among the given options: 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, or 650 nm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how light reflects and interferes in a thin film like this oil layer. When light hits the oil layer, part of it reflects off the top surface, and part penetrates into the oil. Then, at the bottom surface where the oil meets the water, another reflection occurs. These two reflected rays can interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the path difference and the wavelengths.\n\nSince the light is normally incident, the angle is 0 degrees, which simplifies things because there's no refraction affecting the path difference due to angles. The path difference is mainly determined by the thickness of the oil layer and the refractive indices.\n\nNow, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium. The formula for the path difference in a thin film is:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = 2n t \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\nBut since the light is normally incident, \u03b8 is 0, so cos\u03b8 is 1. Therefore, the path difference simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = 2n t\n\\]\n\nFor constructive interference, this path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the oil:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = m \\lambda_{oil}\n\\]\n\nWhere m is an integer, t is the thickness, n is the refractive index of the oil, and \u03bb_oil is the wavelength of light in the oil.\n\nI also need to consider the phase change upon reflection. When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index, there's a phase shift of half a wavelength. In this case, light reflects off the top surface of the oil (reflecting from a medium with a lower index, air, to a higher index, oil), so there's a phase shift there. At the bottom surface, it reflects from oil (higher index) to water (lower index), which is from higher to lower, so no additional phase shift. Therefore, there's a net phase shift of half a wavelength due to the first reflection.\n\nTo account for this phase shift, I need to adjust the condition for constructive interference. Instead of \u03b4 = m\u03bb_oil, it should be:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = m \\lambda_{oil} + \\frac{\\lambda_{oil}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda_{oil}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2n t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda_{oil}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find \u03bb_oil in terms of the vacuum wavelength, \u03bb. The relationship between \u03bb and \u03bb_oil is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{oil} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\n\\]\n\nPlugging this into the earlier equation:\n\n\\[\n2n t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\frac{\\lambda}{n}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4n^2 t}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nGiven that t = 500 nm and n = 1.5, I can plug these values in:\n\nFirst, calculate n squared:\n\n\\[\nn^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 \\times 2.25 \\times 500 \\text{ nm}}{2m + 1} = \\frac{4500 \\text{ nm}}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find integer values of m that give me wavelengths close to the options provided: 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm.\n\nLet me try m = 1:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4500}{2(1) + 1} = \\frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's way outside the visible range.\n\nm = 2:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4500}{4 + 1} = \\frac{4500}{5} = 900 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nStill not visible.\n\nm = 3:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4500}{6 + 1} = \\frac{4500}{7} \\approx 642.86 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's close to 650 nm.\n\nm = 4:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4500}{8 + 1} = \\frac{4500}{9} \\approx 500 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThere we go, that matches one of the options.\n\nm = 5:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4500}{10 + 1} = \\frac{4500}{11} \\approx 409.09 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's in the violet range, shorter than 500 nm.\n\nSo, for m = 4, \u03bb \u2248 500 nm, and for m = 3, \u03bb \u2248 642.86 nm, which is close to 650 nm.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the wavelength that's most strongly reflected, which corresponds to constructive interference. So, among the options, 500 nm and 650 nm are the ones that satisfy the constructive interference condition based on the calculations above.\n\nHowever, the question is to pick the most strongly reflected wavelength, implying a single answer. Maybe I need to consider which one is more strongly reflected between 500 nm and 650 nm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the intensity of reflection and see which wavelength has the highest reflectivity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the order of interference. Higher orders might have lower intensities due to more light being transmitted or absorbed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the first-order maximum is the strongest, and higher orders are weaker.\n\nIf that's the case, then m = 1 would correspond to \u03bb \u2248 1500 nm, which is not visible, and m = 2 is 900 nm, still not visible. m = 3 is approximately 642.86 nm, and m = 4 is 500 nm.\n\nIf the first visible constructive interference is at m = 3, 642.86 nm, and m = 4, 500 nm, perhaps the one with m = 3 is stronger because it's the first visible constructive maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the reflectance formula or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reflectance is strongest at the wavelength where the path difference equals exactly one wavelength in the film, i.e., m = 1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, m = 1 gives \u03bb = 1500 nm, which is infrared, not visible.\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for constructive interference without considering the phase shift.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier regarding the phase shift.\n\nWhen light reflects off the top surface of the oil (from air to oil, higher index), there's a phase shift of half a wavelength. At the bottom surface (from oil to water, lower index), there's no phase shift. So, total phase shift is half a wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the condition for constructive interference should be:\n\n\\[\n2n t = m \\lambda + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n\\[\n2n t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the reflection coefficients at each interface.\n\nThe reflection coefficient at the air-oil interface is positive (since n_oil > n_air), and at the oil-water interface, it's negative (since n_water > n_oil).\n\nWait, actually, the reflection coefficient at the air-oil interface is negative because n_oil > n_air, and at oil-water, it's positive because n_water > n_oil.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused about the signs.\n\nLet me look up the reflection coefficient formula.\n\nThe reflection coefficient, r, at an interface between two media is given by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_2 + n_1}\n\\]\n\nSo, for air to oil (n1=1, n2=1.5):\n\n\\[\nr_{air-oil} = \\frac{1.5 - 1}{1.5 + 1} = \\frac{0.5}{2.5} = 0.2\n\\]\n\nAnd for oil to water (n1=1.5, n2=1.33):\n\n\\[\nr_{oil-water} = \\frac{1.33 - 1.5}{1.33 + 1.5} = \\frac{-0.17}{2.83} \\approx -0.06\n\\]\n\nSo, the reflection coefficients are positive for air-oil and negative for oil-water.\n\nNow, the electric fields of the reflected waves need to be added to find the net reflected field.\n\nThe phase difference between the two reflected waves is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} 2n t + \\phi_0\n\\]\n\nWhere \u03c6\u2080 is the phase shift upon reflection.\n\nSince there's a phase shift of \u03c0 at the first reflection (air to oil), and no phase shift at the second reflection (oil to water), then \u03c6\u2080 = \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the total phase difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{4\\pi n t}{\\lambda} + \\pi\n\\]\n\nFor constructive interference, \u03b4 = 2m\u03c0, where m is an integer.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\pi n t}{\\lambda} + \\pi = 2m\\pi\n\\]\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\pi n t}{\\lambda} = (2m - 1)\\pi\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n t}{2m - 1}\n\\]\n\nThis is similar to what I had earlier.\n\nPlugging in n = 1.5, t = 500 nm:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 \\times 1.5 \\times 500 \\text{ nm}}{2m - 1} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ nm}}{2m - 1}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's try m = 1:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{3000}{1} = 3000 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's infrared.\n\nm = 2:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{3000}{3} = 1000 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nStill infrared.\n\nm = 3:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{3000}{5} = 600 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's visible green light.\n\nm = 4:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{3000}{7} \\approx 428.57 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's violet.\n\nm = 5:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{3000}{9} \\approx 333.33 \\text{ nm}\n\\]\n\nThat's ultraviolet.\n\nSo, among the given options, 600 nm is one of the options, and 500 nm is close to the m=4 case, which is approximately 428 nm.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different formula. Maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for constructive interference.\n\nThe phase difference \u03b4 should be:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = \\frac{4\\pi n t}{\\lambda} + \\pi = 2m\\pi\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\pi n t}{\\lambda} = (2m - 1)\\pi\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n t}{2m - 1}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for m = 1: 3000 nm (IR)\n\nm = 2: 1000 nm (IR)\n\nm = 3: 600 nm (green)\n\nm = 4: ~428 nm (violet)\n\nm = 5: ~333 nm (UV)\n\nSo, 600 nm is one of the constructive interference wavelengths.\n\nBut the options are 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider destructive interference as well, but the question is about most strongly reflected, which would correspond to constructive interference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the reflectance intensity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the wavelength that has the highest reflectance, considering the reflectance at each interface.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the reflectance using the Fresnel equations.\n\nThe Fresnel equations give the reflectance at each interface based on the refractive indices and the polarization of light.\n\nBut this might be too complicated for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the reflectance in a thin film:\n\n\\[\nR = r_{01}^2 + r_{01} r_{12} \\frac{4 \\cos \\theta}{n_{12}} \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\delta}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the reflectance is maximized when the path difference corresponds to constructive interference.\n\nGiven that, and from my earlier calculation, m = 3 gives \u03bb = 600 nm, which is one of the options.\n\nBut m = 4 gives approximately 428 nm, which is not among the options.\n\nTherefore, 600 nm seems to be a possible answer.\n\nBut the options include 500 nm, which corresponds to m = 4 in my earlier incorrect calculation.\n\nWait, in my first calculation, I had:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n^2 t}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nWhich gave \u03bb \u2248 500 nm for m = 4.\n\nBut according to the correct formula I derived later:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n t}{2m - 1}\n\\]\n\nWhich gives \u03bb = 600 nm for m = 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct formula is the second one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the path difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = 2n t \\cos \\theta + \\phi_0\n\\]\n\nAnd for normal incidence, cos\u03b8 = 1, and \u03c6\u2080 = \u03c0 for a phase shift upon reflection.\n\nThen, for constructive interference:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = m \\lambda + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2n t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n t}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nWait, this contradicts my earlier correct formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused myself.\n\nLet me re-derive the formula properly.\n\nThe optical path difference between the two reflected rays is:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = 2n t \\cos \\theta + \\phi_0\n\\]\n\nFor normal incidence, \u03b8 = 0, so cos\u03b8 = 1.\n\nThe phase shift \u03c6\u2080 upon reflection is \u03c0 at the first surface (air to oil, higher index) and 0 at the second surface (oil to water, lower index).\n\nTherefore, total phase shift is \u03c0.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\delta = 2n t + \\pi\n\\]\n\nFor constructive interference:\n\n\\[\n\\delta = m \\lambda + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n2n t + \\pi = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{2n t + \\pi}{m + 0.5}\n\\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I need to consider that the phase shift is already accounted for in the path difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:\n\n\\[\n2n t = m \\lambda + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2n t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 n t}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nThis seems consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nNow, plugging in n = 1.5, t = 500 nm:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{4 \\times 1.5 \\times 500 \\text{ nm}}{2m + 1} = \\frac{3000 \\text{ nm}}{2m + 1}\n\\]\n\nFor m = 1: 3000 nm (IR)\n\nm = 2: 1000 nm (IR)\n\nm = 3: 600 nm (green)\n\nm = 4: 428.57 nm (violet)\n\nm = 5: 333.33 nm (UV)\n\nSo, 600 nm is the only visible wavelength in these calculations.\n\nBut the options include 500 nm and 650 nm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the reflectance is not just determined by the constructive interference condition but also by the intensity of the reflected light.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple orders that contribute to the reflectance, and their combination could enhance certain wavelengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the reflectance at each interface and how they interfere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the reflectance is strongest at the wavelength where the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, considering the phase shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I"
