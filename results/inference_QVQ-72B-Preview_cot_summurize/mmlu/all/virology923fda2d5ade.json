                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a medical class with 147 students who took a biochemistry final exam. The statistics given are: mean score is 67, median is 76, mode is 80, standard deviation is 5.5, and variance is 30.25. Then, three students couldn't take the test on time and took a different version a week later. The question is asking which parameter is most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. Standard deviation and variance are measures of spread or variability, not central tendency, so options D and E are probably not relevant for this question. But let's make sure.\n\nCentral tendency refers to the typical or central value in a distribution. Mean, median, and mode are common measures of central tendency. Mean is the average value, median is the middle value when data is ordered, and mode is the most frequent value.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that three students took a different form of the exam a week later. This suggests that their scores might not be directly comparable to the rest of the class due to differences in the exam version or because they had an extra week to prepare. So, their scores could be biased in some way.\n\nThe question is asking which of these measures (mean, median, mode) is least likely to be biased in estimating the central tendency of the entire class's performance.\n\nLet's think about each option:\n\nA. Mean: The mean is sensitive to every value in the dataset. If the three late students have scores that are higher or lower than the rest, it will affect the mean. Since their scores might be biased, this could introduce bias into the mean as a measure of central tendency.\n\nB. Median: The median is the middle value when data is ordered. In a large class of 147 students, the median is primarily determined by the scores of the students around the middle of the distribution. The scores of the three late students, being a small portion of the class, are unlikely to shift the median significantly unless their scores are extremely high or low compared to the rest.\n\nC. Mode: The mode is the most frequent score. With 147 students, unless the three late students' scores are the same as the existing mode, they shouldn't affect the mode much. If their scores are different, they might not change the mode at all, especially if the existing mode is well-established.\n\nGiven this, the median and mode seem less sensitive to the inclusion of the three potentially biased scores compared to the mean.\n\nBut let's think deeper. In a distribution with a mean of 67, a median of 76, and a mode of 80, it seems like the distribution is skewed to the right. Normally, in a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the tail, while the median is less affected and the mode is towards the higher end.\n\nSo, in this case, the mean is being pulled down by some lower scores, possibly outliers or a skewness towards lower scores.\n\nGiven that, the median might be a better measure of central tendency because it is less affected by skewed data or outliers.\n\nHowever, considering that three students took a different exam and might have scores that are systematically different, perhaps due to having more time to study or differences in the exam difficulty, their scores could introduce bias into any measure.\n\nBut among the options, the mean would be most directly affected by these scores because it includes every score in its calculation. The median, being based on position in the ordered data, is less sensitive to a few extreme values or differences in a small number of scores.\n\nThe mode, depending on the frequency distribution, might not be affected at all by the three new scores unless they match the existing mode.\n\nHowever, if the three students all scored the same and that score becomes the most frequent, then the mode could change significantly.\n\nBut given that there are 147 students, it's unlikely that three students would change the mode unless their score matches the existing mode or creates a new one with higher frequency.\n\nIn any case, the median seems to be the most robust to changes from a small number of potentially biased scores.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the median is the least biased estimator of central tendency in this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Median.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
