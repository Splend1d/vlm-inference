                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if this covenant not to compete is enforceable. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an employment contract with an \"at will\" provision. That means either the employer or the employee can terminate the employment at any time, as long as they give reasonable notice. Got it.\n\nThen, one year after the employment starts, the employer asks the employee to sign a covenant not to compete. This covenant restricts the employee from working for a competitor for two years after termination. Okay.\n\nTwo years later, the employee quits and immediately goes to work for a competitor. The former employer sues and wants a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argues that the covenant is invalid because there was no consideration given for signing it. The employer counters that continuing the employee's employment after having her sign the covenant is the consideration.\n\nAlright, so the main issue here is whether there was sufficient consideration to make the covenant enforceable.\n\nLet me recall what consideration is. In contract law, consideration is something of value that is exchanged between parties. It's what makes a promise enforceable. Basically, for a contract to be binding, there has to be consideration.\n\nNow, in the context of employment, when an employer and employee enter into an employment contract, that contract is supported by consideration. The employer provides job opportunities and compensation, and the employee provides their labor and skills.\n\nBut in this case, the covenant not to compete was signed one year after the employment started. So, the initial employment contract was already in place, and now there's an additional agreement being made.\n\nThe employee is arguing that since she could be fired at any time under the \"at will\" provision and didn't receive anything extra for signing the covenant, there's no new consideration.\n\nThe employer is saying that by continuing her employment after she signed the covenant, they provided consideration.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether continuing employment can serve as consideration for a new covenant not to compete.\n\nI remember reading about this before. Generally, when an existing employee is asked to sign a non-compete agreement, the employer needs to provide something additional, some benefit, to make the agreement enforceable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, continuing employment can be considered sufficient consideration, especially if the employee continues to be employed for a substantial period after signing the covenant.\n\nIn this case, the employee continued to work for two more years after signing the covenant. That might be seen as a substantial period, suggesting that the continued employment was the consideration for the covenant.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the employee could argue that she was already employed and had no obligation to sign the covenant, and that the employer could have fired her if she didn't sign it. So, maybe there wasn't any real bargaining power or additional benefit provided.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the covenant was part of the original employment contract, it might be enforceable because it's part of the overall agreement. But in this case, it was added later, so the situation is different.\n\nI think the key here is whether the covenant was supported by independent consideration. Continuing employment might be seen as consideration, but there might be arguments against it.\n\nLet me consider some case law. I recall a case called Loral Fairchild v. Sanders, where the court held that continued employment can be sufficient consideration for a non-compete agreement signed after employment has commenced, provided that the employee continues to be employed for a substantial period after signing the agreement.\n\nIn another case, like Adhikari v. Feinstein, the court held that continued employment alone may not be sufficient consideration for a non-compete agreement, and that there needs to be something more, like a promotion, a raise, or additional benefits.\n\nSo, it seems like there's some inconsistency in how different jurisdictions handle this issue.\n\nIn this particular scenario, the employee worked for two more years after signing the covenant. That seems like a substantial period, which might support the argument that continuing employment was the consideration.\n\nBut the employee is arguing that she could be fired at any time under the \"at will\" provision, so the promise of continued employment isn't really binding.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the employer should have provided something more tangible in exchange for the covenant, like a bonus or additional benefits.\n\nWait, the employer is arguing that they didn't have to continue her employment and that by doing so, they provided consideration for the covenant.\n\nBut the employee might counter that since she was already employed and had no obligation to sign the covenant, the continued employment wasn't really something new or additional.\n\nThis brings up the concept of \"forbearance\" or \"restraint from terminating employment\" as consideration. Some courts accept this, while others do not.\n\nI think it depends on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where this case is being heard.\n\nAssuming that the jurisdiction recognizes continued employment as sufficient consideration for a covenant not to compete signed during employment, then the employer might have a strong argument.\n\nHowever, if the jurisdiction requires something more than just continued employment, then the employer might not have provided adequate consideration.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider the options provided:\n\nA. Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.\n\nB. Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.\n\nC. Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.\n\nD. No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n\nOption A suggests that continued employment for a substantial period is adequate consideration. Based on what I've considered, this seems plausible in some jurisdictions.\n\nOption B says that modification of an existing contract doesn't require consideration. Actually, that's not accurate. Generally, for a modification to be enforceable, there must be new consideration. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C claims that courts never question the adequacy of consideration. While it's true that courts generally don't inquire into the sufficiency of consideration, they do require that some consideration exists. So, this is too broad.\n\nOption D states that there was inadequate consideration for the covenant. This could be a possible answer if the continued employment is not considered sufficient consideration.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is A, assuming that the jurisdiction recognizes continued employment for a substantial period as adequate consideration for a covenant not to compete.\n\nHowever, since the employee is arguing that there was no consideration, and there is a debate about whether continued employment alone is sufficient consideration, it's possible that the court could rule either way.\n\nBut based on the information provided and the options given, A seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
