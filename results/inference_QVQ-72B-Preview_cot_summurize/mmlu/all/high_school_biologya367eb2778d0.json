                    "text": "So I've got this question here about hormones and their functions. It says that all of the following statements are true except one, and I need to figure out which one is false. The options are:\n\nA. Thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism.\n\nB. Insulin decreases storage of glycogen.\n\nC. Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney.\n\nD. Epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate.\n\nAlright, let's go through each one.\n\nStarting with A: Thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism. I remember that thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and it's known for regulating metabolic rate. So, yes, it increases the rate of metabolism. That seems correct.\n\nMoving on to B: Insulin decreases storage of glycogen. Hmm, I thought insulin was involved in storing glycogen. Let me think. When blood sugar levels rise, insulin is released, which helps cells take up glucose and store it as glycogen. So, actually, insulin promotes glycogen storage, not decreases it. Maybe this is the false statement.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's look at C: Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney. I recall that vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), does exactly that. It helps the kidneys reabsorb water to prevent dehydration. So, that seems correct.\n\nLastly, D: Epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate. Epinephrine, or adrenaline, is released during stress and fight-or-flight responses. It's known for raising blood sugar levels and increasing heart rate to provide more energy and oxygen to muscles. So, that checks out.\n\nBased on this, it seems like option B is the incorrect statement. Insulin actually promotes glycogen storage, not decreases it.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Glycogen is a form of stored glucose in the liver and muscles. When we eat, insulin helps convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage. So, yes, insulin is essential for glycogen synthesis. Therefore, saying it decreases storage of glycogen is incorrect.\n\nAlright, I'm confident now. The false statement is B. Insulin decreases storage of glycogen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
