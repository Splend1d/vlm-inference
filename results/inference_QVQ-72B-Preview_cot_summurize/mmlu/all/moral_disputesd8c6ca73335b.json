I need to pick the one that best aligns with Nathanson's views. Let me think about what each type means and see which one fits.\n\nFirst, retributivism is a theory of punishment that emphasizes giving offenders the punishment they deserve based on the severity of their crimes. It's about balancing the scales of justice. Now, let's break down each option:\n\nA. Preventive retributivism: This sounds like a combination of retribution and prevention. Maybe it's about punishing someone to deter future crimes while also giving them what they deserve. But I think prevention is more aligned with utilitarian approaches, not strictly retributivist.\n\nB. Proportional retributivism: This seems to suggest that the punishment should match the crime in terms of severity. So, the more serious the offense, the harsher the punishment. This aligns well with the idea of \"an eye for an eye\" or proportionate justice.\n\nC. Equality retributivism: This might refer to treating all offenders equally under the law, regardless of their social status or other factors. It could mean that everyone is subject to the same standards of punishment for similar crimes.\n\nD. Retaliatory retributivism: This sounds very similar to proportional retributivism, perhaps emphasizing the idea of payback or retaliation for the harm caused. It might be more focused on the victim's perspective or on exacting revenge in a controlled manner.\n\nNow, considering Nathanson's views. I recall that he discusses the importance of proportionality in punishment, emphasizing that sentences should fit the crime. He argues that punishment should be commensurate with the harm caused and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.\n\nGiven that, option B, proportional retributivism, seems to align closely with his perspective. He stresses the need for punishments to be balanced and proportionate, not too lenient or too severe, but just enough to reflect the gravity of the offense.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A, preventive retributivism, seems to blend retribution with preventive goals, like rehabilitating the offender or protecting society. While prevention is important in criminal justice, Nathanson appears to prioritize retribution and proportionality over preventive measures.\n\nOption C, equality retributivism, focuses on equal treatment under the law. While Nathanson likely supports equality in punishment, his emphasis seems to be more on the proportionality of punishment to the crime rather than solely on equality.\n\nOption D, retaliatory retributivism, might involve an element of retribution, but it sounds too much like seeking revenge, which Nathanson might not fully endorse. He seems to favor a more measured and just approach to punishment rather than one driven by vengeance.\n\nTherefore, based on his emphasis on proportionality in punishment, I would say that Nathanson supports proportional retributivism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
