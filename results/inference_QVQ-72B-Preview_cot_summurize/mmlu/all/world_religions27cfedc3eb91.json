                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Sikh history. The question is: \"Which Guru was martyred when he refused to embrace Islam?\" And the options are Guru Ram Das, Guru Tegh Bahadur, Guru Gobind Singh, and Guru Har Rai.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some information about the Sikh Gurus. I know that Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and there are a total of ten human Gurus in Sikhism. Each Guru contributed to the religion in their own way, and some faced significant challenges and persecutions during their lifetimes.\n\nLet me think about the context of the question. It's asking about a Guru who was martyred specifically for refusing to convert to Islam. Martyrdom suggests that the Guru was killed because of his religious beliefs or principles.\n\nI should probably start by eliminating the options that I don't think are correct. Let's see...\n\nStarting with Guru Ram Das Ji. I remember that he was the fourth Sikh Guru and is known for establishing the city of Amritsar and the Golden Temple. I don't recall any stories about him being martyred or forced to convert to Islam. So, maybe he's not the correct answer.\n\nNext, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. He was the ninth Sikh Guru. I have a stronger recollection about him. I think he was martyred for refusing to convert to Islam. Let me verify that. I believe that during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, who was a strict Muslim fundamentalist, many non-Muslims were under pressure to convert to Islam. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji stood firm in his faith and refused to convert, even when faced with death. He was executed in 1675 in Delhi, which is a significant event in Sikh history. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nThen there's Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth and final human Guru of Sikhism. He was known for formalizing the Sikh community as the Khalsa in 1699. I know that he also faced persecution and had to fight against the Mughals, but I don't think he was martyred for refusing to convert to Islam. He was actually assassinated in 1708 by Muslim warriors, but the primary reason wasn't his refusal to convert; it was more about the political and military conflicts of the time.\n\nLastly, Guru Har Rai Ji, who was the seventh Sikh Guru. I don't recall any stories about him being forced to convert to Islam or being martyred. He is known for his love for nature and for continuing the teachings of the previous Gurus, but I don't think he faced martyrdom.\n\nSo, based on this recall, it seems that Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji is the correct answer. He was indeed martyred for refusing to embrace Islam, which makes him a significant figure in Sikh history for his sacrifice to protect religious freedom.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my knowledge. I remember that his martyrdom was a turning point for the Sikh community, leading to the formalization of the Khalsa by his son, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who emphasized martial training to defend their religious freedoms.\n\nYes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be Guru Tegh Bahadur.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Guru Tegh Bahadur}} \\]"
