                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle with mass m and charge Q moving towards a uniform electric field of strength E and traveling a distance d. Then it asks what happens if the original velocity is doubled and the mass is cut in half. The options are 4d, 2d, d, or 1/2d.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the situation. There's a particle with mass m and charge Q moving with velocity v into a uniform electric field of strength E. It travels a distance d. Now, if I double the velocity to 2v and halve the mass to m/2, how far does it travel?\n\nI think this is a problem involving kinematics and possibly work-energy principles in the context of electric fields. Since it's a uniform electric field, the force on the particle should be constant, right? The electric force would be F = Q*E.\n\nNow, the particle is moving with an initial velocity v, and there's a force acting on it due to the electric field. Depending on the direction of the charge and the field, the force could be in the same direction as the motion or opposite. I need to assume a scenario here. Let's say the particle is moving in the direction of the electric field lines, so the force is in the same direction as the motion if the charge is positive.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't specify the direction of the charge or the field, but since it's just asking about the distance traveled, and it's a uniform field, I think I can assume that the force is in the direction of motion for simplicity.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"directed toward a uniform electric field,\" but it doesn't specify the direction of the field relative to the motion. To make this problem solvable, I need to assume a specific configuration. Maybe I can assume that the particle is moving in the direction opposite to the electric field, so the force is opposing its motion. That would make sense for \"toward the field.\"\n\nLet me clarify: if the particle is moving toward the electric field, meaning against the direction of the field lines, then for a positive charge, the electric force would be in the opposite direction to the motion, right? So the particle would be decelerated by the field.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"toward a uniform electric field,\" which could mean moving in the direction of the field lines or against them, depending on the field direction. This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of work done by the electric field on the particle. The work done by the electric field would be W = F * d = Q * E * d, assuming the force is constant and in the direction of motion.\n\nBut wait, if the particle is moving against the field, the force would be against its motion, so the work done would be negative, meaning it would lose kinetic energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the work-energy theorem, which states that the work done by all forces equals the change in kinetic energy.\n\nSo, the work done by the electric field would be W = F * d = Q * E * d, but I need to consider the direction. If the particle is moving against the field, and the field is opposing its motion, then the force is in the opposite direction to the displacement, so W = -Q * E * d.\n\nAccording to the work-energy theorem, W = \u0394K, where \u0394K is the change in kinetic energy.\n\nSo, -Q * E * d = (final kinetic energy) - (initial kinetic energy)\n\nAssuming the particle comes to rest, then final kinetic energy is zero, so:\n\n-Q * E * d = 0 - (1/2) m v\u00b2\n\nTherefore, (1/2) m v\u00b2 = Q * E * d\n\nSo, the initial kinetic energy equals the work done by the electric field.\n\nNow, if I double the velocity to 2v and halve the mass to m/2, I need to find the new distance d' such that the same work is done.\n\nWait, but the work done by the electric field is still W = -Q * E * d', and the change in kinetic energy should be equal to this work.\n\nSo, (1/2) (m/2) (2v)\u00b2 - (1/2) m v\u00b2 = -Q * E * d'\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n(1/2) * (m/2) * (4 v\u00b2) - (1/2) m v\u00b2 = -Q * E * d'\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2) * (m/2) * 4 v\u00b2 = (1/2) m v\u00b2\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, (1/2) (m/2) (2v)\u00b2 = (1/2) * (m/2) * 4 v\u00b2 = (1/2) * 2 m v\u00b2 = m v\u00b2\n\nSo, new initial kinetic energy is m v\u00b2\n\nAnd the final kinetic energy is zero, assuming it comes to rest again.\n\nSo, change in kinetic energy is 0 - m v\u00b2 = -m v\u00b2\n\nSet equal to the work done:\n\n-Q * E * d' = -m v\u00b2\n\nSo, Q * E * d' = m v\u00b2\n\nBut from the original scenario, (1/2) m v\u00b2 = Q * E * d\n\nSo, m v\u00b2 = 2 Q * E * d\n\nTherefore, Q * E * d' = 2 Q * E * d\n\nCancel Q and E from both sides:\n\nd' = 2 d\n\nSo, the new distance is twice the original distance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2d\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my assumptions.\n\nI assumed that the particle comes to rest in both cases, which might not necessarily be the case. Maybe in the original scenario, it comes to rest, but in the new scenario, it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particle is decelerated by the electric field over a certain distance until it stops.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should use the equation of motion.\n\nThe particle has an initial velocity v, and there's a constant force F = -Q E (assuming it's decelerating), so acceleration a = -Q E / m.\n\nThen, using the equation v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + 2 a s, where u is initial velocity, v is final velocity, a is acceleration, and s is displacement.\n\nAssuming the particle comes to rest, v = 0, so:\n\n0 = u\u00b2 + 2 a s\n\nTherefore, s = -u\u00b2 / (2 a )\n\nGiven a = -Q E / m, so s = m u\u00b2 / (2 Q E )\n\nIn the original case, s = d = m v\u00b2 / (2 Q E )\n\nNow, if velocity is doubled to 2v and mass is halved to m/2, then:\n\ns' = (m/2) (2v)\u00b2 / (2 Q E ) = (m/2) * 4 v\u00b2 / (2 Q E ) = m v\u00b2 / Q E\n\nBut from the original equation, m v\u00b2 / (2 Q E ) = d, so m v\u00b2 / Q E = 2 d\n\nTherefore, s' = 2 d\n\nSo, again, I get s' = 2 d\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2d\n\nI think this makes sense. The key was to assume that the particle comes to rest in both scenarios, and use the work-energy theorem or the equation of motion accordingly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 2d} \\]"
