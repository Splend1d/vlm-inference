                    "text": "So I'm dealing with this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically about the magnetic quantum number m_l for an electron in an atom. The problem says that the electron is in the l = 2 state, and I need to find out how many allowed values of m_l there are. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what m_l represents. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when we talk about the angular momentum of an electron in an atom, the angular momentum can point in different directions due to the uncertainty principle. The quantum number l describes the magnitude of the angular momentum, and m_l describes the component of this angular momentum along a particular axis, usually the z-axis.\n\nSo, m_l is the magnetic quantum number associated with the angular momentum, and it can take on integer values ranging from -l to +l, including zero. That means for a given l, there are (2l + 1) possible values of m_l.\n\nGiven that l = 2, I can plug this into the formula:\n\nNumber of m_l values = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, there should be 5 allowed values of m_l when l = 2.\n\nLet me list them out to make sure. For l = 2, m_l can be:\n\n1. m_l = -2\n\n2. m_l = -1\n\n3. m_l = 0\n\n4. m_l = +1\n\n5. m_l = +2\n\nThat's indeed 5 values. So, the answer should be D. 5.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this again. Is there any chance that some of these m_l values could be invalid in certain situations? For example, if the spin quantum number comes into play or if there are other constraints.\n\nThe problem states that it's a single-electron atom, which probably means it's like hydrogen, where there's only one electron. In hydrogen-like atoms, the energy depends only on the principal quantum number n, and the angular momentum is described by l, with m_l determining the orientation of the angular momentum in space.\n\nBut since the energy doesn't depend on m_l, all these values should be allowed. So, I don't think there's any reason to suspect that any of the m_l values from -2 to +2 are invalid in this scenario.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the possible orbitals. For l = 0, it's the s-orbital, with m_l = 0 (only one orbital). For l = 1, it's p-orbitals, with m_l = -1, 0, +1 (three orbitals). For l = 2, it's d-orbitals, which should have m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 (five orbitals). So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the definition again. The magnetic quantum number m_l can take on integer values from -l to +l, inclusive. So, for l = 2, m_l can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. That's five values.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem seems straightforward. It's probably just testing whether I remember that for a given l, m_l ranges from -l to +l in integer steps.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
