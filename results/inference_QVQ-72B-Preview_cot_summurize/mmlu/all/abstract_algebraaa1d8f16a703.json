                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about rings and polynomials. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nStatement 1 says: If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what an integral domain is. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (so it has a multiplicative identity, usually denoted as 1), and it has no zero divisors. That means if you have two elements a and b in R, and their product is zero, then either a is zero or b is zero.\n\nNow, R[x] refers to the ring of polynomials in one variable x over the ring R. So, if R is an integral domain, is R[x] also an integral domain?\n\nI think yes, because in an integral domain, since there are no zero divisors in R, then the polynomials over R should also not have zero divisors. But I need to think about this carefully.\n\nLet me consider two polynomials in R[x], say f(x) and g(x). If f(x) and g(x) are both nonzero, but their product f(x)g(x) is zero, that would mean that there's a problem. But in an integral domain, since R has no zero divisors, the coefficients of the polynomials can't multiply to zero unless one of them is zero. So, it seems like R[x] should also be an integral domain.\n\nBut wait, I've heard something about polynomial rings over integral domains being integral domains themselves. Is there a theorem that states this?\n\nYes, I believe there is. In fact, it's a standard result in ring theory that if R is an integral domain, then the polynomial ring R[x] is also an integral domain. So, Statement 1 should be true.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n\nDegree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a nonzero coefficient. So, this statement is saying that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of the original polynomials.\n\nThis seems familiar from basic algebra, like when we multiply polynomials over the real numbers or integers. But is this always true for any ring R?\n\nI need to think about this carefully. Let's consider two polynomials f(x) and g(x) in R[x]. Suppose deg f(x) = m and deg g(x) = n. Then, the leading term of f(x) is a x^m and of g(x) is b x^n, where a and b are the leading coefficients.\n\nWhen we multiply f(x) and g(x), the leading term of the product should be a b x^{m+n}. So, the degree of the product should be m + n, assuming that a b is nonzero.\n\nBut wait, in a general ring R, there might be zero divisors. That is, it's possible that a and b are both nonzero, but a b = 0. If that happens, then the leading term of the product would be zero, and the degree of the product would be less than m + n.\n\nSo, in a ring with zero divisors, this statement might not hold. Let me try to find a counterexample.\n\nSuppose R is a ring with zero divisors. For instance, take R = Z/4Z, the integers modulo 4. This ring has zero divisors, like 2 and 2, since 2*2 = 4 \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nNow, consider the polynomials f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 2x in R[x]. The degree of f(x) is 1, and the degree of g(x) is 1. According to the statement, deg(f(x)g(x)) should be 2.\n\nBut f(x)g(x) = 2x * 2x = 4x^2 \u2261 0x^2 = 0 in R[x], since 4 \u2261 0 mod 4. So, the product is the zero polynomial, which has degree -\u221e or undefined, depending on convention.\n\nTherefore, in this case, deg(f(x)g(x)) is not equal to deg f(x) + deg g(x). So, Statement 2 is false in general for any ring R.\n\nBut, I should note that if R is an integral domain, meaning it has no zero divisors, then the statement would be true. Because in that case, a b \u2260 0 if a \u2260 0 and b \u2260 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"If R is a ring,\" which doesn't specify that it's an integral domain. So, in general rings, Statement 2 can be false, as shown by the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any condition in Statement 1 that I might have overlooked? No, I think the proof for Statement 1 is solid: if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is indeed an integral domain.\n\nFor Statement 2, the counterexample seems valid, showing that in rings with zero divisors, the degree rule doesn't hold.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
