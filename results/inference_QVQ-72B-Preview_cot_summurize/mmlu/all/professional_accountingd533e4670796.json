                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the standard deviation of an equal-weighted portfolio consisting of two stocks, A and B. The standard deviations of Stock A and Stock B are 6% and 18% respectively, and their correlation is 0.2. I need to find the standard deviation of this portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to calculate the standard deviation of a portfolio. Since it's an equal-weighted portfolio, that means each stock has a weight of 50% or 0.5 in the portfolio.\n\nThe formula for the portfolio variance is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p^2 = w_A^2 \\sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \\rho_{A,B} \\sigma_A \\sigma_B\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(w_A\\) and \\(w_B\\) are the weights of Stock A and Stock B in the portfolio,\n\n- \\(\\sigma_A\\) and \\(\\sigma_B\\) are their respective standard deviations,\n\n- \\(\\rho_{A,B}\\) is the correlation between the two stocks.\n\nGiven that it's an equal-weighted portfolio:\n\n\\[\nw_A = w_B = 0.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_A = 6\\% = 0.06\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_B = 18\\% = 0.18\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{A,B} = 0.2\n\\]\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p^2 = (0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 + (0.5)^2 (0.18)^2 + 2 (0.5) (0.5) (0.2) (0.06) (0.18)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\[\n(0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 = 0.25 \\times 0.0036 = 0.0009\n\\]\n\nSecond term:\n\n\\[\n(0.5)^2 (0.18)^2 = 0.25 \\times 0.0324 = 0.0081\n\\]\n\nThird term:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.18 = 2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.18\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(2 \\times 0.5 = 1\\)\n\nThen, \\(1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5\\)\n\nThen, \\(0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\)\n\nThen, \\(0.1 \\times 0.06 = 0.006\\)\n\nFinally, \\(0.006 \\times 0.18 = 0.00108\\)\n\nNow, sum all three terms:\n\n\\[\n0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.00998\n\\]\n\nThis is the variance of the portfolio. To find the standard deviation, I need to take the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{0.00998} \\approx 0.1000\n\\]\n\nConverting to percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.1000 \\times 100\\% = 10\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the equal-weighted portfolio is approximately 10%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10%\n\nB. 5%\n\nC. 3.40%\n\nD. 9.70%\n\nThe correct answer is A. 10%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: \\(0.5^2 \\times 0.06^2 = 0.25 \\times 0.0036 = 0.0009\\) \u2013 that's correct.\n\nSecond term: \\(0.5^2 \\times 0.18^2 = 0.25 \\times 0.0324 = 0.0081\\) \u2013 correct.\n\nThird term: \\(2 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.06 \\times 0.18\\)\n\nStep by step:\n\n\\(2 \\times 0.5 = 1\\)\n\n\\(1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5\\)\n\n\\(0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\)\n\n\\(0.1 \\times 0.06 = 0.006\\)\n\n\\(0.006 \\times 0.18 = 0.00108\\) \u2013 yes, that's correct.\n\nSum: \\(0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.00998\\) \u2013 correct.\n\nSquare root of 0.00998 is approximately 0.1000, which is 10%. So, the answer should be A. 10%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 10\\%} \\]"
