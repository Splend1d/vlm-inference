                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this legal question about impeaching a witness with a prior conviction. The scenario is that Sally, who is testifying in a case against a former police officer for extortion, has a past conviction for vehicular homicide. She pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty, and got a suspended sentence, but the maximum she could have gotten was up to 5 years in prison.\n\nThe question is whether this conviction can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of one year.\n\nB. Inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\n\nC. Inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\n\nD. Inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"impeach\" means in this context. Impeaching a witness involves challenging their credibility or the reliability of their testimony. One common way to do this is by showing that the witness has a criminal record, particularly if the crime involved dishonesty or moral turpitude.\n\nNow, the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 609, govern the admissibility of prior criminal convictions for impeachment purposes. Let's look at that rule.\n\nRule 609 states:\n\n(a) Criminal convictions used to attack a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness.\n\n(1) For convictions admissible under a federal or state statute, the court must permit, and otherwise the court may permit, attacking the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness by evidence that:\n\n(A) the witness was ever convicted of a crime; and\n\n(B) the crime/(i) was punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, or (ii) involved fraud or a false statement, regardless of the punishment.\n\n(2) The court may not admit a conviction under this rule more than 10 years old unless the proponent shows good cause.\n\nSo, according to this rule, convictions that are punishable by more than one year in prison or involve fraud or false statements can be used to impeach a witness's credibility.\n\nIn this case, Sally was convicted of vehicular homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of up to 5 years in prison. That's more than one year, so it falls under the first part of Rule 609(a)(1)(A).\n\nBut wait, there are some nuances here.\n\nFirst, Sally pleaded nolo contendere. I need to understand what that means. A nolo contendere plea is essentially saying, \"I will not contest the charge,\" but it's not the same as admitting guilt. However, in most jurisdictions, a nolo contendere plea results in an adjudication of guilt, which means the court treats it as a conviction for most purposes.\n\nIn this scenario, it says Sally was adjudicated guilty, so it seems like the court treated her nolo contendere plea as a conviction.\n\nOption B suggests that because she didn't admit guilt, the conviction can't be used to impeach her. But given that she was adjudicated guilty, I think that's not accurate. The adjudication of guilt is what matters for impeachment purposes, not whether she admitted guilt or entered a nolo contendere plea.\n\nNext, option C says it's inadmissible because she received a suspended sentence. A suspended sentence means she didn't go to prison, but she was still convicted. In most jurisdictions, a suspended sentence doesn't affect the admissibility of the conviction for impeachment purposes. The fact that she could have been sentenced to more than one year is what matters, not the actual sentence imposed.\n\nSo, option C is probably incorrect.\n\nOption D claims it's inadmissible because she's only a witness, not the defendant. But according to Rule 609, prior convictions can be used to impeach any witness, not just the defendant. So, this option is likely wrong.\n\nThat leaves option A, which says it's admissible because the crime carries a maximum penalty in excess of one year. Given what I've considered, this seems correct based on Rule 609(a)(1)(A).\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any exceptions or further considerations.\n\nFor example, is vehicular homicide considered a crime involving dishonesty or false statements? If it is, then it would be admissible regardless of the punishment under Rule 609(a)(1)(B)(ii). But vehicular homicide seems more related to recklessness or negligence leading to someone's death, not necessarily involving dishonesty or false statements. So, it might not fall under that category.\n\nHowever, since the crime carries a maximum sentence of more than one year, it still qualifies under part (A).\n\nAnother consideration is the time limit. Rule 609(a)(2) says that convictions more than 10 years old may not be admitted unless the proponent shows good cause. I don't have information about how old Sally's conviction is, so I'll assume it's within the last 10 years.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any state laws that might differ from the federal rule. Since the question mentions the State of Florida, I should check if Florida has any specific rules regarding the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment.\n\nA quick search tells me that Florida Evidence Code Section 90.610(5) allows for the impeachment of a witness by evidence of conviction of a crime if:\n\n- The conviction was for a felony, or\n\n- The conviction was for a crime involving falsehood, and the witness is testifying in a civil case or in a criminal proceeding in which the witness is not the defendant.\n\nIn this case, vehicular homicide is a felony in Florida, punishable by up to 15 years in prison if it's a second-degree felony, which it likely is.\n\nSo, according to Florida law, a conviction for a felony can be used to impeach a witness's credibility.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Sally pleaded nolo contendere and was adjudicated guilty should still qualify as a conviction for impeachment purposes in Florida.\n\nTherefore, based on both federal and Florida state law, the conviction should be admissible to impeach Sally.\n\nBut let me double-check one point: in Florida, does a nolo contendere plea result in an adjudication of guilt that can be used for impeachment?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, a nolo plea may not result in an adjudication of guilt, or there might be specific rules about whether such a plea can be used for impeachment.\n\nUpon checking, in Florida, a nolo contendere plea can lead to an adjudication of guilt, depending on the judge's discretion. Often, judges will withhold adjudication upon a nolo plea, especially in certain types of cases.\n\nIf adjudication is withheld, does that affect the admissibility of the conviction for impeachment purposes?\n\nAccording to Florida Evidence Code Section 90.610(5)(a), impeachment by evidence of a conviction is allowed if the witness has been convicted of a felony or a crime involving falsehood.\n\nIt doesn't specify whether adjudication must have been entered. However, a nolo contendere plea that results in an adjudication of guilt should be treated as a conviction.\n\nIf adjudication is withheld, though, it might not be considered a conviction for impeachment purposes.\n\nIn Florida, when adjudication is withheld, it's often treated as a non-conviction for many purposes, including impeachment.\n\nTherefore, if Sally's adjudication was withheld, her nolo contendere plea might not be admissible for impeachment.\n\nBut in the scenario provided, it states that Sally was adjudicated guilty, so it seems like the adjudication was not withheld.\n\nTherefore, her conviction should be admissible to impeach her credibility.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might make the conviction inadmissible.\n\nFor example, if the conviction has been expunged or sealed, it might not be admissible.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention anything about expungement or sealing, so I'll assume the conviction is still on record.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have rules about the relevance of the prior conviction to the witness's truthfulness.\n\nIn this case, vehicular homicide doesn't directly relate to truthfulness or veracity, unlike crimes like perjury or fraud.\n\nBut under Rule 609 and Florida law, any felony conviction can be used for impeachment, regardless of whether it directly relates to truthfulness.\n\nTherefore, even if vehicular homicide isn't a crime of dishonesty, it's still admissible because it's a felony with a potential sentence exceeding one year.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Federal Rules of Evidence and Florida state law, Sally's conviction for vehicular homicide is admissible to impeach her credibility as a witness.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of one year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
