Be absent from work, B. Invest in craft and hobby books, C. Do some informal planning, D. Become irritated and anxious.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. I'm not retired yet, but I have friends and family who are getting close to retirement age, so maybe I can draw from their experiences.\n\nFirst off, I know that retirement is a big milestone in a person's life. It's when you stop working full-time and have more free time to do other things. But getting there isn't just about reaching a certain age; there's a lot that goes into preparing for retirement.\n\nOption A is \"be absent from work.\" That seems a bit negative. Sure, maybe some people start taking more days off as they get closer to retirement, but I don't think that's the general trend. Most people I know who are nearing retirement are actually quite diligent about their jobs, maybe even more so because they want to leave on a good note.\n\nOption B is \"invest in craft and hobby books.\" That sounds interesting. Maybe some people do start picking up new hobbies as they think about having more free time in retirement. But is this something that most working people do as they get closer to retirement? I'm not so sure. It seems a bit specific.\n\nOption C is \"do some informal planning.\" This makes sense to me. When you're approaching retirement, there's a lot to think about: finances, where you might live, how you'll spend your time, etc. Even if it's not formal planning with detailed budgets and schedules, most people probably do some thinking and discussing about their plans for retirement.\n\nOption D is \"become irritated and anxious.\" That seems like a negative outcome, and while some people might feel anxious about retirement\u2014maybe because of financial uncertainties or worrying about what they'll do with their time\u2014I don't think this is the most common response. In fact, many people I know are excited and look forward to retirement.\n\nLet me consider this again. Retirement is a significant life change, and preparation is key. Formal planning, like saving money and investing, is important, but even before that, people might start thinking about their goals and desires for retirement in a more informal way.\n\nFor example, my aunt and uncle have been talking a lot about where they might want to live when they retire. They've been researching different cities and considering the pros and cons of each place. It's not a formal plan with a set decision, but it's definitely some form of planning.\n\nAnother friend of mine who's close to retirement has been volunteering more in her community, maybe as a way to test out potential activities she might want to pursue when she has more free time.\n\nSo, from these observations, it seems like doing some informal planning is a common behavior among working people as they approach retirement.\n\nLet me see if there's any research or common knowledge that supports this.\n\nI recall that financial planners often advise people to start planning for retirement well in advance, not just financially but also in terms of lifestyle. They suggest thinking about what you want to do in retirement, whether it's traveling, taking up new hobbies, or perhaps doing part-time work.\n\nMoreover, psychological preparations are also important. Retirement can bring about changes in identity and social connections, so thinking ahead about how to adjust to these changes can be beneficial.\n\nSo, considering all this, option C\u2014doing some informal planning\u2014seems like the most accurate answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be misleading.\n\nOption A\u2014being absent from work\u2014could be a possibility for some individuals who are disengaged or burnt out near the end of their careers. However, this isn't a universal trend, and it's not necessarily a typical behavior as one approaches retirement.\n\nOption B\u2014investing in craft and hobby books\u2014is too specific and doesn't capture the broader preparations that people make for retirement.\n\nOption D\u2014becoming irritated and anxious\u2014might be true for some people who are stressed about retirement, but again, this isn't a general rule. Many people approach retirement with positivity and excitement.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option C: doing some informal planning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
