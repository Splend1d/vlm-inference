                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem. So, here's the scenario: On October 31, year 1, a company pays $90,000 for services that will be performed evenly over a six-month period from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2. The company initially expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1, to its services expense account. But since the services are being provided over six months, spanning two different calendar years, we need to adjust this initial entry to properly reflect the prepayment in the financial statements for year 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the time periods involved. The payment was made on October 31, year 1, and the services cover from November 1, year 1, to April 30, year 2. That's a six-month period, split across two calendar years. The company's year-end is December 31, year 1, so the financial statements for year 1 cover up to December 31, year 1.\n\nThe company expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1, but since the services are being provided over six months, only a portion of that payment should be recognized as an expense in year 1, and the remaining portion should be recognized in year 2. This is because expenses should match the revenues they help generate, according to the matching principle in accounting.\n\nSo, let's calculate how much of the $90,000 should be recognized as an expense in year 1 and how much should be carried over to year 2.\n\nThe services start on November 1, year 1, and end on April 30, year 2. That's a total of six months. The company's financial year ends on December 31, year 1, which is two months after the services start (November and December).\n\nSince the services are provided evenly over six months, the monthly cost is $90,000 divided by 6 months, which is $15,000 per month.\n\nTherefore, for the two months from November to December in year 1, the expense recognized should be 2 months times $15,000, which is $30,000.\n\nThe remaining four months of the service period are in year 2, so the prepayment for those four months is $60,000 ($15,000 per month times 4 months).\n\nNow, since the company has already expensed the full $90,000 in year 1, we need to adjust this by reclassifying the portion that relates to year 2 as a prepaid expense (an asset), and adjusting the expense to reflect only the portion that should be recognized in year 1.\n\nSo, the adjusting entry should:\n\n- Debit Prepaid Services for $60,000 (the amount relating to year 2)\n\n- Credit Services Expense for $60,000 (to reduce the expense that was initially recognized by $60,000)\n\nThis way, the financial statements for year 1 will show a services expense of $30,000 (which is the correct amount for year 1), and a prepaid services asset of $60,000, which will be recognized as an expense in year 2.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. The initial entry was to debit Services Expense for $90,000 and credit Cash for $90,000 on October 31, year 1.\n\nAs of December 31, year 1, two months of services have been consumed, so $30,000 should remain as an expense for year 1. The remaining $60,000 relates to the next four months, which are in year 2, so it should be recorded as a prepaid expense (an asset) and recognized as an expense in year 2.\n\nTherefore, the adjusting entry should be:\n\nDebit Prepaid Services $60,000\n\nCredit Services Expense $60,000\n\nThis will effectively reduce the Services Expense from $90,000 to $30,000 for year 1, and create a prepaid asset of $60,000 that will be expensed in year 2.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.\n\nB. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nC. Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $30,000.\n\nD. Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $60,000.\n\nThe correct option is B: Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nI think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
