By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this passage here about gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s to the 1400s. It's talking about how early cannons were used in Europe during sieges, even though they were heavy and slow to fire. Governments there thought they were useful enough to invest in and experiment with, which led to better and more mobile gunpowder weapons over time.\n\nOn the other hand, in China, especially after the mid-1300s, the main threat was from mobile steppe nomads. Early gunpowder weapons weren't very useful against these nomads because they were unwieldy and not suited for fighting mobile enemies. So, China focused on improving their horse archer units, which were better at dealing with the nomadic threats.\n\nNow, the question is asking what traditional view of world history this passage seems to challenge. There are four options:\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies.\n\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation.\n\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts.\n\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying and how it might challenge traditional views.\n\nThe passage is highlighting that both Europe and China had access to gunpowder weaponry during this period, but they approached its development and use differently based on their specific military needs.\n\nIn Europe, where sieges were common, early cannons were useful despite their limitations, and this led to further investment and improvement in gunpowder weapons.\n\nIn China, facing mobile nomadic threats, early gunpowder weapons weren't effective, so they didn't invest as much in developing them further. Instead, they focused on improving their cavalry archers, which were more suitable for countering nomadic raiders.\n\nSo, this suggests that China's approach to technology wasn't necessarily due to a lack of technological capability or innovation, but rather to the specific challenges they faced and the strategies they deemed most effective.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A says that China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies.\n\nBut according to the passage, China was capable of developing and improving military technology when it suited their needs. For example, they improved their horse archer units to deal with nomadic threats. So, this seems to contradict the idea that China has always been less technologically adept. Maybe this is being challenged.\n\nOption B says that China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about China's political system suppressing innovation. It just says that they focused their efforts on improving horse archer units because early gunpowder weapons weren't effective against mobile nomads. So, this doesn't seem directly challenged by the passage.\n\nOption C mentions that China was hindered by religious fundamentalism in modernizing efforts.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't say anything about religion affecting China's approach to technology or innovation. It's more about the practical application of technology based on military needs.\n\nOption D states that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.\n\nThe passage suggests that China didn't ignore technological change but rather adapted their technology to suit their specific military requirements. They chose not to invest in gunpowder weapons because those weapons weren't effective against their main threat, which were mobile nomads. So, this seems to challenge the notion that China turned a blind eye to technological benefits.\n\nGiven this, it seems like option D is the one being challenged by the passage. The passage indicates that China wasn't ignoring technological advantages in general, but rather making strategic decisions based on their particular military needs.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I look back at the passage, it says that in Europe, early cannons were useful in sieges, and this led to further development of gunpowder weapons. In China, early gunpowder weapons weren't useful against mobile nomads, so they focused on improving their horse archers.\n\nThis suggests that China was responsive to its strategic environment and invested in technologies that were effective against their primary threats. So, it's not that they ignored technology altogether, but rather prioritized different types of technology based on their needs.\n\nTherefore, the traditional view that China was surpassed by Europe because it ignored the benefits of technological change is being challenged by this passage.\n\nOptions A, B, and C seem to be making broader claims about China's technological capabilities or political and religious systems, which aren't directly addressed in the passage.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.\n\nThe passage suggests that China didn't turn a blind eye to technological benefits but made strategic choices based on the military challenges they faced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
