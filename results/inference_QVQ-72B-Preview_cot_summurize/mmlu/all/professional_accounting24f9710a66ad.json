                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital, or WACC for short. From what I recall, WACC is a measure that represents the average cost of financing for a company, taking into account both equity and debt funding sources. The formula for WACC is:\n\n\\[ \\text{WACC} = (\\text{Weight of Debt} \\times \\text{Cost of Debt} \\times (1 - \\text{Tax Rate})) + (\\text{Weight of Equity} \\times \\text{Cost of Equity}) \\]\n\nOkay, so I have the weights of debt and equity, their respective costs, and the tax rate. Let's list out the given information to make sure I have everything:\n\n- Capital structure:\n\n- Common equity: 20%\n\n- Debt: 80%\n\n- Cost of common equity: 10%\n\n- Pretax cost of debt: 5%\n\n- Tax rate: 21%\n\nGreat, now plug these values into the WACC formula.\n\nFirst, calculate the after-tax cost of debt. The after-tax cost of debt is the pretax cost of debt multiplied by (1 - tax rate). So,\n\n\\[ \\text{After-tax cost of debt} = 5\\% \\times (1 - 21\\%) = 5\\% \\times 0.79 = 3.95\\% \\]\n\nNext, plug the weights and costs into the WACC formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{WACC} = (80\\% \\times 3.95\\%) + (20\\% \\times 10\\%) \\]\n\nNow, calculate each part:\n\n\\[ 80\\% \\times 3.95\\% = 0.80 \\times 0.0395 = 0.0316 \\]\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\times 10\\% = 0.20 \\times 0.10 = 0.02 \\]\n\nFinally, add them up:\n\n\\[ \\text{WACC} = 0.0316 + 0.02 = 0.0516 \\]\n\nTo express this as a percentage, 0.0516 is 5.16%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.16%\n\nB. 6.00%\n\nC. 6.98%\n\nD. 7.50%\n\nIt seems like option A matches my calculation. But just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might consider whether to use the market value or book value weights for WACC calculations. But in this problem, it doesn't specify which to use, so I'll assume the given percentages are the weights to be used.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the cost of debt is given before or after taxes. Here, it's specified as pretax, so I correctly used the after-tax cost of debt in my calculation.\n\nAlso, confirming that the tax rate is 21%, which is already provided, so no issues there.\n\nLet me see if perhaps there's a different formula or if I missed something. Wait, the problem mentions \"common equity\" and \"debt,\" but doesn't specify if there are other components like preferred stock. Assuming there are only these two components, as indicated by the capital structure being 20% equity and 80% debt.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes, the cost of equity is given, but in some contexts, it might need to be calculated. Here, it's already provided as 10%, so I can use that directly.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. My calculation leads me to conclude that the WACC is 5.16%, which corresponds to option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that could influence this. For example, if there were any retained earnings or other forms of financing, but the problem doesn't mention any, so I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 5.16\\%} \\]"
