                    "text": "Let's see here. I need to find the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers in its simplest form. The options are A. 96 over 216, B. 16 over 36, C. 4 over 9, and D. 9 over 4.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, 96 to 216 means I need to divide 96 by 216 and simplify that fraction.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\\frac{96}{216}\\]\n\nNow, to simplify this fraction, I should divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's find the GCD of 96 and 216.\n\nI know that 96 factors are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3\n\nAnd 216 factors are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\n\nSo, the common factors are three 2's and one 3, which is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 24\n\nTherefore, the GCD is 24.\n\nNow, divide both numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n\\[\\frac{96 \\div 24}{216 \\div 24} = \\frac{4}{9}\\]\n\nSo, the simplest form of the ratio is 4 over 9.\n\nWait a minute, but there's option B, which is 16 over 36. Is that also possible?\n\nLet me check if 16 over 36 is the same as 4 over 9.\n\nSimplify 16 over 36:\n\n\\[\\frac{16}{36} = \\frac{16 \\div 4}{36 \\div 4} = \\frac{4}{9}\\]\n\nYes, it's the same as 4 over 9.\n\nBut in the options, 16 over 36 is given, which simplifies to 4 over 9, but since the question asks for the simplest form, 4 over 9 is more appropriate.\n\nAlso, option A is 96 over 216, which is not simplified, so that's not the simplest form.\n\nOption D is 9 over 4, which is the reciprocal of 4 over 9, so that's not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 4 over 9.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check again.\n\nStarting with 96 over 216, dividing both by 24 gives 4 over 9.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could cross-multiply to check if it's proportional.\n\n4/9 = ? 96/216\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 \u00d7 216 = 9 \u00d7 96\n\n4 \u00d7 216 = 864\n\n9 \u00d7 96 = 864\n\nYes, they are equal, so 4/9 is indeed the correct simplified ratio.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 4 over 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
