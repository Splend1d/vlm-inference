                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a landlord and a tenant, and there's a letter involved that seems to offer a lease option. I need to figure out if that letter was an effective offer for a two-year lease. The options are a bit confusing, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. There's a landlord who rented an apartment to a tenant for $250 per month on a month-to-month agreement. On September 3, the landlord mailed a letter to the tenant that says:\n\n\"September 2 In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option for 20 days from the above date to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided you pay two months' rent in advance.\"\n\nThe tenant received this letter on September 4 but didn't read it until September 5. Then, on September 23, the tenant called the landlord and said they wanted to give the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. The landlord responded by saying they've changed their mind and want the tenant to vacate immediately. The key point here is that the tenant never paid the one-dollar consideration mentioned in the letter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.\n\nB. Yes, because consideration for the option can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease.\n\nC. No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.\n\nD. No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.\n\nFirst, let's consider what constitutes an offer in contract law. An offer is when one party expresses a willingness to enter into a contract on certain terms, with the expectation that it will be accepted by the other party. For an offer to be binding, there usually needs to be consideration exchanged.\n\nIn this case, the landlord's letter seems to be offering an option to the tenant to sign a two-year lease at a specified rate, provided certain conditions are met. The phrase \"in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged\" suggests that there is consideration for the option being offered. However, it's important to note that the tenant never paid this one-dollar consideration.\n\nOption A suggests that the letter manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent. But, in option C, it says no unless the tenant paid or tendered the one-dollar consideration. So, there's a disagreement here about whether the consideration is necessary for the offer to be effective.\n\nOption B mentions that consideration for the option can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease. This might be suggesting that there's some implied consideration based on the existing relationship between the landlord and the tenant.\n\nOption D says no because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease. A condition precedent is a condition that must be met before a contract becomes binding. In this case, the letter mentions that the tenant must pay two months' rent in advance to sign the lease.\n\nNow, let's think about this more carefully. The letter seems to be offering an option to sign a lease within 20 days from September 2, provided the tenant pays one dollar. This sounds like an option contract, where the landlord is giving the tenant the right to enter into a lease agreement within a certain period, in exchange for a small consideration.\n\nIn option contracts, the offer remains open for the option period in exchange for the consideration paid for the option. Here, the consideration is one dollar, and the option period is 20 days.\n\nHowever, the tenant never paid the one-dollar consideration. Does that mean the option is not effective, and therefore the offer is not binding?\n\nOption A seems to suggest that the offer is effective because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain. But in option C, it specifies that unless the tenant paid or tendered the one-dollar consideration, the offer is not effective.\n\nI think the key here is whether the one-dollar consideration is necessary for the option to be binding. If it is, and the tenant didn't pay it, then the option is not effective, and the landlord can revoke the offer at any time before acceptance.\n\nOption B suggests that consideration can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease. But I'm not sure about that. Just because there's an existing lease doesn't necessarily mean that there's consideration for a new option agreement.\n\nOption D mentions a condition precedent. In this case, the condition that the tenant must pay two months' rent in advance is a condition for executing the lease, not for the offer to be effective. So, I don't think that's directly related to whether the offer itself is effective.\n\nGiven all this, I'm leaning towards option C: no, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration. Because the one-dollar consideration is part of the agreement for the option, and without it, the offer isn't binding.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's some implied consideration or perhaps the offer is effective regardless of the consideration.\n\nWait, the letter says, \"in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option...\" So, it seems like the landlord is acknowledging receipt of the one dollar as consideration for the option. But the tenant never paid it. So, the acknowledgment is premature or incorrect.\n\nDoes this mean that the offer is not effective because the consideration wasn't actually provided? It seems that way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the landlord's acknowledgment of receipt is a mistake, and the offer is still valid without the consideration. But that seems unlikely, as the consideration is part of the agreement for the option.\n\nI think the most accurate answer is C: no, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.\n\nSo, the landlord's letter did not constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease because the tenant did not pay the required one-dollar consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
