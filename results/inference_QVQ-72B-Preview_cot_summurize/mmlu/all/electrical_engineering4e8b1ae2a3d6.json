                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a metal surface with a radius of 1 meter and a surface charge density of 20 C/m\u00b2. This metal surface is enclosed in a cube that has a side length of 10 meters. We need to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what electric displacement is. I know that electric displacement, often denoted by D, is related to the electric field E through Gauss's law. The relationship is D = \u03b5\u2080 E, where \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space. However, in Gauss's law, the integral of D over a closed surface equals the total charge enclosed divided by \u03b5\u2080.\n\nWait, actually, Gauss's law states that \u222bD\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080, but I think I need to double-check that. Let me look it up.\n\nOkay, upon checking, I realize that the standard form of Gauss's law is \u222bE\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080, where E is the electric field. But electric displacement D is defined as D = \u03b5\u2080 E + P, where P is the electric polarization. However, in vacuum or air, P is zero, so D = \u03b5\u2080 E. But for the purposes of Gauss's law, it's often used in the form with E.\n\nI think in this problem, we're dealing with vacuum or air, so I can use Gauss's law in its basic form: \u222bE\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080.\n\nBut the question mentions \"electric displacement,\" which might be referring to the flux of D, which is \u222bD\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, in Gaussian units, sometimes D is used differently, but in SI units, it's more accurate to use E for Gauss's law.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nGauss's law in SI units is:\n\n\u222eE\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080\n\nAnd the electric displacement D is related to E by D = \u03b5\u2080 E + P, where P is the polarization charge density. In free space, P is zero, so D = \u03b5\u2080 E.\n\nThe flux of D through a closed surface is:\n\n\u222eD\u00b7dA = \u222b\u03b5\u2080 E\u00b7dA = \u03b5\u2080 \u222bE\u00b7dA = \u03b5\u2080 (Q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080) = Q_enclosed\n\nSo, \u222bD\u00b7dA = Q_enclosed\n\nTherefore, the total electric displacement flux through the surface is equal to the total charge enclosed.\n\nIn this problem, we need to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. That sounds like it's asking for the flux of D through the cube's surface.\n\nSo, if I can find the total charge enclosed by the cube, then the electric displacement flux through the cube's surface should be equal to that charge.\n\nGiven that the metal surface is inside the cube and has a radius of 1 meter with a surface charge density of 20 C/m\u00b2, I can calculate the total charge on the metal surface.\n\nFirst, I need to find the surface area of the metal sphere.\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n\nGiven r = 1 m,\n\nA = 4\u03c0(1)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 m\u00b2\n\nThe total charge Q on the metal surface is charge density times area:\n\nQ = \u03c3 * A = 20 C/m\u00b2 * 4\u03c0 m\u00b2 = 80\u03c0 C\n\nSo, the total charge enclosed by the cube is 80\u03c0 C.\n\nAccording to Gauss's law, the total electric displacement flux through the cube's surface should be equal to the total charge enclosed, which is 80\u03c0 C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option B is 80\u03c0 coulombs, but option A is 40\u03c0 coulombs, and option C is 10\u03c0 coulombs. There's also option D: none of these.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning.\n\nI used Gauss's law, assuming that the electric displacement flux through the cube is equal to the total charge enclosed, which is 80\u03c0 C. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the electric field at the surface of the cube.\n\nThe cube has sides of 10 meters, which is much larger than the sphere's diameter of 2 meters, so the sphere is well inside the cube.\n\nIs there any possibility that some of the electric field lines from the sphere do not exit the cube, but since the cube fully encloses the sphere, all the field lines should exit outward.\n\nTherefore, the total flux should indeed be equal to the total charge enclosed, which is 80\u03c0 C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a factor of 2 missing somewhere.\n\nLet me think about the electric field of a charged sphere.\n\nFor a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field outside the sphere is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.\n\nTherefore, the total flux through any closed surface enclosing the sphere should be equal to the total charge enclosed.\n\nIn this case, the cube fully encloses the sphere, so the total flux through the cube should be equal to the total charge on the sphere, which is 80\u03c0 C.\n\nBut let's consider the surface charge density and the area again.\n\nSurface charge density \u03c3 = 20 C/m\u00b2\n\nSurface area A = 4\u03c0(1)\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 m\u00b2\n\nTotal charge Q = \u03c3 * A = 80\u03c0 C\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the terms used in the problem.\n\nThe problem mentions \"the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\"\n\nThis seems to be referring to the flux of the electric displacement field D through the cube's surface.\n\nAs established earlier, this should be equal to the total charge enclosed, which is 80\u03c0 C.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other charge present inside the cube.\n\nThe problem states that there is a metal surface with a radius of 1 meter and surface charge density of 20 C/m\u00b2 enclosed in a cube with 10-meter sides.\n\nAssuming this is the only charge present inside the cube, then yes, the total charge enclosed is 80\u03c0 C, and the electric displacement flux through the cube's surface should be 80\u03c0 C.\n\nIf there were other charges inside the cube, their contributions would add to the total flux, but the problem doesn't mention any other charges.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80\\pi \\text{ coulombs}} \\]"
