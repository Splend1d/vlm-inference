The old building is being actively marketed and they expect to sell it in four months. Now, there are four statements about how this old building should be treated accounting-wise, and I need to identify which one is incorrect.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\nI remember that when a company decides to sell a non-current asset like a building, and it's actively being marketed, it should be reclassified as an asset held for sale. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. If the building is expected to be sold in four months, which is less than a year, it might be considered a current asset. But I should double-check that.\n\nOption C: It will no longer be depreciated.\n\nI recall that when an asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation should stop. So, if the building was being depreciated before, it shouldn't be depreciated anymore once it's reclassified as held for sale. That makes sense.\n\nOption D: It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nNow, this is tricky. I know that assets held for sale are supposed to be measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Historical cost is the original purchase price, adjusted for things like depreciation. But in the case of assets held for sale, the measurement basis changes to fair value less costs to sell.\n\nWait a minute, so if the asset is held for sale, it should be valued at fair value less costs to sell, not necessarily the historical cost. So, this might be the incorrect statement.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Reclassify as asset held for sale \u2013 seems right.\n\n- Option B: Classify as current asset \u2013 likely correct since expected to be sold within a year.\n\n- Option C: No longer depreciated \u2013 correct, as per accounting standards.\n\n- Option D: Valued at historical cost \u2013 might be wrong because it should be valued at fair value less costs to sell.\n\nI think the answer is Option D. It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me look it up quickly. According to IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, assets held for sale should be measured at the lower of their carrying amount before reclassification and their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSo, it's not necessarily their historical cost; it's the fair value less costs to sell. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
