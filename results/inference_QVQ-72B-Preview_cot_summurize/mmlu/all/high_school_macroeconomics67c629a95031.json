                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about money creation in banks. It says that commercial banks save no excess reserves and the reserve requirement is 20 percent. So, if a bank gets a deposit of $1000, how much money is created in new loans from all banks after this deposit?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand how banks create money through lending. I remember something about the money multiplier, but it's been a while since I studied this. Let's recall that when a bank receives a deposit, it has to keep a certain percentage of it as reserves, and the rest it can lend out. This lending then gets deposited into another bank, which keeps its reserve and lends out the rest, and so on. This process creates more money in the economy.\n\nSo, the reserve requirement is 20 percent, which means that for every dollar deposited, the bank has to keep 0.20 and can lend out 0.80. Right?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that banks save no excess reserves, so they're lending out everything they can, which means they're keeping only the required reserves.\n\nAlright, so the initial deposit is $1000. The bank keeps 20% of $1000 as reserves, which is $200, and lends out the remaining $800.\n\nThis $800 is then deposited into another bank, which keeps 20% as reserves ($160) and lends out $640.\n\nThis process repeats, with each bank keeping 20% and lending out 80% of the deposit they receive.\n\nTo find the total money created in new loans, I think I need to sum up all the amounts lent out at each stage.\n\nSo, let's list out the lending process:\n\nFirst round: $800\n\nSecond round: $800 * 0.8 = $640\n\nThird round: $640 * 0.8 = $512\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series where each term is 80% of the previous one.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nHere, a = $800 and r = 0.8.\n\nSo, S = $800 / (1 - 0.8) = $800 / 0.2 = $4000.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Is that the total money created in new loans?\n\nLet me double-check. The money multiplier formula is 1 / reserve ratio, which in this case is 1 / 0.2 = 5.\n\nSo, the total money created from the initial deposit of $1000 would be $1000 * 5 = $5000.\n\nBut that seems to be the total new money created, which includes both the reserves and the loans.\n\nBut the question is asking specifically for the money created in new loans from all banks.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs there a difference between the total money created and the money created in new loans?\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the money created in new loans is the total money created minus the initial deposit.\n\nSo, total money created is $5000, and the initial deposit is $1000, so money created in loans would be $5000 - $1000 = $4000.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated the sum of the loans as $4000 directly from the geometric series.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nActually, I think both approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, the total money created is $5000, and the money created in new loans is $4000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C is $4000, which seems to align with my calculations.\n\nBut wait, option A is $800, which is the first round of lending.\n\nOption B is $1000, which is the initial deposit.\n\nOption D is $5000, which is the total money created.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the money created in new loans from all banks.\n\nI think $4000 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the money created in new loans is the total money supply increase minus the initial deposit, which is indeed $5000 - $1000 = $4000.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of the infinite geometric series of loans is $800 / (1 - 0.8) = $4000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $4000.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
