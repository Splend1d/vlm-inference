                    "text": "So I've got this question here about urban planning and transportation systems. It's asking which type of transportation system created the star-shaped city pattern. The options are:\n\nA. Highways to airports that link cities\n\nB. Interstate highways that link cities\n\nC. Beltways around cities\n\nD. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a star-shaped city pattern looks like. From the name, it sounds like there are multiple lines radiating out from a central point, similar to how a star has points extending from its center. So, in urban terms, this would mean that development is spreading outwards from a central business district (CBD) along specific paths.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Highways to airports that link cities.\n\nThis seems like it would connect different cities rather than shape the internal structure of a single city. While airports and connecting highways can influence regional development, they might not be the primary shapers of a city's internal layout.\n\nOption B: Interstate highways that link cities.\n\nSimilar to option A, interstate highways are primarily designed to connect different cities and facilitate long-distance travel. While they can influence where people choose to live relative to work locations in different cities, they might not be the best explanation for a star-shaped pattern within a single city.\n\nOption C: Beltways around cities.\n\nBeltways are typically circular highways designed to relieve congestion in the center of a city by providing a route around the CBD. They can influence suburban development by making certain areas more accessible, but again, they might not be the driving force behind a star-shaped pattern within the city itself.\n\nOption D: Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD.\n\nThis option seems the most promising. Streetcars and trolleys are forms of public transportation that typically operate within a city, connecting different neighborhoods to the central business district. If these lines extend out from the CBD like spokes on a wheel, they could naturally create a star-shaped pattern of development. People tend to live along these transportation lines for easy access to the city center, leading to concentric growth along each line.\n\nAdditionally, historical examples support this idea. In many cities, the introduction of streetcars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to the development of suburbs along the streetcar lines. These lines often terminated at key points, encouraging residential and commercial growth in those areas.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems that streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD are the most likely candidates for creating a star-shaped city pattern.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it a bit more.\n\nImagine a city with a central business district. From this center, multiple streetcar lines are built in different directions. As people move along these lines to live further from the city center, but still have convenient access to it, residential areas develop along these corridors. Commercial areas might also develop at key intersections or terminals of these lines.\n\nThis kind of development would indeed create a star-shaped pattern, with the CBD at the center and the residential and commercial areas forming the \"points\" of the star along the transportation lines.\n\nIn contrast, highways to airports or interstate highways are more about connecting different cities, and beltways are about providing a ring road around the city to manage traffic flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check a quick reference on urban planning.\n\n[Imagining consulting a textbook on urban planning]\n\nYes, according to the text, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the development of streetcar systems in many cities led to the extension of urban areas along these transit lines. This radial pattern of growth is consistent with a star-shaped city layout.\n\nMoreover, this type of development is often associated with the concept of \"urban corridors,\" where density increases along major transportation arteries and decreases between them.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD are responsible for creating the star-shaped city pattern.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
