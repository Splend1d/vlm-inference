                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about finding the empirical formula of a compound. The compound is made up of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and I'm given the masses of each element in a sample that has a total mass of 29.05 grams. Specifically, the carbon mass is 18.02 grams, hydrogen is 3.03 grams, and the rest is oxygen. I need to find the simplest whole-number ratio of these elements in the compound.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how much oxygen is there since the total mass is given and I have the masses of carbon and hydrogen. So, oxygen mass would be total mass minus mass of carbon minus mass of hydrogen.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nOxygen mass = total mass - mass of carbon - mass of hydrogen\n\nOxygen mass = 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g\n\nOxygen mass = 7.99 g\n\nOkay, so oxygen is 7.99 grams.\n\nNow, to find the empirical formula, I need to determine the mole ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the compound.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the masses of each element into moles using their atomic masses.\n\nAtomic mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol.\n\nAtomic mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01 g/mol.\n\nAtomic mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol.\n\nSo,\n\nMoles of carbon = mass of carbon / atomic mass of carbon\n\nMoles of carbon = 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol \u2248 1.50 moles\n\nMoles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / atomic mass of hydrogen\n\nMoles of hydrogen = 3.03 g / 1.01 g/mol \u2248 3.00 moles\n\nMoles of oxygen = mass of oxygen / atomic mass of oxygen\n\nMoles of oxygen = 7.99 g / 16.00 g/mol \u2248 0.499 moles\n\nNow, I need to find the simplest whole-number ratio of these moles.\n\nTo do that, I can divide each mole value by the smallest mole value, which is oxygen's 0.499 moles.\n\nSo,\n\nFor carbon: 1.50 / 0.499 \u2248 3.01\n\nFor hydrogen: 3.00 / 0.499 \u2248 6.01\n\nFor oxygen: 0.499 / 0.499 = 1\n\nNow, these ratios are approximately 3:6:1 for C:H:O.\n\nBut empirical formulas should have whole numbers, so this would be C3H6O.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. C2H4O\n\nB. C3H6O\n\nC. C2H6O3\n\nD. C3H8O2\n\nSo, option B seems to match what I calculated: C3H6O.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me verify the mole calculations again.\n\nMass of carbon = 18.02 g\n\nAtomic mass of carbon = 12.01 g/mol\n\nMoles of carbon = 18.02 / 12.01 = 1.50 mol\n\nMass of hydrogen = 3.03 g\n\nAtomic mass of hydrogen = 1.01 g/mol\n\nMoles of hydrogen = 3.03 / 1.01 = 3.00 mol\n\nMass of oxygen = 7.99 g\n\nAtomic mass of oxygen = 16.00 g/mol\n\nMoles of oxygen = 7.99 / 16.00 = 0.499 mol\n\nNow, dividing each by the smallest mole value (0.499):\n\nC: 1.50 / 0.499 \u2248 3.01\n\nH: 3.00 / 0.499 \u2248 6.01\n\nO: 0.499 / 0.499 = 1\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 3:6:1, which rounds to C3H6O.\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula is C3H6O, which corresponds to option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
