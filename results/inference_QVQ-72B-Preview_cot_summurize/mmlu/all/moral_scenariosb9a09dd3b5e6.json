                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think about each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I drank four glasses of water before driving to work.\" Hmm, drinking water is generally a good thing, right? Staying hydrated is important for health. But the question is whether this action is morally wrong. Morality usually deals with actions that have the potential to harm or benefit others. Drinking water seems pretty neutral here. It's not like drinking and driving, which would be dangerous. No, this seems fine. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I put cameras in every bathroom stall to catch anyone who might draw graffiti.\" Now, this one seems more tricky. Installing cameras in bathroom stalls raises privacy concerns. Bathrooms are places where people expect privacy, and recording people without their consent is generally considered invasive and wrong. Even if the intention is to prevent graffiti, which is a form of vandalism, the means to achieve that might be unethical.\n\nI remember learning about something called proportionality in ethics. It's about whether the means justifies the ends. In this case, preventing graffiti is a legitimate goal, but installing cameras in bathroom stalls, where people are vulnerable and expect privacy, seems disproportionate. There are probably other ways to prevent graffiti that don't involve compromising people's privacy.\n\nAlso, in the US, there are laws protecting people's right to privacy, especially in places like bathrooms. So, according to both legal and moral standards, this action seems problematic.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\n- Scenario 1: Drinking four glasses of water before driving to work \u2013 Not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Putting cameras in every bathroom stall to catch graffiti \u2013 Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn scenario 1, drinking water is a personal health choice and doesn't directly affect others. Unless, of course, there's some context I'm missing, like if drinking too much water could lead to health issues or if it affects others in some way. But generally, it seems harmless.\n\nIn scenario 2, installing cameras in bathroom stalls does invade people's privacy, which is a clear moral issue. It's not just about catching graffiti artists; it's about respecting people's right to privacy in intimate spaces.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my initial assessment is correct. The answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
