                    "text": "So I have this question about tax rates and I need to figure out what kind of tax system it's describing. Let me see... The question says that for a single person with $25,000 in taxable income, the tax rate is 24 percent, and for someone with $20,000, it's 20 percent. So, as income increases from $20,000 to $25,000, the tax rate increases from 20% to 24%.\n\nNow, I need to choose from the options:\n\nA. Regressive\n\nB. Progressive\n\nC. Proportional\n\nD. Revenue-neutral\n\nHmm, let's recall what each term means.\n\nA regressive tax is one where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases. So, in this case, if the tax rate was going down as income increased, it would be regressive. But here, the tax rate is going up as income increases, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nA progressive tax is one where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. That sounds like what's happening here. The tax rate goes up as income goes up.\n\nA proportional tax is one where the tax rate stays the same regardless of the taxable amount. So, everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes. That's not the case here, since the tax rate changes with income.\n\nRevenue-neutral isn't really a description of the tax rate structure; it's more about a change in tax policy that doesn't result in more or less total tax revenue. So, that doesn't apply here.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the tax system being described is progressive because the tax rate increases as income increases.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In a progressive tax system, higher income levels are taxed at higher rates, which is exactly what's happening here. So, option B. Progressive is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose someone makes $20,000 and pays 20%, which would be $4,000 in taxes. Another person makes $25,000 and pays 24%, which would be $6,000 in taxes. So, not only are they paying more in total taxes because they make more, but they're also paying a higher percentage. That's a characteristic of a progressive tax system.\n\nContrast that with a regressive tax, where someone with a higher income would pay a lower percentage in taxes. For example, if the $25,000 earner paid 15%, that would be regressive because the rate decreases as income increases.\n\nAnd in a proportional tax, both would pay the same percentage, say 20%, regardless of their income level.\n\nSo, yeah, the tax system described in the question is definitely progressive.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is B. Progressive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
