                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If c > 0 and f(x) = e^x - cx for all real numbers x, I need to find the minimum value of f(x). The options are f(c), f(e^c), f(1/c), and f(log c). Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that to find the minimum value of a function, I can take its derivative and set it to zero to find critical points. Then, I can check which of these points gives me a minimum. So, let's start by finding f'(x).\n\nGiven f(x) = e^x - cx, the derivative f'(x) should be e^x - c. To find the critical points, I set f'(x) = 0:\n\ne^x - c = 0\n\ne^x = c\n\nNow, to solve for x, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nx = ln(c)\n\nWait, but ln is natural logarithm, and log is usually base 10, but sometimes log is used interchangeably with ln in different texts. I need to be careful here. In calculus, ln is the standard natural logarithm, so I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, x = ln(c). Now, to determine if this is a minimum, I can check the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nf''(x) = e^x\n\nAt x = ln(c), f''(ln(c)) = e^{ln(c)} = c. Since c > 0, f''(ln(c)) > 0, which means that f has a local minimum at x = ln(c).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = ln(c), which is also written as x = log(c), assuming log base e.\n\nLooking back at the options, one of them is f(log c), which seems to align with this.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Is f(log c) the same as f(ln c)? It depends on the base of the log. If log is base e, then yes, ln(c) = log_e(c), and they are the same. However, sometimes log is used for log base 10.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"f(log c)\". The notation used here might be assuming log base e, but to be safe, I should consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Maybe I can evaluate f at each of the given points and see which one gives the smallest value.\n\nLet's try evaluating f at each option:\n\nA. f(c) = e^c - c*c = e^c - c\u00b2\n\nB. f(e^c) = e^{e^c} - c*e^c\n\nC. f(1/c) = e^{1/c} - c*(1/c) = e^{1/c} - 1\n\nD. f(log c), assuming log base e, so f(ln c) = e^{ln c} - c*ln c = c - c*ln c\n\nNow, I need to compare these expressions to see which one is the smallest.\n\nLet's consider f(x) = e^x - c x. We already found that the minimum should be at x = ln(c), so f(ln(c)) = c - c ln(c).\n\nNow, let's see what f(c) is: e^c - c\u00b2. For c > 0, e^c grows faster than c\u00b2, so for small c, e^c - c\u00b2 might be less than c - c ln(c), but as c increases, e^c - c\u00b2 will be much larger.\n\nSimilarly, f(e^c) = e^{e^c} - c e^c. Since e^{e^c} grows extremely fast, this is going to be much larger than f(ln(c)).\n\nf(1/c) = e^{1/c} - 1. For c > 0, 1/c can be large or small depending on c, but e^{1/c} approaches 1 as c approaches infinity, so this might not be the minimum.\n\nf(log c) = c - c ln(c), which matches f(ln(c)).\n\nWait a minute, so f(log c) = f(ln c), assuming log is natural log. So, if log is natural log, then f(log c) is indeed the minimum.\n\nBut the problem says \"log c\", and it's ambiguous whether log is base e or base 10. Maybe I need to consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: log is base e.\n\nThen, f(log c) = f(ln c), which is the minimum value we found.\n\nCase 2: log is base 10.\n\nThen, f(log c) = e^{log_{10} c} - c log_{10} c.\n\nI need to see if this equals f(ln c).\n\nLet's express log_{10} c in terms of ln c: log_{10} c = ln c / ln 10.\n\nSo, f(log_{10} c) = e^{ln c / ln 10} - c * (ln c / ln 10) = e^{ln c / ln 10} - (c ln c) / ln 10.\n\nBut f(ln c) = e^{ln c} - c ln c = c - c ln c.\n\nThese are not the same unless e^{ln c / ln 10} equals c, which it doesn't.\n\ne^{ln c / ln 10} = c^{1 / ln 10}, which is not equal to c.\n\nTherefore, if log is base 10, then f(log c) \u2260 f(ln c).\n\nBut in the problem, log is used without specifying the base, and it's in the context of real analysis, where ln is more common.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps log refers to natural log in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects log to be base e.\n\nGiven that, perhaps f(log c) is indeed f(ln c), and thus the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = e^x - c x.\n\nTo find its minimum, as before, find f'(x) = e^x - c, set to zero: e^x = c, so x = ln c.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value is f(ln c) = e^{ln c} - c ln c = c - c ln c.\n\nNow, among the options:\n\nA. f(c) = e^c - c\u00b2\n\nB. f(e^c) = e^{e^c} - c e^c\n\nC. f(1/c) = e^{1/c} - c*(1/c) = e^{1/c} - 1\n\nD. f(log c) = e^{log c} - c log c\n\nIf log is base e, then f(log c) = e^{ln c} - c ln c = c - c ln c, which matches the minimum.\n\nIf log is base 10, then f(log c) = e^{log_{10} c} - c log_{10} c = e^{ln c / ln 10} - c (ln c / ln 10).\n\nThis is not equal to c - c ln c.\n\nTherefore, only if log is base e does f(log c) equal the minimum value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps log is base e in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects log to be base e.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in some texts, log is used for natural log.\n\nGiven that, perhaps f(log c) is indeed f(ln c), and thus the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, to be thorough, perhaps I should check the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum.\n\nf''(x) = e^x.\n\nAt x = ln c, f''(ln c) = e^{ln c} = c > 0, since c > 0, confirming it's a minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs at x = ln c, and f(ln c) = c - c ln c.\n\nNow, comparing this to the options:\n\nA. f(c) = e^c - c\u00b2\n\nFor c > 0, e^c - c\u00b2 > c - c ln c, because e^c grows faster than c\u00b2, and c - c ln c is less than e^c - c\u00b2.\n\nB. f(e^c) = e^{e^c} - c e^c\n\nThis is even larger than e^c - c\u00b2.\n\nC. f(1/c) = e^{1/c} - 1\n\nFor c > 0, 1/c can be large or small, but e^{1/c} approaches 1 as c approaches infinity, so this might be less than c - c ln c for some c, but not necessarily the minimum overall.\n\nD. f(log c), assuming log is base e, equals c - c ln c, which matches the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(x) is f(ln c), which is f(log c) if log is base e.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. f(log c).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
