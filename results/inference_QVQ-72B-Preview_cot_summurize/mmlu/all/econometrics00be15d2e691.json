                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about cointegration are true. I'm not super confident with cointegration yet, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, what is cointegration? From what I remember, cointegration is a statistical property that applies to time series data, particularly non-stationary data. It's about finding a long-term equilibrium relationship between variables that are both integrated of the same order, usually first order, meaning they have unit roots.\n\nSo, if $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, that means both are non-stationary, right? But there exists some linear combination of them that is stationary. That sounds like they share a common stochastic trend.\n\nLet's look at statement i): $x_t$ and $y_t$ must both be stationary. If they're cointegrated, actually, they are typically non-stationary but share a common trend. So, I think this statement is false. They don't have to be stationary; in fact, usually, they are non-stationary.\n\nStatement ii): Only one linear combination of $x_t$ and $y_t$ will be stationary. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here. In the case of two variables, is there only one cointegrating relationship? I think in the bivariate case, yes, there's only one cointegrating vector. But in multivariate cases, there can be more. So, for two variables, this seems correct.\n\nStatement iii): The cointegrating equation for $x_t$ and $y_t$ describes the short-run relationship between the two series. I thought cointegration was about long-run equilibrium relationships. So, if $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, their deviations from the cointegrating relationship should be mean-reverting over time. That sounds more like a long-run relationship. So, I think this statement is false.\n\nStatement iv): The residuals of a regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$ must be stationary. This sounds familiar. In fact, one way to test for cointegration is to run a regression of one variable on the other and check if the residuals are stationary. If they are, that's evidence of cointegration. So, this statement seems true.\n\nSo, based on this, statements ii) and iv) are true, and i) and iii) are false. That matches option A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in statement i), it says both must be stationary. No, that's not correct. Cointegration typically applies to non-stationary series that are integrated of the same order.\n\nStatement ii): Only one linear combination will be stationary. Yeah, for two variables, that makes sense. In higher dimensions, there can be more, but here we're dealing with two variables.\n\nStatement iii): Cointegrating equation describes short-run relationship. No, it's actually the long-run relationship. Short-run dynamics might be captured by other models like error correction models.\n\nStatement iv): Residuals must be stationary. Yes, that's a key aspect of cointegration testing.\n\nSo, yeah, A seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, is there any chance that multiple linear combinations could be stationary in a bivariate case? I don't think so. It's generally one cointegrating relationship in two variables.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
