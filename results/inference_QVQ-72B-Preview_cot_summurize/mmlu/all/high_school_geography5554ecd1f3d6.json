I need to figure out where the largest Hindu temple complex is located. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that Hinduism is primarily practiced in India, so maybe it's in one of the Indian cities listed, like Calcutta or Bombay. But then again, Hinduism has spread to other parts of the world, including Cambodia and Bali, which are also options here. So, I can't immediately jump to an answer based solely on location.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. Calcutta. Calcutta, now known as Kolkata, is a major city in India, famous for its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. It's known for places like the Dakshineswar Kali Temple and the Kalighat Temple, which are prominent Hindu temples. However, I don't recall any particularly massive temple complexes in Calcutta that would qualify as the largest ever constructed.\n\nMoving on to B. Bombay. Bombay, now Mumbai, is another major city in India, known for its vibrant culture and diverse religious sites. There are several Hindu temples in Mumbai, such as the Siddhivinayak Temple and the Haji Ali Dargah, but again, these are more individual temples rather than vast temple complexes.\n\nNext is C. Cambodia. Cambodia is located in Southeast Asia and is famous for its ancient temples, particularly those in Angkor Wat. Wait a minute, Angkor Wat is a Hindu temple, isn't it? Let me recall: Angkor Wat was initially built as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu and later became a Buddhist temple. It's known for its massive size and architectural grandeur. In fact, it's often cited as the largest religious monument in the world. So, maybe this is a strong candidate for the largest Hindu temple complex.\n\nLastly, D. Bali. Bali is an Indonesian island known for its rich Hindu culture and numerous temples. The Besakih Temple is particularly famous and is considered the holiest temple in Bali. However, while it's a significant temple, I don't think it's the largest Hindu temple complex in the world.\n\nComparing all these options, Cambodia's Angkor Wat seems to stand out in terms of size and significance. It's not just one temple but an entire complex, covering a vast area with multiple structures and galleries. Plus, it's recognized globally for its historical and cultural importance.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other major Hindu temple complexes that might be larger, but based on my knowledge, nothing comes to mind that surpasses Angkor Wat in size.\n\nSo, my best answer is C. Cambodia, home to the largest Hindu temple complex ever constructed, Angkor Wat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Cambodia}} \\]"
