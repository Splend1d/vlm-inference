For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, particularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against the structure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did not respond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customers and employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club for violating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and charged him with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act were legally insufficient to establish manslaughter. What will the court decide?\n\nA. This was not manslaughter because the omission to respond to safety citations is not enough to establish the high degree of criminal negligence that is required.\nB. The failure to act is much less culpable than active recklessness, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to charge manslaughter.\nC. A corporate employee cannot be prosecuted for the crime of manslaughter with respect to the performance or nonperformance of his duties on behalf of the corporation.\nD. The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this case about the nightclub that collapsed, resulting in deaths, and now the general manager is charged with involuntary manslaughter. He's defending himself by saying that his failure to act isn't enough to establish manslaughter. I need to figure out which option the court will likely decide.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what involuntary manslaughter is. From what I recall, involuntary manslaughter is when someone causes death due to criminal negligence or recklessness, but without any intent to kill. So, it's not like first-degree murder, which involves premeditation.\n\nIn this case, the nightclub was built on a pier over a river, and parts of the building were wobbling, especially during bad weather when the river was hitting the structure harder. Employees and customers complained, but the manager didn't do anything about it. Then, one night, a section of the pier collapsed, killing 28 people. It also came out that the club had been cited multiple times for violating safety regulations.\n\nSo, the manager is being charged with involuntary manslaughter, but he's arguing that his omissions\u2014meaning his failures to act\u2014are not sufficient to establish the high degree of criminal negligence required for manslaughter.\n\nOption A says that this wasn't manslaughter because the omission to respond to safety citations isn't enough to show the required level of criminal negligence.\n\nOption B says that failing to act is less culpable than actively being reckless, and therefore there's not enough evidence to charge manslaughter.\n\nOption C says that a corporate employee can't be prosecuted for manslaughter based on their duties for the corporation.\n\nOption D says that the charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\nAlright, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in many legal systems, omissions can lead to criminal liability if there's a duty to act. So, if someone has a legal duty to do something and they fail to do it, that omission can be criminally negligent, especially if it results in harm.\n\nIn this case, the manager likely had a duty to ensure the safety of the nightclub, given his position. He was responsible for maintaining the building and addressing any safety hazards, especially since employees and customers had complained about the wobbling.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the club had been cited for safety violations multiple times suggests that there were known issues that needed to be addressed, and the manager failed to do so.\n\nSo, his failure to act, especially in light of these warnings and complaints, could be seen as a reckless disregard for the safety of others, which could amount to criminal negligence.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A suggests that omissions aren't enough to establish the high degree of criminal negligence required. But, as I thought earlier, omissions can lead to criminal liability if there's a duty to act, which seems to be the case here.\n\nOption B says that failing to act is less culpable than active recklessness. While it's true that active conduct might be viewed as more blameworthy, in some jurisdictions, omissions can still be sufficient to establish manslaughter, especially when there's a clear duty to act and the person knows or should know of the risk.\n\nOption C claims that a corporate employee can't be prosecuted for manslaughter based on their corporate duties. But I don't think that's accurate. Corporations are separate legal entities, but individuals within them can be held criminally liable for their actions or omissions.\n\nIn fact, in many cases, managers and executives can be personally liable for crimes committed in the course of their employment if they personally engage in criminal conduct or fail to perform their duties in a way that causes harm.\n\nSo, Option C seems unlikely to be correct.\n\nThat leaves Option D, which states that the charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\nGiven that the manager had a duty to maintain safety, was aware of the issues through complaints and citations, and still failed to act, leading to the deaths of 28 people, it seems that his omissions could indeed be considered reckless and unlawful, supporting a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nTherefore, I think the court will decide that the charge is legally sufficient, meaning Option D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nPerhaps the manager could argue that he didn't know about the severity of the issues or that the collapse was unforeseeable. However, given that there were multiple citations and complaints, it's hard to make that argument stick.\n\nAlso, maybe he could say that he relied on engineers or inspectors who assured him that everything was fine, but unless there's evidence to support that, it's not a strong defense.\n\nAnother angle could be that the collapse was due to an act of God or some unforeseeable event, but again, given the prior warnings, it's unlikely that the court would accept that.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that Option D is the correct choice: the charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
