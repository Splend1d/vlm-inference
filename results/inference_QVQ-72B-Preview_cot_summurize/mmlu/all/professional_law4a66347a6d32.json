                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out who owns the apartment building after all these deeds and deaths. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the professor owns the apartment building outright, right? He's the fee simple owner. Then he conveys it with these words: \"I hereby convey my apartment building to my son and daughter as tenants in common.\" And in the deed, he reserves a life estate for himself. So, he's giving the property to his son and daughter, but he's keeping the right to live there or receive income from it until he dies.\n\nNow, after that, he tells his children about this conveyance and puts the deed in a family vault for safekeeping. Then, the son gets married to a doctor, and the professor, who doesn't like the doctor, executes another deed called a \"correction deed.\" In this new deed, he conveys the apartment building \"to my son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship,\" again reserving a life estate for himself. Both children accept this \"correction deed.\"\n\nSix months later, the son dies intestate, meaning without a will, and the doctor is his only heir. So, the question is, who holds the title to the apartment building now?\n\nAlright, let's analyze this. First, there are two deeds involved: the original conveyance to tenants in common and the subsequent \"correction deed\" conveying it to joint tenants.\n\nGenerally, when someone conveys property, the deed must be delivered and accepted to be effective. In this case, both deeds were properly executed, and the children accepted the \"correction deed.\"\n\nBut there's a question of whether the \"correction deed\" actually corrected or replaced the original deed. If the professor intended to revoke the first deed and replace it with the second one, then the second deed would prevail. However, if he intended both deeds to coexist, that could create some confusion.\n\nBut since he labeled it a \"correction deed\" and conveyed the property again, it seems like he intended to replace the first deed with the second one. Plus, the children accepted the second deed, so presumably, they agreed to its terms.\n\nAssuming that the \"correction deed\" revoked the first deed, then the property is held by the son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship, with the professor retaining a life estate.\n\nNow, the professor has a life estate, which means he has the right to use or receive income from the property during his lifetime. After his death, the remainder interest passes to the joint tenants, the son and daughter.\n\nBut the son has since died, and the daughter is still alive. In joint tenancy with right of survivorship, when one joint tenant dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant(s), not to their heirs.\n\nSo, upon the son's death, his interest in the joint tenancy would pass to the daughter, making her the sole owner of the remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nHowever, the son was married to a doctor, and he died intestate, meaning without a will. Normally, in intestate succession, a spouse would inherit from the deceased. But in this case, since the son held his interest in joint tenancy with his sister, the daughter, his interest would pass to her by operation of law, bypassing his estate and his spouse.\n\nTherefore, the doctor, being the son's spouse, would not inherit the son's interest in the property because of the joint tenancy's right of survivorship.\n\nSo, after the son's death, the daughter becomes the sole owner of the remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include the doctor as a tenant in common with the daughter. Is that possible?\n\nWell, if the joint tenancy was between the son and daughter, and the son dies, his interest passes to the daughter, not to his spouse. So, the doctor doesn't get any interest through the son's estate because the joint tenancy trumps intestate succession.\n\nTherefore, the title should be in the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common.\n\nNo, because the doctor shouldn't get any interest through the son's estate due to the joint tenancy.\n\nOption B: the daughter subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOption C: the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nAgain, the doctor shouldn't have any interest.\n\nOption D: the daughter and the doctor as joint tenants with survivorship rights, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nNo, because the doctor shouldn't have any interest in the property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option B: the daughter subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about the effect of the \"correction deed.\"\n\nThe professor executed a \"correction deed\" after the first deed, conveying the property to joint tenancy again with a life estate reserved.\n\nAssuming that the \"correction deed\" revoked the first deed, then the joint tenancy between the son and daughter is established, with the professor retaining a life estate.\n\nUpon the son's death, his interest passes to the daughter, making her the sole owner of the remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nTherefore, the title is in the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nI think Option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
