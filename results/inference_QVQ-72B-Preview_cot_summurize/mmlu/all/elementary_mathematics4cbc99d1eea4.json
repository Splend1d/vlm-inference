Okay, so it's -8 times -4, and I need to pick the correct answer from the options A. -4, B. 4, C. 32, D. -32.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. So, -8 times -4 should be positive 32. Let me just double-check that.\n\nFirst, I'll ignore the signs and multiply 8 times 4, which is 32. Then, since both numbers are negative, their product should be positive. So, 32 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, one of the options is 4. Is that a typo or something? No, probably not. Maybe someone might think it's just the coefficient, but no, that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I have -8 and I multiply it by -4, it's like saying \"the opposite of eight, four times the opposite.\" But since multiplying two negatives makes a positive, it should indeed be 32.\n\nMaybe I should consider the rules for multiplying integers. The general rule is that the product of two negative integers is positive. So, -8 * -4 = 32.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll think about smaller numbers. Like, -1 * -1 = 1, because negating twice brings you back to positive. So, extending that logic, -8 * -4 should definitely be positive 32.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it seems straightforward. The question is probably testing whether I know that the product of two negatives is positive.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA. -4\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 32\n\nD. -32\n\nI can eliminate A and D because they are negative, and I know the answer should be positive. Between B and C, 4 is much smaller than 32, and doesn't make sense for -8 * -4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 32.\n\nWait, just to be extra sure, maybe I can think about another example. Like, -2 * -6 = 12, which matches the rule. Similarly, -8 * -4 should be 32.\n\nAlright, I think I've convinced myself enough times that the answer is 32. I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
