The options are:\n\nA. The system is consistent.\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what it means for a system to be consistent and what the nature of its solutions looks like.\n\nFirst off, a system is consistent if it has at least one solution. Given that all these equations are set equal to zero, and they're linear, it's unlikely to have no solutions because the equations are homogeneous (i.e., equal to zero). In homogeneous systems, the trivial solution (where all variables are zero) always exists, so the system is always consistent. So, option A is probably true, but I should verify that.\n\nNext, since it's a homogeneous system, the solutions can either be just the trivial solution or there can be infinitely many solutions, including the trivial one. Given that we have more equations than variables, it might be tempting to think that the only solution is the trivial one, but that's not necessarily the case. I need to check the rank of the coefficient matrix to determine the number of solutions.\n\nLet me write down the coefficient matrix:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis is a 4x4 matrix since there are four variables: w, x, y, z.\n\nTo determine the number of solutions, I need to find the rank of this matrix. If the rank is 4, then the only solution is the trivial one. If the rank is less than 4, say r, then there are 4 - r free variables, and thus infinitely many solutions.\n\nBut wait, the system is homogeneous, and the augmented matrix is just the coefficient matrix since the constants are all zero. So, I can row reduce the matrix to find its rank.\n\nLet's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStart with:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubtract the first row from the second row to eliminate the w in the second equation:\n\nRow2 \u2192 Row2 - Row1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, eliminate the w's in the third and fourth rows using the first row:\n\nRow3 \u2192 Row3 - 3*Row1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nRow4 \u2192 Row4 - 2*Row1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not right. Let's recalculate Row4:\n\nRow4 - 2*Row1:\n\n(2 - 2*1) = 0\n\n(5 - 2*3) = -1\n\n(5 - 2*2) = 1\n\n(6 - 2*2) = 2\n\nSo, it should be:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, proceed to eliminate the x's below the second row.\n\nFirst, swap Row3 and Row4 to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, add Row2 to Row3:\n\nRow3 \u2192 Row3 + Row2:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, add 4 times Row2 to Row4:\n\nRow4 \u2192 Row4 + 4*Row2:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the row-reduced matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the rank of the matrix is 2, since there are only two nonzero rows. Therefore, there are 4 - 2 = 2 free variables.\n\nSo, the system has infinitely many solutions, which means option B is true.\n\nNow, since it's a homogeneous system and the solutions form a vector space, the sum of any two solutions should also be a solution. This is a property of vector spaces, so option C should be true.\n\nOption D states that every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). If that's the case, then the solution space should be one-dimensional, spanned by that vector.\n\nBut wait, we just determined that the solution space has two free variables, meaning it should be two-dimensional. If every solution is a scalar multiple of one vector, that would imply the solution space is one-dimensional, which contradicts our earlier finding.\n\nTherefore, option D seems suspect. Maybe that's the false statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that vector is indeed a solution, but there are others that can't be expressed as scalar multiples of it.\n\nLet me check if (-5, 1, 1, 0) is indeed a solution.\n\nPlug in w = -5, x = 1, y = 1, z = 0 into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n-5 + 3(1) + 2(1) + 2(0) = -5 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 0. Good.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n-5 + 4(1) + 1(1) = -5 + 4 + 1 = 0. Good.\n\nThird equation:\n\n3(-5) + 5(1) + 10(1) + 14(0) = -15 + 5 + 10 + 0 = 0. Good.\n\nFourth equation:\n\n2(-5) + 5(1) + 5(1) + 6(0) = -10 + 5 + 5 + 0 = 0. Good.\n\nSo, (-5, 1, 1, 0) is indeed a solution.\n\nBut since the solution space is two-dimensional, there must be other solutions that are not scalar multiples of this one.\n\nLet me try to find another solution.\n\nFrom the row-reduced matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z = 0 \\\\\nx - y - 2z = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nLet's express w and x in terms of y and z.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nx = y + 2z\n\nPlug this into the first equation:\n\nw + 3(y + 2z) + 2y + 2z = 0\n\nw + 3y + 6z + 2y + 2z = 0\n\nw + 5y + 8z = 0\n\nSo, w = -5y - 8z\n\nNow, we have:\n\nw = -5y - 8z\n\nx = y + 2z\n\ny = y\n\nz = z\n\nSince y and z are free variables, we can set them to any real numbers.\n\nLet's set y = 1, z = 0:\n\nw = -5(1) - 8(0) = -5\n\nx = 1 + 2(0) = 1\n\ny = 1\n\nz = 0\n\nWhich is the vector (-5, 1, 1, 0), as given in option D.\n\nNow, set y = 0, z = 1:\n\nw = -5(0) - 8(1) = -8\n\nx = 0 + 2(1) = 2\n\ny = 0\n\nz = 1\n\nSo, another solution is (-8, 2, 0, 1).\n\nIs this a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0)?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nSuppose (-8, 2, 0, 1) = k*(-5, 1, 1, 0)\n\nThen:\n\n-8 = -5k \u21d2 k = 8/5\n\n2 = k*1 \u21d2 k = 2\n\n0 = k*1 \u21d2 k = 0\n\n1 = k*0 \u21d2 k is undefined\n\nClearly, there's no single k that satisfies all these equations, so (-8, 2, 0, 1) is not a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nTherefore, there exists another solution that is not a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0), which means option D is false.\n\nTo confirm, let's check if the sum of these two solutions is also a solution.\n\nSum: (-5 + (-8), 1 + 2, 1 + 0, 0 + 1) = (-13, 3, 1, 1)\n\nPlug into the original equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n-13 + 3(3) + 2(1) + 2(1) = -13 + 9 + 2 + 2 = 0. Good.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n-13 + 4(3) + 1(1) = -13 + 12 + 1 = 0. Good.\n\nThird equation:\n\n3(-13) + 5(3) + 10(1) + 14(1) = -39 + 15 + 10 + 14 = 0. Good.\n\nFourth equation:\n\n2(-13) + 5(3) + 5(1) + 6(1) = -26 + 15 + 5 + 6 = 0. Good.\n\nSo, the sum is also a solution, which aligns with option C being true.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is option D: Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
