                    "text": "So I've got this property law problem here, and I need to figure out whether this solar collector has to be removed. Let me try to understand the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a woman who owns a piece of land that's next to a public highway to the south. Her neighbor owns the land immediately to the north. The neighbor's predecessor had been granted an easement from the woman's predecessor in title, which allows the neighbor to cross the woman's land to get to the public highway. Even though the neighbor has other ways to access public roads, this easement gives them another option.\n\nRecently, the woman put up a big solar collector on part of her land that's subject to this easement. She did this because that location is best for maximizing sunlight, even though she has other power sources. But by putting the solar collector there, she's blocking the neighbor's access to the easement. Now, the neighbor is suing to make her remove it.\n\nThe local zoning code allows the use of solar collectors, which might be relevant. The question is asking whether the solar collector must be removed, and it gives four options:\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\n\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\n\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n\nAlright, let's analyze each option.\n\nOption A says no, because the neighbor has other means of access. While it's true that the neighbor has other access to public roads, the fact is that they have an easement that allows them to use this specific path across the woman's land. An easement is a property right that gives someone the right to use another's land for a specific purpose. Just because they have other access doesn't necessarily mean they can be prevented from using the easement. So, I think this option might not be correct.\n\nOption B says no, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. Zoning codes regulate how land can be used, and if solar collectors are allowed, that might seem like a strong argument. However, easements are property rights that exist independently of zoning regulations. So, even if solar collectors are permitted by zoning, if there's an easement in place that allows access across that part of the land, putting something there that blocks that access could be a violation of the easement. Therefore, I don't think this is the right answer either.\n\nOption C says yes, because the easement remains valid. This seems plausible. Easements are binding on subsequent owners unless there's some agreement to the contrary. Since the neighbor has an easement to cross the woman's land for access to the highway, and she's put something there that prevents that access, it could be considered a violation of the easement terms. Therefore, the neighbor might have the right to have the obstruction removed to restore their access.\n\nOption D says yes, because the woman has other power resources. While it's true that she has other power sources, I don't think that's relevant to whether she can block the easement. The existence of the easement is a property right that the neighbor holds, and it doesn't depend on whether the woman needs the land for something else. So, even if she has other power resources, she can't just ignore the easement.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems like option C is the correct answer. The easement is a valid property right that the neighbor has, and the woman's action in placing the solar collector there is interfering with that right. Therefore, the neighbor is likely entitled to have the obstruction removed to ensure their continued use of the easement.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this a bit more. Is there any way that the woman could argue that the easement is no longer valid or that her use of the land is permissible despite the easement?\n\nWell, easements typically survive changes in land ownership unless there's an express agreement to terminate them. There's no mention of any such agreement here, so the easement should still be in place.\n\nAlso, the fact that the neighbor has other access doesn't necessarily mean that the easement is redundant or can be ignored. Easements can be for convenience or preference, not just necessity.\n\nMoreover, the woman's need for the solar collector, even if it's for a good cause like renewable energy, doesn't override the neighbor's property rights in the easement unless there's a specific legal mechanism that allows it, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the answer is C: Yes, because the easement remains valid, and the woman's actions are interfering with the neighbor's rights under that easement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
