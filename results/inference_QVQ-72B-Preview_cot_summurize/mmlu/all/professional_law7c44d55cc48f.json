                    "text": "So I've got this question about slander, and the client thinks she's been slandered. The question is asking which of the following statements is not true about slander. Let me go through each option one by one to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst option: \"It is spoken defamation.\" I know that slander is a type of defamation, specifically when it's spoken. So, yeah, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, defamation can be either libel or slander. Libel is typically written or published, while slander is spoken. So, this option seems true.\n\nSecond option: \"Plaintiff has to prove special damages, unless it falls into slander per se.\" Okay, so in general, for slander, the plaintiff usually has to show that they suffered some kind of harm, like financial loss or damage to their reputation. But there are certain types of statements that are considered so inherently damaging that the plaintiff doesn't need to prove specific damages. These are called slander per se. So, this option also seems accurate.\n\nThird option: \"The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.\" Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about this one. I thought that for defamation, whether libel or slander, the statement has to be published or communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. But maybe with slander per se, there's an exception? Let me think. Slander per se refers to statements that are so damaging that damages are presumed, but I don't think it\u514d\u9664s the requirement of publication. Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nFourth option: \"There are four slander per se categories.\" I recall that there are specific categories of statements that qualify as slander per se. Typically, these include accusations of serious crimes, statements that impute poor professional conduct or incompetence, claims that someone has a sexually transmitted disease, and statements that impute unchastity to a woman. So, there are indeed four main categories, though I might be missing some specifics.\n\nGiven that, it seems like options A, B, and D are accurate, while option C might be the incorrect one. Let me double-check. Slander, being a form of defamation, does require that the defamatory statement be published to at least one third party. Even in cases of slander per se, the publication requirement still applies; it's just that the plaintiff doesn't need to prove actual damages because the harm is presumed due to the nature of the statement.\n\nSo, the statement in option C, \"The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se,\" is not true. Publication is still required; it's just that the presumption of damages means the plaintiff doesn't have to prove specific monetary losses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
