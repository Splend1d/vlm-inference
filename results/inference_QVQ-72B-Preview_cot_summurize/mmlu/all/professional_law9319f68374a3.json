                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about agency law, specifically regarding apparent authority. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a businessperson who sends their administrative assistant to represent them at a conference where business deals are often negotiated. The businessperson equips the assistant with various materials like cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and even order forms bearing the businessperson's logo. The assistant tells third parties that they're officially representing the businessperson and have the authority to sign contracts on their behalf.\n\nThe assistant then negotiates a deal with a third party, but later, the businessperson refuses to honor the terms of the deal because they don't like them. The question is whether the third party can enforce the contract against the businessperson.\n\nOkay, so the key here is understanding apparent authority. Apparent authority is when a principal creates the impression that an agent has the authority to act on their behalf, and a third party relies on that impression to their detriment.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because furnishing the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\n\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nHmm, let's analyze each one.\n\nStarting with option A: It suggests that providing the assistant with materials like cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms is enough to bind the businessperson to the contract. But is that necessarily true?\n\nWell, these materials certainly make it seem like the assistant has the authority to represent the businessperson and negotiate deals. The third party, seeing these materials, might reasonably believe that the assistant has the power to enter into contracts on behalf of the businessperson.\n\nHowever, just providing the materials might not be sufficient on its own. There needs to be some representation or implication that the assistant has the authority to bind the businessperson contractually.\n\nMoving on to option B: It claims that whenever a principal sends an employee to a convention, the principal is bound by the employee's actions.\n\nThat seems too broad. Just because an employee is sent to a convention doesn't automatically mean that everything they do there binds the principal. The scope of their authority matters here. If the employee is exceeding their actual authority, then it depends on whether apparent authority can be established.\n\nOption C says no, because third parties have a duty to determine whether the assistant is an authorized agent.\n\nThis touches on the concept of due diligence. In general, third parties are expected to exercise reasonable care in verifying the authority of the person they're dealing with. However, if the principal has created a situation where it's reasonable for the third party to believe that the assistant has the authority to act, then the principal may be bound by the assistant's actions even if the third party didn't verify.\n\nOption D is similar, suggesting that because of technology, third parties should confirm actual authority before proceeding.\n\nWhile technology does make verification easier, it's still possible for principals to create circumstances where third parties reasonably rely on apparent authority without verification. So, this might not be a definitive reason to say the third party can't enforce the contract.\n\nNow, considering all this, I think the answer is A: Yes, because furnishing the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nHere's why: The businessperson provided the assistant with various materials that suggest they have the authority to represent and negotiate deals. This can be seen as creating an appearance of authority. If the third party reasonably relies on this appearance and enters into a contract, then the businessperson may be bound by that contract, even if they later disapprove of the terms.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Is providing the materials enough, or does there need to be more?\n\nIn agency law, apparent authority can be created by the principal's actions or representations that convey to third parties that the agent has the necessary authority. This can include giving the agent access to tools or resources that are typically associated with having such authority.\n\nIn this case, providing cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms with the businessperson's logo on them strongly suggests that the assistant is authorized to negotiate and possibly bind the businessperson to contracts.\n\nMoreover, the assistant explicitly represented to third parties that they were there officially representing the businessperson and had the authority to execute contracts on their behalf. This direct representation reinforces the third party's belief in the assistant's authority.\n\nThe third party, relying on these materials and representations, negotiates a deal and presumably signs a contract. If the businessperson then refuses to honor the contract, the third party may argue that they reasonably believed the assistant had the authority to bind the businessperson.\n\nTherefore, under the doctrine of apparent authority, the third party is likely to prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson.\n\nWait a minute, but what if the businessperson argues that they never intended to give the assistant actual authority to sign contracts, and that the assistant was misrepresenting their authority?\n\nWell, in such a case, it's still about what the third party reasonably believed based on the principal's conduct. If the principal's actions led the third party to believe that the assistant had the authority, then the principal is bound by that, regardless of whether the assistant was exceeding their actual authority.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the businessperson provided the assistant with materials that suggest authority to negotiate and sign contracts, and the assistant represented having such authority, the third party likely has a strong case to enforce the contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Yes, because furnishing the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
