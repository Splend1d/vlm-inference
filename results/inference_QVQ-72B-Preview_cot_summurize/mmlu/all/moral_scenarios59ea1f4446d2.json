                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are A: both are wrong, B: the first is wrong but the second isn't, C: the second is wrong but the first isn't, or D: neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nScenario 1: \"When I saw my neighbor's house was on fire, I rushed to the phone to call my long lost friend to chat.\"\n\nOkay, so there's a emergency situation here\u2014neighbor's house is on fire. That's a really serious issue. The main character's response is to call a long-lost friend to chat instead of, say, calling the fire department or trying to help in some way.\n\nHmm, that seems off. Like, shouldn't the first thought be to call for help or see if anyone needs assistance? Calling a friend to chat in that moment feels insensitive and maybe even negligent.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person thought that someone else had already called the fire department, or perhaps they were in shock and weren't thinking clearly.\n\nBut from an ordinary moral standpoint, I think the expected action would be to call for emergency services immediately, especially if no one else is around or if it's unclear whether help has been summoned.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it seems like the person is prioritizing a personal conversation over addressing the emergency, which could potentially put lives or property at risk.\n\nThat feels like a morally wrong choice because it's neglecting the well-being of others in favor of personal desires.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I didn't know the answers to the exam so my friend helped me study.\"\n\nHere, it seems like the person is seeking help to prepare for an exam because they didn't know the answers. So, they asked a friend to help them study.\n\nAt first glance, this seems perfectly fine. Asking for help when you don't understand something is generally considered a good thing, right? It shows a willingness to learn and improve.\n\nHelping someone study is also usually seen as a positive action, as it can benefit both parties by reinforcing knowledge and fostering collaboration.\n\nHowever, there might be some nuances here that I need to consider. For example, if the friend is helping them cheat during the exam, that would be morally wrong. But the scenario says \"helped me study,\" which implies preparation before the exam, not necessarily during it.\n\nUnless, of course, \"helped me study\" is a euphemism for something else, but based on the wording, it seems straightforward.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it appears that the person is simply getting assistance to better understand the material, which is not inherently morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Acting insensitively and potentially negligently by prioritizing a personal call over an emergency situation.\n\n- Scenario 2: Seeking and receiving help to study for an exam, which is a positive and constructive action.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps there's a context where calling a friend instead of emergency services could be justified. For example, if the fire was already being handled by professionals and there was no immediate danger, maybe chatting to a friend wouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't provide any such context; it just says the neighbor's house is on fire, and the person rushes to call a friend to chat.\n\nIn the absence of additional information, it's reasonable to assume that the immediate response should be to call for help or assist in some way, rather than engaging in a non-urgent personal conversation.\n\nTherefore, it's still considered morally wrong based on ordinary US standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, unless there's some unusual circumstance, helping someone study is generally a morally acceptable action.\n\nSo, the answer remains B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
