                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which restaurant serves a Grand Slam breakfast. The options are Denny's, McDonald's, Burger King, and Hardee's. Hmm, I think I've heard of a Grand Slam at Denny's before, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst off, I know that a Grand Slam is typically a breakfast meal that includes things like eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and maybe pancakes or biscuits. It's usually a pretty substantial breakfast, maybe even with some hash browns or home fries. But which restaurant is famous for calling their breakfast a \"Grand Slam\"?\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Denny's. I recall that Denny's is known for their breakfast offerings, and I think they have a signature breakfast called the Grand Slam. Let me see if I can remember any details about it. I think it includes two eggs, hash browns, toast, and either bacon or sausage. That sounds familiar, but I might be mixing it up with another restaurant.\n\nNext, McDonald's. They're famous for their breakfast menu, especially their McMuffins and hash browns. But do they have something called a Grand Slam? I don't think so. I believe their breakfast items are more individual, like the Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin, or hash browns. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't recall them having a combo meal named Grand Slam.\n\nThen there's Burger King. I know they have breakfast sandwiches and croissants, and they also serve hash browns. But again, I don't remember them having a specific Grand Slam breakfast. Maybe they have different combinations, but not that particular name.\n\nLastly, Hardee's. I know Hardee's is known for their biscuits, especially their sausage biscuits. They also offer breakfast platters that include eggs, bacon or sausage, and hash browns. But again, I don't think they refer to any of their meals as a Grand Slam.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps I should consider the origin of the term \"Grand Slam\" in the context of breakfast. In sports, a grand slam refers to scoring all runs in baseball, or winning all major titles in tennis or golf. In dining, it might refer to a meal that's particularly comprehensive or satisfying.\n\nI think I need to do a bit of research here. Maybe look up the menus of these restaurants to see which one actually offers a Grand Slam breakfast.\n\nLet me start with Denny's. I recall that Denny's has a slogan like \"Denny's is always open, always serving breakfast,\" or something along those lines. They are well-known for their breakfast meals, and I'm pretty sure they have a Grand Slam option. Let me verify that.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Denny's does indeed offer a Grand Slam breakfast. It typically includes two eggs, hash browns, toast, and a choice of bacon or sausage. It's one of their signature dishes, and it's available all day, which is convenient.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, I'll check the other restaurants.\n\nMcDonald's: Their breakfast menu includes items like Egg McMuffins, hash browns, pancakes, and various beverages. But they don't have a meal called the Grand Slam. Maybe they have different combinations, but not specifically labeled as such.\n\nBurger King: Their breakfast options include croissant sandwiches, French toast sticks, pancakes, and hash browns. Again, no mention of a Grand Slam breakfast.\n\nHardee's: Known for their biscuits, they offer various breakfast platters that include eggs, meat, and hash browns. But similar to the others, they don't seem to have a Grand Slam named meal.\n\nBased on this research, it seems that Denny's is the restaurant that offers a Grand Slam breakfast. I must have remembered correctly initially.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should consider if any of these restaurants might have a similar meal under a different name. For example, at McDonald's, they have the Big Breakfast, which includes eggs, hash browns, pancakes, and sausage or bacon. That sounds similar to the Grand Slam, but it's not called the same thing.\n\nAt Burger King, they have the BK Big Breakfast, which includes eggs, hash browns, pancakes, and sausage or bacon as well. Again, similar components but a different name.\n\nHardee's has the All Star Breakfast, which also includes eggs, meat, hash browns, and biscuits. Still, no Grand Slam.\n\nSo, unless there's some regional variation or a limited-time offer I'm unaware of, it appears that Denny's is the primary restaurant among these options that offers a Grand Slam breakfast.\n\nPerhaps it's worth noting that Denny's has been around since the 1950s and has a long history of serving breakfast meals, which might explain why the Grand Slam is associated with them.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking to order a Grand Slam breakfast, Denny's is the restaurant where you can find it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Denny's}} \\]"
