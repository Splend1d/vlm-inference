                    "text": "So I've come across this question about Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross's theory on the stages of grief, particularly focusing on the first reaction of a person faced with a terminal illness. The options are acceptance, anger, bargaining, or denial. Hmm, I think I remember learning about this in psychology class, but it's been a while. Let me see if I can recall the correct order.\n\nFirst off, I know that Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross was a Swiss-American psychiatrist who developed a model to explain the five stages people go through when dealing with terminal illness or other life-changing events. The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Wait, is that the order? Let me double-check.\n\nLet me try reciting them in my mind: denial is the first stage, then comes anger, followed by bargaining, then depression, and finally acceptance. So, according to this, denial is the initial reaction. But I should make sure that this applies specifically to terminal illness as well, since the question specifies \"a person faced with a terminal illness.\"\n\nI think her original work, \"On Death and Dying,\" which introduced these stages, was based on people with terminal illnesses. So, yes, this should be applicable. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there have been any revisions or new research that might have changed this sequence.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that some experts have questioned whether these stages are universal or if everyone goes through them in the same order. But for the purpose of this question, I think we're supposed to go with K\u00fcbler-Ross's original model.\n\nSo, if denial is the first stage, then the answer should be D. denial. But let me think about each option to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is acceptance. That seems like it would be the final stage, not the first one. People usually come to acceptance after going through other emotions first.\n\nOption B is anger. While anger is one of the stages, it comes after denial in the K\u00fcbler-Ross model. So, it shouldn't be the first reaction.\n\nOption C is bargaining. That's typically the third stage, following denial and anger. So, again, not the first reaction.\n\nThat leaves option D, denial, which aligns with the first stage of K\u00fcbler-Ross's model. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, maybe I can think of an example. Suppose someone is told they have a terminal illness. Initially, they might say, \"No, that can't be true. There must be some mistake.\" That sounds like denial, right? So, that seems to fit the first reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people might immediately get angry upon hearing such news, blaming others or feeling\u6124\u6068ful. But according to the model, anger comes after denial. So, even if someone appears to be angry right away, perhaps deep down, there's a denial going on.\n\nAnother possibility is that some individuals might accept the news right away, without going through the other stages. But according to K\u00fcbler-Ross, acceptance is the final stage, and not everyone reaches it.\n\nBargaining might involve making deals with a higher power or themselves, like, \"If I get better, I'll change my ways.\" But that seems more like a later reaction, after initial shock and denial have worn off.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm pretty confident that denial is the first reaction, as per K\u00fcbler-Ross's model.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the first reaction,\" and it's multiple-choice with four options. It's possible that some people might have a different first reaction, but according to the model, denial is the first stage.\n\nI think I'll go with D. denial as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
