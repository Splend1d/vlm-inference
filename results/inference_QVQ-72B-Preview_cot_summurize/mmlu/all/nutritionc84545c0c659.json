                    "text": "So I need to figure out the correct definition of overweight based on BMI. The options are:\n\nA. BMI > 25 kg/m\u00b2\n\nB. BMI = 25 kg/m\u00b2\n\nC. BMI 25-29.9 kg/m\u00b2\n\nD. BMI 25-30 kg/m\u00b2\n\nFirst, I should recall what BMI stands for. BMI is Body Mass Index, which is a measure used to indicate whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. It's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.\n\nNow, the question is about the definition of \"overweight.\" I remember that BMI ranges are categorized into different classes:\n\n- Underweight: below 18.5\n\n- Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9\n\n- Overweight: 25 to 29.9\n\n- Obesity: 30 and above\n\nLooking at the options, C and D both mention BMI 25-29.9 kg/m\u00b2, which matches my recollection of the overweight category. But option A says BMI > 25 kg/m\u00b2, which would include BMI values above 25, but it's not clear if it includes 25 or not. Option B specifies BMI = 25 kg/m\u00b2, which is just the lower boundary of the overweight category.\n\nWait a minute, in standard BMI classifications, the overweight category does include BMI values from 25 through 29.9. So, it's not just BMI greater than 25, but specifically from 25 to 29.9.\n\nLet me double-check this. If I look up the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on BMI, they define overweight as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. So, that would be BMI \u2265 25 and <30.\n\nOption C says BMI 25-29.9 kg/m\u00b2, which is the same as BMI \u2265 25 and <30.\n\nOption D says BMI 25-30 kg/m\u00b2, which would include BMI values from 25 to exactly 30.\n\nSo, according to WHO, overweight is BMI \u2265 25 and <30, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let's see if there's any difference between option C (25-29.9) and option D (25-30). The difference is whether BMI of exactly 30 is included in the overweight category or not.\n\nAccording to standard definitions, BMI of 30 and above is considered obese, not overweight. So, BMI 30 should be in the obesity category.\n\nTherefore, option C (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m\u00b2) is the correct definition of overweight, while option D includes BMI 30, which should be considered obese.\n\nTo summarize, the definition of overweight based on BMI is from 25 to 29.9 kg/m\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
