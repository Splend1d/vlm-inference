                    "text": "So I've got this excerpt from the Port Huron Statement from 1962, and I need to figure out who its primary intended audience was. The options are African Americans in the South, government officials, middle-class college students, or factory workers.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the Port Huron Statement is. I remember hearing about it in history class; it was a document that came out of a conference in Port Huron, Michigan, and it's often associated with the New Left movement in the United States. It was kind of a manifesto for a new generation of activists.\n\nLooking at the excerpt, it starts by reflecting on the post-World War II era when the United States was at the height of its power and influence. It mentions things like being the only country with the atom bomb, the founding of the United Nations, and American values like freedom and equality.\n\nThen it talks about how, as people grew up, they started to see issues that they couldn't ignore. Specifically, it mentions \"the Southern struggle against racial bigotry,\" which refers to the Civil Rights Movement, and \"the Cold War,\" particularly the threat of nuclear war.\n\nThe language used seems thoughtful and reflective, suggesting that the audience might be educated and intellectually engaged. The reference to \"maturing in complacency\" and then being \"penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss\" makes it sound like the intended readers are young adults who are becoming aware of social and political issues.\n\nGiven that, middle-class college students seem like a likely audience. They would have had the education and the time to reflect on these issues, and many college students in the 1960s were becoming involved in social activism, especially around civil rights and anti-war movements.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nAfrican Americans in the South were certainly a key group affected by and involved in the Civil Rights Movement. However, the language in the statement seems more directed towards a broader audience, not specifically African Americans. Also, the reference to \"many of us\" beginning to mature and be awakened to these issues suggests a group that was previously unaware or uninvolved, which might not accurately describe the majority of African Americans in the South who were deeply immersed in the struggle against bigotry.\n\nGovernment officials might be influenced by such a statement, but it doesn't seem directly addressed to them. It's more of a call to action for young people to get involved and change society, rather than a policy proposal or legislative agenda.\n\nFactory workers are another group that might have been affected by social and political issues of the time, but again, the language seems more suited to a middle-class, educated audience. Factory workers might have been more focused on economic issues and labor rights, whereas this statement touches on a broader range of issues including civil rights and the Cold War.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the primary intended audience for the Port Huron Statement was middle-class college students. They were seen as a group that could be mobilized to address the social and political issues of the time and to work towards creating a better society based on American values.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. middle-class college students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
