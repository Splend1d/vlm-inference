                    "text": "Let's see. So, last week Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days. This week, he ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days. I need to find an expression that represents the total number of cookies he ate over these two weeks.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cookies he ate each week and then add those together to get the total.\n\nFor last week: He ate 2 cookies per day for 5 days. So, that's 2 multiplied by 5, right? That gives me 10 cookies.\n\nFor this week: He ate 2 cookies per day for 4 days. So, that's 2 multiplied by 4, which is 8 cookies.\n\nNow, to find the total cookies over two weeks, I need to add last week's cookies to this week's cookies. So, 10 plus 8, which is 18 cookies in total.\n\nNow, looking at the options to see which expression matches this.\n\nOption A: 2 x (5 x 4). That's 2 times 20, which is 40. That's not 18.\n\nOption B: 2 x (5 + 4). That's 2 times 9, which is 18. Hmm, that matches my total.\n\nOption C: (2 x 5) x (2 x 4). That's 10 times 8, which is 80. That's way more than 18.\n\nOption D: (2 + 5) x (2 + 4). That's 7 times 6, which is 42. Also not 18.\n\nSo, option B seems to match my total of 18 cookies.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at it? Maybe I should consider the total number of days he ate cookies and the total cookies per day.\n\nTotal days last week: 5 days\n\nTotal days this week: 4 days\n\nTotal days over two weeks: 5 + 4 = 9 days\n\nCookies per day: 2\n\nTotal cookies: 2 x 9 = 18\n\nAgain, that matches option B: 2 x (5 + 4) = 2 x 9 = 18\n\nOption A is 2 x (5 x 4) = 2 x 20 = 40, which would be if he ate 5 times the cookies per day, but that's not the case.\n\nOption C is (2 x 5) x (2 x 4) = 10 x 8 = 80, which seems like multiplying the cookies of each week separately, but that doesn't make sense for the total.\n\nOption D is (2 + 5) x (2 + 4) = 7 x 6 = 42, which might be adding the cookies and days separately and then multiplying, but that doesn't fit the scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, option B is the correct expression that represents the total number of cookies Paul ate over the two weeks.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the operations again.\n\nLast week: 2 cookies/day for 5 days \u2192 2 * 5 = 10 cookies\n\nThis week: 2 cookies/day for 4 days \u2192 2 * 4 = 8 cookies\n\nTotal cookies: 10 + 8 = 18\n\nOr, combined: 2 * (5 + 4) = 2 * 9 = 18\n\nYes, that's consistent with option B.\n\nI don't think the other options correctly represent the situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: 2 x (5 + 4)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
