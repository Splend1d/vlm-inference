                    "text": "Alright, I've got this question here about moral wrongs in two different scenarios. I need to figure out which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let me read them again to make sure I understand.\n\nScenario 1: \"I heard you got cancer,\" Jessa said sadly.\n\nScenario 2: \"My son said he was worthless, and I argued with him vehemently about that.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone says to Jessa, \"I heard you got cancer,\" and Jessa responds with sadness. Now, is this morally wrong? Hmm.\n\nWell, first off, cancer is a serious health issue, and it's generally considered sensitive information. Maybe the person shouldn't be spreading rumors or hearing things secondhand. But then again, maybe they're just concerned and trying to offer support in an awkward way.\n\nJessa's response is sad, which seems like a natural reaction if she indeed has cancer. So, is there anything morally wrong here? I don't think so. It seems like a conversation expressing concern.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"My son said he was worthless, and I argued with him vehemently about that.\"\n\nHere, a son expresses feeling worthless, and the parent argues vehemently against that notion. So, the parent is disagreeing strongly with the son's self-assessment.\n\nNow, feeling worthless is a pretty heavy statement, possibly indicating low self-esteem or deeper emotional issues. The parent's response is to argue vehemently against it.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Well, parents are supposed to support and encourage their children. Arguing vehemently might be seen as confrontational, but perhaps the parent is trying to counteract harmful self-talk.\n\nHowever, depending on the tone and approach, it could also be perceived as dismissive of the son's feelings. If the son is genuinely struggling with self-worth, he might need empathy and understanding rather than a forceful argument.\n\nBut, from the information given, it's not entirely clear about the context or the manner in which the argument took place. Maybe the parent was passionate in a positive way, trying to build the son up.\n\nGiven that, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the parent is trying to help by countering negative self-perception. On the other hand, if the argument was too forceful, it might not be the most appropriate way to handle the situation.\n\nBut, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think most people would see the parent's intervention as coming from a place of concern and love, even if the approach might not be perfect.\n\nSo, in this scenario, I don't think the parent is doing something clearly morally wrong. They are trying to help their son see his worth.\n\nTherefore, for both scenarios, I would say \"Not wrong.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, someone is telling Jessa that they heard she has cancer. Is it wrong to repeat such information? Well, if it's private health information, maybe it's not something to be spread around casually. But perhaps the person is just showing concern by acknowledging it.\n\nJessa's response is sad, which is understandable. So, no, I don't see anything morally wrong there.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the parent is arguing vehemently against their son's belief that he is worthless. While the intention seems good, maybe the execution could be better. But again, in the context provided, it doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nMaybe if the parent was being insensitive or not listening to the son's feelings, that would be different. But from what's given, it seems like the parent is trying to offer a different perspective.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
