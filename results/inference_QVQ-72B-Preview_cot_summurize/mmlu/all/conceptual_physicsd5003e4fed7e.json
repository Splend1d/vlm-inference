Follow an inverse-square law.\n\nD. Are special to space travelers.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Einstein's theory says about space and time.\n\nI remember that Einstein proposed the theory of relativity, which has two main parts: special relativity and general relativity.\n\nSpecial relativity, published in 1905, showed that space and time are not absolute but are relative to the observer's frame of reference. It introduced the concept that space and time are interconnected, forming a single entity called spacetime.\n\nGeneral relativity, published in 1915, extended this by describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\nSo, considering that, option A says they are separate entities. But according to Einstein, they are interconnected, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says they are parts of one whole. That sounds like they are combined into spacetime, which aligns with Einstein's theory.\n\nOption C mentions the inverse-square law. The inverse-square law is related to how light or gravity decreases with distance, but I don't think that's directly about Einstein's discoveries on space and time.\n\nOption D says they are special to space travelers. Well, relativity does have implications for space travel, like time dilation and length contraction, but that seems more of an application rather than a fundamental discovery about space and time.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer should be B. They are parts of one whole.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any chance that Einstein considered them separate entities or something else?\n\nNo, from what I recall, Einstein indeed combined space and time into a single continuum called spacetime. So, option B seems correct.\n\nI think the answer is B. Are parts of one whole.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
