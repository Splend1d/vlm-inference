                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a uniform solid disk starts from rest and rolls down an inclined plane without slipping. I need to find out what fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy after some time. The options are 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about rolling without slipping. For a rolling object, the total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy and the rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe translational kinetic energy (K_trans) is given by (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the disk and v is its velocity.\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy (K_rot) is given by (1/2)I\u03c9^2, where I is the moment of inertia of the disk about its axis of rotation, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\n\nFor a uniform solid disk, the moment of inertia is (1/2)mr^2, where r is the radius of the disk.\n\nIn rolling without slipping, there's a relationship between the linear velocity v and the angular velocity \u03c9, which is v = r\u03c9.\n\nSo, substituting v = r\u03c9 into the expression for K_trans, I get K_trans = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nBut I also have K_rot = (1/2)I\u03c9^2 = (1/2)(1/2mr^2)\u03c9^2 = (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nSo, the total kinetic energy (K_total) is K_trans + K_rot = (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2 + (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2 = (3/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nNow, I need to find the fraction that is rotational kinetic energy, which is K_rot / K_total.\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\nK_rot / K_total = [(1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2] / [(3/4)mr^2\u03c9^2] = (1/4)/(3/4) = (1/4)*(4/3) = 1/3.\n\nWait, so according to this calculation, the fraction is 1/3. But looking back at the options, both B and D have 1/3 and 2/3. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, moment of inertia for a solid disk is indeed (1/2)mr^2.\n\nThen, v = r\u03c9, which is correct for rolling without slipping.\n\nTranslational kinetic energy: (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nRotational kinetic energy: (1/2)I\u03c9^2 = (1/2)(1/2mr^2)\u03c9^2 = (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nTotal kinetic energy: (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2 + (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2 = (3/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nFraction of rotational kinetic energy: (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2 divided by (3/4)mr^2\u03c9^2, which simplifies to (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1/3.\n\nBut wait, I feel like I've heard somewhere that for a disk, the rotational kinetic energy is one-third of the total kinetic energy. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the conservation of energy.\n\nInitially, the disk is at rest, so all its energy is potential energy, mgh, where h is the height down the incline.\n\nAs it rolls down, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, both translational and rotational.\n\nSo, mgh = K_trans + K_rot.\n\nBut I don't know h, and I don't need to find the exact energies, just the ratio of K_rot to K_total.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct. The fraction should be 1/3.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the equations of motion for the rolling disk.\n\nOn an inclined plane with angle \u03b8, the acceleration component down the plane is g sin\u03b8.\n\nIf there's no slipping, the angular acceleration \u03b1 is related to the linear acceleration a by \u03b1 = a/r.\n\nAlso, the torque \u03c4 = I\u03b1 = (1/2)mr^2 * (a/r) = (1/2)mar.\n\nThe torque is also equal to the frictional force times the radius, \u03c4 = f * r.\n\nSo, f * r = (1/2)mar.\n\nBut the net force down the plane is mgsin\u03b8 - f = ma.\n\nFrom f * r = (1/2)mar, and since r = a / \u03b1 = a / (a/r) = r, then f = (1/2)ma.\n\nSubstituting into the net force equation: mgsin\u03b8 - (1/2)ma = ma.\n\nSo, mgsin\u03b8 = (3/2)ma.\n\nThus, a = (2/3)gsin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the velocity v after time t is v = at = (2/3)gsin\u03b8 t.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps me find the fraction of rotational kinetic energy.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating it. Going back to my initial calculation, the fraction seems to be 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people consider that for a rolling object, the total kinetic energy is (7/4)K_rot, but I might be mixing things up.\n\nWait, let's calculate K_total in terms of K_rot.\n\nWe have K_trans = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2, and K_rot = (1/2)(1/2mr^2)\u03c9^2 = (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nSo, K_total = K_trans + K_rot = (1/2)mr^2\u03c9^2 + (1/4)mr^2\u03c9^2 = (3/4)mr^2\u03c9^2.\n\nThus, K_rot / K_total = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
