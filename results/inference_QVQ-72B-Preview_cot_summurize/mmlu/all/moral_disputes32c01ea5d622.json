                    "text": " So I'm trying to understand this question about Norcross and his views on moral standing, particularly regarding animals. The question is asking which argument presents a strong challenge to any proposed standard that excludes animals from having full moral standing. The options are the ontological argument, the argument from cosmology, the argument from marginal cases, or none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what \"full moral standing\" means in this context. I think it refers to the idea that certain beings have inherent value and deserve moral consideration, possibly on par with humans. So, if animals are excluded from this, it means they're not given the same level of moral consideration as humans.\n\nNorcross is probably Peter Norcross, who has written about animal ethics and moral philosophy. I should look into his work to understand his perspective.\n\nLet me recall or research what Norcross might say about moral standing and animals. I think he advocates for the inclusion of animals in our moral considerations, arguing that they deserve ethical treatment based on their ability to suffer or experience well-being.\n\nNow, the question is about which argument poses a formidable challenge to any criterion that excludes animals from full moral standing. So, among the options:\n\nA. the ontological argument\n\nB. the argument from cosmology\n\nC. the argument from marginal cases\n\nD. none of the above\n\nI need to consider which of these would effectively challenge a criterion that excludes animals from full moral standing.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with A. the ontological argument.\n\nOntological arguments are typically concerned with the existence of God, trying to prove God's existence from the concept of a perfect being. I'm not sure how this directly relates to the moral standing of animals. Maybe there's a connection I'm missing, but at first glance, it doesn't seem directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nMoving on to B. the argument from cosmology.\n\nCosmological arguments are also usually about the existence of God, based on the idea that the universe had a cause or a first mover. Again, I'm not seeing a clear link to the moral standing of animals. Perhaps there's a way to interpret these arguments to include animals, but it's not immediately obvious.\n\nNext is C. the argument from marginal cases.\n\nThis sounds promising. The argument from marginal cases is often used in discussions about moral status and personhood. It involves comparing the moral status of humans who are considered to have reduced mental capacities or are on the margins of personhood (like infants, the severely disabled, or those with advanced dementia) with that of animals.\n\nThe idea is that if we grant full moral standing to humans who may have similar or lower cognitive abilities compared to some animals, then it's inconsistent to deny full moral standing to those animals. This argument challenges the idea that being human is the sole criterion for full moral standing and suggests that other factors, like the capacity for suffering or consciousness, should be considered instead.\n\nGiven that Norcross is known for his work on animal ethics and advocating for the moral consideration of animals, it makes sense that he would find the argument from marginal cases particularly compelling. This argument directly challenges the idea of speciesism, which is the belief that humans are superior to other species and therefore deserve different moral consideration.\n\nFinally, D. none of the above.\n\nIf neither the ontological nor the cosmological arguments are relevant here, and the argument from marginal cases seems highly relevant, then \"none of the above\" doesn't seem like the correct choice.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is C. the argument from marginal cases.\n\nTo make sure, let me think about it again. Norcross is likely to support an argument that challenges speciesist views and promotes the idea that moral standing should be based on relevant characteristics, not just species membership. The argument from marginal cases does exactly that by pointing out inconsistencies in how we treat humans with reduced capacities versus animals with similar capacities.\n\nTherefore, I believe C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
