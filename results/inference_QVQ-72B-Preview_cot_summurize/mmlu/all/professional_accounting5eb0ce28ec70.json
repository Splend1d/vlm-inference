                    "text": "Let's tackle this depreciation problem. So, Baker bought some equipment on May 1 of the previous year for $10,000, and it has a five-year useful life. They used the MACRS depreciation system and didn't take any special depreciation deductions. Then, on March 1 of the current year, they sold the equipment. I need to find out how much depreciation Baker can deduct in the current year. The options are $533, $1,600, $2,000, or $3,200.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what MACRS stands for and how it works. MACRS is the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, which is a method of depreciation used for tax purposes in the United States. It allows businesses to recover the cost of certain assets over a specified period using an accelerated depreciation schedule.\n\nSince the equipment has a five-year useful life, I'll use the MACRS depreciation rates for five-year property. The table provided gives the depreciation percentages for each year:\n\n- First year: 20.00%\n\n- Second year: 32.00%\n\n- Third year: 19.20%\n\nNow, the purchase date was May 1 of the prior year, and the sale date was March 1 of the current year. I need to figure out how the depreciation is calculated for the partial year in which the equipment was used in the current year.\n\nIn MACRS, when an asset is placed in service during the year, the depreciation for the first year is prorated based on the month the asset was put into service. Similarly, if the asset is disposed of before the end of its recovery period, the depreciation for the year of disposal is prorated as well.\n\nGiven that the asset was placed in service in May of the prior year and disposed of in March of the current year, I need to determine how much depreciation is allowed for the current year.\n\nFirst, let's determine the depreciation for the prior year.\n\nThe asset was placed in service in May, which is the fifth month of the year. Under MACRS, for five-year property placed in service in a given year, the depreciation for that year is the first year's rate multiplied by the asset's cost, adjusted for the month of placement.\n\nI recall that in MACRS, for five-year property, the convention is to depreciate assets placed in service during the year based on a mid-quarter convention if certain thresholds are met. However, since no specific mid-quarter convention is mentioned, and considering the complexity, perhaps I should consider the half-year convention, where regardless of when during the year the asset is placed in service, it's treated as if it was placed in service at the midpoint of the year.\n\nBut actually, for five-year property under MACRS, the half-year convention is generally used, meaning that in the first year, you take half of the first-year depreciation rate, and in the second year, you take the full first-year rate plus half of the second-year rate, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look this up more carefully.\n\nUpon checking, for five-year property, the half-year convention is typically applied. This means that in the year of placement, only half of the first-year depreciation is allowed, and in the year of disposal, only half of the applicable rate is allowed, unless the asset is held for more or less than half the year.\n\nBut in this problem, the asset was placed in service in May of the prior year and sold in March of the current year. So, it was held for a little over a year.\n\nGiven that, I need to calculate the depreciation for the partial year in the current year.\n\nLet me consider the depreciation for the prior year first.\n\nIn the prior year, since the asset was placed in service in May, which is after the midpoint of the year, the half-year convention would apply. So, for the prior year, the depreciation would be half of the first-year rate.\n\nFirst-year rate is 20.00%, so prior year depreciation would be 10% of $10,000, which is $1,000.\n\nNow, in the current year, the asset was sold in March, which is the third month of the year. If I consider the half-year convention, since the asset is disposed of before the midpoint of the year, I should take half of the second-year rate.\n\nSecond-year rate is 32.00%, so half of that would be 16.00%. So, current year depreciation would be 16% of $10,000, which is $1,600.\n\nBut wait, option B is $1,600, but I need to make sure this is correct.\n\nHowever, I think I need to consider the actual months the asset was in service. Since the asset was in service from March 1 of the current year until it was sold on March 1, which is effectively two months in the current year (assuming it was in service from March 1 to March 1, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it was sold on March 1 of the current year, so from January 1 to March 1, that's two months, or from March 1 to March 1, that's one month. The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, \"on March 1 of the current year, Baker sold the equipment.\" So, the equipment was in service from May 1 of the prior year to March 1 of the current year.\n\nLet's calculate the total months in service.\n\nIf May of the prior year to March of the current year, that's from May to March, which is 11 months (May to April is 12 months, minus one month).\n\nBut in terms of tax years, depending on Baker's tax year end, this could vary. Assuming a calendar tax year, the prior year is from January 1 to December 31, and the current year is from January 1 to December 31.\n\nSo, in the prior year, from May 1 to December 31, that's 8 months, and in the current year, from January 1 to March 1, that's 2 months. Total months in service: 8 + 2 = 10 months.\n\nBut under MACRS, especially with the half-year convention, it might not require such a precise month-by-month calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the year of disposal, depreciation is taken for the entire year unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut given that the asset was sold in March, which is before the midpoint of the year, perhaps the half-year convention still applies.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, for the current year, since the asset was disposed of before the midpoint of the year, depreciation would be half of the second-year rate.\n\nSecond-year rate is 32.00%, half of that is 16.00%, so $1,600 depreciation for the current year.\n\nBut let's see another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the actual period the asset was in service.\n\nIf the asset was in service for 10 months out of 12 months over the two years, perhaps depreciation should be pro-rated accordingly.\n\nBut under MACRS, it's not typically pro-rated by the number of months; instead, it uses conventions like half-year or mid-quarter.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking with the half-year convention is appropriate.\n\nSo, in the prior year, half of the first-year rate (20.00% / 2 = 10.00%), which is $1,000.\n\nIn the current year, since the asset is disposed of before the midpoint of the year, half of the second-year rate (32.00% / 2 = 16.00%), which is $1,600.\n\nTherefore, the total depreciation for the current year would be $1,600.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any other consideration.\n\nIs there any special rule for assets held less than a full year beyond the half-year convention?\n\nI think the half-year convention already accounts for assets being placed in service or disposed of during the year by applying the half-rate in the year of acquisition and disposition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $1,600.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps calculate the depreciation for the period the asset was in service.\n\nFrom May 1 of the prior year to March 1 of the current year is 10 months.\n\nIf the first year's depreciation is 20.00% and the second year's is 32.00%, and the asset was in service for parts of both years, perhaps calculate the depreciation accordingly.\n\nBut under MACRS, it's not typically done on a monthly basis; it's based on the tax year and the convention applied.\n\nGiven that, and considering the half-year convention, $1,600 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different convention applied for five-year property.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the general depreciation system for five-year property under MACRS.\n\nUnder the general depreciation system (GDS), for five-year property, the depreciation rates are as follows:\n\n- Year 1: 20.00%\n\n- Year 2: 32.00%\n\n- Year 3: 19.20%\n\n- Year 4: 11.52%\n\n- Year 5: 11.52%\n\n- Year 6: 5.76%\n\nBut with the half-year convention, in the year of placement, only half of the first-year rate is taken, and in the year of disposal, only half of the applicable rate is taken.\n\nSo, in the prior year, half of 20.00% is 10.00%, which is $1,000.\n\nIn the current year, since the asset is disposed of before the midpoint of the year, half of the second-year rate, which is 16.00%, is $1,600.\n\nTherefore, the depreciation for the current year is $1,600.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. $1,600.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
