                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about IPv4 datagrams and whether certain statements are true. I need to figure out which of these statements are correct. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst statement: \"Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\"\n\nHmm, I remember that in IPv4, the MTU can vary from one network to another. So, when a node sends a datagram, it has to consider the size that the networks along the path can handle. If it sends a datagram that's too big for one of the networks, there could be problems.\n\nI think the source node doesn't necessarily have to know the smallest MTU along the path in advance. Instead, there's a mechanism called path MTU discovery that helps determine the largest datagram size that can be sent without fragmentation. So, maybe this statement isn't entirely accurate.\n\nSecond statement: \"Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\"\n\nI know that fragmentation in IPv4 happens when a datagram needs to be sent over a network that can't handle its current size. So, if a datagram is too big for the next hop, it can be divided into smaller fragments, each of which can be transmitted separately.\n\nI believe this is correct. Fragmentation can occur at any router along the path if the datagram exceeds the MTU of the outgoing link.\n\nThird statement: \"Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.\"\n\nI recall that in IPv4, reassembly of fragmented datagrams typically occurs at the destination host. Intermediate routers don't usually reassemble fragments; they only fragment if necessary.\n\nHowever, sometimes, intermediate routers might reassemble fragments under certain circumstances, but I think the general rule is that reassembly is done only at the destination.\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think again. In IPv4, the destination host is responsible for reassembling fragments into the original datagram. Intermediate routers are not supposed to reassemble fragments; they only fragment if needed to forward the datagrams.\n\nSo, based on that, the third statement seems correct.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- First statement: Not necessarily true, because path MTU discovery allows for adjustment, and the source doesn't have to limit the datagram size to the smallest MTU along the path from the start.\n\n- Second statement: True, datagrams can be fragmented during routing if they exceed the MTU of the next hop.\n\n- Third statement: True, reassembly is generally performed only at the destination host.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are II and III.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. II and III\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, D. II and III is the correct answer.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me double-check.\n\nIn IPv4:\n\n- Fragmentation can occur at routers when a datagram is too large for the next hop's MTU.\n\n- Reassembly is typically done only at the destination host.\n\n- The source doesn't need to know the smallest MTU along the path; instead, path MTU discovery handles this dynamically.\n\nTherefore, statements II and III are true, while statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. II and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
