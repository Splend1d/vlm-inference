I remember that in a group, every element has an inverse that, when multiplied by the element, gives the identity element of the group. So, first things first, I need to identify what the identity element is in this group.\n\nGiven that it's a multiplicative group, the identity element should be the one that, when multiplied by any element, gives that element back. In standard complex numbers, 1 is the multiplicative identity because 1 multiplied by any number gives that number. So, in this group, the identity should be 1.\n\nNow, I need to find an element in this group that, when multiplied by -i, gives me 1. So, I need to solve the equation: (-i) * x = 1, where x is one of {1, -1, i, -i}.\n\nLet me try each one:\n\nFirst, x = 1:\n\n(-i) * 1 = -i, which is not 1.\n\nSecond, x = -1:\n\n(-i) * (-1) = i, which is not 1.\n\nThird, x = i:\n\n(-i) * i = -i^2. I know that i^2 = -1, so -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nAh, so (-i) * i = 1.\n\nFourth, x = -i:\n\n(-i) * (-i) = i^2 = -1, which is not 1.\n\nSo, among these options, it seems that x = i is the inverse of -i because (-i) * i = 1.\n\nWait a minute, but I thought that in complex numbers, the inverse of -i is -i itself. Let me double-check that.\n\nIn complex numbers, multiplication is associative and commutative. So, the inverse of -i should satisfy (-i) * inverse = 1.\n\nLet me check if (-i) * (-i) = 1.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, (-i) * (-i) = i^2 = -1, which is not 1.\n\nThen, (-i) * i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1, which is indeed 1.\n\nSo, it seems that the inverse of -i is i.\n\nBut wait, I thought that in complex numbers, the inverse of -i is -i. Maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nLet me recall that in the set of complex numbers, the multiplicative inverse of -i is indeed i, because (-i) * i = 1, as shown.\n\nSo, in this group {1, -1, i, -i}, the inverse of -i is i.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D is -i, which seems incorrect based on my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try to verify again.\n\nCompute (-i) * (-i) = i^2 = -1 \u2260 1.\n\n(-i) * i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo, yes, the inverse is i.\n\nBut the answer options include -i, which might be a typo or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this specific group, the inverse is different.\n\nWait, but groups must satisfy the inverse property, and in this case, i is the inverse of -i.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. i.\n\nBut the question says \"the inverse of -i is D. -i\", which seems incorrect based on my calculations.\n\nMaybe there's a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group operation is different, but in standard multiplication of complex numbers, the inverse of -i is indeed i.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question to see if I notice that i is the inverse of -i.\n\nIn any case, based on my understanding, the inverse of -i in this group is i.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. i.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{i} \\]"
