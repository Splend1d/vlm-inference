                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which property I should measure to determine the sign of charge carriers in a doped semiconductor. The options are magnetic susceptibility, Hall coefficient, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity. I'm not super familiar with all of these, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that in semiconductors, doping is used to add extra charge carriers, which can be either electrons or holes, depending on the type of dopant. If it's n-type doping, it adds electrons, which are negative, and if it's p-type doping, it adds holes, which behave like positive charges. So, the sign of the charge carriers is either negative (electrons) or positive (holes).\n\nNow, I need to find out which of these properties can tell me about the sign of these charge carriers.\n\nLet's start with magnetic susceptibility. From what I recall, magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material is affected by an external magnetic field. It's related to diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism. In semiconductors, the magnetic susceptibility can be influenced by the electrons in the material. But does it tell us about the sign of the charge carriers? Hmm. I think that both electrons and holes contribute to the magnetic properties in their own ways, but I'm not sure if it directly gives the sign. Maybe not the best choice here.\n\nNext, Hall coefficient. I've heard of the Hall effect before. It's when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the flow of current in a conductor, and it causes a voltage to build up across the conductor. The Hall coefficient is related to this voltage and can be used to find out properties like the charge carrier concentration and their mobility. More importantly, the sign of the Hall coefficient depends on the sign of the charge carriers. So, if it's electrons (negative), the Hall coefficient will be one sign, and if it's holes (positive), it will be the opposite sign. This seems promising.\n\nElectrical resistivity is another property. Resistivity is a measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current. In semiconductors, resistivity changes with doping because more dopants mean more charge carriers, which should decrease resistivity. But does the sign of the charge carriers affect resistivity in a way that allows us to determine the sign? Not sure. I think both electrons and holes decrease resistivity when their concentration increases, but maybe there are differences in how they affect it. Still, I don't think resistivity directly tells us about the sign.\n\nLastly, thermal conductivity. This is how well a material conducts heat. In semiconductors, heat can be conducted by phonons (vibrations in the crystal lattice) and by charge carriers. So, doping can affect thermal conductivity because it introduces more charge carriers, which can carry heat. But again, does the sign of the charge carriers influence thermal conductivity in a distinguishable way? I don't think so. Heat is carried by the movement of particles regardless of their electric charge sign, so this might not be the best property to determine the sign of charge carriers.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Magnetic susceptibility: Related to magnetic properties, but not directly to the sign of charge carriers.\n\n- Hall coefficient: Directly related to the charge carriers' sign through the Hall effect.\n\n- Electrical resistivity: Affected by carrier concentration but not specifically by their sign.\n\n- Thermal conductivity: Affected by carrier concentration but not by their sign.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward property to measure to determine the sign of charge carriers in a doped semiconductor is the Hall coefficient.\n\nI think the answer is B. Hall coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
