Eighteenth century CE\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some basic information about Jainism. I know that Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and asceticism. Its followers are known as Jains, and they worship Tirthankaras, who are spiritual teachers.\n\nNow, I need to think about when these temples were first constructed. Temples are important places of worship for Jains, and they usually house statues of the Tirthankaras.\n\nLet me consider the history of Jainism. I believe that Jainism was founded by Mahavira, who was active around the 5th century BCE. He was the 24th Tirthankara, and his teachings formed the basis of Jain philosophy.\n\nIf Mahavira was living around the 5th century BCE, it makes sense that the earliest Jain temples would have been built after that time. So, option C is 5th century BCE, which seems possible.\n\nBut wait, option A is second century CE, which is also quite early. Maybe temples were built in that period as well.\n\nI should consider the archaeological evidence. Have any Jain temples been discovered that date back to the 5th century BCE?\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about it.\n\nI recall that the earliest known Jain texts, the Agamas, were likely composed orally and then written down much later, perhaps around the 5th century BCE or later. But that's about literature, not about temples.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the earliest known Jain images or sculptures. I think some Jain sculptures date back to around the 3rd century BCE, during the Mauryan period.\n\nFor example, there are Jain images found in the Barabar Caves, which were carved during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who lived around the 3rd century BCE. But were these caves temples, or just places where images were placed?\n\nWait, the Barabar Caves are more like rock-cut chambers, possibly used for meditation or as shelters for monks. So, maybe not full-fledged temples.\n\nPerhaps the earliest Jain temples were simple structures made of wood or mud, which wouldn't survive to this day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the earliest temples were built during the Gupta period, which was from the 4th to 6th centuries CE. That was a time of great cultural and religious flourishing in India, and many Hindu and Buddhist temples were constructed then. Maybe Jain temples were also built during that period.\n\nOption B is fifth century CE, which would align with the Gupta era.\n\nBut option A is second century CE, which is still quite early, but after the time of Mahavira.\n\nWait, the second century CE was during the Kushan Empire, which was known for its patronage of Buddhism and Hinduism. Maybe they also supported Jainism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the earliest Jain temples were built even earlier, in the 1st century BCE.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look at the construction techniques and styles of early Jain temples.\n\nI know that many Jain temples are famous for their architecture, such as the Dilwara Temples in Mount Abu, which are known for their intricate marble carvings. But I think those were built much later, around the 11th to 13th centuries CE.\n\nWhat about the Parsvanatha Temple in Khajuraho? That's another famous Jain temple, but I believe it was built in the 10th century CE.\n\nSo, those are more recent, not helping with the earliest temples.\n\nMaybe I should consider the types of materials used in early temples. If they were made of stone, they might have a better chance of surviving to this day. If they were made of perishable materials, they wouldn't last as long.\n\nBut even with stone temples, unless they're well-preserved or continuously maintained, they might not survive.\n\nPerhaps there are ruins of earlier Jain temples that have been discovered through archaeology.\n\nLet me try to recall if any Jain temples have been dated to the 5th century BCE.\n\nAfter some thought, I can't recall any specific examples of Jain temples from that early.\n\nMaybe the earliest Jain temples were built in the centuries following Mahavira's lifetime, say around the 4th or 3rd century BCE.\n\nBut again, I don't have any specific examples to support that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the earliest Jain temples were built during the Shunga or Satavahana periods, which were from the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.\n\nThat would place them in the second century CE, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm still considering option C, fifth century BCE, since that's when Mahavira lived.\n\nMaybe temples weren't constructed during his lifetime, but after his death, his followers started building places of worship.\n\nThat's possible.\n\nLet me consider the general practice in ancient India. It was common for religious structures to be built after the lifetime of a religion's founder.\n\nFor example, Buddha lived around the 5th century BCE, and the earliest Buddhist stupas and viharas were built in the 3rd century BCE during Ashoka's reign.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps Jain temples were built somewhat later than Mahavira's time.\n\nBut still, considering the importance of temples in Jainism, maybe they started building them sooner.\n\nI need to find some concrete evidence or examples of the earliest Jain temples and their construction dates.\n\nLet me think about the Kankali Tila in Mathura. I think there's a Jain temple there, but I'm not sure about its date.\n\nAlternatively, there are Jain caves in Ellora, which are rock-cut temples, but those are from the 8th century CE, I believe.\n\nThat's too late for this question.\n\nWhat about the Jain temples in Palitana, which are numerous and famous. But again, I think they were built much later, around the 12th century CE.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility that the earliest Jain temples were simple structures, like shrines, rather than large stone buildings.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps they were built soon after Mahavira's lifetime, say in the 5th or 4th century BCE.\n\nBut without any surviving examples, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the earliest Jain temples were wooden structures, which wouldn't have survived to this day.\n\nThat's another possibility.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the earliest references to Jain temples in literature or inscriptions.\n\nI recall that there are some inscriptions mentioning Jain temples being built in the 2nd century BCE, during the Shunga period.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A, second century CE, might be too late.\n\nWait, but option A is second century CE, not BCE.\n\nSo, if temples were being built in the 2nd century BCE, then that would be earlier than option A.\n\nBut option C is fifth century BCE, which is even earlier.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any specific dates from inscriptions or archaeological findings.\n\nI think there is an inscription from the 2nd century BCE mentioning the construction of a Jain temple.\n\nIf that's correct, then the first Jain temples must have been built around that time, or earlier.\n\nBut if that's the case, then option A, second century CE, would be incorrect.\n\nUnless the inscription is referring to a renovation or an expansion, not the original construction.\n\nThat's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the earliest temples were simple and not considered proper 'temples' by later standards.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI know that Jainism has two main sects: Digambaras and Svetambaras.\n\nMaybe one of these sects started building temples earlier than the other.\n\nBut I don't know much about the historical differences in their temple-building practices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the geographical spread of Jainism.\n\nJainism was primarily centered in India, especially in regions like Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Karnataka.\n\nMaybe I can think about the earliest temples in these regions.\n\nFor example, in Rajasthan, there are many ancient Jain temples, but I don't know their exact dates.\n\nSimilarly, in Karnataka, there are Jain basadis, which are temples, but again, their construction dates vary widely.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the earliest known Jain images.\n\nI recall that one of the earliest Jain images is a statue of Parsvanatha, which dates back to around the 3rd century BCE.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's possible that temples existed by then to house such images.\n\nBut again, I don't have confirmation that a temple was built at that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the images were placed in caves or other natural shelters.\n\nThat's possible.\n\nWait, there are Jain caves in Barabar and other places, which are from the 3rd century BCE.\n\nBut were these caves temples, or just places for meditation?\n\nI think they were more for meditation and shelter for monks, not necessarily places of worship with regular congregational gatherings.\n\nSo, perhaps the earliest Jain temples were built later, when there was a need for larger structures to accommodate worshippers.\n\nThat might place them in the 2nd or 1st century BCE.\n\nBut that's still earlier than option A, second century CE.\n\nOption B is fifth century CE, which is even later.\n\nOption D is eighteenth century CE, which is way too late, as Jainism has a long history before that.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, option C seems the least likely because Mahavira lived around the 5th century BCE, and it's unlikely that temples were built during his lifetime.\n\nBut maybe they were built soon after his death, say in the 4th century BCE.\n\nStill, that's earlier than option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the earliest Jain temples were built in the 3rd century BCE, around the time of Ashoka.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the first Jain temples were built in the 2nd century BCE, during the Shunga period, which was a time of active temple construction in India.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A, second century CE, would be incorrect.\n\nUnless, of course, the earliest temples were built earlier, but the ones that survive are from the 2nd century CE.\n\nThat's possible, as many ancient structures have been lost over time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the earliest known Jain temples are from the 2nd century CE.\n\nBut I need to verify this.\n\nLet me think about the Parsvanatha Temple in Shravanabelagola, which is famous for its giant statue of Bahubali.\n\nI think that temple was built much later, around the 12th century CE.\n\nNot helpful for this question.\n\nWhat about the Jain temples in Mathura?\n\nI think there are some ancient Jain temples there, but again, their exact dates are unclear.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the earliest Jain temples were built in the 2nd century BCE, and that option A, second century CE, is incorrect.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the earliest Jain temples were built in the 1st century BCE, which is still earlier than option A.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look at the general timeline of temple construction in India.\n\nHindu temples started being built around the 2nd century BCE, with the earliest examples being rock-cut caves and later free-standing structures.\n\nSimilarly, Buddhist stupas and viharas were built around the 3rd century BCE.\n\nSo, if Jain temples were being built around the same time, that would place them in the 2nd or 1st century BCE.\n\nAgain, that's earlier than option A, second century CE.\n\nOption B is fifth century CE, which is even later.\n\nOption C is fifth century BCE, which is when Mahavira lived.\n\nOption D is eighteenth century CE, which is too recent.\n\nSo, between A, B, and C, option C seems too early, as temples likely weren't built during Mahavira's lifetime.\n\nOption A is second century CE, which might be possible, but I have a feeling that earlier temples were built.\n\nOption B is fifth century CE, which is also possible, but that was during the Gupta period, when many temples were built.\n\nBut were the earliest Jain temples built that late?\n\nI'm still inclined to think that the earliest Jain temples were built earlier, perhaps in the 2nd or 1st century BCE.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong.\n\nLet me consider that perhaps the earliest Jain temples were simple wooden structures, which didn't survive, and the earliest stone temples were built in the 2nd century CE.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A could be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the earliest stone temples were built in the 1st century CE, and the second century CE saw a proliferation of temple construction.\n\nI need to find a reliable source to confirm this.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to reference materials right now.\n\nGiven the information I have, I think the earliest Jain temples were built in the 2nd century BCE, not in the 2nd century CE.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B, fifth century CE, seems too late, as by then, many temples would have already been built.\n\nOption C, fifth century BCE, is too early, as that's when Mahavira lived, and it's unlikely that temples were built during his lifetime.\n\nOption D, eighteenth century CE, is definitely too recent.\n\nSo, between A and B, I think A is closer to the correct answer, even though I initially thought it was too late.\n\nPerhaps the earliest Jain temples were built in the 2nd century CE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the correct answer is B, fifth century CE, during the Gupta period.\n\nBut I have a feeling that temples were built earlier than that.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option A, second century CE, as the time when the first Jain temples appeared.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
