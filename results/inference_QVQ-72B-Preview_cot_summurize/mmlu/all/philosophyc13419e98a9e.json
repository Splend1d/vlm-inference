                    "text": "So I have this question here about a type of argument where you assume something is true, but then you deduce something false or absurd from it, which means the original assumption must be false. The options are modus tollens, modus ponens, hypothetical syllogism, and reductio ad absurdum.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my logical argument forms, but I remember that modus ponens and modus tollens are related to implications.\n\nModus ponens is like: if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. So, it's a way to establish Q by confirming P.\n\nModus tollens is the opposite: if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. So, it's a way to disprove P by disproving Q.\n\nHypothetical syllogism seems to involve chaining implications: if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R. It's about linking causes and effects in a chain.\n\nReductio ad absurdum, which I've heard of, is a proof technique where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and show that this leads to a contradiction or an absurd conclusion, thereby proving the original statement.\n\nNow, the question is describing a scenario where assuming a set of statements leads to a false or absurd conclusion, thereby proving that the original set of statements is false. This sounds a lot like reductio ad absurdum.\n\nLet me double-check this. In reductio ad absurdum, you assume the negation of what you want to prove (or something based on it), and then you show that this assumption leads to something impossible or contradictory. Since that's not acceptable, the original assumption must be wrong, and thus the opposite (what you set out to prove) must be true.\n\nIn the context of the question, assuming a set of statements leads to a false conclusion, which implies that the set of statements themselves must be false. This seems consistent with the reductio ad absurdum approach.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options fit this description.\n\nModus ponens is about confirming Q by confirming P in an implication P\u2192Q. That's not quite what the question is describing.\n\nModus tollens is about disproving P by disproving Q in the same implication. Again, that doesn't seem to match the scenario where assuming a set of statements leads to a false conclusion.\n\nHypothetical syllogism is about linking multiple implications. It doesn't directly relate to assuming something leads to a false conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice seems to be reductio ad absurdum.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose I want to prove that if n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\n\nTo use reductio ad absurdum, I could assume that n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd, and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince n is odd, I can write n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. But this contradicts the assumption that n\u00b2 is even. Therefore, if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even.\n\nIn this case, assuming that n is odd when n\u00b2 is even leads to a false conclusion (that n\u00b2 is odd when it's supposed to be even), thereby proving that the assumption is false, and hence n must be even.\n\nThis perfectly matches the description in the question: assuming a set of statements (here, that n is odd and n\u00b2 is even) leads to a false conclusion (n\u00b2 being both even and odd), thereby proving the original set of statements is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be reductio ad absurdum.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. reductio ad absurdum}} \\]"
