                    "text": "So Veronica has this 400-page novel she wants to read, and she wants to figure out how long it's going to take her. She knows she reads 250 words per minute, and she estimated that there are about 200 words on each page. Okay, let's see how we can put this information together.\n\nFirst, she has 400 pages, and each page has about 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book would be 400 times 200, right? Let me calculate that: 400 times 200 is 80,000 words. So, the book has approximately 80,000 words.\n\nNow, Veronica reads at a speed of 250 words per minute. So, if the book has 80,000 words, and she reads 250 words each minute, the total time she'll need is 80,000 divided by 250 minutes.\n\nLet me do that division: 80,000 divided by 250. Well, 250 times 320 is 80,000. So, it should take her 320 minutes to read the entire book.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the time to the nearest minute, and the options are A. 225, B. 320, C. 400, D. 450. So, among these, 320 is one of the options. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the total words: 400 pages times 200 words per page is indeed 80,000 words.\n\nThen, reading speed is 250 words per minute, so time equals total words divided by words per minute, which is 80,000 divided by 250.\n\nLet me verify the division again: 80,000 divided by 250.\n\nWell, 250 times 320 is 80,000, so yes, 320 minutes.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor to consider, like maybe the time it takes to turn pages or something, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think we can assume that the only time spent is the time reading the words.\n\nAlso, the problem states that she reads 250 words per minute, and each page has approximately 200 words. So, my calculation seems straightforward.\n\nLet me see if perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe using estimation in a different way.\n\nIf she reads 250 words per minute, and there are 200 words per page, then per minute, she reads 200 divided by 250 pages, which is 0.8 pages per minute. So, to read 1 page, it takes her 1 divided by 0.8, which is 1.25 minutes per page.\n\nThen, for 400 pages, it would be 400 times 1.25 minutes, which is 500 minutes. But that's not matching my previous calculation of 320 minutes. Hmm, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the ratios. Let's try again.\n\nIf she reads 250 words per minute, and each page has 200 words, then the time to read one page is 200 words divided by 250 words per minute, which is 200/250 minutes per page.\n\nSimplifying that, 200 divided by 250 is the same as 4/5, which is 0.8 minutes per page.\n\nThen, for 400 pages, it would be 400 times 0.8, which is 320 minutes. Okay, this matches my first calculation.\n\nI think the confusion came when I tried to do it the other way around, calculating pages per minute and then total pages. Let me see why that didn't work.\n\nIf she reads 250 words per minute, and each page has 200 words, then per minute, she reads 200/250 pages, which is 0.8 pages per minute, as I calculated before. Then, for 400 pages, it's 400 divided by 0.8, which is indeed 500 minutes. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nHold on, I think I mixed up the divisor. It should be 400 pages times (1 / 0.8 minutes per page), which is 400 divided by (1 / 0.8), which is 400 divided by 1.25, which is 320 minutes. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nI must have miswritten it earlier. So, both methods lead to the same conclusion: 320 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 320 minutes.\n\nJust to make sure, let's look back at the problem. Veronica has a 400-page novel, with approximately 200 words per page, and she reads at 250 words per minute. We calculated total words as 400 * 200 = 80,000 words, and time as 80,000 / 250 = 320 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, time per page is 200 words / 250 words per minute = 0.8 minutes per page, and 400 pages * 0.8 minutes per page = 320 minutes.\n\nYes, I'm confident that 320 minutes is the correct answer to the nearest minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{320} \\]"
