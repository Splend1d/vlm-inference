                    "text": "So I've got this poem here about Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. It's pretty intense, talking about people getting shot, especially mentioning a mother and her child. The poem seems to be highlighting the brutality of that event. Now, the question is asking about the discriminatory system referred to in the poem, and the options are Jim Crow, spheres of influence, Boer division, or apartheid.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand what happened in Sharpeville in 1960. From the poem, it mentions that black South Africans gathered to protest against having to carry papers that documented their identity and residence. This sounds like it's related to apartheid, which I know was a system of racial segregation in South Africa. Under apartheid, black South Africans were subjected to various restrictions, including having to carry passes or documents to prove their right to be in certain areas.\n\nThe poem says that in Sharpeville, the protest ended violently, with police firing into the crowd, killing many people. Specifically, it mentions that seventy people died, and that they were shot in the back while retreating, unarmed and defenseless. It also describes a bullet tearing through a mother's back and killing her child, which is incredibly poignant and emphasizes the innocence of the victims.\n\nGiven that this event took place in South Africa in 1960, and considering the context provided, it's clear that the discriminatory system being referred to is apartheid. Let me just double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A is Jim Crow. I know that Jim Crow laws were a system of racial segregation in the Southern United States after the Civil War. They enforced racial hierarchies by separating whites and blacks in public places, schools, and other areas. While similar in nature to apartheid, Jim Crow was an American phenomenon, not South African.\n\nOption B is spheres of influence. This term usually refers to geographical areas where one country dominates the economic or political sphere, often seen in colonial contexts. While related to imperialist policies, it's not specifically about racial segregation or the apartheid system in South Africa.\n\nOption C is Boer division. The Boers were Dutch-speaking settlers in South Africa, and they played a significant role in the country's history, including the Anglo-Boer Wars. However, \"Boer division\" isn't a term I'm familiar with in the context of South African segregation policies. It might be a reference to the divide between Boers and other groups, but it's not the formal name for the apartheid system.\n\nOption D is apartheid, which aligns perfectly with the context provided in the poem. Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It enforced segregation between whites, blacks, and people of mixed race, and severely limited the rights and opportunities of non-white South Africans.\n\nConsidering the details in the poem, such as the requirement for black South Africans to carry identity and residence papers, the protest in Sharpeville, and the violent response by the police, it's evident that the discriminatory system being referred to is apartheid.\n\nJust to provide a bit more context, the Sharpeville Massacre was a significant event in the anti-apartheid movement. It led to the banning of anti-apartheid organizations like the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and marked a turning point in the struggle against apartheid, ultimately contributing to its eventual dismantling.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the discriminatory system referred to in the poem is apartheid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. apartheid}} \\]"
