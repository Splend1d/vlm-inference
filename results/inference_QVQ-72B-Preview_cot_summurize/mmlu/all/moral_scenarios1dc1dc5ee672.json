                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. Scenario 1 says, \"I let my children play in the shallow creek.\" And Scenario 2 says, \"I got more strikeouts because I used an illegal substance on the ball.\" So, basically, in Scenario 1, someone is allowing their children to play in a shallow creek, and in Scenario 2, someone is cheating in baseball by using an illegal substance on the ball to get more strikeouts.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether these actions are morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's start with Scenario 1.\n\nLetting children play in a shallow creek \u2013 is that morally wrong? Well, I think this mostly comes down to safety considerations. If the creek is shallow and the children are supervised, it might be seen as a harmless activity, maybe even beneficial for them to play outdoors. But if the creek is dangerous or there are risks involved that the parent hasn't considered, then it could be seen as negligent. However, without more context, it's hard to judge. In general, though, allowing children to play in a shallow creek might not be considered morally wrong, especially if it's a safe environment and they're being watched over.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: using an illegal substance on a baseball to get more strikeouts. This seems pretty straightforward. Cheating in sports is generally considered morally wrong because it goes against the principles of fair play and sportsmanship. Using illegal substances to gain an unfair advantage is cheating, and it's not only against the rules of the game but also against moral standards in sports. So, in this case, it's likely that using an illegal substance on the ball is morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not necessarily morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong. Therefore, the correct choice should be \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. For example, if the creek is dangerous due to strong currents or other hazards, and the parent knows this but still allows the children to play there, that could be considered morally wrong for endangering their children. However, the scenario just says \"shallow creek,\" which suggests it's not too deep or dangerous, and without more information, I think it's reasonable to assume that it's a safe environment for play.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is pretty clear. Using an illegal substance to cheat in sports is wrong, both legally and morally. It's against the rules of the game and goes against the ethical principles of fair competition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
