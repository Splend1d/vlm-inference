Hmm, I need to figure out which one focuses on our closest living relatives.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these subfields is about. Starting with paleoanthropology \u2013 I think that's about studying ancient humans and their ancestors, right? Like fossils and stuff from the past. So, it's more about extinct species rather than living relatives. Maybe not the best choice here.\n\nNext, archaeology. That seems to be about digging up and studying artifacts from past human civilizations. It's more about human culture and history, not specifically about our closest living relatives, which are other primates. So, probably not B.\n\nThen there's primatology. Now, this sounds promising. Primatology is the study of primates, which include monkeys, apes, and humans. Our nearest living relatives are other primates, especially the great apes like chimpanzees and gorillas. So, primatology would likely be the field that focuses on understanding them.\n\nLastly, linguistics. That's the study of language, right? It deals with how humans communicate and the structure of languages. While language is a part of human culture and cognition, it's not directly aimed at understanding our living relatives in the animal kingdom.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like primatology is the subfield that specifically aims to better understand our nearest living relatives, which are other primates.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the main objectives of each field.\n\nPaleoanthropology is indeed concerned with the origin and evolution of humans, often through fossil records. It does look at our extinct ancestors and relatives, but not the living ones.\n\nArchaeology is focused on human history and culture through material remains. Again, it's about past humans and their societies, not about other primates.\n\nLinguistics is all about language structure, meaning, and use. While it's fascinating, it doesn't directly relate to studying our living primate relatives.\n\nPrimatology, on the other hand, is dedicated to the study of primates, including their behavior, ecology, and evolution. This would definitely include our closest living relatives, such as chimpanzees and bonobos.\n\nMoreover, primatologists often conduct fieldwork in natural habitats to observe and understand primate behavior and social structures. This kind of research helps us learn more about our own evolutionary history and the characteristics we share with these animals.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the subfield of anthropology that aims to better understand the nearest living relatives of humans is primatology. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. primatology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. primatology}} \\]"
