I remember that Richard Nixon was the 37th President of the United States, but I don't recall his middle name off the top of my head. Maybe I can eliminate some options that don't sound right.\n\nFirst, option A is Michael. I know some presidents had common middle names like John or James, but I don't think Michael was Nixon's middle name. Maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't ring a bell.\n\nOption B is Milhous. That sounds unusual. I've heard of surnames like Milhouse, but is that his middle name? It seems peculiar, but sometimes presidents have unique middle names.\n\nOption C is Mortimer. That also sounds like a last name or maybe a character from a play or something. I don't think that's his middle name.\n\nOption D is Matthew. Again, similar to Michael, it's a common name, but I don't associate it with Nixon.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can recall his full name. I think his full name is Richard Milhous Nixon. Yeah, that rings a bell now that I think about it. So, that would make his middle name Milhous, which is option B.\n\nWait, but is that right? Maybe I'm confusing it with someone else. Let me double-check. I recall that Nixon's father had a middle name, and I think it was Milhous as well. Maybe it was passed down through the family.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Milhous was his mother's maiden name or something. I'm not entirely sure, but I do remember that his middle name was Milhous.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any significance to the name Milhous. It might have been a family name or perhaps had some personal importance to his parents.\n\nI don't think Michael, Mortimer, or Matthew are his middle names, based on what I know. So, I'm leaning towards Milhous.\n\nMaybe I can try to recall if there's any famous person with the name Milhous, but I can't think of any off the top of my head. It seems like a unique name, which makes me think it's less common and therefore more likely to be memorable if it's associated with someone famous.\n\nIn any case, I'm pretty confident that Richard Nixon's middle name is Milhous. So, the correct answer should be B. Milhous.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll double-check my memory. Richard Milhous Nixon\u2014that sounds familiar. Yes, that's it. So, the answer is B. Milhous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\text{ Milhous}} \\]"
