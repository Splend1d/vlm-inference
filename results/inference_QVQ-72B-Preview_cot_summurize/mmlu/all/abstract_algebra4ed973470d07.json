                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about permutations and permutation groups, specifically the symmetric groups S_n. Let's tackle each statement one at a time.\n\nFirst statement: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what S_n is and what it means for a group to be non-Abelian. S_n is the symmetric group on n elements, which consists of all possible permutations of n distinct objects. The group operation is the composition of permutations.\n\nNow, a group is Abelian if the group operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a. If this doesn't hold for some pair of elements, then the group is non-Abelian.\n\nSo, the statement is claiming that for n greater than or equal to 3, S_n is non-Abelian. I know that S_1 is trivial, and S_2, which has only two elements, is Abelian. But what about n >= 3?\n\nLet me think about S_3, which is the smallest symmetric group where n >= 3. It has 6 elements, and I can list them: the identity, (12), (13), (23), (123), and (132). If I can show that S_3 is non-Abelian, that would be a start.\n\nLet's take two permutations in S_3 and see if their composition is commutative. Take (12) and (13). Let's compute (12)(13) and (13)(12).\n\n(12)(13):\n\n- Apply (13) first: 1 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1, 2 stays.\n\n- Then apply (12): 3 stays, 1 goes to 2, 2 stays.\n\nSo, overall, 1 goes to 2, 2 stays, 3 stays. That's (123).\n\nNow, (13)(12):\n\n- Apply (12) first: 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1, 3 stays.\n\n- Then apply (13): 2 stays, 1 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1.\n\nSo, overall, 1 goes to 3, 2 stays, 3 goes to 1. That's (132).\n\nClearly, (123) is not the same as (132), so (12)(13) \u2260 (13)(12). Therefore, S_3 is non-Abelian.\n\nBut the statement says \"for all n >= 3.\" So, I need to think about whether this property holds for all n greater than or equal to 3, not just n=3.\n\nI recall that S_n contains S_{n-1} as a subgroup. Specifically, any permutation in S_{n-1} can be embedded in S_n by fixing the nth element. So, if S_3 is non-Abelian and S_n contains S_3 as a subgroup, then S_n must also be non-Abelian because it contains a non-Abelian subgroup.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about specific permutations in S_n that don't commute. For example, in S_n, take any two transpositions, like (12) and (13), which we've already seen don't commute in S_3, and since S_n contains S_3, they won't commute in S_n either.\n\nWait, but is that always true? What if n > 3 and I take transpositions that do commute? For example, in S_4, (12) and (34) do commute because they don't share any elements, so (12)(34) = (34)(12). But that doesn't contradict the non-Abelian nature of the group; it just means that some pairs of elements commute, but not all.\n\nTo show that S_n is non-Abelian for n >= 3, I just need to find at least one pair of elements that don't commute, and I've already done that with (12) and (13) in S_3, and by extension in S_n for n > 3.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is true.\n\nNow, onto the second statement: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n).\n\nHmm, this is about the order of the product of two permutations, each of which is a cycle of lengths m and n, respectively. The order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nBut here, a and b are not necessarily disjoint. In fact, they could overlap or interact in some way, which would affect the order of their product.\n\nLet me consider some examples to test this statement.\n\nFirst, take m=1 and n=1. Wait, a 1-cycle is just the identity permutation, which doesn't make much sense, so maybe we should consider m and n at least 2.\n\nLet's take m=2 and n=2. So, a is a 2-cycle, say (12), and b is a 2-cycle, say (34). Assuming these cycles are disjoint, their product (12)(34) is also a permutation that is a product of two disjoint 2-cycles, so its order should be lcm(2,2)=2.\n\nIndeed, (12)(34) squared is (12)(34)(12)(34) = (12)(12)(34)(34) = identity, so the order is 2.\n\nAnother example: m=2 and n=3. Let's take a=(12) and b=(132). Then ab=(12)(132)=(132)(12)=... Wait, I need to be careful with the composition.\n\nActually, composition of permutations is not commutative, as we've seen. But in this case, I'm computing ab, where a=(12) and b=(132).\n\nLet's compute ab:\n\nApply b first: (132), then a: (12).\n\nSo, 1 goes to 3 via b, then 3 stays via a, so 1 goes to 3.\n\n2 goes to 1 via b, then 1 goes to 2 via a, so 2 goes to 2.\n\n3 goes to 2 via b, then 2 goes to 1 via a, so 3 goes to 1.\n\nSo, ab=(13)(22), but 2 goes to itself, so it's just (13). Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, in permutation composition, applying (132) first, then (12):\n\n- Start with 1: b maps 1 to 3, a maps 3 to 3, so 1 goes to 3.\n\n- 2: b maps 2 to 1, a maps 1 to 2, so 2 goes to 2.\n\n- 3: b maps 3 to 2, a maps 2 to 2, so 3 goes to 2.\n\nSo, overall, ab=(13)(22)=(13)(2), but since 2 goes to itself, it's just (13).\n\nSo, ab=(13), which is a 2-cycle, so its order is 2, but lcm(2,3)=6, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in computing ab.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nCompute ab=(12)(132):\n\n- Apply (132) first:\n\n  - 1 -> 3\n\n  - 2 -> 1\n\n  - 3 -> 2\n\n- Then apply (12):\n\n  - 1 -> 2\n\n  - 2 -> 1\n\n  - 3 -> 3\n\nSo, overall:\n\n- 1 -> 3 -> 3\n\n- 2 -> 1 -> 2\n\n- 3 -> 2 -> 2\n\nWait, that seems the same as before: ab=(13)(22)=(13)(2), which is (13).\n\nBut (13) is a 2-cycle, so its order is 2, but lcm(2,3)=6. So, in this case, |ab|=2 \u2260 lcm(2,3)=6.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false in this case.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that a and b are disjoint cycles. Let's try that.\n\nTake a=(12) and b=(34), which are disjoint 2-cycles. Then ab=(12)(34)=(12)(34), which is a product of two disjoint 2-cycles, so its order is lcm(2,2)=2, which matches.\n\nAnother example: a=(123) and b=(456), both 3-cycles. Then ab=(123)(456), which is a product of two disjoint 3-cycles, so its order should be lcm(3,3)=3.\n\nIndeed, (123)(456) cubed is (123)^3 (456)^3 = identity * identity = identity, so order is 3.\n\nBut in the previous example with a=(12) and b=(132), which are not disjoint, |ab|=2 \u2260 lcm(2,3)=6.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false in general unless a and b are disjoint cycles.\n\nBut the statement doesn't specify that a and b are disjoint, so it's false as stated.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
