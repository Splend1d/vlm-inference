                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them involves doing something that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I picked up my mom from the doctor's five minutes early.\"\n\nHmm, picking someone up early... Generally, picking someone up early isn't considered wrong, right? Maybe it's considerate, showing that you care enough to be there ahead of time. Unless there's some context I'm missing, like maybe the doctor said not to come early for some reason, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So, in this case, picking up mom five minutes early seems fine to me.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I watched the nurse grab a box of medication and put them in her purse at work.\"\n\nThis one sounds more serious. Grabbing medication from work and putting it in her purse... That sounds like theft. Medication is property of the workplace or patients, and taking it without permission is stealing. Stealing is generally considered morally wrong across cultures and time periods, including the US in 2020.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the nurse had permission to take the medication for some reason, like personal use with a prescription or something. But the scenario says \"grab a box of medication and put them in her purse,\" which implies she's taking it without authorization.\n\nStill, I should consider if there's any possible justification. For example, maybe the medication was going to be discarded and she was taking it home for personal use or for a family member who needed it. Even then, in most healthcare settings, there are strict protocols about dispensing medication, and taking it without proper documentation could be against the law and ethical standards.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the second scenario involves an action that's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Picking up mom early \u2013 seems not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Nurse taking medication \u2013 seems wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the first scenario.\n\nIs there any way that picking someone up five minutes early could be considered morally wrong? Well, perhaps if the person being picked up specifically asked not to be early due to an appointment or something, but again, the scenario doesn't mention that. So, based on the information given, it's still not wrong.\n\nAnd in the second scenario, taking medication without permission is indeed wrong, both legally and morally.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
