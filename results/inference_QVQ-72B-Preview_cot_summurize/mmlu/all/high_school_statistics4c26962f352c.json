                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about football players' weights. It says that the average weight is 248 pounds with a standard deviation of 47 pounds. I need to find the standard deviation of the total combined weight of four players selected at random. The expected value of the total weight W is given as 992 pounds, which makes sense because 4 times 248 is 992.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the standard deviation of the sum of weights of four independent players. I recall that for independent random variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their individual variances. So, if each player's weight is a random variable with a variance of 47^2, then the variance of the total weight W would be 4 times that.\n\nLet me calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the variance of a single player's weight:\n\nVariance (\u03c3\u00b2) = (standard deviation)^2 = 47^2 = 2209 pounds squared.\n\nSince there are four players, and assuming they are independent, the variance of their total weight W is:\n\nV(W) = V(X1 + X2 + X3 + X4) = V(X1) + V(X2) + V(X3) + V(X4) = 4 * 2209 = 8836 pounds squared.\n\nNow, the standard deviation of W is the square root of its variance:\n\n\u03c3_W = \u221a8836 \u2248 94 pounds.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 47 pounds\n\nB. 67 pounds\n\nC. 94 pounds\n\nD. 141 pounds\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other factor I should consider? For example, since the players are selected at random, is there any dependency or correlation between their weights that I need to account for? The problem states that they are selected at random, so I think it's safe to assume independence.\n\nAlso, sometimes in statistics, especially with large numbers, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, but here we're dealing with a small sample size of four, and we're asked to find the standard deviation, not necessarily the distribution.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nVariance of a single player: \u03c3\u00b2 = 47^2 = 2209.\n\nTotal variance for four players: V(W) = 4 * 2209 = 8836.\n\nStandard deviation: \u221a8836 \u2248 94 pounds.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the standard deviation of the sum being the standard deviation of one player multiplied by the square root of the number of players.\n\nSo, \u03c3_W = \u03c3 * \u221an = 47 * \u221a4 = 47 * 2 = 94 pounds.\n\nThat matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 94 pounds.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other statistical principle that might apply here. Since the problem specifies that the players are selected at random and doesn't provide any information suggesting dependence between their weights, I don't think I need to adjust for correlation.\n\nMoreover, the expected value is given as 992 pounds, which aligns with the calculation of the mean of the sum of four independent variables, each with mean 248 pounds.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 94 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
