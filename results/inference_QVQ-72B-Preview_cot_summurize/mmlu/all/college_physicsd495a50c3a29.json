                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle moving through a magnetic field, and I need to find its mass based on some given parameters. Let's see, I know that in a uniform magnetic field, a charged particle moves in a circular path if the field is perpendicular to its velocity. The frequency of this motion is called the cyclotron frequency, and there's a formula for that which involves the charge of the particle, the mass, and the magnetic field strength.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the expression for the cyclotron frequency. I think it's given by:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi m}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) is the cyclotron frequency,\n\n- \\(q\\) is the charge of the particle,\n\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength,\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nOkay, so if I rearrange this formula to solve for the mass, I get:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi f}\\]\n\nAlright, I have values for \\(q\\), \\(B\\), and \\(f\\), so I can plug them in to find \\(m\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n- Charge of the particle: twice that of an electron. The charge of an electron is \\(1.60 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C, so the particle's charge is \\(2 \\times 1.60 \\times 10^{-19} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C.\n\n- Magnetic field strength: \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) Tesla.\n\n- Cyclotron frequency: 1,600 Hz.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says the charge is twice that of an electron, but I should confirm if that's 2 times the elementary charge or if there's any other consideration. But assuming it's just twice the electron's charge, which is positive or negative, depending on the particle, but for this problem, the sign probably doesn't matter since we're dealing with magnitude.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{(3.20 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\ \\text{T}\\right)}{2\\pi \\times 1600\\ \\text{Hz}}\\]\n\nHmm, let's simplify this expression. First, I can cancel out some terms.\n\nNotice that \\(\\pi\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator. So, \\(\\pi\\) in the numerator from the magnetic field and \\(2\\pi\\) in the denominator from the frequency formula.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and the \\(\\pi\\) in the numerator is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), so that's \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times \\(\\pi\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should write it step by step.\n\nFirst, rewrite the expression:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi f}\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{(3.20 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\ \\text{T}\\right)}{2\\pi \\times 1600\\ \\text{Hz}}\\]\n\nNow, let's combine the numerical values first, ignoring the units for a moment:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\pi / 4}{2\\pi \\times 1600}\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 0.785398... = 2.51327 \\times 10^{-19}\\]\n\nWait, but \\(\\pi / 4\\) is approximately 0.785398, but it's better to keep it as \\(\\pi / 4\\) for exactness.\n\nSo, numerator is \\(3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\pi / 4\\).\n\nDenominator is \\(2\\pi \\times 1600\\).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\pi / 4}{2\\pi \\times 1600}\\]\n\nNow, notice that \\(\\pi\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{1}{4}}{2 \\times 1600}\\]\n\nSimplify \\(3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-19}\\)\n\nWait, \\(3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 0.25 = 0.80 \\times 10^{-19}\\)\n\nSo now:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{0.80 \\times 10^{-19}}{2 \\times 1600}\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{0.80 \\times 10^{-19}}{3200}\\]\n\nNow, dividing numerator by denominator:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{0.80}{3200} \\times 10^{-19}\\]\n\n\\[m = 0.00025 \\times 10^{-19}\\ kg\\]\n\n\\[m = 2.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\ kg\\]\n\nSo, that matches option A. 2.5 * 10^-23 kg.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{qB}{2\\pi f}\\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{(3.20 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\ \\text{T}\\right)}{2\\pi \\times 1600\\ \\text{Hz}}\\]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\[3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 3.20 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 0.785398... = 2.51327 \\times 10^{-19}\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[2\\pi \\times 1600 = 2 \\times 3.14159 \\times 1600 = 10053.096\\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{2.51327 \\times 10^{-19}}{10053.096} \\approx 2.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\ kg\\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the answer should be A. 2.5 * 10^-23 kg.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem or if there's any additional detail I might have missed.\n\nThe problem mentions that the particle is nonrelativistic, which is important because if it were relativistic, the mass might not be constant due to velocity effects. But since it's nonrelativistic, I can assume that the mass is constant and the standard formula for cyclotron frequency applies.\n\nAlso, it's specified that the magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular to the velocity of the particle, which is exactly the scenario needed for the particle to move in a circular path with cyclotron frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 2.5 * 10^-23 kg, which matches my calculation. Option B is 1.2 * 10^-22 kg, which is roughly double of A, and options C and D are larger, so unless I made a mistake, A seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The key was recalling the formula for cyclotron frequency and plugging in the given values, then simplifying the expression carefully to find the mass.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{kg}} \\]"
