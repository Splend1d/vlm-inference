                    "text": "So I have this question about DNA sequences. It says that a DNA strand has the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, and I need to find out which of the given options is complementary to this sequence. The options are:\n\nA. 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032\n\nB. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\n\nC. 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032\n\nD. 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how DNA complementarity works. I recall that in DNA, the nucleotides pair up in a specific way: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This is called base pairing, and it's crucial for DNA replication and transcription.\n\nSo, given a DNA strand, its complementary strand can be determined by replacing each nucleotide with its pair. For example, wherever there's a C, it should be matched with a G, and wherever there's a T, it should be matched with an A.\n\nLet me look at the given sequence: 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032.\n\nStarting from the 5\u2032 end:\n\n- The first nucleotide is C, which should pair with G.\n\n- The second nucleotide is G, which should pair with C.\n\n- The third nucleotide is A, which should pair with T.\n\n- The fourth nucleotide is T, which should pair with A.\n\n- The fifth nucleotide is T, which should pair with A.\n\n- The sixth nucleotide is G, which should pair with C.\n\nSo, if I write this out:\n\nGiven strand: 5\u2032 C G A T T G 3\u2032\n\nComplementary strand: 3\u2032 G C T A A C 5\u2032\n\nWait a minute, but the options are all given in 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation. So, to compare them correctly, I should reverse the complementary strand to read from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032.\n\nReversing 3\u2032 G C T A A C 5\u2032 gives me 5\u2032 C A A T C G 3\u2032.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option D.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the base pairing:\n\n- C pairs with G\n\n- G pairs with C\n\n- A pairs with T\n\n- T pairs with A\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the orientation. The original strand is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, and its complement should be 3\u2032 GCT AAC 5\u2032. To write it in the same 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction as the original, I need to reverse the complement to get 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might get confused about the directionality and just write the complement without reversing.\n\nBut in this case, the question specifically asks for the complementary sequence, but doesn't specify the direction. However, standard practice is to write DNA sequences from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, so matching the direction of the original sequence makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the complement is on the same strand or the opposite strand. In DNA, each strand has a complementary sequence on the opposite strand.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the complement of 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 should be 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032 when written in the same 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.\n\nLet me check the other options to see if any of them could possibly match.\n\nOption A: 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032\n\nThis seems to be the direct complement without reversing, so it doesn't match.\n\nOption B: 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\n\nThis also appears to be a variation of the direct complement, but with a different sequence. Specifically, it has T instead of C in one position, which doesn't match the expected pairing.\n\nOption C: 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032\n\nThis doesn't seem to follow the base pairing rules at all.\n\nOption D: 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032\n\nThis matches the expected complement when considering the correct base pairing and directionality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\nIs there a possibility that the question is referring to RNA complementarity? No, because it's about DNA strands. In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine (T), but here it's DNA, so T is appropriate.\n\nAlso, sometimes people might consider the antiparallel nature of DNA strands and get confused about the reading direction, but I think I've handled that correctly by reversing the complement to match the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction of the original strand.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'm confident that the correct answer is option D: 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
