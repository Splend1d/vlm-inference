                    "text": "So I have this problem about radioactive decay. There's an isotope with a half-life of 6 hours, and it has an initial activity of 150 mCi when it's delivered to a hospital. I need to find out how much activity will remain after 24 hours. The options are 150 mCi, 38 mCi, 19 mCi, and 9.4 mCi.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what half-life means. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay. So, every 6 hours, the activity of this isotope is reduced by half.\n\nThe initial activity is 150 mCi, and the half-life is 6 hours. The time in question is 24 hours, which is 4 half-lives because 24 divided by 6 is 4.\n\nSo, after each 6-hour period, the activity is halved. Let's go step by step.\n\nAfter 6 hours: 150 mCi \u2192 150 / 2 = 75 mCi\n\nAfter 12 hours: 75 mCi \u2192 75 / 2 = 37.5 mCi\n\nAfter 18 hours: 37.5 mCi \u2192 37.5 / 2 = 18.75 mCi\n\nAfter 24 hours: 18.75 mCi \u2192 18.75 / 2 = 9.375 mCi\n\nSo, the activity should be 9.375 mCi after 24 hours. Looking at the options, 9.4 mCi is the closest.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should use the formula for radioactive decay to confirm this.\n\nThe formula for activity after time t is:\n\nA(t) = A\u2080 * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- A(t) is the activity at time t\n\n- A\u2080 is the initial activity\n\n- t is the time elapsed\n\n- T is the half-life\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA(t) = 150 * (1/2)^(24/6)\n\nA(t) = 150 * (1/2)^4\n\nA(t) = 150 * (1/16)\n\nA(t) = 150 / 16\n\nA(t) = 9.375 mCi\n\nSo, this confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9.4 mCi.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"mCi = microcuries,\" but I think it might be a typo because mCi usually stands for milliCurie, not microCurie. Let me check that.\n\nYes, mCi typically stands for milliCurie, which is 10^-3 Ci, and \u03bcCi is microCurie, which is 10^-6 Ci. So, if the initial activity is 150 mCi, that's 150 milliCuries, which is 0.15 Ci. After 24 hours, it decays to approximately 9.4 mCi, which is 0.0094 Ci.\n\nBut the options given are A. 150 mCi, B. 38 mCi, C. 19 mCi, D. 9.4 mCi. So, based on my calculations, D seems correct.\n\nI think the note \"mCi = microcuries\" might be a mistake, because 150 microcuries is a very small amount, whereas 150 milliCuries is a more typical activity for medical uses.\n\nAssuming it's milliCuries, then the answer should be D. 9.4 mCi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 9.4 \\ \\text{mCi}} \\]"
