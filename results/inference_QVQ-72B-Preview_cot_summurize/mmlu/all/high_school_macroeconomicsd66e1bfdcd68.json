                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"If real GDP per capita grows at a rate of 10 percent a year, then we can expect the standard of living to double in... A. 10 years. B. 9 years. C. 8 years. D. 7 years.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out how long it will take for the real GDP per capita, which is a measure of the standard of living, to double at a growth rate of 10% per year. This sounds like a problem involving exponential growth, right? Because growth at a percentage rate each year is exponential.\n\nI remember there's a rule of thumb called the rule of 70, which helps estimate the time it takes for something to double when it's growing exponentially. The formula is:\n\nDoubling time (in years) = 70 / growth rate (%)\n\nSo, if the growth rate is 10% per year, then the doubling time should be 70 / 10 = 7 years. That would point to answer D. 7 years.\n\nBut I should make sure that the rule of 70 is applicable here. Let me recall: the rule of 70 is a simplified formula that's used to estimate the doubling time of a quantity growing at a constant annual rate. It's particularly useful for compound interest or economic growth rates. So, yes, it fits this scenario.\n\nLet me cross-verify this with the actual formula for exponential growth. The formula for future value is:\n\nFV = PV * (1 + r)^t\n\nWhere:\n\n- FV is the future value\n\n- PV is the present value\n\n- r is the annual growth rate\n\n- t is the time in years\n\nIn this case, we want the future value to be double the present value, so FV = 2 * PV.\n\nSo, 2 * PV = PV * (1 + 0.10)^t\n\nDividing both sides by PV gives:\n\n2 = (1.10)^t\n\nNow, I need to solve for t. I can use logarithms for this.\n\nTake the natural log on both sides:\n\nln(2) = t * ln(1.10)\n\nSo, t = ln(2) / ln(1.10)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931\n\nLn(1.10) is approximately 0.0953\n\nSo, t = 0.6931 / 0.0953 \u2248 7.27 years\n\nHmm, so according to the exact calculation, it's approximately 7.27 years, which rounds to 7 years. So, the rule of 70 gives a close enough estimate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the rule of 69, which is more precise for continuous compounding, but since the growth is annual, rule of 70 should suffice.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the time it takes for the economy to double at 10% growth. Let's consider the growth factor each year is multiplying by 1.10.\n\nSo, year 0: \\$1\n\nYear 1: \\$1.10\n\nYear 2: \\$1.21\n\nYear 3: \\$1.331\n\nYear 4: \\$1.4641\n\nYear 5: \\$1.61051\n\nYear 6: \\$1.771561\n\nYear 7: \\$1.9487171\n\nYear 8: \\$2.14358881\n\nSo, it looks like it takes about 7 years to double, since \\$1 * 2 = \\$2, and at year 7, it's \\$1.95, which is almost \\$2, and at year 8, it's over \\$2.\n\nSo, based on the rule of 70, the exact calculation, and this manual multiplication, it seems that 7 years is the closest answer.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other factor I should consider. The question mentions real GDP per capita, which adjusts for inflation and population growth. So, the growth rate given is already the real growth per person, so I don't need to adjust for inflation or population changes separately.\n\nTherefore, the standard of living, as measured by real GDP per capita, will double in approximately 7 years at a 10% annual growth rate.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 7 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
