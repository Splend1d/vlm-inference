                    "text": "So I've got this problem here where I need to place the symbols plus, times, and minus into the blanks between the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8. I have to use each symbol exactly once, and I can't use parentheses or rearrange the numbers. My goal is to make the highest possible number.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what's going on. I have four numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8, arranged in that order. I need to insert the operations +, \u00d7, and - between them, using each operation once.\n\nFirst, I should recall that operations like multiplication and addition generally increase the value, while subtraction can either increase or decrease it, depending on the arrangement.\n\nSince I want the highest possible number, I should prioritize multiplication because it can significantly boost the value, especially when multiplied by larger numbers.\n\nLet me consider the positions where I can place these operations:\n\nThere are three blanks between four numbers:\n\n- Between 2 and 4: let's call this position 1\n\n- Between 4 and 6: position 2\n\n- Between 6 and 8: position 3\n\nI need to assign +, \u00d7, and - to positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nLet's think about the possible permutations of the operations and calculate the results.\n\nFirst permutation:\n\n- Position 1: +\n\n- Position 2: \u00d7\n\n- Position 3: -\n\nSo, the expression would be: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\nI need to remember the order of operations: multiplication before addition and subtraction.\n\nSo, first, do the multiplication: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen, add: 2 + 24 = 26\n\nFinally, subtract: 26 - 8 = 18\n\nHmm, that's not very high. Maybe I can do better.\n\nSecond permutation:\n\n- Position 1: +\n\n- Position 2: -\n\n- Position 3: \u00d7\n\nSo, the expression is: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nAgain, multiplication first: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, subtraction: 4 - 48 = -44\n\nFinally, addition: 2 + (-44) = -42\n\nThat's way lower. Not good.\n\nThird permutation:\n\n- Position 1: \u00d7\n\n- Position 2: +\n\n- Position 3: -\n\nExpression: 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8\n\nMultiplication first: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen addition: 8 + 6 = 14\n\nFinally, subtraction: 14 - 8 = 6\n\nStill not great.\n\nFourth permutation:\n\n- Position 1: \u00d7\n\n- Position 2: -\n\n- Position 3: +\n\nExpression: 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8\n\nMultiplication first: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen subtraction: 8 - 6 = 2\n\nFinally, addition: 2 + 8 = 10\n\nBetter than before, but I think I can do better.\n\nFifth permutation:\n\n- Position 1: -\n\n- Position 2: +\n\n- Position 3: \u00d7\n\nExpression: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nMultiplication first: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen addition: -4 + 48 = 44\n\nFinally, subtraction: 2 - 44 = -42\n\nSame as the second permutation. Not helpful.\n\nSixth permutation:\n\n- Position 1: -\n\n- Position 2: \u00d7\n\n- Position 3: +\n\nExpression: 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8\n\nMultiplication first: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen subtraction: 2 - 24 = -22\n\nFinally, addition: -22 + 8 = -14\n\nStill negative. Not what I want.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps I should try to maximize the multiplication effects.\n\nLet me consider placing the multiplication symbol where the numbers are larger to maximize its impact.\n\nFor example, multiplying 6 and 8 would give 48, which is larger than multiplying 2 and 4, which gives 8.\n\nSo, let's try placing \u00d7 between 6 and 8.\n\nSo, position 3: \u00d7\n\nThen, positions 1 and 2 would be + and -.\n\nFirst sub-permutation:\n\n- Position 1: +\n\n- Position 2: -\n\n- Position 3: \u00d7\n\nWhich is the same as the first permutation I tried earlier, giving 18.\n\nSecond sub-permutation:\n\n- Position 1: -\n\n- Position 2: +\n\n- Position 3: \u00d7\n\nWhich is the same as the fifth permutation, giving -42.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place \u00d7 between 4 and 6.\n\nSo, position 2: \u00d7\n\nThen, positions 1 and 3 would be + and -.\n\nFirst sub-permutation:\n\n- Position 1: +\n\n- Position 3: -\n\nWhich is the third permutation I tried, giving 6.\n\nSecond sub-permutation:\n\n- Position 1: -\n\n- Position 3: +\n\nWhich is the fourth permutation, giving 10.\n\nStill not high enough.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider placing the subtraction in a way that it adds to the total rather than subtracting.\n\nFor example, if I have a negative sign before a small number, it might not decrease the total as much.\n\nBut actually, since I'm aiming for the highest possible number, subtraction is probably not helping me here.\n\nMaybe I should aim to have addition and multiplication, and see how to handle the subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can arrange it so that the subtraction is effectively adding a negative number.\n\nWait, no, subtraction is just subtracting the number that follows.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can make the subtraction result in a negative number that can be added later.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to maximize multiplication, since it can significantly increase the result.\n\nSo, let's try to place the multiplication symbol between the largest numbers possible.\n\nIn this case, between 6 and 8, which are the largest numbers.\n\nSo, position 3: \u00d7\n\nThen, positions 1 and 2 would be + and -.\n\nBut earlier, that gave me 18, which isn't very high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe placing \u00d7 between 4 and 6.\n\nSo, position 2: \u00d7\n\nThen, positions 1 and 3: + and -.\n\nAgain, not very high results.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that subtraction can also be used in a way that it effectively subtracts a smaller number, thereby increasing the total.\n\nFor example, if I subtract a small number early on, it might not decrease the total as much.\n\nLet me try placing - in position 1, + in position 2, and \u00d7 in position 3.\n\nSo, expression: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nFirst, multiplication: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen addition: -4 + 48 = 44\n\nFinally, subtraction: 2 - 44 = -42\n\nNo, that's worse.\n\nWait, maybe I need to place the subtraction between smaller numbers.\n\nLet me try placing - between 4 and 6.\n\nSo, expression: 2 + (4 - 6) \u00d7 8\n\nWait, but I can't use parentheses.\n\nOh, right, no parentheses allowed.\n\nSo, 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculating:\n\nFirst, multiplication: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, addition: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nFinally, subtraction: 6 - 48 = -42\n\nAgain, negative.\n\nNot good.\n\nMaybe I need to rethink my strategy.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize addition and multiplication, and minimize the impact of subtraction.\n\nLet me try placing + and \u00d7 in positions where they can maximize the sum, and place - in a position where it subtracts the smallest possible number.\n\nFor example, placing - between the last two numbers, so it subtracts 8, which is the largest number, but maybe that's not optimal.\n\nWait, no, subtracting a larger number decreases the total more.\n\nMaybe I should subtract a smaller number.\n\nLet me try placing - between 2 and 4.\n\nSo, expression: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculating:\n\nMultiplication first: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen addition: -4 + 48 = 44\n\nFinally, subtraction: 2 - 44 = -42\n\nNo, that's negative.\n\nNot what I want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe placing - between 4 and 6.\n\nSo, expression: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nWhich is the same as before, giving -42.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to make the subtraction effectively add a positive number.\n\nBut subtraction is always subtracting, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can arrange it so that the subtraction is minimal.\n\nFor example, subtracting the smallest number possible.\n\nIn this case, subtracting 2.\n\nSo, placing - between 6 and 8.\n\nExpression: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\nCalculating:\n\nMultiplication first: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen addition: 2 + 24 = 26\n\nFinally, subtraction: 26 - 8 = 18\n\nSame as the first permutation.\n\nNot high enough.\n\nMaybe I need to avoid subtraction altogether, but I have to use each symbol exactly once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can arrange it so that the subtraction doesn't decrease the total much.\n\nFor example, subtracting a small number.\n\nWait, but subtracting a small number still decreases the total, just not as much as subtracting a larger number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make the subtraction negative, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no, subtraction is always subtracting the number that follows.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nMaybe I can list all possible permutations of the operations and calculate their results.\n\nThere are 3 factorial, which is 6, possible permutations of the operations.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. +, \u00d7, -\n\n2. +, -, \u00d7\n\n3. \u00d7, +, -\n\n4. \u00d7, -, +\n\n5. -, +, \u00d7\n\n6. -, \u00d7, +\n\nNow, let's calculate each one step by step.\n\nFirst permutation: +, \u00d7, -\n\nExpression: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen, 2 + 24 = 26\n\nThen, 26 - 8 = 18\n\nSecond permutation: +, -, \u00d7\n\nExpression: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, 4 - 48 = -44\n\nThen, 2 + (-44) = -42\n\nThird permutation: \u00d7, +, -\n\nExpression: 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen, 8 + 6 = 14\n\nThen, 14 - 8 = 6\n\nFourth permutation: \u00d7, -, +\n\nExpression: 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen, 8 - 6 = 2\n\nThen, 2 + 8 = 10\n\nFifth permutation: -, +, \u00d7\n\nExpression: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, -4 + 48 = 44\n\nThen, 2 + 44 = 46\n\nWait a minute, 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nCalculating:\n\nFirst, 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, 2 - 4 + 48\n\nWhich is -2 + 48 = 46\n\nOh, that's 46, which is higher than the previous results.\n\nThat's promising.\n\nSixth permutation: -, \u00d7, +\n\nExpression: 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8\n\nCalculate:\n\n4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen, 2 - 24 = -22\n\nThen, -22 + 8 = -14\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo, among these permutations, the highest result is 46.\n\nIs there any way to get a higher number than 46 with different arrangements?\n\nLet me check if there are any other arrangements that might yield a higher number.\n\nWait, in the fifth permutation, I got 46.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the operations to get a higher number than 46?\n\nLet me see.\n\nMaybe if I try to maximize the multiplication effect.\n\nFor example, multiplying the largest numbers together.\n\nSo, placing \u00d7 between 6 and 8, which are the largest numbers.\n\nSo, expression: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nWait, that's the second permutation, which gave -42.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, placing \u00d7 between 4 and 6.\n\nSo, expression: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\nWhich is the first permutation, giving 18.\n\nNot higher than 46.\n\nAlternatively, placing \u00d7 between 2 and 4.\n\nSo, expression: 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8\n\nWhich is the third permutation, giving 6.\n\nNot higher.\n\nAlternatively, placing \u00d7 between 2 and 4, and + between 4 and 6, and - between 6 and 8.\n\nWait, but I have to use each symbol exactly once, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, no, I have three operations to place in three positions.\n\nI think I've covered all possible permutations.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst permutation: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8 = 2 + 24 - 8 = 26 - 8 = 18\n\nSecond permutation: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8 = 2 + 4 - 48 = 6 - 48 = -42\n\nThird permutation: 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8 = 8 + 6 - 8 = 14 - 8 = 6\n\nFourth permutation: 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8 = 8 - 6 + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\n\nFifth permutation: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 = 2 - 4 + 48 = -2 + 48 = 46\n\nSixth permutation: 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8 = 2 - 24 + 8 = -22 + 8 = -14\n\nSo, indeed, the highest result is 46.\n\nIs there any other way to arrange the operations to get a higher number?\n\nWait, maybe if I consider that subtraction can be thought of as adding a negative number.\n\nBut in terms of actual calculation, it's still subtracting the number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret the operations differently, but given the constraints, I don't think so.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible number that John could obtain is 46.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 46\n\nC. 100\n\nD. 99\n\nSo, option B. 46 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]"
