                    "text": "So I've got this question here about delegates to presidential nomination conventions. I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says that delegates are generally more likely to register as third-party voters at some point. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. Delegates are usually deeply involved in politics and often strongly aligned with a particular party, either Republican or Democratic, since those are the main parties in the U.S. I think they might be less likely to register as third-party voters because they're so invested in one of the major parties. But I could be wrong. Maybe some research shows that they switch parties or register as independents sometimes. I should look that up.\n\nOption B says that the majority of the general population is more educated than the delegates. That seems counterintuitive. Delegates are typically well-educated individuals, often with college degrees or higher, especially since many are professionals in various fields. The general population has a wider range of education levels, but on average, I think delegates are more educated. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I'd be surprised if the general population was more educated on average than delegates.\n\nOption C says that delegates typically have little interest in politics. That can't be right. Delegates to presidential nomination conventions are usually very interested in politics. They're often party activists, elected officials, or prominent members of the party who have a strong interest in the political process. It's hard to imagine someone with little interest in politics becoming a delegate.\n\nOption D says that typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates. This one seems plausible. Delegates are often selected based on their commitment to certain ideological positions or candidates, so they might be more ideologically extreme or committed than the general population. Many people in the general population consider themselves moderates or don't identify strongly with a particular ideology. So, I think this could be true.\n\nLet me summarize what I think:\n\n- A: Delegates are more likely to register as third-party voters \u2013 seems unlikely because they're often loyal to one of the major parties.\n\n- B: General population is more educated than delegates \u2013 I think delegates are more educated on average.\n\n- C: Delegates have little interest in politics \u2013 Definitely not true; they're very interested.\n\n- D: General population is less ideological than delegates \u2013 This seems plausible.\n\nMaybe I should check some sources to confirm. I recall that studies have shown that political activists, like delegates, tend to be more ideologically extreme than the general electorate or the general population. For example, Republican delegates might be more conservatively ideological, and Democratic delegates more liberally ideological, compared to the average voter or citizen.\n\nThere's also research indicating that the general population includes a significant number of moderates or people who don't strictly adhere to one ideology. So, yes, that supports option D.\n\nAs for option A, I found that most delegates are loyal to their party and while some might switch parties or register as independents at some point, it's not the majority. So, it's probably not accurate to say they're generally more likely to register as third-party voters.\n\nOption B contradicts what I know about delegates; they are typically well-educated. Maybe in some specific contexts, the general population might have higher education levels, but generally, I think delegates are more educated.\n\nOption C is straightforwardly incorrect based on what we know about delegates' roles and motivations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
