                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand post-modernist writers' views. The question is about what they argue regarding our world and theories. The options are:\n\nA. We live in a world of superficial, fragmented images.\n\nB. No theory is better than any other; 'anything goes.'\n\nC. Society has changed and we need new kinds of theory.\n\nD. All of the above.\n\nHmm, postmodernism is a bit tricky for me, but I'll try to make sense of it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what postmodernism is. I think it's a movement that came after modernism, right? Modernism was about progress, reason, and objectivity, whereas postmodernism questions those ideas. It suggests that there are no universal truths and that reality is subjective.\n\nOption A says we live in a world of superficial, fragmented images. I've heard about how postmodernism critiques mass media and the way information is presented in bits and pieces, often without context. So, maybe this is something postmodernists believe. But is it just superficial images, or is there more to it?\n\nOption B says no theory is better than any other; 'anything goes.' This sounds like relativism, where all opinions are equally valid. Postmodernists do question absolute truths and hierarchical structures, including the idea that some theories are superior to others. So, this seems to align with their thoughts.\n\nOption C states that society has changed and we need new kinds of theory. Postmodernism emerged in response to the changes in society, culture, and technology that weren't adequately addressed by modernist theories. So, they might argue that traditional theories are insufficient for understanding contemporary society.\n\nGiven that, it seems like all three points are relevant to postmodernist thought. But is it accurate to say all of the above? Let me double-check.\n\nStarting with Option A: Living in a world of superficial, fragmented images. Postmodernists often discuss the impact of mass media and capitalism on culture, leading to a fragmentation of meaning and a focus on surfaces rather than depths. So, yes, this is a common theme in postmodern thought.\n\nOption B: No theory is better than any other; 'anything goes.' This relates to postmodernism's rejection of metanarratives and grand theories. They emphasize that reality is constructed through language and that multiple interpretations are possible. However, some critics argue that this leads to relativism, where all views are seen as equally valid, which can be problematic.\n\nOption C: Society has changed and we need new kinds of theory. This is largely true, as postmodernism arose in response to the limitations of modernist theories in explaining the complexities of contemporary society. Postmodernists argue for more fluid, context-dependent approaches to understanding the world.\n\nGiven this, it seems that all three options reflect aspects of postmodernist thought. Therefore, the answer is D: all of the above.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, while postmodernists do emphasize the fragmentation of culture and the subjectivity of truth, they might not necessarily agree that absolutely anything goes. Some postmodern thinkers still believe in some form of critical evaluation or criteria for ideas, even if they reject absolute truths.\n\nHowever, in general, the statement that no theory is better than any other and that anything goes is often associated with postmodernism, whether or not all postmodernists would fully embrace that phrase.\n\nSimilarly, while postmodernists recognize that society has changed and that new theories are needed, they might not prescribe specific new theories, but rather advocate for a shift in perspective or a different approach to understanding.\n\nDespite these nuances, the question is asking about what post-modernist writers have argued, and all three points are indeed arguments attributed to them.\n\nSo, my final answer is D: all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
