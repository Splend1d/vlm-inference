                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of these performers made her film debut in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing'?\" And the options are Jennifer Lopez, Rosie Perez, Paula Abdul, and Tisha Campbell. Hmm, I need to figure out who made their first film appearance in that movie.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"Do the Right Thing\" is a Spike Lee joint, and it came out in 1989. It's a iconic film set in Brooklyn, New York, on a hot summer day, and it deals with themes of racism, poverty, and social tension. But who made their debut in it?\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Jennifer Lopez. I know she's a big star now, acting and singing. I think she was in \"Selena\" and \"Out of Sight,\" but I'm not sure about her film debut. Let me recall\u2014did she start in the late 80s or early 90s? I think she started acting in the late 80s, but was \"Do the Right Thing\" her first film? I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at the cast of that movie.\n\nNext, Rosie Perez. I remember her from \"White Men Can't Jump\" with Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson. That was in 1992. But was she in \"Do the Right Thing\"? I think she was in that movie, maybe dancing or having a role. Could that have been her debut? It seems possible.\n\nThen there's Paula Abdul. She's primarily known as a singer and dancer. I don't recall her having a significant acting career, but maybe she had a cameo or a small role in \"Do the Right Thing.\" But I think her focus was more on music during that time.\n\nLastly, Tisha Campbell. I know her from \"Martin,\" the TV show in the 90s. She's been in several films and TV shows, but I don't remember if \"Do the Right Thing\" was her first film role.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Jennifer Lopez: likely started acting around that time, but not sure if \"Do the Right Thing\" was her debut.\n\n- Rosie Perez: known for \"White Men Can't Jump,\" which was a few years later, but possibly in \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\n- Paula Abdul: mainly a singer, unsure about her acting debut.\n\n- Tisha Campbell: active in film and TV, but again, unsure about her debut role.\n\nI think the key here is to identify which of these performers made their film debut in \"Do the Right Thing.\" So, I need to check who was part of the cast and whether it was their first film role.\n\nLet me try to recall the cast of \"Do the Right Thing.\" I remember Spike Lee directed it and also starred in it, playing Mookie. There's also Danny Aiello as Sal, Samuel L. Jackson as Radio Raheem, and Rosie Perez as Tina, Mookie's girlfriend. Wait, is that right? I think Rosie Perez was in that movie. Let me confirm that.\n\nIf Rosie Perez was in \"Do the Right Thing\" and it was her debut, then that would be the answer. I think she played Tina, who was Mookie's love interest and the mother of his child. That sounds like a significant role.\n\nLet me consider Jennifer Lopez. I think her first major film role was in \"My Little Girl\" in 1986, but I might be wrong. Maybe she had smaller roles before that. If that's the case, then \"Do the Right Thing\" wouldn't be her debut.\n\nAs for Paula Abdul, I think her focus was on music during that time. She had several hit songs in the late 80s and early 90s, but I don't recall her being in films back then. Maybe she had a cameo somewhere, but it's unlikely that \"Do the Right Thing\" was her debut.\n\nTisha Campbell, I know she was in \"House Party\" in 1990, which was before \"Martin.\" But again, I don't remember if \"Do the Right Thing\" was her first film.\n\nSo, based on this, Rosie Perez seems like the most plausible choice. She was in \"Do the Right Thing,\" and I think it was her film debut.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Maybe I can recall if she had any other roles before that. I don't think so. \"Do the Right Thing\" was her breakthrough role, and I believe it was her first film.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider Jennifer Lopez again. I think she was in \"My Little Girl\" in 1986, which would make that her debut, not \"Do the Right Thing.\" So, she's out.\n\nPaula Abdul, as far as I know, didn't have a film debut until much later, if at all. Her career was in music, and I don't recall her acting in films during that period.\n\nTisha Campbell, I think her first film was \"Roma\" in 1972, when she was a child, but I might be mistaken. Alternatively, she was in \"House Party\" in 1990, which could be her debut, but again, not \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Rosie Perez. She made her film debut in Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. Rosie Perez}} \\]"
