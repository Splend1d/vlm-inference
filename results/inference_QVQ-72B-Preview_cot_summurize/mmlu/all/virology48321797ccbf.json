I'm not super familiar with polyomaviruses, but I think I can recall some basics.\n\nFirst off, I know that viruses are infectious agents that can cause diseases in living organisms. Polyomaviruses are a type of virus that affect mammals, including humans. I think they were first discovered in the 1950s or something like that, but I'm not sure about the exact history.\n\nLet me think about what I know regarding human polyomaviruses. I remember that there are several types, and some of them are more common than others. For example, there's JC virus and BK virus, which are probably the best-known ones. JC virus can cause a rare but serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, especially in immunocompromised patients, like those with AIDS or who've received organ transplants. BK virus is commonly associated with urinary tract infections and can be a problem in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nBesides JC and BK viruses, I think there are other human polyomaviruses that have been discovered more recently. I recall reading about KI virus and WU virus, which were identified in the early 2000s, I think. And there might be others that have been found since then.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of human polyomaviruses known at present. The options are 100, 1, 10, or unknown. Clearly, it's not just one, so option B is out. Option A is 100, which seems too high. I don't think there are that many human polyomaviruses known.\n\nOption C is 10, which might be plausible. Let me see if I can list some of them to get an idea. I know about JC, BK, KI, and WU viruses. There's also MCPyV, which I think is associated with Merkel cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. That makes five so far.\n\nLet me think if there are any others. I think there might be some more that have been discovered in the last few years, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nConsidering that, I think the number is around 10 to 12, but I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, 10 seems like a reasonable answer. So, I would go with option C, 10.\n\nBut wait, option D is unknown. Maybe the exact number isn't known, or perhaps new viruses are still being discovered, making the number unclear. However, based on what I know, I think researchers have identified around 10 human polyomaviruses so far, so I'll stick with that.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the classification of polyomaviruses. They belong to the family Polyomaviridae, and within that, there are several genera, including Mammapolyomavirus, which includes human polyomaviruses. So, specifically, we're dealing with human polyomaviruses, which are part of the Mammapolyomavirus genus.\n\nI think I've covered most of what I know about human polyomaviruses. To sum it up, there are multiple types, with JC and BK being the most well-known, and several others that have been discovered more recently, bringing the total to around 10.\n\nTherefore, my answer is C. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
