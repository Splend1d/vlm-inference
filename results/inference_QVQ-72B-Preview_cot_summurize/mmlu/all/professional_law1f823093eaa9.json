                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario about jury selection in a federal diversity action. It's between a wholesaler and a large pharmaceutical company over a breach of contract. During the jury selection process, there's this potential juror who reveals that five years ago, he was an employee of the pharmaceutical company and still owns several hundred shares of its stock. Now, the judge asked him if he could fairly consider the evidence, and he said yes. But the wholesaler's attorney wants this juror to be struck for cause. The question is, should the judge strike this potential juror for cause?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"struck for cause\" means. I know that in jury selection, there are peremptory challenges and challenges for cause. Peremptory challenges allow each side to dismiss a certain number of jurors without giving a reason, while challenges for cause are requests to dismiss a juror based on a specific reason, like bias or prejudice that would prevent them from being fair.\n\nIn this case, the wholesaler's attorney is asking for a challenge for cause because of the potential juror's past employment and current stock ownership in the pharmaceutical company. The attorney probably thinks that these connections could bias the juror in favor of the company.\n\nNow, the potential juror has said that he can fairly consider the evidence. That seems important. The judge likely considered that statement, but the attorney is still concerned about the appearance of bias due to the juror's financial interest in the company.\n\nLet me think about this. If someone owns stock in a company, they have a financial interest in that company's success. So, in this case, the juror owns several hundred shares of the pharmaceutical company's stock. That means that if the company does well, the stock value goes up, and he benefits financially. Conversely, if the company faces legal issues or financial penalties from losing the lawsuit, that could negatively impact the stock price and thus his investment.\n\nGiven that, it's reasonable to think that this juror might be inclined to favor the pharmaceutical company to protect his investment. Even if he says he can be fair, there might be subconscious biases at play.\n\nBut, on the other hand, he was employed by the company five years ago. That was a while back, so maybe his loyalties have shifted since then. However, owning stock is a current interest.\n\nI need to recall what the standards are for striking a juror for cause due to potential bias. I think there are both actual bias and implied bias considerations.\n\nActual bias is when a juror has a specific prejudice or interest that would affect their ability to be impartial. Implied bias is when the juror's connection to the case is so significant that bias is presumed, and the juror should be disqualified regardless of what they say about their ability to be fair.\n\nIn this scenario, the potential juror has a financial interest in the defendant company because of his stock ownership. That seems like a pretty significant connection. Owning stock in a company could be seen as a conflict of interest, especially since the outcome of the trial could affect the stock price.\n\nBut, he did say that he could fairly consider the evidence. Does that mean that he shouldn't be struck for cause?\n\nWell, in some cases, a juror's assurance that they can be fair is taken into account, but if there's a strong indication of potential bias, the court might still strike the juror for cause.\n\nLet me consider the options provided:\n\nA. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.\n\nB. No, because the wholesaler's attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.\n\nC. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.\n\nD. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n\nOption A suggests that since the juror says he can be fair, he shouldn't be struck for cause. But, as I thought earlier, just because someone says they can be fair doesn't necessarily override other indications of potential bias.\n\nOption B mentions using a peremptory challenge instead. Well, peremptory challenges are limited, and attorneys often save them for jurors who they think might be biased but who haven't given a clear reason for a challenge for cause. However, in this case, the attorney is seeking a challenge for cause, probably because they believe there's a sufficient reason to do so.\n\nOption C says yes because other jurors are available. That seems a bit simplistic. Just because there are other potential jurors doesn't mean that this one should be automatically struck for cause. The goal is to have a fair jury, not just to fill seats.\n\nOption D says yes because the juror is presumed to be biased due to his relationship with the company. This seems the most plausible. If owning stock in the defendant company is seen as a significant connection that could influence his decision-making, then bias might be presumed, and he should be struck for cause regardless of his assertion that he can be fair.\n\nI need to think more about the concept of implied bias. Are there cases where owning stock in a party to the litigation is enough to presume bias?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, having a direct financial interest in the outcome of the case is a ground for disqualification. For example, if someone stands to gain or lose money based on the trial's outcome, they might be automatically disqualified.\n\nIn this case, the juror owns stock in the pharmaceutical company. If the company is found liable for breach of contract and has to pay damages, that could negatively affect the company's financial standing and, by extension, the stock price. So, there is a potential indirect financial impact on the juror.\n\nGiven that, it seems reasonable to presume that the juror might not be able to set aside his financial interests and be entirely impartial. Even if he tries to be fair, there could be subconscious biases affecting his judgment.\n\nMoreover, the fact that he was employed by the company five years ago adds another layer. Although it was five years ago, his past employment might still influence his perceptions or loyalties towards the company.\n\nSo, considering both the stock ownership and the past employment, it appears that there is a significant risk of bias that goes beyond just the juror's assurance of fairness.\n\nTherefore, I think the judge should strike this potential juror for cause. It's important to ensure that the jury is composed of individuals who do not have conflicts of interest or biases that could affect their impartiality.\n\nBetween the options given, D seems to be the most accurate explanation: yes, the potential juror should be struck for cause because he is presumed to be biased due to his relationship with the company.\n\nI don't think A is correct because, while the juror says he can be fair, the connections to the company suggest a higher risk of bias that shouldn't be ignored.\n\nOption B isn't directly addressing the issue of whether the juror should be struck for cause. It's suggesting that a peremptory challenge could be used instead, but that doesn't answer the question of whether a challenge for cause is appropriate.\n\nOption C is too simplistic and doesn't consider the principles behind jury selection and the importance of impartiality.\n\nSo, my answer is D: yes, the potential juror should be struck for cause because he is presumed to be biased due to his relationship with the company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
