A disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action.\n\nC. Intellectual knowledge.\n\nD. The capacity to ascertain what God would desire.\n\nHmm, I remember that Aristotle was a big figure in philosophy, especially ethics, and he talked a lot about virtue. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that Aristotle believed in the \"golden mean,\" which is like finding a balance between extremes. So, for example, courage is the mean between recklessness and cowardice. Does that sound right?\n\nLooking at option B, it says \"a disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action.\" That seems to align with the idea of the golden mean. He thought that virtue is about finding the right balance in our emotions and behaviors.\n\nOption A is about controlling anger. While that might be related to virtue, it seems too specific. Virtue encompasses a lot more than just anger management, right?\n\nOption C says intellectual knowledge. Aristotle did distinguish between intellectual virtues and moral virtues. Intellectual virtues are about knowledge and wisdom, while moral virtues are about character and behavior. So, virtue could be about both, but the question might be referring to moral virtue specifically.\n\nOption D mentions ascertaining what God would desire. Hmm, Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and while he did talk about a highest good or final cause, I don't recall him referring to a divine being in the same way that, say, Christian philosophers do. So, this might not be accurate for Aristotle's definition.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should recall his famous quote. I think he said something like \"virtue is a habit\" or \"virtue is a mean between two vices.\" Let me see.\n\nYes, in his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defines virtue as a habit of choosing the mean relative to us, determined by a rational principle. So, it's about choosing the middle path, not going to extremes in either direction.\n\nThat sounds a lot like option B: a disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action. Disposition suggests a habitual way of behaving, which fits with Aristotle's idea of virtue as a habit.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if any of the other options could also be considered.\n\nOption A, controlling anger, is more specific and relates to a particular virtue, like temperance or self-control, but not the overall definition of virtue.\n\nOption C, intellectual knowledge, is more about the intellectual virtues, like wisdom or understanding, but again, not the general definition of virtue.\n\nOption D seems out of place because Aristotle's philosophy was more secular and didn't revolve around a divine being telling us what to do.\n\nSo, after thinking this through, I think the best answer is B: a disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
