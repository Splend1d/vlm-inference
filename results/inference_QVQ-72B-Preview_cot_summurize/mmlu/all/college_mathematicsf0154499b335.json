                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements, and I need to determine whether each one is true or false. Let's tackle them one at a time.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\"\n\nHmm, connectedness is a topological property, and I remember that in topology, connected spaces don't have any separation into two nonempty open sets. So, if A is a connected subset of some topological space, is its closure also connected?\n\nLet me recall what the closure of a set is. The closure of A, denoted by cl(A) or A\u0305, is the union of A and its limit points. So, it includes all the points of A and the points that are arbitrarily close to A.\n\nI need to prove whether cl(A) is connected if A is connected. Or, if not, find a counterexample.\n\nLet me think about the properties of connectedness. In a topological space, if A is connected, and A is dense in cl(A), then cl(A) is also connected. Wait, is that always true?\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem that says if A is connected and A is dense in B, then B is connected. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the contrapositive. If cl(A) is not connected, then A can't be connected. But that doesn't sound right.\n\nLet me consider a specific example. Take the real line with the standard topology. Let A = (0,1), the open interval. This is a connected set because it cannot be expressed as the union of two nonempty open sets in itself.\n\nNow, the closure of A is [0,1], which is also connected. So, in this case, the statement holds.\n\nBut is this always the case?\n\nLet me consider another example. Take the rational numbers Q with the standard topology. Let A be, say, the set of all rational numbers whose square is less than 2. That is, A = {q \u2208 Q : q\u00b2 < 2}. Is A connected?\n\nWell, A is a subset of Q, and Q is totally disconnected because between any two rationals, there are infinitely many others, and any nonempty open set in Q can be written as a union of open intervals, which can be further divided.\n\nBut actually, A is not connected in Q because it can be separated into two nonempty open sets in Q. For example, one set containing rationals less than \u221a2, and another containing rationals greater than \u221a2.\n\nWait, but A is not connected in this case, so it doesn't help with the original statement.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider a disconnected set and take its closure. If A is disconnected, then cl(A) is also disconnected. But that's not what the statement says. The statement is about A being connected implying cl(A) is connected.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the theorem about connectedness and closures.\n\nAfter a quick search in my topology notes, I recall that in a topological space, if A is connected and cl(A) is connected, then A is dense in cl(A). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, there's a theorem that says: If A is a subset of a topological space X, and A is connected, and A is dense in B (where B is a subset of X), then B is connected.\n\nBut in this case, cl(A) is the smallest closed set containing A, and A is dense in cl(A) by definition.\n\nSo, if A is connected and A is dense in cl(A), then cl(A) is connected.\n\nIs that always true?\n\nLet me see. Suppose A is connected, and cl(A) is the closure of A. Since A is dense in cl(A), meaning cl(A) is the smallest closed set containing A, and A is connected, then cl(A) should also be connected.\n\nWait, but is this always the case?\n\nLet me consider a counterexample.\n\nTake the set A = {1/n : n \u2208 N} in the real line with the standard topology. The closure of A is A \u222a {0}, because 0 is a limit point of A.\n\nNow, A is discrete because each point is isolated in A. Wait, but A is not connected because it can be separated into two nonempty open sets relative to A.\n\nWait, but the statement says A is connected, so in this case, A is not connected, so this doesn't serve as a counterexample.\n\nI need an example where A is connected, but cl(A) is not.\n\nIs such a thing possible?\n\nLet me think about it differently. Suppose A is connected, and cl(A) is not connected. Then, cl(A) can be written as the union of two nonempty separated sets, say B and C, where B \u2229 C = empty, and B \u2229 cl(C) = empty, and C \u2229 cl(B) = empty.\n\nBut since A is connected, and A \u2286 cl(A), if cl(A) is the union of B and C, then A must be entirely contained in either B or C, because A cannot be split between two disconnected parts.\n\nBut if A is entirely in B, say, then cl(A) \u2286 cl(B), and since A is dense in cl(A), this might imply something about B and C.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a proof that if A is connected, then cl(A) is connected.\n\nLet me try to prove it.\n\nSuppose A is connected, and cl(A) is not connected. Then, cl(A) can be written as the union of two nonempty open sets, say U and V, in cl(A), such that U \u2229 V = empty.\n\nNow, since A is connected, A cannot be split into U and V. That is, A cannot be expressed as (A \u2229 U) \u222a (A \u2229 V) with A \u2229 U and A \u2229 V nonempty and disjoint.\n\nBut A is contained in cl(A), so A \u2286 U \u222a V.\n\nIf A \u2229 U and A \u2229 V are both nonempty, then A would be disconnected, which contradicts the assumption that A is connected.\n\nTherefore, either A \u2286 U or A \u2286 V.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose A \u2286 U.\n\nSince U is open in cl(A), and cl(A) is closed in the ambient space, U is open in cl(A), but I need to think about what this implies for A being connected.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that if A is connected and A \u2286 U, then cl(A) \u2286 cl(U), and since U is open in cl(A), cl(U) is contained in cl(A).\n\nBut I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose A is connected, and consider cl(A). Assume cl(A) is not connected. Then, cl(A) can be written as B \u222a C, where B and C are nonempty, separated sets in cl(A).\n\nSince A is connected, A must be entirely contained in either B or C. Suppose A \u2286 B.\n\nThen, C is a closed set in cl(A) that is disjoint from A.\n\nBut since C is closed in cl(A), and cl(A) is closed in the ambient space, C is closed in the ambient space as well.\n\nMoreover, since C is disjoint from A, and A is dense in cl(A), but I'm not sure if that leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look for a reference or a standard theorem on this.\n\nAfter checking my notes, I find that indeed, in a topological space, if A is connected and cl(A) is the closure of A, then cl(A) is also connected.\n\nThe proof goes something like this:\n\nAssume cl(A) is not connected. Then, cl(A) = B \u222a C, where B and C are nonempty, separated sets.\n\nSince A is connected, A must be entirely contained in either B or C. Suppose A \u2286 B.\n\nThen, C is a closed set in cl(A) that is disjoint from A.\n\nBut since C is closed in cl(A), and A is dense in cl(A), this would imply that A has no points or limit points in C, which might contradict the density of A in cl(A).\n\nWait, but I need to formalize this.\n\nSuppose A is connected, and cl(A) is not connected. Then, cl(A) = B \u222a C, where B and C are nonempty, separated sets.\n\nSince A is connected, A cannot be split between B and C; hence, A \u2286 B or A \u2286 C.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose A \u2286 B.\n\nThen, C is a closed set in cl(A) that is disjoint from A.\n\nBut since C is closed in cl(A), and A is dense in cl(A), any closed set in cl(A) that is disjoint from A must be empty, because A is dense.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nIf A is dense in cl(A), then any closed set in cl(A) that does not intersect A must be empty, because the closure of A is the smallest closed set containing A.\n\nTherefore, if C is a nonempty closed set in cl(A) that is disjoint from A, then this contradicts the density of A in cl(A).\n\nHence, cl(A) cannot be written as the union of two nonempty separated sets, and thus cl(A) must be connected.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"Every continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point.\"\n\nA fixed point of a function f is a point x such that f(x) = x.\n\nSo, the statement is claiming that for any continuous function from (0,1) to itself, there exists at least one x in (0,1) such that f(x) = x.\n\nThis sounds reminiscent of the intermediate value theorem, which deals with continuous functions and the existence of points where the function takes on certain values.\n\nLet me recall the intermediate value theorem: If f is continuous on [a, b], and c is between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one x in (a, b) such that f(x) = c.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with a function from (0,1) to itself, and we're looking for a point where f(x) = x.\n\nSo, perhaps I can consider the function g(x) = f(x) - x. If f has a fixed point, then g(x) = 0 for some x in (0,1).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to showing that g(x) has a root in (0,1).\n\nNow, if g(0) and g(1) have opposite signs, then by the intermediate value theorem, g has a root in (0,1).\n\nBut wait, (0,1) is an open interval, and g is defined on (0,1), so I need to think carefully about the endpoints.\n\nMoreover, since f maps (0,1) to (0,1), we have 0 < f(x) < 1 for all x in (0,1).\n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1.\n\nWait, but 0 and 1 are not in the domain of f, since f is defined on (0,1). So, I can't evaluate f at 0 or 1 directly.\n\nThis complicates things because the intermediate value theorem typically requires knowledge of the function values at the endpoints, but here the endpoints are not in the domain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can extend f continuously to the closed interval [0,1] and then apply the intermediate value theorem.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's always possible.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nConsider f(x) = x/2 + 1/4. This is a continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1), since for x in (0,1), f(x) is in (1/4, 3/4) \u2286 (0,1).\n\nNow, does f have a fixed point? That is, does f(x) = x for some x in (0,1)?\n\nSo, x/2 + 1/4 = x \u21d2 x/2 = 1/4 \u21d2 x = 1/2.\n\nIndeed, f(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 \u2260 1/2, so no fixed point here.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculation.\n\nf(x) = x/2 + 1/4.\n\nSet f(x) = x: x/2 + 1/4 = x \u21d2 x/2 - x = -1/4 \u21d2 (-x/2) = -1/4 \u21d2 x = 1/2.\n\nBut f(1/2) = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4, which is not equal to 1/2. So, indeed, no fixed point in this case.\n\nBut according to the statement, every continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) should have a fixed point. However, in this example, it doesn't seem to have one.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is false, and this is a counterexample.\n\nLet me consider another example.\n\nTake f(x) = x. This is trivial; it has a fixed point at every x in (0,1).\n\nNot helpful.\n\nTake f(x) = 1 - x. Does this map (0,1) to (0,1)? Yes, because if x is in (0,1), then 1 - x is in (0,1).\n\nDoes it have a fixed point? Set f(x) = x: 1 - x = x \u21d2 1 = 2x \u21d2 x = 1/2.\n\nSo, yes, it has a fixed point at x = 1/2.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = sin(\u03c0x/2).\n\nThis maps (0,1) to (0,1) because sin(\u03c0x/2) is between 0 and 1 for x in (0,1).\n\nDoes it have a fixed point? Set sin(\u03c0x/2) = x.\n\nThis equation may have solutions in (0,1). For example, at x = 1/2, sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.707, which is not equal to 1/2.\n\nAt x = 0.5, it's not equal. At x = 0.7, sin(0.7\u03c0) \u2248 sin(1.1\u03c0) \u2248 sin(3.49 radians), which is approximately 0.99, which is greater than 0.7.\n\nSo, there might be a point where sin(\u03c0x/2) = x.\n\nLet me solve sin(\u03c0x/2) = x.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation and might not have an elementary solution, but numerically, there is a solution between 0 and 1.\n\nUsing a calculator, I can approximate it.\n\nLet me pick x = 0.6: sin(\u03c0*0.6/2) = sin(0.9\u03c0) \u2248 sin(2.7\u03c0) \u2248 sin(8.47 radians), which is approximately 0.51, which is greater than 0.6.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. \u03c0*0.6/2 = 0.3\u03c0 \u2248 0.942 radians, and sin(0.942) \u2248 0.801, which is greater than 0.6.\n\nSo, at x = 0.6, sin(0.3\u03c0) \u2248 0.801 \u2260 0.6.\n\nAt x = 0.8, sin(0.4\u03c0) \u2248 sin(1.256) \u2248 0.997, which is greater than 0.8.\n\nAt x = 0.7, sin(0.35\u03c0) \u2248 sin(1.099) \u2248 0.901, which is greater than 0.7.\n\nIt seems that as x increases, sin(\u03c0x/2) increases faster than x, so there might not be a fixed point in this case.\n\nBut earlier, at x = 0.5, sin(\u03c0/4) \u2248 0.707 > 0.5.\n\nAt x = 0.4, sin(0.2\u03c0) \u2248 sin(0.628) \u2248 0.59, which is greater than 0.4.\n\nAt x = 0.3, sin(0.15\u03c0) \u2248 sin(0.471) \u2248 0.45, which is greater than 0.3.\n\nAt x = 0.2, sin(0.1\u03c0) \u2248 sin(0.314) \u2248 0.309, which is greater than 0.2.\n\nAt x = 0.1, sin(0.05\u03c0) \u2248 sin(0.157) \u2248 0.156, which is greater than 0.1.\n\nSo, in this case, sin(\u03c0x/2) > x for all x in (0,1), so there is no fixed point.\n\nTherefore, this is another counterexample to the statement.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but I thought that in compact intervals, the intermediate value theorem could be applied to show the existence of a fixed point, but here, (0,1) is not compact, which might be why the statement fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a theorem that requires the domain to be a compact interval for the fixed-point property to hold.\n\nLet me check.\n\nI recall Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, which states that any continuous function from a compact convex set to itself has a fixed point. But here, (0,1) is not compact.\n\nSo, perhaps that's why the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different theorem for open intervals.\n\nBut based on my examples, it seems that not every continuous function from (0,1) to (0,1) has a fixed point.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
