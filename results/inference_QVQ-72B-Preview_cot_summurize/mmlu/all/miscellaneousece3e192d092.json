                    "text": "Let's see here. The question is about an early-nineteenth-century railroad steam engine, and it wants to know which type of power system this is an example of. The options are:\n\nA. Internal combustion engine\n\nB. External combustion engine\n\nC. Rotary engine\n\nD. Reaction engine\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a steam engine is and how it works. I know that steam engines were crucial during the Industrial Revolution and were used in trains, among other applications. But specifically, what kind of engine is it?\n\nLet me recall what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the internal combustion engine (option A): this is where the combustion of fuel occurs inside the engine itself, typically in cylinders, and the expanding gases directly drive the mechanical components. Cars usually have internal combustion engines, either gasoline or diesel.\n\nNext, external combustion engine (option B): in this case, the fuel is burned outside the engine, and the energy is transferred to the engine through a working fluid, like steam. So, in a steam engine, the fuel (coal, wood, etc.) is burned in a boiler to produce steam, which then drives the engine.\n\nRotary engine (option C): this refers to engines where the rotating motion is continuous, unlike piston engines that have reciprocating parts. Wankel engines are a type of rotary engine.\n\nReaction engine (option D): this term is a bit more abstract. It generally refers to an engine that propels by reaction propulsion, like rockets or jet engines, where the engine expels mass in one direction to move in the opposite direction.\n\nGiven this background, a steam engine seems to fit into the external combustion engine category because the combustion happens outside the engine, in the boiler, and the steam produced is used to drive the engine.\n\nBut let me double-check. In a steam engine, you have a boiler where fuel is burned to heat water and produce steam. This steam is then directed into the engine, where it expands and does work, typically on pistons or turbines.\n\nSo, the combustion is happening separately in the boiler, not inside the engine itself. That sounds like an external combustion engine.\n\nOn the other hand, an internal combustion engine would have the fuel burned directly inside the engine, like in the cylinders of a car engine.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption C, rotary engine: while there are steam turbines that rotate, the early nineteenth-century railroad steam engines were likely using reciprocating piston engines, not rotary engines.\n\nOption D, reaction engine: this doesn't seem to apply here. Reaction engines are more about expelling mass to produce thrust, like in rockets or jets, which isn't the primary operating principle of a steam engine in a train.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is B. External combustion engine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
