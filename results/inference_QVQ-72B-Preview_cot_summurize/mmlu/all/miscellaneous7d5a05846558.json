J Crew.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these isn't under the Gap Inc. umbrella.\n\nFirst off, I know that Gap Inc. is a big retail company that owns several clothing and fashion brands. The options are Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and J Crew. Let me think about each one individually.\n\nStarting with option A, Gap. That seems straightforward. Gap Inc. is named after Gap, so it must be owned by them, right? Yeah, I'm pretty confident that Gap is part of Gap Inc.\n\nNext is option B, Banana Republic. I recall that Banana Republic was acquired by Gap Inc. back in the 1980s. So, unless something has changed recently, I believe Banana Republic is still owned by Gap Inc.\n\nNow, option C, Old Navy. Old Navy is another popular clothing retailer. I think it was also started by Gap Inc. as a more affordable option compared to their main Gap stores. So, if that's the case, Old Navy should be owned by Gap Inc.\n\nLastly, option D, J Crew. J Crew is another fashion retailer, but I don't recall if it's part of Gap Inc.'s portfolio. Let me see... I think J Crew is its own separate company. In fact, I remember hearing about J Crew having some financial issues a few years back, but I don't think Gap Inc. was involved in that.\n\nLet me double-check my thoughts. Gap Inc. owns Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. J Crew seems to be an independent company. So, based on that, the answer should be D. J Crew.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that nothing has changed recently. Maybe I should look up the current list of brands owned by Gap Inc. to confirm.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I find that Gap Inc.'s brand portfolio includes Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and Intermix. But J Crew is not listed among them. So, my initial thought is correct; J Crew is not owned by Gap Inc.\n\nJust to be thorough, I check who owns J Crew. It turns out that J Crew is owned by J Crew Group Inc., which has been through some ownership changes over the years, including private equity buyouts. But it's definitely not owned by Gap Inc.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the store that is not owned by Gap Inc. among the given options is J Crew.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
