                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about group theory. I'm not super confident with subgroups and cosets yet, so I need to break this down.\n\nFirst statement: \"If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then |aH| = |Ha|.\"\n\nOkay, so aH and Ha are left and right cosets, respectively. I remember that in group theory, cosets of a subgroup have the same size. But is this always true that |aH| = |Ha| for any a in G?\n\nLet me think about the definitions. A left coset aH is the set {ah : h \u2208 H}, and a right coset Ha is {ha : h \u2208 H}. In general, for arbitrary a and H, these don't have to be equal. But the question is about their sizes, not their equality.\n\nI think there's a theorem that says that all left cosets of a subgroup H in G have the same number of elements, and similarly for right cosets. So |aH| = |H| and |Ha| = |H|, assuming H is finite. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that G or H is finite. Does this still hold for infinite groups?\n\nI need to recall. Actually, the concept of cosets and their equivalence classes still applies, and the size of each coset is the same as H, whether finite or infinite. So |aH| = |H| = |Ha| for any a in G. So the first statement seems true.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose G is infinite. For example, G = Z (integers under addition), and H = 2Z (even integers). Then a left coset a + H would be {a + 2k : k \u2208 Z}, and a right coset H + a would be {2k + a : k \u2208 Z}, which is the same set. So |aH| = |Ha| = |H| = |Z|, which is aleph-null, the cardinality of the integers.\n\nAnother example: G = R (real numbers under addition), H = Q (rationals). Then a + H = H + a = {a + q : q \u2208 Q}, which is just a translate of the rationals, which is still countably infinite. So |aH| = |H| = |Q| = aleph-null.\n\nWhat if G is infinite but H is finite? Like G = Z, H = {0,1}. Wait, in Z under addition, H = {0,1} isn't a subgroup because it's not closed under addition (1+1=2, which is not in H). So that's not a valid subgroup.\n\nLet me try another example: G = Z_2 x Z_2 (Klein four-group), H = {(0,0), (1,0)}. Then a left coset aH and a right coset Ha should both have size 2, since |H| = 2.\n\nWait, but Z_2 x Z_2 is a finite group. Maybe I need to think about non-abelian groups to see if anything changes.\n\nConsider G = S_3, the symmetric group on 3 letters, and H = <(12)>, the subgroup generated by (12), which has order 2.\n\nThen for a in S_3, say a = (13), then aH = {(13)(12), (13)(e)} = {(13)(12), (13)} and Ha = {(12)(13), (e)(13)} = {(12)(13), (13)}. So in this case, aH = Ha, and their sizes are equal to |H| = 2.\n\nBut in general, in non-abelian groups, left and right cosets can be different sets, but their sizes are the same.\n\nSo, based on this, the first statement is true: |aH| = |Ha| for any a in G.\n\nNow, the second statement: \"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.\"\n\nWait a minute, this seems off. First, aH is a left coset, and Hb is a right coset. Are these even comparable directly?\n\nI think there might be a confusion here. Typically, we compare left cosets with left cosets and right cosets with right cosets.\n\nIn any case, in group theory, the left cosets of a subgroup H partition G, meaning every element of G is in exactly one left coset, so any two left cosets are either identical or disjoint. Similarly, right cosets partition G.\n\nBut the statement is mixing left and right cosets. It says aH and Hb. Are these necessarily identical or disjoint?\n\nFrom the examples earlier, in S_3, with H = <(12)>, and a = b = (13), then aH = {(13)(12), (13)} and Hb = {(12)(13), (e)(13)}, which are the same set. So in this case, they are identical.\n\nBut what if a and b are different?\n\nLet me pick a = e (the identity), b = (12). Then eH = H, and H(12) = {(12), e(12)} = {(12), (12)}.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. In S_3, H = <(12)> = {e, (12)}, so H(12) = {(12)(12), e(12)} = {e, (12)}.\n\nWait, but (12)(12) = e, and e(12) = (12), so H(12) = {e, (12)} = H.\n\nSo in this case, eH = H and H(12) = H, so they are identical.\n\nAnother example: G = Z, H = 2Z, a = 0, b = 1.\n\nThen 0 + H = {0 + 2k : k \u2208 Z} = {even integers}, and H + 1 = {2k + 1 : k \u2208 Z} = {odd integers}.\n\nThese are different sets; one is even integers, the other is odd integers. So aH and Hb are disjoint in this case.\n\nIs there a scenario where aH and Hb are neither identical nor disjoint?\n\nLet me see. Suppose G = Z_2 x Z_2, H = {(0,0), (1,0)}, a = (0,0), b = (1,1).\n\nThen aH = {(0,0) + (0,0), (0,0) + (1,0)} = {(0,0), (1,0)}\n\nAnd Hb = {(0,0) + (1,1), (1,0) + (1,1)} = {(1,1), (0,1)}\n\nThese two sets have no elements in common, so they are disjoint.\n\nAnother example: G = Z_4, H = <2> = {0, 2}, a = 0, b = 1.\n\nThen 0 + H = {0, 2}, and H + 1 = {1, 3}.\n\nAgain, disjoint.\n\nIt seems like in these examples, aH and Hb are either identical or disjoint. But is this always the case?\n\nLet me consider a non-abelian group again, like S_3.\n\nTake H = <(12)>, a = (13), b = (123).\n\nThen aH = {(13)(12), (13)} = {(13)(12), (13)} = {(123), (13)}\n\nAnd Hb = {(12)(123), e(123)} = {(12)(123), (123)} = {(132), (123)}\n\nThese two sets have (123) in common, so they are not disjoint. But they are not identical either, since aH = {(123), (13)} and Hb = {(132), (123)}.\n\nWait, but (132) is not in aH, and (13) is not in Hb. So they are not identical.\n\nBut they are not disjoint either, since they both contain (123). So in this case, they are neither identical nor disjoint, which contradicts the statement.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
