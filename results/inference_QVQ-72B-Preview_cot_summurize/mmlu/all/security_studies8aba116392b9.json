                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept of securitization, and specifically, why an issue might fail to become securitized. Let's see, securitization seems to involve a process where an issue is framed as a security threat that requires urgent and extraordinary measures to address it. There are several steps in this process, and if any of them don't go as planned, securitization can fail.\n\nFirst, there's the securitizing actor, who could be a political leader, a government agency, or some other entity that perceives a threat and tries to convince others that this threat is so severe that it needs exceptional actions to be taken. This actor performs a speech act, which is essentially a public declaration that presents the issue as an existential danger.\n\nNow, for securitization to succeed, this speech act has to be accepted by the audience, which could be the general public, policymakers, or other relevant stakeholders. The audience needs to be convinced that the threat is indeed urgent and severe enough to warrant bypassing normal political procedures and possibly civil liberties.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat.\n\nThis seems straightforward. If the public doesn't buy into the idea that there's a real, imminent danger, then they're unlikely to support granting special powers or taking extraordinary measures. So, if the securitizing actor fails to persuade the public that there's a legitimate threat, securitization is likely to fail.\n\nB. When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The discursive element refers to the part of the process where the securitizing actor communicates the threat and tries to build consensus around it. If, after this discourse, extraordinary measures are not implemented, it might be because the audience wasn't fully convinced, or perhaps there were obstacles in the policy-making process.\n\nBut wait, securitization theory suggests that the successful securitization of an issue leads to the implementation of extraordinary measures. So, if these measures aren't put in place, it could indicate that securitization failed at some stage.\n\nC. When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures.\n\nThis seems closely related to option D. The securitizing actor needs to be authorized by the audience to take exceptional actions. If the audience agrees that there's a severe threat but doesn't trust the actor to handle it, or doesn't agree to give them the necessary powers, then securitization fails.\n\nD. When the audience is convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fails to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\n\nThis option builds on option C. Even if the audience is convinced of the threat's severity, they might not grant the actor the special rights or powers to implement extraordinary measures. This could be due to concerns about potential abuse of power, distrust in the actor, or disagreement over the specific measures proposed.\n\nSo, in this case, securitization fails because, although the threat is recognized, the means to address it aren't agreed upon.\n\nNow, to answer the question: When may an issue fail to become securitized?\n\nI think all of these options point to different scenarios where securitization can fail.\n\nOption A highlights the importance of persuading the audience of the threat's legitimacy. Without this, securitization doesn't get off the ground.\n\nOption B suggests that failure to implement extraordinary measures indicates securitization failure, which could be due to various reasons, including lack of audience support or practical constraints.\n\nOption C focuses on the authorization step, where the audience needs to grant the actor the right to take extraordinary measures.\n\nOption D specifies a situation where the audience is convinced of the threat but doesn't grant the actor the special rights needed to act.\n\nSo, all these options are potential points of failure in the securitization process.\n\nBut perhaps I need to think about which one is the most direct or common cause of securitization failure.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose a government official claims that climate change is an existential threat that requires immediate and drastic actions, such as banning fossil fuels overnight and investing heavily in renewable energy.\n\nFor this securitization attempt to succeed, several things need to happen:\n\n1. The audience (public, policymakers) needs to accept that climate change is indeed an existential threat (option A).\n\n2. The audience needs to agree that extraordinary measures are necessary to address it.\n\n3. The audience needs to trust the securitizing actor enough to grant them the special rights or powers to implement these measures (options C and D).\n\nIf any of these steps fail, securitization fails.\n\nFor instance, if the audience doesn't believe that climate change is a severe threat (option A), they won't support extraordinary measures. Alternatively, they might agree that it's a significant issue but not an existential one, hence not justifying exceptional actions.\n\nOr, they might agree that it's a severe threat but don't trust the securitizing actor to handle it responsibly (options C and D). Maybe they doubt the actor's motives or competence, or they disagree with the specific measures proposed.\n\nOption B is a bit different because it refers to the actual implementation of extraordinary measures. If these measures aren't put in place, it could be because the securitization attempt failed at any of the previous stages, or due to other factors like legal constraints, resource limitations, or opposition from other powerful actors.\n\nSo, in summary, an issue may fail to become securitized when:\n\n- The audience isn't convinced of the threat's legitimacy (option A).\n\n- The securitizing actor isn't granted the special rights to implement extraordinary measures (options C and D).\n\nOption B is more of an outcome indicating that securitization has failed, but it doesn't specify the reason.\n\nTherefore, all of the above options can lead to securitization failure, but perhaps option D is the most comprehensive because it encompasses both the persuasion aspect and the authorization aspect.\n\nWait, but option D says, \"When the audience is convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fails to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\"\n\nSo, it's a scenario where the audience is convinced of the threat but doesn't grant the special rights. This could be because they don't trust the actor, or they disagree with the proposed measures, or they think that extraordinary measures are unnecessary despite agreeing that there's a threat.\n\nThis seems like a common scenario where securitization attempts fail. For example, in the case of terrorism, a government might successfully convince the public that terrorism is a severe threat, but the public might resist granting extensive surveillance powers or other civil liberty intrusions to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, option A is about failing to convince the audience of the threat's legitimacy in the first place. This could also lead to securitization failure. For instance, if a government tries to securitize immigration by claiming it's a existential threat, but the public doesn't buy into that framing, securitization fails.\n\nOption C is similar to option D but more focused on the authorization step. It says that if the securitizing actor isn't granted the special rights, securitization fails. This is indeed a critical point.\n\nOption B seems more of an outcome rather than a direct cause of failure. If extraordinary measures aren't implemented, it could be due to failure at any of the previous stages, or due to other factors.\n\nSo, in conclusion, all of these options can lead to securitization failure, but perhaps option D is the most precise because it captures the scenario where the audience is convinced of the threat but doesn't grant the necessary special rights, which is a common hurdle in securitization processes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
