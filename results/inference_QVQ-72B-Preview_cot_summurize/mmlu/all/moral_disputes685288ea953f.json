                    "text": "Okay, so I'm trying to understand this argument about embryos and whether they are considered persons based on their mental capacities. Lee and George are responding to someone who says that embryos aren't persons because they don't exercise higher mental capacities. And I have to choose which of these options best represents their response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"higher mental capacities\" means. I think it refers to things like consciousness, self-awareness, reasoning, and maybe memory. So, the argument is that since embryos don't have these abilities, they shouldn't be considered persons.\n\nNow, Lee and George are disagreeing with this view. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.\n\nThis seems straightforward. If Lee and George are arguing that embryos do have and use these higher mental capacities, then this would directly counter the original argument. But I have some doubts here because embryos, especially in their early stages, don't appear to have developed brains capable of complex mental functions. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nB. It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.\n\nThis option suggests that the concept of \"exercising\" higher mental capacities is flawed or meaningless. Maybe they're arguing that mental capacities are just properties of being a person and don't require active exercise. But I'm not entirely sure what they mean by this. It seems a bit vague.\n\nC. The argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.\n\nThis one is interesting. \"Sound\" usually means that the argument is valid and its premises are true. But then they say its validity fails due to a logical fallacy. That seems contradictory because if an argument is sound, it can't have a logical fallacy. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this option. Perhaps they mean that the argument seems plausible at first glance but actually contains a logical error.\n\nD. To have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\n\nThis seems to be a personal identity argument. It's suggesting that if an embryo has the potential to develop into you, then harming it is equivalent to harming you. This is a common argument in ethics, particularly in discussions about abortion and embryo research.\n\nGiven that Lee and George are responding to the claim that embryos aren't persons because they lack higher mental capacities, I need to see which of these options directly addresses that specific claim.\n\nOption A suggests that embryos do have these capacities, but as I thought earlier, this might not align with scientific understanding of embryonic development.\n\nOption B questions the meaning of \"exercising\" higher mental capacities, which might be a way to challenge the premise, but it's not directly addressing whether embryos are persons or not.\n\nOption C seems confusing because it says the argument is sound but also invalid, which doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in how it's phrased.\n\nOption D presents a different angle, focusing on potentiality and personal identity, suggesting that an embryo is essentially the same as the person it will become.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option D is the most relevant response to the original argument. Lee and George are likely arguing that even though an embryo doesn't currently have higher mental capacities, it has the potential to develop into a person with those capacities, and thus it should be treated with the same respect and consideration as a person.\n\nThis kind of argument is often used in ethics to suggest that entities with the potential to become persons should be afforded moral consideration, even if they don't currently possess certain characteristics typically associated with personhood.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D: to have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
