                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem about three steel containers holding different gases: helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Each container is the same size and at the same temperature. The masses are given: 4.0 g of helium, 28.0 g of nitrogen, and 44.0 g of carbon dioxide. I need to pick the false statement from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each option is saying and see which one doesn't hold true under these conditions.\n\nOption A says that the densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n\nDensity is mass per unit volume. Since all containers are the same size (same volume), the density depends on the mass of the gas inside. So, if container A has 4 g and container B has 28 g, and container C has 44 g, then yes, densities would be in that order: 4 < 28 < 44. So, this seems correct, but maybe I should double-check with actual densities.\n\nOption B says that the number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n\nHmm, number of molecules depends on the number of moles of the gas, since one mole of any gas has the same number of molecules (Avogadro's number). So, I need to find out how many moles are in each container.\n\nTo find moles, I can use the formula:\n\nn = m / M\n\nWhere n is moles, m is mass in grams, and M is molar mass in grams per mole.\n\nLet's find the molar masses:\n\n- Helium (He): atomic number 2, molar mass approximately 4 g/mol.\n\n- Nitrogen (N\u2082): molecular mass approximately 28 g/mol.\n\n- Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082): molecular mass approximately 44 g/mol.\n\nNow, calculate moles for each:\n\n- Helium: 4 g / 4 g/mol = 1 mole.\n\n- Nitrogen: 28 g / 28 g/mol = 1 mole.\n\n- Carbon dioxide: 44 g / 44 g/mol = 1 mole.\n\nSo, all containers have 1 mole of gas. Therefore, the number of molecules is the same in each container (Avogadro's number, N_A, which is approximately 6.022 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 molecules per mole).\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nOption C says that the pressure in all three containers is the same.\n\nPressure of a gas depends on temperature, volume, and number of moles, according to the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nWhere P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nGiven that V, n, and T are the same for all containers, then P should be the same for all.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nOption D says that the average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n\nHmm, is that right? I thought that at the same temperature, different gases have different average speeds because their molecular masses differ.\n\nI recall that the average speed (root mean square speed, rms) of gas molecules is given by:\n\nv_rms = sqrt(3RT / M)\n\nWhere R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass in kg/mol.\n\nSince T is the same for all containers, and M differs, v_rms should be different for each gas.\n\nLet's calculate v_rms for each:\n\nFirst, convert molar masses to kg/mol:\n\n- Helium: 4 g/mol = 0.004 kg/mol.\n\n- Nitrogen: 28 g/mol = 0.028 kg/mol.\n\n- Carbon dioxide: 44 g/mol = 0.044 kg/mol.\n\nAssuming temperature T is constant, let's see how v_rms relates to M.\n\nFrom the formula, v_rms is inversely proportional to the square root of M.\n\nSo, the lighter the gas, the faster its molecules move at the same temperature.\n\nSo, helium, being the lightest, should have the highest v_rms, followed by nitrogen and then carbon dioxide.\n\nTherefore, option D is false because the average speeds are not the same; they differ based on the molar masses of the gases.\n\nSo, the false statement is option D: \"The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
