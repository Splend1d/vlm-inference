The options are A. a[i] == max, B. a[i] != max, C. a[i] < max || a[i] > max, or D. FALSE. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what this expression is saying. It's a boolean expression, so it'll evaluate to either true or false based on the values of a[i] and max.\n\nThe expression is: a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]).\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst part: a[i] == max. That's checking if the element at index i of array a is equal to max.\n\nSecond part: !(max != a[i]). So, max != a[i] checks if max is not equal to a[i]. The ! in front negates that, so !(max != a[i]) is true when max is equal to a[i].\n\nSo, overall, the expression is true if either a[i] == max is true, or if !(max != a[i]) is true. But !(max != a[i]) is just another way of saying a[i] == max because they are logically equivalent.\n\nWait a minute, yes, !(max != a[i]) is the same as saying a[i] == max.\n\nSo, the expression is a[i] == max || a[i] == max.\n\nThat means the whole expression simplifies to just a[i] == max.\n\nSo, option A. a[i] == max seems to be the correct simplification.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIs there any scenario where a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]) would not be equivalent to a[i] == max?\n\nWell, since !(max != a[i]) is indeed the same as a[i] == max, there's no way they differ.\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to a[i] == max.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. a[i] == max.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ a[i] == max}} \\]"
