                    "text": "So Sheila has 5 minutes to solve 20 arithmetic problems. I need to figure out the minimum rate she can work at to finish in time. The options are 1, 2, 4, or 5 problems per minute.\n\nFirst, I should understand what rate means in this context. Rate here is probably how many problems she solves per minute. So, if she works at a rate of 1 problem per minute, in 5 minutes, she would solve 5 problems. But she has 20 problems, so that's not enough.\n\nLet me try to calculate it. If she has 20 problems and 5 minutes, her required rate is 20 problems divided by 5 minutes, which is 4 problems per minute. So, option C, 4 problems per minute, seems to be the minimum she needs to finish in time.\n\nBut wait, let's think about it again. If she does 4 per minute, in 5 minutes, she does 4 times 5, which is 20 problems. That's exactly what she needs. So, 4 is the minimum rate to finish in exactly 5 minutes.\n\nBut is there a slower rate where she could still finish in less than 5 minutes? Well, no, because if she works slower than 4 per minute, say 3 per minute, in 5 minutes she would only do 15 problems, which is less than 20. So, she wouldn't finish in time.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor to consider. Maybe she can solve problems faster as time goes on, like improving speed, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says she has 5 minutes to solve 20 problems, assuming a constant rate.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the minimum rate she needs is 4 problems per minute to finish in exactly 5 minutes. If she wants to finish earlier, she'd need a higher rate, like 5 per minute, which would allow her to finish in 4 minutes (since 5 times 4 is 20). But the question is asking for the minimum rate to finish in time, which is 5 minutes.\n\nWait, but the options include 5 problems per minute. If she works at 5 per minute, in 5 minutes she would do 25 problems, which is more than 20. So, that's faster than needed, but still, it's a higher rate than necessary.\n\nThe question is, what's the minimum rate she can work at to finish in time, which I think is 4 per minute, because at 4 per minute, she finishes exactly in 5 minutes.\n\nBut let's double-check. If she works at 3 per minute, in 5 minutes she does 15 problems, which is less than 20, so she wouldn't finish in time. At 4 per minute, she does exactly 20, which is perfect. At 5 per minute, she does 25, which is more than needed, but still finishes in time.\n\nSo, the minimum rate required is 4 problems per minute.\n\nI think the answer is C. 4 problems per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
