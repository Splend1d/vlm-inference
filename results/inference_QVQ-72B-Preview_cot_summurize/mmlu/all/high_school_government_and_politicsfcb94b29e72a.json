                    "text": "So I've got this question here about voter turnout, and it's asking which category of voters would be least likely to vote. The options are:\n\nA. Blue-collar workers who belong to a union\n\nB. Professionals\n\nC. Voters who are active in their political parties\n\nD. Voters aged 18-29\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that voter turnout can vary based on different factors like age, socioeconomic status, education, and political engagement. So, each of these categories probably has some relationship to how likely someone is to vote.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: blue-collar workers who belong to a union. Now, blue-collar workers are typically associated with manual labor or trade jobs, and they often belong to unions for better wages and working conditions. Unions are known to be active in political processes, often advocating for their members' interests and sometimes mobilizing voters. So, if someone is a blue-collar worker and belongs to a union, might they be more or less likely to vote?\n\nI recall that unions sometimes run get-out-the-vote campaigns and are involved in political activities, which could increase voter turnout among their members. So, maybe they're more likely to vote rather than less.\n\nMoving on to option B: professionals. Professionals are people like doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc., who usually have higher education and are in higher-income brackets. These individuals might have more resources and knowledge about the political system, which could make them more likely to vote. Additionally, their socioeconomic status might give them a greater stake in the political process. So, again, this seems like a group that might have higher, not lower, voter turnout.\n\nOption C: voters who are active in their political parties. This seems straightforward. If someone is active in a political party, they're likely more engaged and interested in the political process. Party activists are often highly motivated to vote because they want to see their party's candidates succeed. So, this group should have very high voter turnout rates.\n\nFinally, option D: voters aged 18-29. This is the youngest voting-age group, and I've heard that younger people tend to have lower voter turnout rates compared to older voters. There are several reasons for this, including being less established in their careers, moving more frequently, and perhaps not being as interested or informed about politics yet. Additionally, first-time voters might not be as familiar with the voting process.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the group that would be least likely to vote is D. Voters aged 18-29.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. In many countries, including the United States, voter turnout is indeed lower among younger age groups. For example, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the voter turnout for the 18-24 age group was significantly lower compared to older age groups. So, this aligns with my thought.\n\nOn the other hand, blue-collar workers in unions might actually have higher turnout due to union mobilization efforts. Professionals are likely to vote at higher rates because of their socioeconomic status, and active party members are highly engaged and thus more likely to vote.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Voters aged 18-29.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
