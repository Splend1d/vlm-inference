The predicates are:\n\n- Cx: x is a child\n\n- Sx: x is a school\n\n- Gxy: x goes to y\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statement is saying. \"All children go to some school\" means that for every child, there exists at least one school that the child goes to.\n\nSo, in logical terms, for every x, if x is a child, then there exists some y such that y is a school and x goes to y.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(\u2200x)(Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(S y \u2227 G(x,y)))\n\nWait, but in standard logical notation, we usually write predicates without the spaces, and sometimes with commas to separate variables. So, G(x,y) is correct, but I should make sure about the syntax.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy]\n\nB. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nC. (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nD. (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nI need to match my understanding of the statement with these options.\n\nFirst, option A: (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Cx \u2022 Sy) \u2022 Gxy]\n\nThis says that for every x, there exists a y such that x is a child and y is a school, and x goes to y.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that for every x, there is a y that is both a child and a school and x goes to y. That doesn't seem right. Because y can't be both a school and a child at the same time. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: (\u2200x)[Sx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis says that for every x, if x is a school, then there exists a y such that y is a child and x goes to y.\n\nBut this seems to suggest that every school has at least one child going to it, which isn't what the original statement says. The original statement is about children going to schools, not schools having children going to them.\n\nSo, this also doesn't match.\n\nOption C: (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis says that for every x, if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y.\n\nThis seems to match my initial understanding of the statement. It says that for every child, there is at least one school that the child goes to.\n\nOption D: (\u2200x)[Sx \u2022 (\u2203y)(Cy \u2022 Gxy)]\n\nThis says that for every x, if x is a school, and there exists a y that is a child and x goes to y.\n\nWait, this seems similar to option B but with a different logical structure. It's saying that every school is such that there exists a child who goes to it. Again, this is about schools having children going to them, not about children going to schools.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct translation of the statement \"All children go to some school.\"\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again.\n\nThe statement is about children going to schools. So, for every child, there should be at least one school that the child attends.\n\nOption C says (\u2200x)[Cx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Sy \u2022 Gxy)], which means for every x, if x is a child, then there exists some y which is a school and x goes to y.\n\nYes, that captures exactly what the statement is saying.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
