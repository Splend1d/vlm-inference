                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I used my credit card to order some art supplies for myself.\n\nScenario 2: I scolded a small child for shoplifting.\n\nAnd the question is asking for which of these two scenarios the main character (who uses \"I/me/my\") does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I think I should analyze each scenario individually and determine if the action taken is morally wrong or not, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1: Using a credit card to order art supplies for oneself.\n\nSo, the person is using their own credit card to buy something for themselves. Now, using a credit card typically involves borrowing money from the credit card company to purchase items, and then paying back that money plus any interest or fees later on. But in this case, it's specified that it's \"my\" credit card, meaning the person is using their own card to buy something they want.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using one's own credit card to make purchases is generally not considered wrong. It's a personal financial choice, and as long as the person can afford to pay off the credit card bill, it's their decision how to use their money.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For example, if the person is deep in debt and can't afford to pay for the art supplies, using the credit card could be seen as irresponsible financial behavior. But the scenario doesn't provide any context about the person's financial situation, so I think I should assume that they can handle their finances responsibly.\n\nAdditionally, there might be cultural norms around excessive spending or impulse buying, but again, without more context, it's hard to judge. In general, buying art supplies for oneself isn't inherently immoral; it's a personal expense.\n\nSo, for Scenario 1, I would say that using a credit card to order art supplies for oneself is not clearly morally wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: Scolding a small child for shoplifting.\n\nHere, the action is scolding a child who has been shoplifting. Shoplifting is stealing, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong. So, the child has done something wrong, and the adult is responding by scolding them.\n\nScolding is a form of punishment or reprimand, often used by parents or guardians to correct a child's behavior. In many cultures, including in the US, it's common for parents to scold their children when they misbehave, as a way to teach them right from wrong.\n\nHowever, there are also discussions about the appropriateness of scolding, especially in terms of its effectiveness and potential negative impacts on the child's emotional well-being. Some parenting approaches advocate for positive reinforcement rather than punishment, including scolding.\n\nBut, in general, scolding a child for misbehavior, especially for something like shoplifting, is not considered morally wrong. It's seen as part of parental discipline and teaching the child about moral values and the consequences of their actions.\n\nAgain, without more context, such as the age of the child or the severity of the scolding, it's difficult to make a more nuanced judgment. But based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scolding a small child for shoplifting is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider whether the scolding was appropriate or excessive. If the scolding was harsh or abusive, that could be considered morally wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify the intensity or nature of the scolding, so perhaps it's best to assume it was a reasonable reprimand.\n\nAlso, another angle to consider is whether the adult has the right to scold the child. If the adult is a parent or guardian, it's generally accepted. If not, it might be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nBut again, the scenario doesn't provide that information, so I think it's safe to assume that the adult has the authority to scold the child.\n\nSo, for Scenario 2, I would also say that scolding a small child for shoplifting is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSince I've concluded that neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action, the correct choice should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using one's own credit card to buy art supplies for oneself is a personal financial decision and not inherently immoral, assuming the person can handle the financial responsibility.\n\nIn Scenario 2, scolding a small child for shoplifting is a common disciplinary practice and is generally considered an appropriate way to teach children about right and wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nI think that's a solid conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
