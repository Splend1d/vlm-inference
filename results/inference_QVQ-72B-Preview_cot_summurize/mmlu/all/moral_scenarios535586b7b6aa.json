                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are both \"wrong,\" both \"not wrong,\" or one wrong and one not wrong. Let me think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I frequently encouraged criminals to counteract the police force.\" So, someone is encouraging criminals to go against the police. Hmm, that sounds pretty bad right off the bat. The police are generally seen as upholding law and order, and criminals are, well, breaking the law. Encouraging criminals to counteract the police seems like it's supporting lawlessness or crime, which is against the norm in society.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe there's a context where someone might see the police as unjust, and therefore, they might encourage actions against them. For example, if there's perceived police brutality or corruption, some people might feel justified in opposing the police. However, even in such cases, encouraging criminal behavior is still generally considered wrong because it promotes breaking the law and potentially harms public safety.\n\nMoreover, in the US, there's a strong emphasis on the rule of law and the authority of law enforcement agencies like the police. Undermining that authority without proper legal channels could be seen as morally wrong. So, in this scenario, it seems like the person is doing something morally wrong by encouraging criminals to counteract the police.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I sang a romantic song for my wife at her dad's funeral.\" Okay, so someone sang a romantic song for their wife at her father's funeral. At first glance, this might seem like a sweet gesture, but considering the setting is a funeral, which is a somber occasion, it might be inappropriate.\n\nFunerals are typically times of mourning and respect for the deceased and their family. Singing a romantic song might be seen as insensitive or inappropriate because it's a celebration of love in a context where people are grieving. It might shift the focus away from honoring the deceased to celebrating the singer's relationship with their wife.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the song had special meaning related to the deceased or was a way to comfort the wife in her grief. But even then, it's still a bit unusual to choose a romantic song in that setting.\n\nI think most people in the US would consider this action morally wrong or at least highly inappropriate because it disrespects the solemnity of the occasion and could be seen as self-centered.\n\nSo, to sum it up, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1 involves encouraging criminal behavior against the police, which is against the rule of law and public safety. Scenario 2 involves singing a romantic song at a funeral, which is seen as insensitive and disrespectful to the occasion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's a different perspective. For example, in Scenario 1, if the person believes that the police are unjust and corrupt, perhaps they see their actions as a form of resistance or protest. However, even in that case, encouraging criminal behavior is not typically considered a morally acceptable way to address perceived injustices in law enforcement.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, maybe the song was intended to celebrate the life of the deceased or to offer comfort in a personal way. But even with good intentions, the choice of a romantic song at a funeral is generally seen as inappropriate and could be hurtful to the family and attendees.\n\nSo, after considering both scenarios carefully, I still believe that both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
