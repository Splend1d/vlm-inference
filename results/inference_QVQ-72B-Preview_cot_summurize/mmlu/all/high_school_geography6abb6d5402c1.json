                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"If you wanted to find the global distribution of coal, you would use a ___. \" And the options are A. reference map, B. topographic map, C. thematic map, and D. location map. Hmm, I need to figure out which type of map would show where coal is found around the world.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each type of map is used for. Starting with a reference map, I think those are general-purpose maps that show things like countries, cities, rivers, and roads. They're like the basic maps you find in atlases. So, would that show the distribution of coal? Not really, I don't think. Coal deposits aren't usually marked on reference maps.\n\nNext, there's the topographic map. I remember these are detailed maps that show elevations, contours, and natural features like mountains and valleys. They're great for hiking and understanding the physical landscape, but again, I don't think they specifically mark where coal is located. Maybe indirectly, if there are areas known for mining, but not directly showing coal deposits.\n\nThen there's the thematic map. This sounds interesting. Thematic maps focus on specific themes or data sets, like population density, temperature, or types of vegetation. So, maybe this would be the right choice for showing the distribution of coal. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLastly, there's the location map. That sounds like it might show specific places or locations, perhaps with landmarks or addresses. Again, not sure if that would show coal distribution.\n\nLet me think about this again. I need a map that shows where coal is found globally. So, it's about displaying data related to coal deposits or reserves around the world. Reference maps might show some industrial areas, but not specifically coal. Topographic maps could hint at areas where coal might be found based on geology, but they don't explicitly mark the presence of coal. Location maps seem more about pinpointing specific places rather than distributing resources.\n\nThematic maps, on the other hand, are designed to show specific types of data overlaid on a map. So, if I wanted to see where coal is located globally, a thematic map would be the most suitable option. It could show areas with coal deposits, maybe even with different symbols or colors indicating the amount or type of coal.\n\nWait a minute, is there another term I should consider? Maybe a resource map? That sounds like it would show natural resources like coal, oil, or minerals. But looking back at the options, none of them mention resource maps. So, perhaps thematic maps include resource maps.\n\nLet me do a quick search to confirm. Oh, according to some sources, thematic maps can indeed focus on various themes, including natural resources like coal. So, that seems to align with what I'm looking for.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other type of map that might also show coal distribution. For example, an economic map might show mining areas or coal production sites. But again, that's more about the economic activity related to coal rather than the actual distribution of the resource itself.\n\nA geological map could also be relevant since coal is a fossil fuel and is found in specific rock formations. However, geological maps can be quite detailed and might not be the best for a global distribution view. Plus, they focus more on the types of rocks and geological structures rather than specifically on coal deposits.\n\nSo, between thematic map and geological map, thematic map seems more appropriate for showing the distribution of coal on a global scale. Geological maps might be more useful for detailed studies in specific regions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. thematic map.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. thematic map}} \\]"
