                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about price discrimination. It says, \"When the opportunity for price discrimination arises,\" and then there are four options. I need to pick the correct one. I'm a bit rusty on price discrimination, but let me think this through.\n\nFirst off, price discrimination is when a seller charges different prices to different buyers for the same product, right? But it's not just arbitrary; there has to be a reason they can get away with it. Like, maybe different customers have different willingness to pay, or different elasticities of demand.\n\nOption A says that market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If demand is elastic, that means customers are sensitive to price changes. So, if you raise the price, demand drops a lot. So, why would firms charge higher prices to elastic demand segments? That seems counterintuitive because if they do, those customers might just buy less or go elsewhere.\n\nOption B says that market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices. But wait, if demand is inelastic, customers are not very sensitive to price changes. So, even if you raise the price, they won't buy much less. In that case, it seems like the firm could charge them higher prices without losing much business. So, why would they pay lower prices? This seems opposite to what I'd expect.\n\nOption C says that consumer surplus decreases. Okay, so consumer surplus is the difference between what customers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. In perfect competition, consumer surplus is maximized because prices are low. But in price discrimination, the firm tries to capture more of that surplus by charging different prices. So, if the firm is successful in price discrimination, consumer surplus should decrease because customers are paying closer to their willingness to pay.\n\nOption D says that demand is horizontal. A horizontal demand curve represents perfectly elastic demand, meaning that even a small increase in price will cause demand to drop to zero. That doesn't seem directly related to price discrimination. Price discrimination usually involves segments with different demand elasticities, not a single perfectly elastic demand.\n\nSo, let's recap. Options A and B seem contradictory to what I know about elasticity and pricing. Option C seems plausible because price discrimination typically leads to a transfer of surplus from consumers to the producer. Option D doesn't seem relevant to the concept of price discrimination.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. What is the fundamental goal of price discrimination? It's to extract more consumer surplus by charging different prices based on willingness to pay. So, if a firm can identify customers with higher willingness to pay, it can charge them more, and those with lower willingness to pay, it can charge them less, as long as it's still above marginal cost.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to contradict my earlier thoughts. If a firm can charge higher prices to customers with higher willingness to pay (inelastic demand), and lower prices to those with lower willingness to pay (elastic demand), then maybe option B is correct. But that still doesn't make sense because inelastic demand means customers are less sensitive to price changes, so they might be willing to pay more.\n\nLet me try to think of an example. Suppose there's a movie theater that offers discounted tickets to students. Students might have more time and less income, so their demand for movies might be more elastic\u2014they're more price-sensitive. Non-students might have higher incomes and less time, so their demand might be less elastic\u2014they're willing to pay more regardless of the price.\n\nIn this case, the theater is charging a lower price to the more elastic demand segment (students) and a higher price to the less elastic segment (non-students). So, in this scenario, market segments with more elastic demand pay lower prices, and those with less elastic demand pay higher prices.\n\nWait, that seems to align with option B, but option B says market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices, which contradicts my example. No, hold on. Option B says market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices. But in my example, the segment with inelastic demand (non-students) pays higher prices.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe I misremembered. Let me check a textbook or a reliable source to clarify this.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I find that in price discrimination, firms charge higher prices to customers with inelastic demand and lower prices to customers with elastic demand. So, in my movie theater example, non-students have inelastic demand and pay higher prices, while students have elastic demand and pay lower prices.\n\nSo, according to this, option B is incorrect because it says market segments with relatively inelastic demand pay lower prices, but in reality, they pay higher prices.\n\nSimilarly, option A says market segments with relatively elastic demand pay higher prices, which is also incorrect because they should pay lower prices.\n\nSo, both A and B seem to be incorrect based on this understanding. Option D doesn't make sense because demand being horizontal implies perfectly elastic demand, which isn't the case in price discrimination scenarios where there are different elasticities.\n\nThat leaves option C: consumer surplus decreases. This seems plausible because price discrimination allows the firm to capture more of the consumer surplus by charging different prices based on willingness to pay.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. In some cases, price discrimination can lead to increased total surplus if it allows the firm to sell to more customers who were previously priced out of the market. For example, offering discounts to certain segments might allow them to buy the product when they otherwise couldn't, increasing overall welfare.\n\nHowever, in most cases, price discrimination leads to a transfer of surplus from consumers to the producer, and possibly some deadweight loss due to overproduction or underproduction in some segments.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like the best answer among the choices provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by presenting incomplete options.\n\nLet me consider the concept again. Price discrimination occurs when a firm can segment the market based on different elasticities of demand and charge different prices accordingly.\n\n- First-degree price discrimination: the firm charges each customer their maximum willingness to pay, eliminating all consumer surplus.\n\n- Second-degree price discrimination: customers are charged different prices based on the quantity they purchase, like bulk discounts.\n\n- Third-degree price discrimination: the market is segmented into groups with different demand elasticities, and each segment is charged a different price.\n\nIn all these cases, the firm is trying to capture more consumer surplus by charging prices that are closer to each customer's willingness to pay.\n\nTherefore, consumer surplus decreases as a result of price discrimination, while producer surplus increases.\n\nSo, option C is correct: consumer surplus decreases.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider another example. Suppose a pharmaceutical company has a drug that saves lives. Some patients value their life highly and are willing to pay a lot for the drug, while others can't afford high prices. If the company practices price discrimination, it might charge higher prices to those who can afford more and lower prices to those who can't.\n\nIn this case, the consumer surplus of the high-willingness-to-pay group decreases because they pay closer to their willingness to pay, while the company captures more revenue.\n\nSimilarly, the low-willingness-to-pay group might benefit from lower prices and buy the drug, which they couldn't before, but their consumer surplus might still decrease compared to a uniform price scenario.\n\nOverall, consumer surplus decreases, and producer surplus increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. consumer surplus decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
