Let me see what options I have:\n\nA. criminals were socialized into an 'underworld' of crime\n\nB. no act is intrinsically deviant\n\nC. biological failings drove some people into crime\n\nD. women were less likely to be arrested than men\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall who Lombroso was and what his theories were about crime. I remember that Cesare Lombroso was an Italian criminologist who lived in the 19th century. He's often referred to as the father of modern criminology. His theories were quite influential, but also controversial.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: criminals were socialized into an 'underworld' of crime.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a sociological explanation of crime, suggesting that people learn criminal behaviors from their social environment or peer groups. But Lombroso was more known for his biological theories of crime. He believed that criminal behavior had biological roots, almost like a return to primitive instincts. So, while socialization is an important factor in some criminological theories, I don't think it's central to Lombroso's ideas.\n\nOption B: no act is intrinsically deviant.\n\nThis seems to be touching on the idea that deviance is relative and constructed by society. It's a bit too postmodern or constructivist for Lombroso's time. He was more focused on the individual characteristics of criminals, particularly their biological traits, rather than the social construction of deviance. So, probably not his claim.\n\nOption C: biological failings drove some people into crime.\n\nThis one seems closer to Lombroso's ideas. He did believe that there were biological factors that predisposed certain individuals to criminal behavior. He studied the physical characteristics of criminals, such as the shape of their skulls, the size of their jaws, and so on, thinking these indicated a link to primitive ancestors. He also considered mental characteristics, like intelligence levels. So, this option aligns with his biological determinism.\n\nOption D: women were less likely to be arrested than men.\n\nWell, statistically, it's true that women are generally arrested less frequently than men for most types of crimes. But I don't recall Lombroso specifically making this claim. He did study female criminals and had theories about them, but his focus was more on the differences between male and female criminals in terms of their physical and mental traits.\n\nGiven this, I think Option C is the most accurate representation of Lombroso's claims. He was famous for proposing that criminal behavior was linked to biological factors, suggesting that some people were born with tendencies towards crime due to their physiological makeup.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. I remember that Lombroso's theory was part of the positivist school of criminology, which sought to find scientific explanations for criminal behavior. He conducted autopsies on executed criminals and studied their skulls and bones, comparing them to those of non-criminals. This led him to conclude that certain physical anomalies were indicators of a predisposition to crime.\n\nSo, yeah, among the given options, C seems to be the best fit for Lombroso's claims. A and B are more aligned with sociological or social constructionist views of crime and deviance, which came later. D might be a statistical observation, but it's not specifically a central claim of Lombroso's theory.\n\nTherefore, I would go with Option C: biological failings drove some people into crime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
