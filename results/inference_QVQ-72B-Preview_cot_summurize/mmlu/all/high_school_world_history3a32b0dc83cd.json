                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this passage about the Arab slave trade in Algeria in the 1830s, and it's comparing it to the Atlantic slave trade. The question is asking how the Arab trade in Africans was different from the Atlantic slave trade, and there are four options to choose from. I need to read the passage carefully and see which one of these statements is correct based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the passage is saying. It's an account from a French officer in Algeria who heard about the Arab slave trade caravan from one of its members. The caravan was made up of soldiers who were instructed to hunt for black Africans, specifically called \"Koholanes,\" which seems to be a derogatory term. They were told to attack undefended places and capture the inhabitants, as well as seize farmers working in the fields.\n\nThe passage then mentions that while waiting for the companies sent to hunt Negroes to return, they went to the slave market and bought slaves at various prices. The prices are listed in cowries, which I believe are a type of shell used as currency in some parts of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe prices are:\n\n- A bearded Negro (male adult): 10,000 to 15,000 cowries\n\n- An adult Negress (female adult): 10,000 to 15,000 cowries\n\n- An adolescent Negro: 30,000 cowries\n\n- A young Negress: 50,000 to 60,000 cowries\n\n- A male Negro child: 45,000 cowries\n\n- A female Negro child: 35,000 to 40,000 cowries\n\nIt also notes that the price varies based on beauty, especially for young women.\n\nThe caravan started with 64 camels and 16 people but was later joined by 400 slaves, of which 300 were women. This suggests that the majority of the slaves they had were female.\n\nTowards the end of the passage, there's a description of the slaves showing resistance and distress, with some refusing to walk and having to be forced to move with whips until they were bloody.\n\nNow, the question is about how the Arab trade in Africans was different from the Atlantic slave trade. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.\n\nThis option suggests a difference in motivation between the two trades, specifically relating to religion. The passage doesn't provide information about the motivations behind the Arab slave trade. It only describes the actions and the process of capturing and trading slaves. To answer this, I'd need to know more about the motivations of both the Arab and Atlantic slave traders, which isn't provided in the passage. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nB. Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.\n\nThis option suggests a difference in the prospects of freedom for slaves in the two trades. The passage doesn't mention anything about the possibility of slaves gaining freedom in either trade. It's focusing on the capture and transportation of slaves, not on their eventual fate or potential for emancipation. Without more information, I can't confirm or deny this statement.\n\nC. Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male.\n\nThis option is about the gender composition of the slaves in the two trades. The passage clearly states that out of the 400 slaves captured by the caravan, 300 were women. That means 75% of the slaves were female. Now, regarding the Atlantic slave trade, I recall that the transatlantic slave trade primarily involved male slaves, as they were seen as more suitable for the heavy labor on plantations in the Americas. If that's the case, then this would be a significant difference between the two trades.\n\nD. Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade.\n\nThis option suggests a difference in life expectancy for slaves in the two trades. The passage doesn't provide any information about the life spans of slaves in either trade. It only describes the capture and transportation process, not the long-term health or survival rates of the slaves. Without additional information, I can't evaluate this statement.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the only option that can be confirmed is C. The passage shows that in this particular Arab slave trade caravan, the majority of slaves were female, whereas I know from historical context that the Atlantic slave trade predominantly transported male slaves. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check. The passage says that out of 400 slaves, 300 were women, which is 75%, meaning 25% were male. In contrast, the Atlantic slave trade is known to have transported a higher percentage of male slaves, often around 60% male or more, depending on the time and place.\n\nSo, yes, it seems that the gender composition was different between the two trades, with the Arab trade having mostly female slaves and the Atlantic trade having mostly male slaves.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
