                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem: I need to find which ratio cannot form a proportion with 8 over 18. The options are A. 46 over 108, B. 12 over 27, C. 60 over 135, and D. 4 over 9. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what a proportion is. A proportion is when two ratios are equal, right? So, if I have two fractions that are equal, like a/b = c/d, that's a proportion.\n\nSo, in this case, I have 8/18 and I need to see which of these options does not equal 8/18. Alright, let's start by simplifying 8/18 to make it easier to compare. Both 8 and 18 are divisible by 2. So, 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 and 18 \u00f7 2 = 9. So, 8/18 simplifies to 4/9. Okay, so any ratio that simplifies to 4/9 should form a proportion with 8/18.\n\nNow, I need to check each option to see which one does not simplify to 4/9.\n\nLet's start with option A: 46 over 108.\n\nHmm, 46 and 108. I need to see if these numbers have a common divisor. Let's see, 46 divided by 2 is 23, and 108 divided by 2 is 54. So, 46/108 simplifies to 23/54. That's not equal to 4/9. Wait, but maybe I need to simplify further. Let's see, 23 and 54 don't have any common divisors, do they? 23 is a prime number, so no. So, 46/108 simplifies to 23/54, which is not equal to 4/9. So, this might be the answer, but let's check the others to be sure.\n\nOption B: 12 over 27.\n\nLet's simplify 12/27. Both numbers are divisible by 3. 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, and 27 \u00f7 3 = 9. So, it simplifies to 4/9. That matches 8/18. So, this is not the one that doesn't form a proportion with 8/18.\n\nOption C: 60 over 135.\n\nHmm, 60 and 135. Let's see, both are divisible by 15. 60 \u00f7 15 = 4, and 135 \u00f7 15 = 9. So, it simplifies to 4/9 again. Okay, so this also forms a proportion with 8/18.\n\nOption D: 4 over 9.\n\nWell, this is already 4/9, which is the same as 8/18 in its simplified form. So, this also forms a proportion with 8/18.\n\nSo, out of all the options, A simplifies to 23/54, which is not equal to 4/9, while B and C simplify to 4/9, and D is already 4/9. Therefore, option A is the one that cannot form a proportion with 8/18.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Perhaps cross-multiplying or something.\n\nSo, for option A: 46/108 and 8/18.\n\nCross-multiplying: 46 * 18 = ? and 8 * 108 = ?\n\n46 * 18:\n\n40 * 18 = 720\n\n6 * 18 = 108\n\nTotal 720 + 108 = 828\n\n8 * 108:\n\n8 * 100 = 800\n\n8 * 8 = 64\n\nTotal 800 + 64 = 864\n\n828 \u2260 864, so they are not proportional.\n\nNow, option B: 12/27 and 8/18.\n\nCross-multiplying: 12 * 18 = ? and 8 * 27 = ?\n\n12 * 18:\n\n10 * 18 = 180\n\n2 * 18 = 36\n\nTotal 180 + 36 = 216\n\n8 * 27:\n\n8 * 20 = 160\n\n8 * 7 = 56\n\nTotal 160 + 56 = 216\n\n216 = 216, so they are proportional.\n\nOption C: 60/135 and 8/18.\n\nCross-multiplying: 60 * 18 = ? and 8 * 135 = ?\n\n60 * 18:\n\n60 * 10 = 600\n\n60 * 8 = 480\n\nTotal 600 + 480 = 1080\n\n8 * 135:\n\n8 * 100 = 800\n\n8 * 35 = 280\n\nTotal 800 + 280 = 1080\n\n1080 = 1080, so they are proportional.\n\nOption D: 4/9 and 8/18.\n\nCross-multiplying: 4 * 18 = ? and 8 * 9 = ?\n\n4 * 18 = 72\n\n8 * 9 = 72\n\n72 = 72, so they are proportional.\n\nTherefore, again, option A is the one that doesn't form a proportion with 8/18.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the final choice is A. 46 over 108.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
