The options are:\n\nA. disobedience to a sovereign\n\nB. disobedience to God's law\n\nC. failure to abide by a contract\n\nD. failure to respect inherent rights\n\nI know that Hobbes was a political philosopher who wrote \"Leviathan,\" which is pretty famous. He had some strong views about government and society.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Hobbes's view on injustice. I remember that in his philosophy, the state of nature is this chaotic situation where everyone is against everyone, and there's no law or government to keep order. To avoid that, people agree to form a social contract and create a sovereign authority that everyone must obey.\n\nSo, in Hobbes's view, the sovereign is essential for maintaining order and preventing chaos. If people disobey the sovereign, it could lead back to the state of nature, which he sees as undesirable.\n\nOption A says disobedience to a sovereign. That seems relevant because Hobbes thought that obeying the sovereign is crucial for social order.\n\nOption B is disobedience to God's law. Hmm, Hobbes was known for his materialist and somewhat secular views. While he did believe in God, his political theory doesn't rely heavily on divine law. So, maybe this isn't his primary definition of injustice.\n\nOption C is failure to abide by a contract. Hobbes does talk about contracts; in fact, the social contract is central to his theory. People agree to give up some freedoms in exchange for security provided by the sovereign. So, failing to abide by this contract would be a problem according to Hobbes.\n\nBut wait, is injustice specifically about failing to abide by a contract? Hobbes might see breaking a contract as a form of injustice, but is it his definition of injustice?\n\nOption D is failure to respect inherent rights. Now, Hobbes did believe in natural rights, but his understanding of rights might differ from how we think of them today.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. In Hobbes's view, in the state of nature, everyone has the right to everything, which leads to conflict. To resolve this, people agree to transfer their rights to the sovereign through the social contract.\n\nSo, if someone fails to respect the terms of this contract, that would be injustice because they're not honoring the agreement that ensures social order.\n\nBut option A is disobedience to the sovereign. Is that the same as failing to abide by the contract?\n\nWell, obeying the sovereign is part of the contract. So, disobeying the sovereign would be failing to abide by the contract.\n\nMaybe options A and C are closely related in Hobbes's thought.\n\nLet me check a summary of Hobbes's views on injustice.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Hobbes defines injustice as \"the voluntary violation of a covenant to which the party hath submitted himself for the benefit of his life, and the goods thereof.\"\n\nSo, according to this, injustice is breaking a covenant or contract that one has agreed to for one's own benefit.\n\nThat seems to align closely with option C: failure to abide by a contract.\n\nBut option A is disobedience to a sovereign, which is also related because obeying the sovereign is part of the social contract.\n\nHowever, the definition mentions violating a covenant, which is more directly related to a contract.\n\nMaybe option C is more accurate because it refers specifically to a contract, whereas disobedience to a sovereign could be seen as a specific instance of breaking a contract.\n\nOption B, disobedience to God's law, doesn't seem to fit Hobbes's philosophy as closely, since he was more concerned with civil law and the social contract than with divine law.\n\nOption D, failure to respect inherent rights, might be related, but Hobbes's view is that in the social contract, people give up some of their natural rights in exchange for security provided by the sovereign. So, respecting inherent rights might not be the primary concern in his definition of injustice.\n\nBased on this, I think option C is the best answer. Failure to abide by a contract is directly related to Hobbes's concept of injustice, as it involves breaking a covenant that ensures social order and individual security.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Maybe disobedience to the sovereign is a broader concept that includes failing to abide by the contract.\n\nHowever, the definition specifically mentions violating a covenant, which is more precise than just disobeying the sovereign. Disobeying the sovereign could be for various reasons, not necessarily related to the contract.\n\nFor example, the sovereign might make a law that isn't part of the original contract, and disobeying that law would be disobedience to the sovereign but not necessarily breaking the social contract.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more accurate.\n\nI think the answer is C. failure to abide by a contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
