                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a pilot who plays a practical joke on his girlfriend during a flight, and now I need to figure out if she can successfully sue him for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to know what intentional infliction of emotional distress means. From what I recall, it's a tort (which is like a wrong that can be sued over) where someone causes another person severe emotional or mental distress on purpose. So, there are a few elements that need to be met for this to hold up in court.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. The defendant's conduct must be extreme and outrageous.\n\n2. The defendant must have intended to cause severe emotional distress or acted with reckless disregard for causing it.\n\n3. The plaintiff must have suffered severe emotional distress.\n\n4. The defendant's conduct must have been the cause of that distress.\n\nOkay, so in this case, the defendant is the pilot, and the plaintiff is his girlfriend. Let's look at each element one by one.\n\nStarting with the first element: the conduct must be extreme and outrageous. The pilot shut off the engine during flight, causing the plane to nosedive, and then pretended that they were going to crash. This seems pretty extreme to me, especially since the girlfriend is scared of flying to begin with. I can imagine that this kind of prank would be considered outrageous in most people's eyes.\n\nMoving on to the second element: intent. The pilot meant it as a joke, but did he intend to cause severe emotional distress? The question mentions that he intended his actions as a practical joke, but maybe he didn't realize it would cause such a strong reaction. But I think the key here is that he should have foreseen that shutting off the engine and pretending to crash would cause severe distress, especially to someone who's already afraid of flying. So, even if he didn't specifically intend to cause distress, he acted with reckless disregard for the likely consequences.\n\nThird element: the girlfriend suffered severe emotional distress. She became panic-stricken and started screaming hysterically. That sounds pretty severe to me. I don't think there's much debate about whether that constitutes severe emotional distress.\n\nFourth element: the pilot's conduct caused her distress. Well, it was directly because of the prank that she started panicking and screaming. So, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.\n\nB. Recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nC. Not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.\n\nD. Not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.\n\nLet me consider each option.\n\nOption A suggests that a reasonable person would have been distressed. While that's somewhat relevant, I think the focus is more on the specific elements of the tort, not just what a reasonable person would feel.\n\nOption B seems spot on. The conduct was extreme and outrageous, which is one of the key elements.\n\nOption C claims she wouldn't recover because the pilot intended it as a joke and lacked sufficient intent. But from what I thought earlier, even if it was intended as a joke, if he recklessly disregarded the likelihood of causing severe distress, that should still qualify.\n\nOption D says she wouldn't recover because there was no physical injury. But in intentional infliction of emotional distress cases, physical injury isn't always required, especially if there's severe emotional distress.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that. Is physical injury a requirement for intentional infliction of emotional distress?\n\nI think in many jurisdictions, physical injury isn't required for emotional distress claims. The trend is towards recognizing that severe emotional distress can be harmful in itself, without needing a physical injury. So, I think option D is incorrect based on that.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, I think option B is the most accurate. The conduct was extreme and outrageous, which is a central part of the tort. Option A is somewhat vague, and option C seems to misinterpret the intent requirement.\n\nBut let me think again about the intent part. The pilot intended to play a joke, not necessarily to cause distress. But in tort law, intent can include situations where someone acts knowing that their actions will likely cause the harm, even if their purpose wasn't to cause harm. So, maybe the pilot should have known that shutting off the engine would cause severe distress, especially given the girlfriend's fear of flying.\n\nI think that in this case, the pilot's conduct shows recklessness or knowledge that severe emotional distress was substantially certain to result from his actions. So, the lack of specific intent to cause distress shouldn't prevent the girlfriend from recovering.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there are any other factors that might come into play. For example, perhaps there's a duty of care between the pilot and his passenger that could affect this. But in intentional torts, the focus is more on the intent and the harm caused, rather than on breaching a duty of care, which is more relevant in negligence cases.\n\nAlso, maybe there's a question of consent here. The girlfriend agreed to go flying, but did she consent to being pranked like this? Probably not. But I'm not sure how that affects the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps there's a defense based on the relationship between the pilot and his girlfriend. They're in a romantic relationship, and maybe pranks are part of their dynamic. But given that the girlfriend was already scared of flying and reluctantly agreed to go, it seems like this prank went beyond what she might have reasonably expected.\n\nOverall, I still think option B is the best answer. The conduct was extreme and outrageous, causing severe emotional distress, and the pilot should have foreseen the likely impact of his actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
