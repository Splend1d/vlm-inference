                    "text": "So I have this question here about the earliest example of the development of a complex society, and the options are Jericho in Israel, Caral in Peru, Stonehenge in England, and Olmec along the Gulf Coast. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is the earliest.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what constitutes a \"complex society.\" Generally, that refers to societies that have developed social hierarchies, specialized labor, centralized authority, and often written languages or other forms of record-keeping. So, among these options, which one developed these features first?\n\nLet me start by looking up some information about each site.\n\nStarting with Jericho in Israel. I recall that Jericho is often referred to as one of the oldest cities in the world. Let me check when it was established. Oh, wow. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jericho was settled as early as 10,000 BCE, and by about 7000 BCE, it had developed into a significant urban center with walls and a tower. That's really early.\n\nNext, Caral in Peru. I'm less familiar with this site. Let me see. Caral is an ancient city located in the Supe Valley of Peru. It's considered one of the oldest urban centers in the Americas. Archaeologists have dated it to around 3500 to 3000 BCE. So, that's considerably later than Jericho.\n\nStonehenge in England is another option. This prehistoric monument is famous for its massive stones arranged in a circle. It was built in several phases, with the earliest structures dating back to around 3000 BCE, and the famous stone circle was constructed between roughly 2500 BCE and 2000 BCE. So, again, later than Jericho.\n\nLastly, the Olmec along the Gulf Coast. The Olmec civilization is often considered one of the earliest advanced civilizations in Mesoamerica. They are known for their massive stone heads and other sculptures. The Olmec culture flourished from approximately 1500 BCE to 400 BCE. That's still later than Jericho.\n\nSo, based on these dates, Jericho seems to be the earliest among these options, with settlements dating back to 10,000 BCE and developing into a complex society by around 7000 BCE.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if these dates are accurate and make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe some recent discoveries have pushed back the dates for one of these sites.\n\nLet me look up some more recent sources. For Jericho, recent radiocarbon dating confirms that the site was inhabited as early as 10,000 BCE, and by 7000 BCE, it had a well-established urban layout with defensive walls and towers. That reinforces its status as an early complex society.\n\nFor Caral, ongoing research continues to refine its dating, but most experts still place its establishment around 3500 to 3000 BCE, which is still later than Jericho.\n\nStonehenge's construction phases are well-documented, with the earliest wooden structures around 3000 BCE and the stone circle from about 2500 BCE onward.\n\nAs for the Olmec, while there is some debate about the exact timing of their rise, the generally accepted period remains from about 1500 BCE to 400 BCE.\n\nSo, unless there's new evidence that places one of these other sites earlier than previously thought, Jericho appears to be the earliest example of a complex society among the given options.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the level of complexity in each society. Just because a settlement is old doesn't necessarily mean it had a complex society. For example, Jericho was an early urban center, but did it have the social hierarchies, specialized labor, and centralized authority that define a complex society?\n\nFrom what I've read, Jericho did show signs of early urban planning and social organization. The construction of defensive walls and towers suggests organized labor and possibly a leadership structure to oversee such projects. Additionally, archaeological findings indicate the presence of artisans and specialized crafts, which points to some degree of social stratification and division of labor.\n\nSimilarly, Caral is known for its pyramids and other monumental architecture, indicating organized labor and a centralized authority. However, as mentioned earlier, it's dated to around 3500 to 3000 BCE, which is still after Jericho.\n\nStonehenge, while an impressive feat of engineering, was primarily a ceremonial site and doesn't show the same level of social complexity as an urban center like Jericho.\n\nThe Olmec civilization certainly had a complex society, with large settlements, trade networks, and the development of a writing system. However, their timeline places them after Jericho.\n\nTherefore, considering both the timing and the level of social complexity, Jericho in Israel seems to be the earliest example among the provided options.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there are any other ancient sites not included in these options that might be older and more complex. For example, I've heard of Catalh\u00f6y\u00fck in Turkey, which is another ancient settlement. Let me look that up.\n\nCatalh\u00f6y\u00fck is indeed an important Neolithic site, dated to approximately 7500 to 5700 BCE. It was a large settlement with advanced architecture and evidence of social organization. However, it's still later than Jericho's initial settlement, although it overlaps with Jericho's development as an urban center.\n\nAnother site that comes to mind is G\u00f6bekli Tepe, also in Turkey, which has structures that date back to around 9500 BCE. This site features large stone pillars and appears to have been a significant ceremonial center. However, it's not clear to what extent it had the characteristics of a complex society beyond organized religious activities.\n\nGiven this additional research, Jericho still stands out as the earliest example of a complex society among the provided options.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Jericho in Israel.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\text{ Jericho in Israel}} \\]"
