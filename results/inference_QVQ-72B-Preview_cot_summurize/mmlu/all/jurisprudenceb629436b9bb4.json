                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"In which of the following did the idea of 'natural law' first appear? The options are A. French Revolution, B. American War of Independence, C. Roman Law, or D. Greek Thinking.\" Hmm, I need to figure out where the concept of natural law originated from these choices.\n\nFirst off, I should probably understand what natural law is. From what I recall, natural law is a concept that suggests there are certain rights or principles that are inherent to human nature and can be understood through reason, rather than being dependent on human-made laws or regulations. So, it's about universal principles that apply to all people, regardless of what laws a particular society might have.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. French Revolution: The French Revolution was in the late 18th century, from 1789 to 1799. It was a period of radical social and political change, inspired in part by Enlightenment ideas about liberty, equality, and fraternity. Figures like Rousseau and Voltaire were influential during this time. But was this where the idea of natural law first appeared? I don't think so. The French Revolution built upon earlier ideas about natural rights, but it wasn't the origin of the concept.\n\nB. American War of Independence: Also known as the American Revolution, this was from 1775 to 1783. It was fought between Great Britain and the thirteen American colonies that declared themselves the independent United States of America. The Declaration of Independence, written in 1776, is famous for stating that \"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" This reflects natural rights philosophy, influenced by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. Again, though, this seems to be building upon earlier ideas rather than being the first appearance of natural law.\n\nC. Roman Law: Roman law was the legal system of ancient Rome and its empire, which lasted from around the 7th century BC to the 5th century AD. Roman law is famous for its comprehensive legal codes and principles that have influenced many modern legal systems. The concept of \"jus naturale,\" or natural law, was developed by Roman jurists and philosophers like Cicero. They believed that there was a higher law based on nature and reason that applied to all people, regardless of written laws. This seems like a pretty early formulation of natural law.\n\nD. Greek Thinking: Ancient Greek philosophy spanned from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundations of Western philosophy. Aristotle discussed natural law in his work, suggesting that there are natural principles that govern human behavior and that laws should be in harmony with these natural principles. So, Greek thinking certainly contributed to the idea of natural law.\n\nNow, between Roman law and Greek thinking, which one came first? Well, ancient Greek philosophy predates ancient Roman civilization. The Greeks were flourishing from around the 6th century BC, while the Roman Republic began in 509 BC and the Roman Empire started in 27 BC. So, Greek philosophy was around earlier.\n\nBut did the Greeks explicitly formulate the concept of natural law as we understand it today? It seems that the Romans, particularly jurists like Cicero, were more explicit in their formulation of natural law as a principle that applies universally based on nature and reason.\n\nHowever, Aristotle did discuss natural law in his ethics and politics, suggesting that there are natural rights and that laws should align with these natural rights. So, the Greeks did have concepts that are akin to natural law.\n\nBut perhaps the Romans were the first to fully develop and articulate the concept of natural law in a way that has influenced Western legal thought.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the first appearance of the idea of natural law. So, maybe it's not about who developed it the most, but where the idea first showed up.\n\nGiven that Greek philosophy predates Roman law, and that Greek thinkers like Aristotle discussed principles that align with natural law, it's possible that the idea originated in Greek thinking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Romans borrowed and built upon Greek ideas, as they often did in philosophy and other fields.\n\nBut still, the origin would be with the Greeks.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I look at the historical timeline, Greek philosophy starts around the 6th century BC, while Roman law develops from around the 7th century BC but becomes more prominent from the time of the Roman Republic onwards, starting in 509 BC.\n\nSo, Greek philosophy was already well-established by the time the Roman Republic began.\n\nMoreover, Roman thinkers like Cicero were influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly Stoicism, which had its own ideas about natural law.\n\nSo, it's likely that the Romans adopted and adapted Greek ideas about natural law.\n\nTherefore, the idea of natural law first appeared in Greek thinking.\n\nBut wait, the option is \"Greek Thinking,\" which is on the list, and \"Roman Law\" is another option.\n\nGiven that Greek thinking predates Roman law, and that the Romans drew upon Greek ideas, it seems that the concept originated in Greek thinking.\n\nHowever, sometimes ideas are developed further in subsequent cultures, but the question is specifically about where it first appeared.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer should be D. Greek Thinking.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I look up natural law, I find that the concept has a long history, with roots in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in the works of Plato and Aristotle.\n\nPlato discussed the idea of natural justice and natural rights, believing that there was a perfect, ideal form of justice that should guide human laws.\n\nAristotle, a student of Plato, further developed these ideas, arguing that laws should be in accordance with reason and the natural order.\n\nSo, the Greeks had a well-developed understanding of natural law.\n\nThe Romans, particularly Cicero, built upon these ideas and popularized the concept of natural law in their legal system.\n\nBut again, this suggests that the idea originated with the Greeks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Greek Thinking.\n\nWait, but the option also includes \"Roman Law,\" which comes after Greek Thinking, but still before the American War of Independence and the French Revolution.\n\nSo, unless there's a reason to believe that the idea of natural law appeared first in Roman law rather than Greek thinking, I should go with Greek Thinking.\n\nAdditionally, considering that Roman law was influenced by Greek philosophy, it's reasonable to conclude that the idea originated in Greek thinking.\n\nHence, the answer is D. Greek Thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
