                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about Freud's theory on when the penis becomes the major focus of pleasure-seeking. The options are at birth, about age 1, between the ages of 3 and 6, or puberty. Hmm, I need to recall Freud's stages of psychosexual development to figure this out.\n\nI remember that Freud divided human development into several stages, each characterized by where pleasure is focused. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. Let me think about which stage corresponds to the penis being the main focus of pleasure.\n\nThe oral stage is from birth to about 18 months, where pleasure is centered around the mouth. So, that would be option A, birth. But I don't think that's when the penis becomes the major focus.\n\nNext is the anal stage, which is from about 18 months to 3 years, where pleasure is associated with the anus and bowel movements. That's option B, about age 1, but again, not directly related to the penis.\n\nThen comes the phallic stage, which is from about 3 to 6 years old. In this stage, children become aware of their genitals and may derive pleasure from them. For boys, this would involve the penis. So, that sounds promising. That would be option C, between the ages of 3 and 6.\n\nAfter that is the latency stage, from about 6 to 12 years, where sexual feelings are less prominent, and finally, the genital stage begins at puberty, which is option D. In the genital stage, sexual feelings re-emerge, but since the question is about when the penis first becomes the major focus of pleasure-seeking, puberty would be too late.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Freud did talk about the phallic stage being crucial for the development of sexuality in boys, where they might experience the Oedipus complex and eventually resolve it by identifying with the same-sex parent. This identification process helps in forming their adult sexual identity.\n\nSo, according to Freud, it's during the phallic stage, which is between 3 and 6 years old, that the penis first becomes the major focus of pleasure-seeking for boys.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective that might suggest a different answer. For example, in terms of physical development, the penis starts to develop before birth, but that's not what the question is asking. It's asking when it first becomes the major focus of pleasure-seeking.\n\nI don't think it's at birth because at that stage, infants are primarily focused on oral gratification, like sucking and eating.\n\nAt about age 1, which is the anal stage, children are more interested in anal sensations and may resist diaper changes or hold in their bowel movements for pleasure. So, again, not focusing on the penis.\n\nThen, between 3 and 6, the phallic stage, children become curious about their genitals, might engage in masturbation, and show interest in the differences between boys and girls. This seems to align perfectly with the description of the penis becoming a major focus of pleasure-seeking.\n\nPuberty is much later, around ages 10 to 14, depending on the individual, and that's when secondary sexual characteristics develop, and sexual feelings reawaken after the latency period.\n\nTherefore, based on Freud's theory of psychosexual development, the correct answer should be option C, between the ages of 3 and 6.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other aspect of Freud's theory that might shift this focus. For instance, in the genital stage, which begins at puberty, individuals start to form meaningful sexual relationships and direct their libido towards others. But again, that's after the initial focus on the penis in early childhood.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is option C, between the ages of 3 and 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
