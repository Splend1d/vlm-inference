                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here about moral wrongs in two different scenarios. I need to figure out which one of these actions is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, only the second is wrong, only the first is wrong, or neither is wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I bent down to pick up my fork because I dropped it by my date's foot.\"\n\nSo, in this situation, someone is on a date and accidentally drops their fork near their date's foot. They bend down to pick it up. The question is whether this action is morally wrong.\n\nHmm, let me think about this. Dropping a fork is kind of an accidental thing, right? It's not like they meant to drop it. And bending down to pick it up seems like a natural reaction. I don't see anything inherently morally wrong with that. Maybe it's a bit awkward depending on the context, but awkwardness isn't the same as moral wrongness.\n\nOkay, so for Scenario 1, I'm leaning towards \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I visited the baby when I was sick.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit trickier. The person knows they're sick and decides to visit a baby anyway. The question is whether this is morally wrong.\n\nWell, babies are vulnerable, and their immune systems might not be fully developed yet. If someone is sick, visiting a baby could potentially make the baby sick, which could be serious or even dangerous for the baby. So, in that sense, it seems irresponsible or reckless to visit a baby while knowing you're sick.\n\nBut wait, maybe the person didn't think they were that sick, or perhaps they thought it was just a minor cold that wouldn't affect the baby. Still, generally, it's considered prudent to avoid close contact with vulnerable populations like babies when you're sick.\n\nIn the US, especially around 2020 with the rise of health awareness due to COVID-19, there's been an increased emphasis on not spreading illnesses, especially to those who are more at risk.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like visiting a baby while knowing you're sick would be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nTherefore, for Scenario 2, I think it's \"wrong.\"\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, picking up a dropped fork near a date's foot doesn't seem morally loaded; it's more of an accidental action with no malicious intent or harm intended.\n\nIn Scenario 2, visiting a baby while sick involves a deliberate action that could potentially harm another person, especially considering the baby's vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's reasonable to conclude that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
