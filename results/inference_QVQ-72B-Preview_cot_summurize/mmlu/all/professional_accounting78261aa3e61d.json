                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about setting a target selling price for a new product called Duct. They want a 20% target contribution margin. The costs are broken down into manufacturing and selling & admin, with both variable and fixed components. Let me try to understand what all this means.\n\nFirst, what's a contribution margin? I remember from my economics class that the contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable costs. It's basically the amount that each unit contributes to covering the fixed costs and then the profit. So, if they want a 20% target contribution margin, that means they want the contribution margin to be 20% of the selling price.\n\nAlright, so let's denote the selling price as S.\n\nThe variable costs are the sum of the variable manufacturing costs and the variable selling & admin costs. That's $12 (manufacturing variable) plus $3 (selling & admin variable), which totals $15.\n\nSo, the contribution margin would be S minus $15, and they want this to be 20% of the selling price. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nS - 15 = 0.20 * S\n\nNow, I can solve for S.\n\nSubtract 0.20*S from both sides:\n\nS - 0.20*S - 15 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0.80*S - 15 = 0\n\nNow, add 15 to both sides:\n\n0.80*S = 15\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.80:\n\nS = 15 / 0.80\n\nS = 18.75\n\nSo, the target selling price should be $18.75.\n\nWait a minute, that's one of the options, but I should double-check if there's anything I'm missing. Maybe I need to consider the fixed costs as well? Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. The contribution margin is indeed selling price minus variable costs, and that margin should be 20% of the selling price. But fixed costs are there too. Maybe I need to consider them.\n\nWait, no. The contribution margin is meant to cover the fixed costs and then some profit. But the problem specifies a target contribution margin percentage, which is probably just the relationship between the margin and the selling price, not directly accounting for the fixed costs.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the fixed costs in a different way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the contribution margin ratio.\n\nThe contribution margin ratio is (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price.\n\nThey want this to be 20%, or 0.20.\n\nSo, (S - 15) / S = 0.20\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nSo, solving for S:\n\nS - 15 = 0.20*S\n\n0.80*S = 15\n\nS = 18.75\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider the fixed costs in terms of break-even analysis or something, but the problem is specifically about the target contribution margin.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. $18.00\n\nB. $18.75\n\nC. $25.00\n\nD. $33.60\n\nSo, $18.75 is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if this makes sense with the fixed costs.\n\nIf the selling price is $18.75 and the variable costs are $15, then the contribution margin per unit is $3.75.\n\nIf they want a 20% contribution margin, that would be $3.75 is 20% of $18.75, which checks out.\n\nBut maybe they have fixed costs that need to be covered as well. Wait, but the problem is only about the target contribution margin, not about the break-even point.\n\nUnless, perhaps, they want the contribution margin to cover the fixed costs and still achieve a certain profit, but that seems beyond what's asked.\n\nI think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. $18.75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 18.75} \\]"
