                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating required returns using the Capital-Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). There are two companies: Plaid Pants, Inc. and Acme Dynamite Company. Their betas are 0.90 and 1.80, respectively. The expected return on the market is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 6%. I need to find the required returns for both stocks using CAPM.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CAPM is. CAPM is a model that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. The formula for CAPM is:\n\n\\[ E(r) = r_f + \\beta (E(r_m) - r_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(r) \\) is the expected return on the asset.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the asset, which measures its sensitivity to market movements.\n\n- \\( E(r_m) \\) is the expected return on the market.\n\nSo, for Plaid Pants, Inc., with a beta of 0.90, the required return would be:\n\n\\[ E(r_{\\text{Plaid}}) = 6\\% + 0.90 \\times (10\\% - 6\\%) \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the market return and the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 10\\% - 6\\% = 4\\% \\]\n\nThen, multiply that by the beta:\n\n\\[ 0.90 \\times 4\\% = 3.6\\% \\]\n\nFinally, add the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 6\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.6\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required return for Plaid Pants is 9.6%.\n\nNow, for Acme Dynamite Company, with a beta of 1.80, the required return would be:\n\n\\[ E(r_{\\text{Acme}}) = 6\\% + 1.80 \\times (10\\% - 6\\%) \\]\n\nAgain, calculate the difference:\n\n\\[ 10\\% - 6\\% = 4\\% \\]\n\nMultiply by the beta:\n\n\\[ 1.80 \\times 4\\% = 7.2\\% \\]\n\nAdd the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 6\\% + 7.2\\% = 13.2\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required return for Acme Dynamite is 13.2%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.6 percent; 7.2 percent\n\nB. 9.6 percent; 13.2 percent\n\nC. 9.0 percent; 18.0 percent\n\nD. 14.0 percent; 23.0 percent\n\nMy calculations match option B: 9.6 percent for Plaid Pants and 13.2 percent for Acme Dynamite.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to look at this. I know that beta measures systematic risk, and a beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market. A beta less than 1, like Plaid Pants' 0.90, means it's less volatile than the market, so it should have a lower required return. Similarly, a beta higher than 1, like Acme's 1.80, means it's more volatile and should have a higher required return.\n\nAlso, the difference between the market return and the risk-free rate is the market risk premium. So, for Plaid Pants:\n\n\\[ E(r) = 6\\% + 0.90 \\times 4\\% = 9.6\\% \\]\n\nAnd for Acme:\n\n\\[ E(r) = 6\\% + 1.80 \\times 4\\% = 13.2\\% \\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here; it's a straightforward application of the CAPM formula. So, the answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
