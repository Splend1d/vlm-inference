Sec. 204 of the state penal code provided for early release for good behavior, and under that provision he would have been granted supervised release as of Jan. 1, 2007. On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether this new law, Section 205a, is an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to this criminal defendant. Let me try to understand the facts first.\n\nThe defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to ten years in prison, starting on January 1, 2000. Under Section 204 of the state penal code, which allowed for early release for good behavior, his supervised release date was supposed to be January 1, 2007. But then, on February 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Section 204 and passed Section 205a. This new section reduced the good time credits not only for future convicts but also for those already in prison, like our defendant. As a result, his new release date was pushed back to January 1, 2009.\n\nThe defendant filed a habeas corpus action, arguing that Section 205a is an ex post facto law and therefore unconstitutional as applied to him. The state courts denied his claim, saying that good time credits are just a privilege, not a vested right. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether the Supreme Court would invalidate Section 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law.\n\nFirst, I should recall what an ex post facto law is. From my understanding, an ex post facto law is one that retroactively changes the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. The Ex Post Facto Clause in the U.S. Constitution prohibits such laws because they can be seen as unfair, as they effectively change the rules after the fact.\n\nIn this case, the new law, Section 205a, was passed on February 1, 2006, and it reduced the good time credits for prisoners who were already in jail at that time. So, it's applying retroactively to change the conditions of the defendant's sentence.\n\nBut the state courts argued that good time credits are just a privilege, not a vested right. I need to think about whether that changes things.\n\nI remember a case called Weaver v. Graham, where the Supreme Court dealt with a similar issue regarding good time credits. In that case, the Court held that where a new law retroactively reduces good time credits, thereby increasing the punishment compared to what was in effect at the time of the crime, it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the new law was passed in 2006, and the defendant was already in prison since 2000. So, the law is being applied retroactively to change the terms of his sentence.\n\nAnother relevant case is Lynce v. Mathis, where the Supreme Court struck down a law that reduced good time credits for inmates who had already committed their crimes, finding it to be an ex post facto violation.\n\nSo, based on these precedents, it seems like the Supreme Court might invalidate Section 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law.\n\nBut let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.\n\nThis seems similar to the state courts' argument that good time credits are a privilege, not a right. However, the Supreme Court in Weaver v. Graham recognized that even if good time credits are a privilege, retroactively reducing them to increase a prisoner's sentence could violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nB. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\n\nThis seems consistent with the Weaver v. Graham decision, where the Court looked at whether the new law increased the punishment retroactively.\n\nC. Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.\n\nThis option suggests that the legislature lacks the power to decrease good time credits, but that might not be entirely accurate. Legislatures can change laws, including those related to good time credits, but they cannot apply them retroactively in a way that increases the punishment for crimes already committed.\n\nD. No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.\n\nAgain, this echoes the idea that good time credits are a privilege, not a right, which is similar to option A.\n\nGiven these options, I think the correct answer is B. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\n\nThis aligns with the Supreme Court's reasoning in cases like Weaver v. Graham and Lynce v. Mathis, where retroactive reductions in good time credits that increase a prisoner's sentence were held to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nSo, the Supreme Court would likely invalidate Section 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
