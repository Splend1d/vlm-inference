                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which proposition follows directly from the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:\n\n1. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\n2. A \u2228 B\n\n3. ~C\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. ~A \u2228 ~B\n\nB. ~~C\n\nC. C \u2228 D\n\nD. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding what it means for something to be an immediate consequence in PL. I think it means that using the rules of inference in propositional logic, one step should lead me directly to the answer without a long chain of reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the premises and see how they relate to each other.\n\nPremise 1: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\nPremise 2: A \u2228 B\n\nPremise 3: ~C\n\nI recall that when you have a conditional statement like (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), and you have A \u2228 B, you can use the rule of modus ponens to derive C \u2228 D. So, from Premise 1 and Premise 2, I can get C \u2228 D. But wait, Premise 3 is ~C, which means C is false. So if C is false, and I have C \u2228 D, which must be true because C \u2228 D includes the possibility of D being true. But since C is false, D must be true to make C \u2228 D true. So, D must be true.\n\nLet me think about that again. If C is false and C \u2228 D is true (which it is, because Premise 2 and Premise 1 imply C \u2228 D), then D must be true. So, D is true.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. ~A \u2228 ~B\n\nThis is equivalent to saying ~(A \u2227 B), but I'm not sure if that follows directly from the premises.\n\nB. ~~C\n\nThis seems to say that it's not the case that C is not true, which would mean C is true. But Premise 3 says ~C, meaning C is false. So, this can't be true.\n\nC. C \u2228 D\n\nAs I thought earlier, from Premise 1 and Premise 2, I can get C \u2228 D directly using modus ponens.\n\nD. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nThis seems interesting. If I know that (A \u2228 B) leads to (C \u2228 D), and I also know ~C, then indeed, since C is false, D must be true. So, (A \u2228 B) would imply D.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both C and D are consequences. But the question asks for an immediate consequence, meaning just one step away from the premises.\n\nLet me consider the immediate derivation.\n\nFrom Premise 2: A \u2228 B\n\nAnd Premise 1: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\nUsing modus ponens, I can immediately conclude C \u2228 D.\n\nSo, option C seems to be a direct consequence.\n\nBut what about option D: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nWell, since I have C \u2228 D and I know ~C, then D must be true. So, if (A \u2228 B) leads to (C \u2228 D), and (C \u2228 D) simplifies to D because ~C, then indeed, (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nBut is this an immediate consequence, or does it involve two steps: first deriving C \u2228 D and then using ~C to get D, and then inferring (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D?\n\nHmm, maybe it's considered a single step if I use the law of simplification or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option C is the most immediate consequence because it's a direct application of modus ponens to Premises 1 and 2.\n\nOption D seems to require an additional step of knowing that C is false, so C \u2228 D reduces to D, and thus (A \ufffd\u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"immediate\" consequence, probably option C is the answer.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nPremises:\n\n1. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D)\n\n2. A \u2228 B\n\n3. ~C\n\nFrom 1 and 2, C \u2228 D (direct modus ponens).\n\nFrom 3, ~C.\n\nCombining C \u2228 D and ~C, we get D.\n\nThen, since (A \u2228 B) \u2283 (C \u2228 D), and (C \u2228 D) reduces to D because of ~C, we have (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D.\n\nBut again, is this an immediate consequence, or is it a two-step process?\n\nI think option C is the immediate consequence, and option D is a consequence but perhaps not immediate in the sense required.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. C \u2228 D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
