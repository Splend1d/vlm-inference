                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand utilitarian arguments better, and I came across this question that asks what utilitarian arguments depend heavily on, in terms of factual claims. The options are:\n\nA. What a virtuous person ought to do in a particular situation.\n\nB. What God has commanded or would prefer.\n\nC. What duties one has inherited through implicit social contracts.\n\nD. The overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which is often defined as happiness or well-being for the greatest number of people.\n\nSo, utilitarianism is all about the consequences of actions and trying to achieve the best overall outcome.\n\nOption A talks about what a virtuous person ought to do. Virtue ethics is more about character and virtues like honesty, courage, and compassion. It's less about the consequences and more about the character of the person acting. So, this seems different from utilitarianism, which is more\u540e\u679c\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684.\n\nOption B mentions what God has commanded or would prefer. This sounds like divine command theory, where moral right and wrong are determined by God's will. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is a secular approach that doesn't rely on religious beliefs. So, this probably isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C refers to duties inherited through implicit social contracts. This sounds more like deontological ethics, particularly social contract theory, which is based on the idea that moral rules arise from agreements or contracts among rational individuals. Again, this is different from utilitarianism, which is consequentialist.\n\nOption D mentions the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action. This seems to align closely with utilitarianism because utilitarianism is all about evaluating the consequences of different actions and choosing the one that leads to the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems that utilitarian arguments depend heavily on factual claims about the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Utilitarianism requires us to assess the likely outcomes of our actions and choose the one that maximizes utility. This involves making predictions about what will happen if we take one action versus another.\n\nThese predictions are factual claims about the world\u2014they are empirical assertions that can be tested or observed. For example, if I'm considering whether to implement a new policy, I might need to estimate how many people it will benefit and by how much, compared to alternative policies.\n\nSo, yes, utilitarianism relies heavily on these kinds of factual claims about the effects of different actions.\n\nNow, just to consider if there's any overlap or potential confusion with the other options.\n\nFor instance, virtue ethics does consider the consequences of actions, but its primary focus is on the character of the person acting. A virtuous person might consider the consequences, but their primary concern is acting in a way that reflects their virtues, not necessarily maximizing utility.\n\nDivine command theory bases morality on God's will, which is a completely different foundation from utilitarianism.\n\nSocial contract theory is about the moral obligations that arise from agreements or contracts among individuals, which is again distinct from utilitarianism's focus on maximizing utility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll look up a quick definition of utilitarianism to confirm.\n\nUtilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, meaning that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. Specifically, it holds that an action is right if it promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nSo, yes, utilitarianism is all about comparing the overall effects of different actions to determine which one is morally best.\n\nTherefore, utilitarian arguments depend heavily on factual claims about the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
