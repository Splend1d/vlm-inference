                    "text": "So I have this quadratic expression: -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53, and I need to write it in the form a(x + d)\u00b2 + e. Then, I have to find the sum of a, d, and e. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to complete the square for the expression -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53. I know that completing the square involves turning a quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial. But there's a coefficient in front of the x\u00b2, which is -2, so that makes it a bit trickier.\n\nMaybe I should factor out the -2 from the first two terms to make it easier. So, -2x\u00b2 - 20x can be written as -2(x\u00b2 + 10x). Then, I'll deal with the constant term separately.\n\nSo, starting with -2(x\u00b2 + 10x). Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, I need to take half of the coefficient of x, which is 10, so half of that is 5. Then, I square it to get 25 and add and subtract it inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53. Wait, no, actually, since I factored out the -2, I need to be careful with the signs. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting over:\n\n-2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53\n\nFactor out -2 from the first two terms:\n\n-2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of 10, which is 5, then square it to get 25. I need to add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses, but because there's a -2 factored out, I have to be careful.\n\nWait, -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) - 53, but I need to account for the +25 inside the parentheses. Since I'm multiplying by -2, -2 times +25 is -50.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + 50. Wait, let's see:\n\n-2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) - 53 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + 50.\n\nWait, I think I did that wrong. Let's double-check.\n\nActually, when I factor out -2, I have -2(x\u00b2 + 10x), and then to complete the square, I add (10/2)\u00b2 = 25 inside the parentheses. But since I factored out -2, I need to add and subtract -2*25, because the 25 is inside the parentheses multiplied by -2.\n\nSo, -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53 is incorrect. Instead, it should be -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) - 53 + something.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. I have -2(x\u00b2 + 10x). To complete the square, I take half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25, and then add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses, but since I'm factoring out -2, I need to adjust for that.\n\nActually, a better way might be to factor out -2 from all three terms:\n\n-2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 26.5). Wait, 2*26.5 is 53, right? So, -2*26.5 = -53.\n\nBut that doesn't help me complete the square. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to complete the square without factoring out the -2 first.\n\nStarting with -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nI can factor out -2 from the first two terms: -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nNow, complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nTake half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nBut since I factored out -2, I have -2(x + 5)\u00b2 + something.\n\nWait, no: -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) = -2(x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nBut originally, the expression was -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) - 53.\n\nWait, no, it was -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nWhen I complete the square, I have -2(x + 5)\u00b2 + something.\n\nWait, let's compute -2(x + 5)\u00b2:\n\n-2(x + 5)\u00b2 = -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 50.\n\nBut our original expression is -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 50.\n\nComparing to the original expression: -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3 = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\n-2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3 = -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) - 3 = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 50 - 3 = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nYes, that matches the original expression.\n\nSo, -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3.\n\nTherefore, a = -2, d = 5, and e = -3.\n\nNow, the sum a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0.\n\nSo, the answer should be 0.\n\nWait, but looking at the options:\n\nA. -80\n\nB. 0\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 53\n\nSo, B. 0 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the vertex form of a quadratic equation.\n\nThe general form is a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex.\n\nBut in this problem, it's a(x + d)\u00b2 + e, which is similar.\n\nSo, a = -2, d = 5, e = -3, as I found earlier.\n\nSumming them up: -2 + 5 + (-3) = 0.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the vertex.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is at x = -b/(2a).\n\nHere, a = -2, b = -20.\n\nSo, x = -(-20)/(2*(-2)) = 20 / -4 = -5.\n\nThen, the vertex form is a(x - (-5))\u00b2 + k, which is a(x + 5)\u00b2 + k.\n\nSo, d = 5, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, to find e, which is k, I need to plug x = -5 back into the original equation.\n\nSo, y = -2*(-5)\u00b2 - 20*(-5) - 53 = -2*(25) + 100 - 53 = -50 + 100 - 53 = -3.\n\nSo, e = -3.\n\nTherefore, a + d + e = -2 + 5 + (-3) = 0.\n\nAgain, the sum is 0.\n\nLooks consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the completing the square method again, but more carefully this time.\n\nStarting with -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nFactor out -2 from the first two terms: -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nNow, complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nTake half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + something.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you factor out -2, and complete the square inside the parentheses, you have -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53, but you need to account for the +25 inside the parentheses being multiplied by -2.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + (-2)*25.\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses after factoring out -2 is -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nNow, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53.\n\nBut originally, it was -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you complete the square, you add and subtract the square inside the parentheses.\n\nSo, -2(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53.\n\nBut since you factored out -2, you have -2(x + 5)\u00b2 + (-2)*(-25) - 53.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 + 50 - 53 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3.\n\nWait, that matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3.\n\nTherefore, a = -2, d = 5, e = -3.\n\nSum is -2 + 5 + (-3) = 0.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for completing the square without factoring out the coefficient.\n\nStart with -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nFirst, factor out -2 from the first two terms: -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nNow, complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nTake half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + something.\n\nWait, no.\n\nActually, when you factor out -2, and complete the square inside the parentheses, you have -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53.\n\nBut you need to adjust for the +25 inside the parentheses being multiplied by -2.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + (-2)*25 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 - 50 = -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 103.\n\nWait, that doesn't match what I had before.\n\nI must have made a mistake here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\n-2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53 = -2(x\u00b2 + 10x) - 53.\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of 10, which is 5, square it to get 25.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 53 + something.\n\nBut since you factored out -2, and added 25 inside the parentheses, you need to account for the fact that -2*(x\u00b2 + 10x + 25) = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 50.\n\nSo, -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 50 is equal to -2(x + 5)\u00b2.\n\nBut our original expression is -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3 = -2x\u00b2 - 20x - 53.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, -2(x + 5)\u00b2 - 3 is the completed square form.\n\nTherefore, a = -2, d = 5, e = -3.\n\nSum is -2 + 5 + (-3) = 0.\n\nSo, the answer is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
