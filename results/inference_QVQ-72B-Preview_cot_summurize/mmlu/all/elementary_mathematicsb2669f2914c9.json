                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Which expression is another way to show 8 x 6?\" and there are four options to choose from. I need to find which one of these expressions is equal to 8 multiplied by 6.\n\nFirst, I know that 8 times 6 is 48. So, I can use that as a target number. I need to look at each option and see which one also equals 48.\n\nLet's look at option A: (24+4)+6. Let's calculate that. 24 plus 4 is 28, and then 28 plus 6 is 34. That's not 48, so option A is out.\n\nNext, option B: (2+4)x6. First, add 2 and 4, which makes 6, and then multiply by 6. 6 times 6 is 36. That's not 48, so option B is also incorrect.\n\nOption C: (2x4) + 6. Multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, then add 6 to make 14. That's not 48 either.\n\nLastly, option D: (2x4)x6. Multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then multiply that by 6. 8 times 6 is 48. That matches the target number.\n\nSo, based on the calculations, option D is the correct expression that represents 8 x 6.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting again:\n\nOption A: (24+4)+6 = 28+6 = 34 \u2260 48\n\nOption B: (2+4)x6 = 6x6 = 36 \u2260 48\n\nOption C: (2x4)+6 = 8+6 = 14 \u2260 48\n\nOption D: (2x4)x6 = 8x6 = 48\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to interpret some of these expressions. For example, perhaps there's an implicit operation or a different grouping that could lead to 48.\n\nLet's consider if there are any possible misinterpretations in the options.\n\nOption A: (24+4)+6. That's straightforward addition. No misinterpretation there.\n\nOption B: (2+4)x6. That's addition followed by multiplication. Again, clear.\n\nOption C: (2x4)+6. Multiplication and addition. No ambiguity.\n\nOption D: (2x4)x6. Multiplication associative property. That's correct.\n\nHmm, all options seem straightforward without any tricks. So, based on that, option D is indeed the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the distributive property or some other algebraic property. Let's see.\n\nThe distributive property states that a(b+c) = ab + ac. Is there a way to apply that here?\n\nWell, 8x6 can be thought of as 8*(4+2), which would be 8*4 + 8*2, which is 32 + 16 = 48. That's interesting. So, 8x6 is equal to (8*4) + (8*2). But looking back at the options, none of them directly represent this. Option D is (2x4)x6, which is 8x6, but that's different from (8*4) + (8*2).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question seems pretty direct: which expression equals 8x6. By calculating each option, only option D gives the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of the associative property of multiplication. Since multiplication is associative, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c). In option D, (2x4)x6 is the same as 8x6, which matches our target.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret \"another way to show 8 x 6\" that might correspond to one of the other options.\n\nFor example, maybe using the distributive property in a different way. Suppose we break down 8x6 as (4+4)x6 = 4x6 + 4x6 = 24 + 24 = 48. But that's not represented in the options.\n\nAlternatively, 8x6 could be seen as 8x(3+3) = 8x3 + 8x3 = 24 + 24 = 48. Again, not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the commutative property, but multiplication is commutative, so 8x6 = 6x8, but that's not directly represented here.\n\nGiven all that, it seems that option D is the only one that correctly represents 8x6.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to test the understanding of the associative property, ensuring that students recognize that (2x4)x6 is the same as 8x6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo or misinterpretation in the options. But based on the given options, option D is the correct one.\n\nSo, my final answer is option D: (2x4)x6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
