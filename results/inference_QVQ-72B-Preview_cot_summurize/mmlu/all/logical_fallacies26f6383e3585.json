The options are:\n\nA. appeal to loyalty\n\nB. reducing to an absurdity\n\nC. ignorance of refutation\n\nD. argument against the person\n\nHmm, I need to recall what \"ad hominem\" means. I think it's a fallacy where you attack the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. Like, instead of saying why someone's idea is wrong, you insult them or question their character. So, it's about attacking the person rather than the idea.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: appeal to loyalty. I'm not sure about this one. Does it mean trying to persuade someone by appealing to their sense of loyalty to a group or a person? That sounds different from ad hominem. Maybe it's related to another fallacy, but I'm not sure which one.\n\nOption B: reducing to an absurdity. This sounds like a different fallacy. I think \"reductio ad absurdum\" is a technique where you take an argument to its extreme to show how ridiculous it is. That's actually a valid argument technique when used correctly, but it's not the same as ad hominem, which is about attacking the person.\n\nOption C: ignorance of refutation. This one sounds vague. I think it might refer to a situation where someone fails to provide a proper refutation of an argument, maybe just dismissing it without giving a reason. But that doesn't seem directly related to ad hominem, which is specifically about attacking the person rather than addressing the argument.\n\nOption D: argument against the person. This seems the most straightforward. It literally says \"argument against the person,\" which aligns perfectly with what I remember about ad hominem. Ad hominem is Latin for \"to the person,\" and it's about making an argument based on personal attacks rather than engaging with the actual ideas being presented.\n\nLet me double-check. Ad hominem fallacies are about attacking the person making the argument, not the argument itself. So, if someone says, \"Your argument is invalid because you're a liar,\" that's ad hominem because it's attacking the person's character instead of addressing why the argument is wrong.\n\nOption D says \"argument against the person,\" which seems to capture that idea perfectly. The other options seem to describe different concepts or different fallacies.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that D. argument against the person is another name for ad hominem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
