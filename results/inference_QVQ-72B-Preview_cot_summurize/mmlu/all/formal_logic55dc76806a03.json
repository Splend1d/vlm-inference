                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here with some premises and I need to figure out which proposition follows directly from them in just one step. The premises are:\n\n1. U \u2283 W\n\n2. W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y)\n\n3. (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\n4. ~Z\n\nAnd the options are:\n\na. U \u2283 Z\n\nb. U \u2228 W\n\nc. ~W\n\nd. ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nI need to find out which one of these is an immediate consequence of the premises. I think the best way to approach this is to look at the chain of implications and see how they connect.\n\nFirst, let's look at the premises:\n\n1. U \u2283 W\n\n2. W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y)\n\n3. (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\n4. ~Z\n\nThese form a chain: U implies W, which implies (X \u2261 ~Y), which implies Z, and we have ~Z.\n\nSo, starting from U, we can go through W and (X \u2261 ~Y) to get to Z, but since we have ~Z, that seems like it could lead to a contradiction if U is assumed. But the question is asking for an immediate consequence, not necessarily involving U.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: U \u2283 Z\n\nDoes U imply Z directly from the premises? Let's see. From U, we get W from premise 1. From W, we get (X \u2261 ~Y) from premise 2. From (X \u2261 ~Y), we get Z from premise 3. So, yes, U implies Z through this chain. But is this an immediate consequence? Immediate usually means one step, not a chain of multiple steps. Maybe not.\n\nOption B: U \u2228 W\n\nIs this an immediate consequence of the premises? I don't see a direct connection for a disjunction here. Premise 1 is U \u2283 W, which is similar but not the same as U \u2228 W. Maybe not.\n\nOption C: ~W\n\nThis is interesting. We have U \u2283 W, and then W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and so on. But we have ~Z at the end. If Z is false, and (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z is true, then (X \u2261 ~Y) must be false because if (X \u2261 ~Y) were true, Z would be true, but it's not. So, (X \u2261 ~Y) is false.\n\nIf (X \u2261 ~Y) is false, then from premise 2, W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), and since (X \u2261 ~Y) is false, W could be either true or false. This doesn't immediately give me ~W. Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. If (X \u2261 ~Y) is false, then from premise 3, (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z, and since (X \u2261 ~Y) is false and ~Z is true, Z is false, which is consistent. But does that tell me anything about W?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of contrapositives. The contrapositive of premise 3 is ~Z \u2283 ~(X \u2261 ~Y). We have ~Z, so ~(X \u2261 ~Y). Then, the contrapositive of premise 2 is ~(X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 ~W. So, from ~Z, I can get to ~W via contrapositives. That seems like a two-step process, but maybe there's a way to do it in one step.\n\nWait, maybe using the law of syllogism. If I have A \u2283 B and B \u2283 C, then A \u2283 C. Here, I have (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z and ~Z, which is the same as Z \u2283 something, but ~Z is not the same as Z \u2283 something directly.\n\nActually, ~Z is the same as Z \u2283 False, but I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nOption D: ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nFrom premise 3, (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z, and we have ~Z, so by modus tollens, ~(X \u2261 ~Y). That seems straightforward. It's a direct application of modus tollens on premise 3 and premise 4.\n\nSo, that's a one-step consequence: from (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z and ~Z, we get ~(X \u2261 ~Y).\n\nIs this the immediate consequence the question is referring to?\n\nLet me check the other options again.\n\nOption A: U \u2283 Z\n\nThis seems to require two steps: U \u2283 W and W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y) and (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z, so it's not immediate.\n\nOption B: U \u2228 W\n\nNot directly supported by the premises.\n\nOption C: ~W\n\nAs I thought earlier, from ~(X \u2261 ~Y) and W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y), I can't immediately conclude ~W because W could be true and (X \u2261 ~Y) false, which is possible.\n\nOption D: ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nThis seems to be the most immediate consequence from the given premises, using modus tollens on premise 3 and premise 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D: ~(X \u2261 ~Y).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
