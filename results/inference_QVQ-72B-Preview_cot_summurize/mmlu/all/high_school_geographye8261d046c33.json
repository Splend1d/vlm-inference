                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"A map that presents a single class of statistics is called a ___. \" And the options are:\n\nA. general purpose map.\n\nB. thematic map.\n\nC. reference map.\n\nD. mental map.\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to figure out which type of map is designed to show a single class of statistics.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a \"single class of statistics\" means in this context. I think it means that the map is focusing on one specific type of data or information, like population density, temperature, or elevation.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: general purpose map.\n\nWhat is a general purpose map? From what I recall, general purpose maps are meant to provide a broad overview of an area, showing features like roads, rivers, cities, and maybe some topographical details. They aren't specifically focused on a single type of data. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B: thematic map.\n\nThematic maps are known for focusing on a particular theme or topic. They can show a variety of data, such as population, climate, vegetation, or economic activities. But the question specifies a \"single class of statistics,\" which suggests focusing on one specific type of data. So, a thematic map might be a candidate, but I need to check if it's limited to just one class of statistics.\n\nOption C: reference map.\n\nReference maps are usually used for navigation or locating places. They show features like roads, buildings, and geographical boundaries. They provide a reference framework but don't typically focus on a single class of statistics. So, similar to the general purpose map, they seem to show multiple types of information rather than a single class of statistics.\n\nOption D: mental map.\n\nA mental map is not an actual physical map but rather an individual's perception or cognition of a place. It's more about how people understand and remember spatial information. This doesn't fit the description of presenting a single class of statistics.\n\nSo, between options A, B, and C, B seems the most plausible. Thematic maps are designed to show specific types of data, and if we're talking about a map that presents a single class of statistics, it would fall under the category of thematic maps.\n\nBut wait, thematic maps can sometimes show multiple variables, right? For example, a map might show both population density and age distribution. So, would that still be considered a single class of statistics?\n\nLet me think again. The question specifies a single class of statistics, which implies that the map is focusing on one specific type of data or one variable.\n\nIf that's the case, then a thematic map that focuses on a single variable would be appropriate. However, thematic maps can be designed to show multiple variables as well, depending on the purpose.\n\nMaybe I need to consider if there's a specific type of thematic map that only shows one class of statistics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of these options are entirely accurate, but I have to choose the best fit among them.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that a thematic map can be customized to show a single class of statistics. For example, a map that only shows the population density without any other data would be a thematic map with a single class of statistics.\n\nIn contrast, a reference map or a general purpose map would include multiple types of information, not just statistical data.\n\nA mental map is again, not a physical map, so it's out of the question.\n\nSo, my best guess is that a map presenting a single class of statistics is called a thematic map.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. thematic map.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
