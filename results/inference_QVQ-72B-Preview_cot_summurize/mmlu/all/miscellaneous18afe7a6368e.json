                    "text": "So I have this question about music theory, specifically about common time. The question is: if a piece of music is in 'common time,' how many quarter notes are there per measure? The options are A. one, B. four, C. five, D. ten.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 'common time' means in music. From what I recall, 'common time' is a term used to describe a time signature that has four beats in each measure, and the quarter note gets one beat. So, essentially, it's the same as 4/4 time signature.\n\nLet me double-check that. In music notation, the time signature tells us how many beats are in each measure and which note value gets one beat. The 'common time' signature is traditionally represented by the symbol , which means there are four beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.\n\nSo, if each measure has four beats, and each quarter note gets one beat, then there should be four quarter notes per measure.\n\nWait a minute, but I see that in some old sheet music, the 'common time' is sometimes written as 4/4, so that aligns with my understanding.\n\nLet me consider another perspective. If I think about the different time signatures and how they relate to 'common time.' For example, 3/4 time is waltz time, which has three beats per measure, and 6/8 time has six beats per measure, often felt as two groups of three.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with 'common time,' which is 4/4, so four beats per measure, with each beat being a quarter note.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can look up the definition of 'common time' to confirm. According to music theory, 'common time' is indeed the 4/4 time signature, where each measure has four quarter notes, or four beats.\n\nI think I've got it right. Let me see if there's any trick here that I might be missing. The question seems straightforward: it's asking directly about the number of quarter notes per measure in 'common time.'\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the relationship between different note values. For instance, a half note is worth two beats, so in 4/4 time, one half note would take up two beats, meaning there would be two half notes per measure in 4/4 time. But since the question is about quarter notes, which are each one beat, there should be four of them per measure.\n\nAlternatively, in 4/4 time, you could have a combination of notes that add up to four beats. For example, you could have one whole note (four beats), or two half notes (two beats each, totaling four), or four quarter notes (one beat each), or any combination that adds up to four beats per measure.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the number of quarter notes per measure in 'common time,' assuming that the measure is filled entirely with quarter notes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, in 'common time' (4/4), there are four quarter notes per measure.\n\nI believe the correct answer is B. four.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
