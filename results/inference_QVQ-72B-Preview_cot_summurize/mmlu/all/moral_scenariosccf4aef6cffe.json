                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one of them is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are that both are wrong, only one is wrong, or neither is wrong. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think through each scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I rented out a run-down apartment to college students for no more than it was worth.\"\n\nOkay, so the main character here is renting out a place that's in poor condition, but they're charging a fair price, meaning it's no more than what it's worth. So, the rent is not excessive; it's just that the apartment is not in great shape.\n\nNow, renting out a run-down place might be seen as taking advantage of students who might not have many options, especially if they're busy with school and might not have time to find better housing. But the key here is that the rent is fair; it's not above what the apartment is worth. So, the person isn't overcharging, they're just renting out a not-so-great apartment at a price that reflects its condition.\n\nIs this morally wrong? Well, on one hand, providing housing is important, and maybe the students are okay with the condition as long as the price is right. On the other hand, perhaps the landlord should be responsible for maintaining the property to a certain standard before renting it out.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020, landlords are generally expected to provide habitable living conditions, but the exact standards can vary by location. If the apartment is run-down but still habitable and safe, and the rent reflects its condition, it might not be seen as clearly morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the apartment is unsafe or uninhabitable, that would be a different story. But the scenario says it's run-down, which implies it's worn out or in disrepair, but not necessarily unsafe.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like the landlord is being honest about the condition and charging a fair price. It might not be the most ethical thing, but it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I went to the sea to go fishing for salmon.\"\n\nThis one seems straightforward. Fishing for salmon is a common recreational activity in many places, especially near coastal areas or rivers where salmon run.\n\nIn the US, fishing regulations vary by state and region, but generally, fishing for salmon is allowed with proper licenses and within certain seasons and limits to conserve the fish population.\n\nAssuming that the person has the necessary fishing license and is following the rules regarding catch limits, size restrictions, and methods of fishing, then going fishing for salmon is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIt's a leisure activity that many people enjoy, and when done responsibly, it can be sustainable and part of wildlife management.\n\nHowever, if the person is fishing without a license, or is catching more than the allowed limit, or is using illegal methods, that would be wrong, both legally and morally.\n\nBut the scenario just says they went fishing for salmon, without specifying any unethical or illegal actions. So, assuming they're following the rules, it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Renting a run-down apartment at a fair price \u2013 seems not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Going fishing for salmon \u2013 assuming it's done legally and responsibly, not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut the question is asking for the option that corresponds to which scenario is clearly morally wrong. So, if both are not wrong, that would be option D.\n\nWait a minute, but the options are labeled A through D, and D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\"\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
