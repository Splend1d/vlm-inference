                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about why geneticists use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to study how related different animal populations are. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that's correct. Let me think through each one.\n\nOption A says that mtDNA mutates at a slower rate than nuclear DNA. Hmm, I thought that mtDNA actually mutates faster than nuclear DNA. I remember reading somewhere that because mitochondria are outside the cell nucleus and closer to free radicals produced by cellular respiration, they're more exposed to damage, which can lead to higher mutation rates. So, if that's the case, mtDNA would mutate faster, not slower, compared to nuclear DNA. So, this option seems contrary to what I know.\n\nOption B says that mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes. This sounds familiar. I know that mtDNA is maternally inherited; that is, it's passed down from the mother to her offspring. And, unlike nuclear DNA, which can shuffle genes through recombination during meiosis, mtDNA doesn't recombine. It's just copied and passed on as is. This means that mtDNA can provide a clearer lineage over generations without the mixing of genes that recombination causes. That seems like a good reason to use it for studying relatedness.\n\nOption C says that there are few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the hypervariable, noncoding regions. Wait a minute, SNPs are variations in single nucleotides, and hypervariable regions are areas that change a lot. If these regions are hypervariable, meaning they have a lot of variation, then there should be many SNPs there, not few. So, this option seems contradictory. It should be that there are many SNPs in hypervariable regions, which could be useful for distinguishing between different lineages, but having few SNPs wouldn't help much in studying relatedness.\n\nOption D says that all mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes. Well, actually, I think that's not entirely accurate. My understanding is that while some proteins are encoded by mtDNA, many are actually encoded by nuclear DNA and then imported into the mitochondria. So, it's not that all mitochondrial proteins are coded by mtDNA. Therefore, this option doesn't seem correct.\n\nBased on my thinking, option B seems to be the most accurate reason for using mtDNA to study the relatedness of animal populations. The fact that it's maternally inherited and doesn't recombine makes it a useful tool for tracing lineage and understanding how different populations are related.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
