                    "text": "So I have this function \\(f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3\\) and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. I'm a bit rusty on multivariable calculus, but I remember that to find extrema of a function of two variables, I need to find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives with respect to both variables and setting them to zero. Then, I can use the second derivative test to classify those points.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nLet's find \\(f_x\\):\n\n\\[\nf_x = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 2y\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(f_y\\):\n\n\\[\nf_y = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2x + 3y^2\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n2x - 2y = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-2x + 3y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[\n2x - 2y = 0 \\implies x = y\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = y\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n-2y + 3y^2 = 0 \\implies y(3y - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\). Since \\(x = y\\), the critical points are \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nNow, I need to determine the nature of these critical points. To do that, I'll use the second derivative test. I need to compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\nf_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -2\n\\]\n\nThe discriminant \\(D\\) at a point is:\n\n\\[\nD = f_{xx} f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2\n\\]\n\nAt \\((0, 0)\\):\n\n\\[\nD(0,0) = (2)(0) - (-2)^2 = 0 - 4 = -4 < 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(D < 0\\), this point is a saddle point.\n\nAt \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\):\n\n\\[\nD\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = (2)(4) - (-2)^2 = 8 - 4 = 4 > 0\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(f_{xx} > 0\\), so this is a relative minimum.\n\nWait a minute, option C says \\(f\\) has a relative minimum at \\((0,0)\\), but according to my calculations, it's a saddle point. So option C is false.\n\nOption D says \\(f\\) has an absolute minimum at \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\). Well, it's a relative minimum, but is it an absolute minimum?\n\nTo determine if it's an absolute minimum, I need to check the behavior of \\(f\\) at infinity and compare it to the value at \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\).\n\nLet's evaluate \\(f\\) at \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{9} - \\frac{8}{9} + \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 8}{27} = \\frac{4}{27}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the behavior as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) go to infinity. Since there's a \\(y^3\\) term, which grows without bound as \\(y\\) increases, and there are no other terms that would dominate this for large \\(y\\), it seems that \\(f\\) can take arbitrarily large values as \\(y\\) goes to infinity. Similarly, for large negative \\(y\\), \\(y^3\\) becomes very negative, but \\(x^2 - 2xy\\) could balance that out, but not necessarily.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider specific directions. For example, along the line \\(x = y\\), substituting \\(x = y\\):\n\n\\[\nf(y, y) = y^2 - 2y^2 + y^3 = -y^2 + y^3 = y^2(-1 + y)\n\\]\n\nThis goes to negative infinity as \\(y\\) goes to negative infinity and to positive infinity as \\(y\\) goes to positive infinity. So, the function has no global maximum or minimum.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\) is a relative minimum but not an absolute minimum, since the function can take smaller values elsewhere. So, option D is false.\n\nNow, option A says that all relative extrema are on the line \\(x = y\\). From my earlier analysis, I found two critical points: \\((0,0)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\), both of which lie on the line \\(x = y\\). So, based on that, it seems that all relative extrema are indeed on the line \\(x = y\\). But I should check if there are any other critical points that I might have missed.\n\nLet me double-check the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n2x - 2y = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -2x + 3y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, \\(x = y\\), substituting into the second gives \\(-2y + 3y^2 = 0\\), which factors as \\(y(3y - 2) = 0\\), giving \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\), as before. So, no other critical points exist.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B says that all relative extrema are on the parabola \\(x = y^2\\). But from my earlier findings, the critical points are on \\(x = y\\), not on \\(x = y^2\\). So, option B is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct option is A: \\(f\\) has all of its relative extrema on the line \\(x = y\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
