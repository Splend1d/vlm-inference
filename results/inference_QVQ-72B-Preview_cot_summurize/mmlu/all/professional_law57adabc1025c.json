                    "text": "So I've got this case to analyze. It's about a partnership that bought five acres of land intended for residential development. Later, a state law was passed requiring the city to create a general plan for land use and open-space development. This plan ended up limiting the development of their five-acre lot to only one to five single-family residences. The partnership is upset because they feel this is a taking of their property without just compensation, which they say violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They lost at the local and appellate levels, and now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case. I need to figure out what the Supreme Court might decide based on the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The partnership bought the land with the intention of developing it for residential use. Then, a new law required the city to make a plan for land use and open space, which resulted in restrictions on how much they could develop their land. Specifically, they can only build one to five single-family homes on their five-acre lot. The partnership is arguing that this is a taking of their property without compensation, citing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment includes the Takings Clause, which states that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. The Fourteenth Amendment applies this protection to the states through its Due Process Clause. So, the partnership is claiming that the city's plan effectively takes away their ability to fully use their property for development, thereby depriving them of the value of their property without compensating them.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\n\nSpot zoning is when a zoning change is made to benefit a particular property owner, often in a way that's inconsistent with the comprehensive plan of the area. But in this case, it seems like the zoning change is part of a general plan required by state law, not necessarily to benefit a particular property owner. So, it might not be considered spot zoning. Maybe the city is applying a general plan that affects multiple properties, not just this one.\n\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\n\nThe partnership is arguing that this is a taking without compensation, but the option mentions \"without prior notice.\" I'm not sure if notice is the main issue here. The takings clause is more about whether the regulation goes too far, effectively taking the property, not necessarily about notice.\n\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\n\nThis seems like a defense of the city's plan. The city might argue that even with the restriction to one to five residences, the partnership can still develop the land to some extent. Maybe they're saying that being able to build up to five houses is sufficient and doesn't constitute a taking.\n\nD. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe ex post facto clause prohibits passing laws that criminalize actions retroactively or change the legal consequences of actions after they were committed. In this case, the partnership bought the land before the law was passed, and then the law changed how the land could be used. But is this an ex post facto violation? Ex post facto laws typically relate to criminal penalties, not to regulatory changes affecting property use.\n\nGiven these options, I need to think about which one is most likely to be the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nFirst, regarding option A, spot zoning: I'm not sure if this applies here because it seems like the zoning change is part of a general plan, not just benefiting one property owner. So, maybe this isn't the right classification.\n\nOption B talks about an unlawful taking without prior notice. While the partnership is arguing that it's a taking, the mention of \"without prior notice\" makes me think that notice might not be the primary issue here. The takings clause is more about the substance of the regulation and whether it goes too far, not about whether there was notice before the regulation was enacted.\n\nOption C suggests that allowing up to five residences makes the ordinance constitutional. This seems plausible. If the partnership can still build up to five houses on their five-acre lot, maybe that's a reasonable use. Depending on the local standards, five houses on five acres might be a low density, but it's still some development. The city might argue that this doesn't constitute a taking because the property still has value and can be developed.\n\nOption D mentions the ex post facto clause. While it's true that the law was passed after the partnership bought the land, ex post facto laws typically apply to criminal matters, not to regulatory changes in property use. So, I doubt that this would be the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most likely. The Supreme Court might rule that since the ordinance still allows for development of up to five residences, it doesn't amount to a taking. The partnership still has the ability to use their property for its intended purpose, just with some restrictions on density.\n\nBut wait, I should think about this more carefully. What if the partnership had planned to build more than five houses? Maybe they had plans for a denser development, and this restriction significantly reduces the potential profit from the property. In that case, they might argue that the restriction goes too far and constitutes a taking.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has established precedents for when regulations go too far and amount to a taking. One famous test is the Penn Central Test, which looks at several factors:\n\n1. The economic impact of the regulation on the claimant.\n\n2. The extent to which the regulation interferes with distinct investment-backed expectations.\n\n3. The character of the government action.\n\nIn this case, the regulation allows some development but limits it to one to five residences. Depending on the size of the lot and local standards, this might not be too restrictive. If five houses on five acres is a reasonable density, the Supreme Court might not find this to be a taking.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost of complying with the new plan is prohibitive or if the restriction severely diminishes the property's value, it could be considered a taking.\n\nBut considering that some development is still allowed, it's less likely to be seen as a total taking. If it's a partial taking, the partnership might be entitled to some compensation, but that's not clear from the options given.\n\nGiven the options, I think option C is the most straightforward and likely answer. The ordinance allows for up to five residences, which is some development, and therefore it's constitutional.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other angle that might make another option more plausible.\n\nOption A, illegal spot zoning, doesn't seem to fit because this appears to be a general plan affecting multiple properties, not just spot zoning for one property.\n\nOption B, unlawful taking without prior notice, might be relevant if the regulation was applied retroactively without adequate notice, but I don't have enough information to support that.\n\nOption D, violation of the ex post facto clause, seems unlikely because ex post facto laws are generally about criminal penalties, not regulatory changes to property use.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option C is the correct answer: The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
