                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Airmail Express and their shipping charges based on the weight of packages. They have different price brackets for different weights, and they don't accept packages over 20 pounds. The question is asking which set of data (weights) would be best to test a program that calculates these shipping charges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the charging system:\n\n- For weights greater than 0 but up to and including 2 pounds, it's $4.00.\n\n- For weights greater than 2 but up to and including 5 pounds, it's $8.00.\n\n- For weights greater than 5 but up to and including 20 pounds, it's $15.00.\n\n- And they don't accept packages over 20 pounds, so probably there's some kind of error or special handling for weights above 20 pounds.\n\nNow, when testing a program that calculates shipping charges, it's important to cover various scenarios to ensure the program handles different cases correctly. This includes:\n\n1. **Boundary values:** Weights that are exactly at the limits of each pricing bracket.\n\n2. **Normal values:** Weights within each pricing bracket but not on the boundary.\n\n3. **Invalid values:** Weights that are not accepted, like those over 20 pounds, and also negative weights since packages can't have negative weight.\n\n4. **Zero weight:** Although the first bracket starts above 0 pounds, it's still important to test how the program handles zero weight.\n\nSo, let's look at the options provided:\n\n**Option A:** 0, 2, 5, 20\n\n- 0: This is a boundary case since it's the lower limit of the first bracket.\n\n- 2: Upper boundary of the first bracket.\n\n- 5: Upper boundary of the second bracket.\n\n- 20: Upper boundary of the third bracket.\n\nThis set covers the boundaries well, but it doesn't include any weights within the brackets or any invalid weights.\n\n**Option B:** 1, 4, 16\n\n- 1: Within the first bracket (0 < w \u2264 2).\n\n- 4: Within the second bracket (2 < w \u2264 5).\n\n- 16: Within the third bracket (5 < w \u2264 20).\n\nThis set includes weights within each bracket but misses the boundary values and any invalid weights.\n\n**Option C:** -1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20\n\n- -1: Invalid weight (negative).\n\n- 1: Within the first bracket.\n\n- 2: Upper boundary of the first bracket.\n\n- 3: Within the second bracket.\n\n- 5: Upper boundary of the second bracket.\n\n- 16: Within the third bracket.\n\n- 20: Upper boundary of the third bracket.\n\nThis set includes boundary values, weights within brackets, and an invalid weight.\n\n**Option D:** -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22\n\n- -1: Invalid weight (negative).\n\n- 0: Lower boundary of the first bracket.\n\n- 1: Within the first bracket.\n\n- 2: Upper boundary of the first bracket.\n\n- 3: Within the second bracket.\n\n- 5: Upper boundary of the second bracket.\n\n- 16: Within the third bracket.\n\n- 20: Upper boundary of the third bracket.\n\n- 22: Invalid weight (over 20 pounds).\n\nThis set is similar to option C but includes 0 and 22, which are additional boundary and invalid values.\n\nNow, let's evaluate which of these options is the best for testing the program.\n\n- **Boundary values:** All options include some boundary values, but option A only has boundaries, while options C and D have both boundaries and invalid values.\n\n- **Invalid values:** Options C and D include invalid weights (-1 and 22), which are important to test how the program handles weights outside the accepted range.\n\n- **Zero weight:** Option D includes 0, which is important to test since it's the lower boundary of the first bracket.\n\n- **Weights within brackets:** Options B, C, and D include weights within the brackets, which are important to ensure that the program correctly assigns the corresponding charges.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D seems to be the most comprehensive:\n\n- It includes both boundary and invalid values.\n\n- It covers all pricing brackets with actual weights.\n\n- It includes zero weight, which is a critical boundary.\n\n- It includes weights just above and below the acceptable range to test error handling.\n\nOption C is also strong but misses the zero weight and has one less boundary value compared to option D.\n\nOption B lacks boundary and invalid values, which are crucial for thorough testing.\n\nOption A has all the boundary values but no invalid weights or weights within the brackets.\n\nTherefore, the best set of data to test the program is option D: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22.\n\nThis set will help ensure that the program correctly handles all possible input scenarios, including valid and invalid weights, and the boundaries of each pricing bracket.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
