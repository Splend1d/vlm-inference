                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following sites has monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle that date from around 3,500 years ago? The options are A. Caral, B. Stonehenge, C. Poverty Point, D. Gobekli Tepe.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First off, we're looking for a site that has monumental earthworks\u2014so probably big structures made of earth, like mounds or ridges. Specifically, these earthworks have concentric ridges arranged in a semicircle. And they should date back to around 3,500 years ago, which would be roughly 1500 BCE.\n\nOkay, so I need to recall some information about each of these sites to see which one fits this description.\n\nStarting with Caral, which is in Peru. Caral is known as one of the oldest urban centers in the Americas, dating back to about 4,500 to 5,000 years ago. It's famous for its pyramids and plazas, but I don't remember anything about concentric ridges in a semicircle there. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's more about architectural structures rather than earthworks.\n\nNext, Stonehenge in England. This is a prehistoric monument consisting of a ring of standing stones, with the earliest construction phases dating back to around 3,100 BCE. While Stonehenge does have earthworks, like the circular ditch and bank surrounding the stones, I don't think there are concentric ridges in a semicircle. It's more about circular features and alignments of stones. So, probably not the right choice.\n\nThen there's Poverty Point in Louisiana, USA. This site is known for its massive earthworks, including six concentric semi-circular ridges. Wait, that sounds promising. Let me think more about this. Poverty Point is estimated to be around 3,200 to 3,600 years old, which aligns pretty closely with the 3,500 years ago mentioned in the question. Moreover, the description mentions monumental earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle, which perfectly matches the design of Poverty Point.\n\nFinally, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey. This is another ancient site, dating back to around 12,000 years ago, making it much older than the specified 3,500 years ago. It's known for its T-shaped megaliths and elaborate stone structures. Since the timing doesn't match, I can probably eliminate this option.\n\nSo, comparing all four options:\n\n- Caral: Wrong type of structures, and a bit too old.\n\n- Stonehenge: Has earthworks but not the specific concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\n- Poverty Point: Perfect match in terms of structure and age.\n\n- Gobekli Tepe: Way older than required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Poverty Point.\n\nJust to make sure, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that one of the other sites could also have similar features?\n\nFor Caral, while it does have pyramids and plazas, nothing about concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\nStonehenge has a henge, which is a bank and ditch, but not concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\nGobekli Tepe is primarily known for its stone T-shaped pillars, not earthworks like ridges.\n\nPoverty Point, on the other hand, is famous for its concentric semi-circular ridges, and its age is consistent with the given timeframe.\n\nYeah, I'm confident that C. Poverty Point is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Poverty Point}} \\]"
