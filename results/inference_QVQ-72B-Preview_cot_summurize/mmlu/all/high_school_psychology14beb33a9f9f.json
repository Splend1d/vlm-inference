The options are bias, conditioning, catharsis, and discrimination. Let me think through each one.\n\nFirst, bias. I know that bias refers to a predisposition or inclination toward something, often based on preconceived notions or stereotypes. It's like having a tendency to favor one group over another without really having all the facts. So, bias is more about the attitude or the inclination itself, not necessarily the action.\n\nConditioning sounds a bit different. It makes me think of learning through rewards and punishments, like in classical or operant conditioning. In the context of attitudes toward groups, maybe it's about how people learn to associate certain groups with positive or negative outcomes. But again, this seems more about how attitudes are formed rather than the behavioral component of expressing negative attitudes.\n\nCatharsis is another option. I recall that catharsis is the process of releasing strong emotions, often through expression or action. In psychology, it's sometimes referred to as the idea that expressing negative emotions can be therapeutic. But in the context of negative attitudes toward groups, catharsis might involve expressing prejudice or hatred, which isn't a healthy or acceptable behavior. However, I'm not sure if catharsis is the term used to describe the behavioral aspect of negative attitudes.\n\nLastly, there's discrimination. This one seems straightforward. Discrimination involves treating people unfairly based on their membership in a particular group, such as race, gender, religion, or other characteristics. It's the action or behavior that results from negative attitudes toward a group.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Bias: inclination or prejudice\n\n- Conditioning: learning process that may lead to biases\n\n- Catharsis: emotional release, possibly through expressive behavior\n\n- Discrimination: actual behavior that treats people unfairly based on group membership\n\nGiven that, the question is asking for the behavioral component of negative attitudes toward particular groups. So, it's looking for the action that stems from holding negative attitudes.\n\nI think discrimination fits best here because it directly involves behaving in a way that shows negative treatment based on group membership.\n\nBias is more about the attitude itself, not the behavior. Conditioning is about how the attitude is formed. Catharsis is about emotional expression, which might not necessarily translate into discriminatory behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Discrimination.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there a possibility that catharsis could be considered the behavioral component? Well, catharsis involves expressing emotions, which could include hateful speech or actions, but it's not typically used to describe systematic or institutionalized unfair treatment. Discrimination, on the other hand, encompasses a wide range of behaviors that can be both individual and systemic.\n\nBias and conditioning are more about the cognitive and learning aspects, whereas discrimination is about the behavior.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I'm confident that discrimination is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
