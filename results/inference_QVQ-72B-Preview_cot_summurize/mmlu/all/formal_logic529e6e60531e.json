                    "text": "So I have this sentence: \"Dylan likes neither math nor science.\" And I need to find out which logical formula best represents this statement from the given options. The options are:\n\nA. M \u2228 S\n\nB. ~(M \u2022 S)\n\nC. ~(M \u2228 S)\n\nD. ~M \u2228 ~S\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The sentence says \"neither math nor science,\" which means Dylan doesn't like math and he doesn't like science. So, both M and S are false. In logical terms, that would be ~M \u2022 ~S.\n\nWait, but let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: M \u2228 S \u2013 This means Dylan likes math or he likes science. But the statement says he likes neither, so this doesn't match.\n\nOption B: ~(M \u2022 S) \u2013 This is the negation of \"Dylan likes both math and science,\" which means he does not like both. So, it could be that he likes one but not the other, or neither. But the statement specifies he likes neither, so this seems too broad.\n\nOption C: ~(M \u2228 S) \u2013 This is the negation of \"Dylan likes math or science,\" which means he does not like math and he does not like science. That sounds exactly like \"neither math nor science.\"\n\nOption D: ~M \u2228 ~S \u2013 This means either he doesn't like math or he doesn't like science. But the original statement says he doesn't like either, so this could be true, but it might also be true if he doesn't like one and likes the other. So, not precise enough.\n\nSo, between options C and D, which one is better?\n\nOption C: ~(M \u2228 S) \u2013 This is equivalent to ~M \u2022 ~S, which perfectly captures \"neither math nor science.\"\n\nOption D: ~M \u2228 ~S \u2013 This is equivalent to saying he doesn't like math or doesn't like science, which could include the case where he doesn't like math but likes science, or likes math but doesn't like science, or doesn't like either. So, it's not specific enough for the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the sentence \"Dylan likes neither math nor science\" is option C: ~(M \u2228 S).\n\nWait a minute, is there a difference between ~(M \u2228 S) and ~M \u2022 ~S? Actually, in logic, these are equivalent due to De Morgan's laws. So, ~(M \u2228 S) is the same as ~M \u2022 ~S. Good, that makes sense.\n\nSo, even though option D is ~M \u2228 ~S, which is different, it's still related because it's the disjunction of negations, but as I thought, it doesn't capture the exact meaning of \"neither...nor...\" as precisely as option C does.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
