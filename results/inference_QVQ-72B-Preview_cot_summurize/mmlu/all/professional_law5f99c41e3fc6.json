                    "text": "So I've got this scenario about a stamp collector who wants to sell his collection to his cousin. There's some confusion about the price because the secretary typed the wrong amount in the letter. Let me try to figure out what the correct price is and whether the mistake affects the enforceability of the contract.\n\nFirst, the collector intended to sell the collection for $78,000, but the secretary mistakenly typed $75,000 in the letter. The cousin then accepted the offer based on the $75,000 price. So, there's a discrepancy between what the collector intended and what was actually written in the letter.\n\nI need to determine the price term of the agreement and its legal effect. There are four options provided:\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 to correct a mistake in integration.\n\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n\nLet me analyze each option one by one.\n\nOption A says the price is $75,000 and it's enforceable. But the collector intended to sell for $78,000, so if the contract is enforced at $75,000, it would go against his original intention. Maybe the collector would want to correct this mistake.\n\nOption B says the price is $78,000 and it's enforceable. But the letter clearly states $75,000, and the cousin accepted that price. So, unless there's a way to correct the mistake, the actual price should be $75,000.\n\nOption C suggests that the price term is $75,000, but the court will reform it to $78,000 to correct a mistake in integration. This sounds like a case of reformation of the contract to match the original intention of the parties.\n\nOption D states that the price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact. Mutual mistake generally refers to a situation where both parties share a common mistake about a material fact, which affects the basis of the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand whether this is a case of mutual mistake or just a unilateral mistake by the collector's secretary.\n\nThe mistake was made by the secretary, who typed $75,000 instead of $78,000. The cousin was unaware of this mistake and accepted the offer as presented. So, it seems like a unilateral mistake by the collector's side, not a mutual mistake where both parties are in error.\n\nIn contract law, mutual mistake can sometimes allow for rescission or reformation of the contract. But since this is a unilateral mistake, the rules might be different.\n\nI recall that for unilateral mistake, if the mistake is material and the other party was aware or should have been aware of the mistake, there might be grounds for reformation or other remedies.\n\nIn this case, the cousin received an offer to buy the collection for $75,000 and accepted it. He might have known that the collector intended to sell for $78,000, but perhaps he didn't, especially if the collector never communicated that intention directly.\n\nWait, the problem says that the collector had dictated the letter to his secretary, specifying $78,000, but the secretary mistakenly typed $75,000. So, the cousin only saw $75,000 in the letter and accepted that offer.\n\nIf the cousin was unaware of the collector's original intention to sell for $78,000, then he accepted the offer as it was presented, which is $75,000.\n\nIn such a scenario, generally, the contract would be formed based on the terms accepted, which is $75,000. So, option A seems plausible, but it doesn't account for the collector's original intention.\n\nHowever, if the collector can prove that there was a mistake in the integration of the contract (i.e., the written agreement doesn't reflect the actual agreement due to a clerical error), then a court might reform the contract to reflect the true intention of the parties.\n\nThis is where option C comes in. It suggests that the price term is $75,000, but the court will reform it to $78,000 to correct a mistake in integration.\n\nReformation is a equitable remedy that allows a court to change the terms of a written agreement to reflect the true intention of the parties when there has been a mutual mistake or a unilateral mistake coupled with the other party's knowledge of the mistake.\n\nIn this case, if the collector can show that the $75,000 was a clerical error and that he intended to offer $78,000, and if the cousin was not aware of the mistake, then it's possible that the court could reform the contract to $78,000.\n\nBut, if the cousin was aware of the collector's intention to sell for $78,000 and still accepted the $75,000 offer, knowing it was a mistake, then the cousin might be taking advantage of the collector's error, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify whether the cousin was aware of the collector's original intention or not. It just says that the collector dictated the letter specifying $78,000, but the secretary mistakenly typed $75,000.\n\nIf the cousin had no knowledge of the mistake and accepted the offer in good faith, then the contract should be enforceable at $75,000, and the collector might be stuck with that price unless he can seek some other remedy.\n\nOption D mentions mutual mistake, but as I thought earlier, this seems to be a unilateral mistake, not mutual.\n\nMutual mistake would require that both parties were mistaken about a material fact that forms the basis of the contract. For example, if both parties believed the stamp collection contained certain rare stamps that it doesn't have, that would be a mutual mistake.\n\nBut in this case, the mistake is only on one side\u2014the collector's side\u2014and the cousin accepted the offer as presented.\n\nTherefore, mutual mistake doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems the most straightforward: the price term is $75,000 and it is enforceable.\n\nHowever, option C introduces the possibility of reformation due to a mistake in integration.\n\nReformation could be a possibility if the collector can prove that the $75,000 was a clerical error and that the true intention was to offer $78,000.\n\nBut for reformation to apply, the mistake must be material, and it must be shown that the written document fails to express the true agreement due to a clerical error.\n\nMoreover, the party seeking reformation must generally act promptly and show that the other party was not relying on the mistaken term.\n\nIn this scenario, the collector might argue that the $75,000 was a clerical error and seek to have the contract reformed to $78,000.\n\nHowever, the cousin has already accepted the $75,000 offer, so he might have relied on that price.\n\nAdditionally, if the cousin was unaware of the mistake, he might resist any attempt to increase the price after the fact.\n\nTherefore, it's unclear whether the court would grant reformation in this case.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is the safest answer: the price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nBut let me consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the collector can prove that the $75,000 was indeed a mistake and that he never intended to sell for that price. If the cousin knew or should have known that the price was incorrectly stated, then perhaps the court would reform the contract.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the cousin's knowledge, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the collector can argue that there was a mutual understanding that the price was $78,000, and the $75,000 was just a clerical error.\n\nBut again, the cousin accepted the $75,000 offer, so it's likely that he believed that was the correct price.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the perspective of offer and acceptance.\n\nThe collector made an offer to sell the collection for $75,000 (as per the letter), and the cousin accepted that offer. Therefore, a binding contract was formed at $75,000.\n\nAny mistake regarding the intended price is irrelevant because the cousin accepted the offer as it was presented.\n\nThus, option A seems correct: the price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the offer was for $75,000, not $78,000.\n\nOption C suggests that the court will reform the price to $78,000, but based on my understanding, that might not necessarily be the case.\n\nOption D mentions mutual mistake, which doesn't apply here since it's a unilateral mistake.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
