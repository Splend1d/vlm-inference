                    "text": "So I have this question here about immiscible liquids. The question is asking which pair of liquids is expected to be immiscible. The options are:\n\nA. H2O and CH3OH\n\nB. C6H6 and C5H12\n\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH\n\nD. CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"immiscible\" means. Immiscible liquids are those that don't mix with each other to form a single phase; they stay separate when combined, like oil and water.\n\nSo, to determine which pair is immiscible, I need to look at the properties of each liquid and see if they are compatible enough to mix.\n\nI know that similar substances mix well together. Like, polar substances mix with polar substances, and nonpolar substances mix with nonpolar substances. When there's a big difference in polarity, they might not mix well.\n\nLet me recall the general rule: \"Like dissolves like.\"\n\nSo, if I can identify the polarity of each substance, I can probably figure out which pair won't mix.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: H2O and CH3OH\n\nH2O is water, which is a polar molecule because of its bent shape and electronegative oxygen atom.\n\nCH3OH is methanol, which is an alcohol. Alcohols have a hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar, and a methyl group (-CH3), which is slightly polar but mostly nonpolar.\n\nMethanol is quite polar due to the -OH group, so it should mix well with water, which is also polar.\n\nSo, I think H2O and CH3OH are miscible.\n\nOption B: C6H6 and C5H12\n\nC6H6 is benzene, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon. It's nonpolar because the bonds are distributed symmetrically.\n\nC5H12 is pentane, another alkane hydrocarbon, which is also nonpolar.\n\nSince both are nonpolar, they should mix well with each other.\n\nSo, I don't think this pair is immiscible.\n\nOption C: C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH\n\nC10H22 is decane, a straight-chain alkane, which is nonpolar.\n\nCH2CH2CH2OH is 1-propanol, which is an alcohol with a polar -OH group.\n\nSo, one is nonpolar, and the other is polar. This seems like a candidate for being immiscible.\n\nBut wait, sometimes alcohols with longer carbon chains can have some solubility in nonpolar solvents because the hydrocarbon part interacts with the nonpolar solvent, even though the -OH group is polar.\n\nBut in general, alcohols with longer chains are less soluble in water but may have some solubility in nonpolar solvents.\n\nStill, the polarity difference might cause them to be partially miscible or immiscible.\n\nOption D: CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH\n\nCH3CH2NH2 is ethylamine, which is an amine. Amines have a nitrogen atom with a lone pair, making them slightly polar.\n\nCH3CH2CH2OH is 1-propanol, which is an alcohol, also polar.\n\nSo, both are polar, so they should mix well.\n\nNow, between options A, B, C, and D, option C seems to have the greatest difference in polarity: C10H22 is nonpolar, and CH2CH2CH2OH is polar.\n\nTherefore, they are likely to be immiscible.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about option A again: H2O and CH3OH. Both are polar, so they should mix.\n\nOption B: C6H6 and C5H12. Both are nonpolar, so they should mix.\n\nOption C: C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH. One is nonpolar, the other is polar, so they might not mix.\n\nOption D: CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH. Both are polar, so they should mix.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's any chance that they could be miscible due to some exceptions or specific interactions.\n\nLet me think about the structure of 1-propanol: CH3-CH2-CH2-OH.\n\nThe -OH group is polar, but the rest of the molecule is nonpolar.\n\nDecane (C10H22) is entirely nonpolar.\n\nSo, the polar -OH group of propanol might not interact well with the nonpolar decane, leading to immiscibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the long hydrocarbon chain of decane allows some interaction with the hydrocarbon part of propanol, but I think the polarity difference is significant enough to cause immiscibility.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
