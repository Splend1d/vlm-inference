We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe sentiments expressed in the excerpt above about political parties are most similar to those expressed by\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Populist Party Platform from 1892, and it's asking which of these other political figures or parties had similar sentiments. The options are George McGovern in 1972, Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, Andrew Jackson in 1829, and H. Ross Perot in 1996. Hmm, I need to think about what the Populists were all about and see which of these guys aligns with that.\n\nFirst off, the Populists, also known as the People's Party, were a big deal in the late 19th century, especially among farmers who were struggling with a bunch of economic issues like low crop prices and high debt. They were pretty critical of the two main parties at the time, the Democrats and the Republicans, saying that both were controlled by big business and weren't looking out for the little guy.\n\nIn the excerpt, they talk about \"grievous wrongs\" being inflicted on the people and accuse the two major parties of permitting these conditions without trying to fix them. They also mention things like tariffs, monopolies, and the money system, specifically the demonetization of silver, which was a big issue for them because they wanted to inflate the currency to help farmers pay off their debts.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. George McGovern in 1972: He was a Democrat who ran on a platform of ending the Vietnam War and expanding social programs. While he was critical of the status quo in some ways, I don't recall his campaign being specifically about taking on big business or monetary policy in the same way the Populists were.\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt in 1912: He ran on the Progressive Party ticket after breaking away from the Republicans. He was known for his trust-busting and environmental conservation efforts. His campaign in 1912 was pretty reform-minded and took on the establishment, which sounds a bit like the Populists.\n\nC. Andrew Jackson in 1829: Jackson was a Democrat who ran on a populist platform, appealing to the common man against the elite. He was famous for his opposition to the Second Bank of the United States, which was kind of like taking on big banking interests. That sounds similar to the Populists' criticisms of banks and financial interests.\n\nD. H. Ross Perot in 1996: He ran as a third-party candidate, focusing a lot on balancing the budget and reducing the national debt. He also criticized the influence of special interests in politics. That seems somewhat aligned with the Populists' critique of party politics being dominated by wealthy interests.\n\nHmm, so all of these options have some elements of populism or criticism of the established parties, but I need to see which one is most similar to the Populist Party Platform in 1892.\n\nLet me think about the key points of the Populist Platform:\n\n- Criticism of the two major parties for being controlled by special interests.\n\n- Emphasis on the suffering of the common people due to economic policies.\n\n- Specific policy grievances like tariffs, trusts, and monetary policy (demonetization of silver).\n\n- A call to return government to the hands of the people.\n\nLooking at this, both Theodore Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson had significant critiques of big business and banking interests. However, Jackson was actually a president in the 1830s, and while he was known for his populist appeal, the Populist Party came about much later, in the 1890s.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, on the other hand, was active in the early 20th century, which is closer in time to the Populists. His Progressive Party in 1912 was very much about reform and taking on trusts and corrupt political influences, which mirrors the Populists' stance.\n\nGeorge McGovern's campaign in 1972 was more focused on social issues and ending the war, whereas the Populists were more focused on economic grievances.\n\nH. Ross Perot in 1996 was critical of special interests and focused on fiscal responsibility, which does align with some Populist themes, but his platform wasn't as strongly centered on the economic struggles of farmers and laborers as the Populists were.\n\nSo, between Roosevelt and Jackson, Roosevelt seems more directly aligned with the Populists' emphasis on economic reforms and taking on big business. Jackson was more about expanding democratic participation and had his own set of policies, like opposition to the Bank of the United States, but the Populist Party was more focused on a range of economic issues beyond just banking.\n\nMoreover, the Populist Party was known for its advocacy of progressive reforms such as the graduated income tax, secret ballots, and direct election of senators, which were also features of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party platform.\n\nAndrew Jackson, while populist in his approach, was a product of a different era and his policies, while populist in nature, were not as comprehensive as those of the Populist Party.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
