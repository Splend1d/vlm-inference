                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about service of process in a federal court case. An investor from State A is suing his stockbroker from State B in federal court in State A. The summons and complaint were served at the stockbroker's office in State B, and the process server handed the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant. Now, the stockbroker is claiming that the service of process was improper. I need to figure out whether the court is likely to dismiss the case based on this defense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure say about serving process. Rule 4 of the FRCP deals with service of process. It outlines different ways to serve a defendant, including serving an individual who is not a minor or incompetent. For an individual, service can be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the person to be served, or by leaving copies at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, or usual place of business with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides or is present there.\n\nIn this case, the process server delivered the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant at the stockbroker's office in State B. So, the service was made at the stockbroker's place of business, which is allowed under Rule 4, by leaving the papers with someone of suitable age and discretion who is present there.\n\nBut the stockbroker is asserting that this service is improper. Maybe there's something specific about serving across state lines or serving through an assistant that could be an issue. The question mentions that both states have identical requirements to the FRCP, so that simplifies things.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\n\nThis seems to align with Rule 4. The administrative assistant is likely considered a person of suitable age and discretion, and the office is the stockbroker's place of business. So, this could be a valid service.\n\nB. No, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused by this option. If the stockbroker is asserting the defense of improper service in her answer, that means she's raising it as a reason why the court shouldn't proceed. Waiver typically means giving up a right or a defense. So, by asserting it in the answer, she's actually preserving the defense, not waiving it.\n\nC. Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\n\nThis contradicts what Rule 4 says. As I understood, Rule 4 does allow serving an individual by leaving the papers with someone at their place of business who is of suitable age and discretion.\n\nD. Yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n\nThis seems related to the idea that one state's courts can't enforce their processes in another state. However, in federal court, the service rules are governed by the FRCP, which allow service anywhere, as long as it's done properly under the rules.\n\nGiven all this, I think option A is correct. The service was proper because it was made on a person of suitable age at the stockbroker's place of employment, which is allowed under Rule 4.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that serving the administrative assistant isn't sufficient? Maybe if the administrative assistant isn't authorized to accept service on behalf of the stockbroker. But in general, leaving papers with a responsible person at the defendant's business address is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the fact that the service was made in State B shouldn't be a problem in federal court proceedings, as the FRCP allow for service anywhere, as long as it's done in accordance with the rules.\n\nOption B suggests that by raising the defense in the answer, the stockbroker has waived it. That doesn't make sense because asserting a defense in an answer is how you preserve it, not waive it. Waiver typically involves not raising the defense when you have the opportunity to do so.\n\nOption C is directly contrary to Rule 4, which does permit serving an individual by leaving papers with someone at their place of business.\n\nOption D seems to be suggesting that State A's process isn't effective in State B, but in federal court, the service rules are federal and should apply regardless of the state where service is made.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, I believe the correct answer is A: No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
