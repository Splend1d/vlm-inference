                    "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about stacks of pennies and their heights. It says that a stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter. Nick has a stack that's 4 centimeters tall, and I need to find out how many pennies are in Nick's stack. They give me four options for equations to use.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of pennies and their height. If 7 pennies make 1 centimeter, then each penny must have a certain height, right? Maybe I can find out how tall one penny is and then use that to figure out how many pennies make 4 centimeters.\n\nLet me calculate the height of one penny. If 7 pennies are 1 centimeter, then one penny's height is 1 divided by 7 centimeters. So, 1/7 cm per penny.\n\nNow, if Nick's stack is 4 centimeters tall, I can find out how many pennies are in it by dividing the total height by the height of one penny.\n\nSo, number of pennies n = total height / height per penny.\n\nThat's n = 4 / (1/7).\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1/7. I remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, n = 4 * 7.\n\nThat would be n = 28.\n\nSo, Nick has 28 pennies in his stack.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. n = 7 + 4\n\nThat's 11, which is not 28.\n\nB. n = 7 \u2013 4\n\nThat's 3, also not 28.\n\nC. n = 7 \u00d7 4\n\nThat's 28, which matches my calculation.\n\nD. n = 7 \u00f7 4\n\nThat's 1.75, which is not 28.\n\nSo, according to this, the correct equation is n = 7 \u00d7 4.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up a proportion. If 7 pennies correspond to 1 cm, then n pennies correspond to 4 cm.\n\nSo, 7/1 = n/4.\n\nTo solve for n, I can cross-multiply: 7 * 4 = n * 1.\n\nSo, 28 = n.\n\nAgain, that gives me n = 28, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of multiplication, since 7 pennies make 1 cm, then for 4 cm, it's 4 times as much, so 7 times 4.\n\nYeah, that makes sense too.\n\nI don't think it's addition or subtraction, because addition would imply that the height adds on pennies linearly, which isn't the case here. Division seems off as well, because dividing the number of pennies by the height wouldn't give a meaningful result in this context.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct equation is n = 7 \u00d7 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{n = 7 \\times 4} \\]"
