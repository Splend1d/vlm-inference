                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this legal case. There's a homeowner who lives downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She's suing both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used there. Her claim is that contaminants, mostly from this solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have been migrating to her property, contaminating her soil, groundwater, and well. She's alleging negligence on the part of the facility owner and also on the part of the solvent supplier's employees, who supposedly spilled some of the solvent while filling a tank on the roof of the facility.\n\nNow, the solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment. They're arguing that if there is any contamination, both the facility owner and the solvent supplier contributed to it in indeterminate amounts. So, the homeowner can't show how much damage each party caused. There's also no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted together in causing the contamination.\n\nThe question is whether the court should grant this summary judgment motion. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\n\nC. Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier.\n\nD. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, what's a summary judgment? It's when the court decides the case without a trial because there are no genuine issues of material fact, and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, the solvent supplier is arguing that even if the homeowner's claims are true, they shouldn't be held responsible because it's impossible to determine how much damage each party caused.\n\nNow, the homeowner is alleging that both the facility owner and the solvent supplier contributed to the contamination. The solvent supplier is saying that since their contributions are indeterminate, the homeowner can't hold them responsible for a specific amount of damage.\n\nOption A says no, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury. Okay, so concurrent tortfeasors are multiple parties whose actions combine to cause harm. Joint and several liability means that each tortfeasor can be held responsible for the entire damage, even if multiple parties caused it. So, if the harm is indivisible, meaning it can't be divided into separate parts caused by each tortfeasor, then the homeowner can hold either party responsible for all the damage.\n\nBut wait, the solvent supplier is arguing that because their contributions are indeterminate, the homeowner can't show how much damage each caused. Doesn't that sound similar to the concept of several liability, where each tortfeasor is only responsible for their proportionate share of the damage? But in some jurisdictions, especially in environmental contamination cases, where it's hard to apportion damage, courts might apply joint and several liability to make sure the injured party is fully compensated.\n\nOption B says no, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner. Vicarious liability is when one party is held responsible for the actions of another, typically in employer-employee relationships. But in this case, the facility owner and the solvent supplier are separate entities. The solvent supplier's employees may be liable for their own negligence, but I don't see a direct employer-employee relationship between the facility owner and the solvent supplier that would make the supplier vicariously liable for the owner's actions. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. This seems to align with the solvent supplier's argument. If it's impossible to determine how much damage the solvent supplier caused, then perhaps they shouldn't be held responsible for any specific amount. However, as I thought earlier, in cases of indivisible injury, some legal systems allow for joint and several liability.\n\nOption D says yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Acting in concert suggests that they collaborated or conspired to cause the harm. But in this case, the homeowner isn't alleging that they acted together; rather, that both independently contributed to the contamination.\n\nSo, considering these options, I need to think about whether the solvent supplier can be held liable despite the indeterminacy of their contribution to the contamination.\n\nLet me consider some legal principles. In tort law, when multiple parties cause an injury that is indivisible, meaning it's impossible to determine the extent to which each contributed to the harm, courts in some jurisdictions apply joint and several liability. This means that each tortfeasor can be held responsible for the entire damage, even if multiple parties caused it. The rationale is to ensure that the injured party receives full compensation, even if one of the tortfeasors is judgment-proof or insolvent.\n\nOn the other hand, some legal systems prefer several liability, where each tortfeasor is only responsible for their proportionate share of the damage. However, in cases where it's impossible to apportion the damage, this can leave the injured party without full compensation.\n\nIn environmental contamination cases, where multiple sources may have contributed to pollution, and it's often difficult to determine each one's contribution, some courts have applied joint and several liability to address the practical difficulties in apportionment.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible. If the harm is indivisible, and both the facility owner and the solvent supplier are concurrent tortfeasors, then the homeowner should be able to hold either of them responsible for the entire damage.\n\nBut let's look at option B again. Vicarious liability typically applies in employer-employee relationships, where the employer is liable for the actions of their employees committed within the scope of employment. In this case, the solvent supplier's employees spilled some solvent while filling a tank at the facility. That seems like an action within the scope of their employment, so the solvent supplier would be vicariously liable for their employees' negligence. However, that doesn't directly relate to the facility owner's negligence. Unless there's some special relationship, I don't see how the solvent supplier would be vicariously liable for the facility owner's actions. So, I think option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C argues that since there's no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier, the summary judgment should be granted in their favor. But if joint and several liability applies, the homeowner doesn't need to allocate damages; she can seek full compensation from either party.\n\nOption D seems to be a red herring. The fact that there's no evidence they acted in concert doesn't directly affect the liability for independent negligent acts that caused an indivisible injury.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the correct answer is option A: no, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose that joint and several liability applies, and the homeowner can hold either party responsible for the entire damage. Would that mean that the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment should be denied, because the homeowner can still seek full compensation from them, despite the indeterminacy of their contribution?\n\nYes, that makes sense. The indeterminacy of each party's contribution doesn't absolve them of liability under joint and several liability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other considerations, such as the solvent supplier's argument that they didn't act in concert with the facility owner. But again, if their liability is based on their independent negligent acts, the absence of concert doesn't negate their individual liability.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the court should not grant the summary judgment motion, and the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
