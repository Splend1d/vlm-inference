                    "text": "So I'm working on this NMR problem. It says that the 13C nuclei in a molecule in a 600 MHz spectrometer can be 100% polarized, which means p = 1. The relaxation time T1 is 5.0 seconds, and I need to find out how long it takes for the polarization p to reach a value that's twice the thermal equilibrium polarization at 298 K.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what polarization means in this context. In NMR, polarization refers to the difference in population between the upper and lower energy states of the nuclear spins. At thermal equilibrium, there's a certain polarization level, peq, which depends on the temperature and the applied magnetic field.\n\nThe problem mentions that at t=0, p = 1, meaning the nuclei are fully polarized. Then, over time, this polarization relaxes back to the equilibrium value peq following an exponential decay described by the equation:\n\np(t) = [p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq\n\nI need to find the time t when p(t) = 2 * peq.\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\np(t) = [1 - peq] * exp(-t/5) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nI need to solve this equation for t.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/5) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nSubtract peq from both sides:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/5) = peq\n\nNow, divide both sides by [1 - peq]:\n\nexp(-t/5) = peq / (1 - peq)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for t:\n\nln(exp(-t/5)) = ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-t/5 = ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nMultiply both sides by -5:\n\nt = 5 * ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nNow, I need to find the value of peq at 298 K in a 600 MHz spectrometer.\n\nI recall that in NMR, the equilibrium polarization peq is given by:\n\npeq = [N_up - N_down] / [N_up + N_down] = (e^(\u03b5/kT) - 1) / (e^(\u03b5/kT) + 1)\n\nWhere \u03b5 is the energy difference between the spin states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe energy difference \u03b5 is given by:\n\n\u03b5 = h * \u03bd0\n\nWhere h is Planck's constant, and \u03bd0 is the Larmor frequency (600 MHz in this case).\n\nFirst, let's calculate \u03b5:\n\n\u03b5 = h * \u03bd0 = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) * (600 \u00d7 10^6 Hz) = 3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nNow, calculate peq:\n\npeq = (e^(\u03b5 / (k * T)) - 1) / (e^(\u03b5 / (k * T)) + 1)\n\nWhere k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.3807 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K, and T = 298 K.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b5 / (k * T):\n\n\u03b5 / (k * T) = (3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.3807 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K * 298 K) \u2248 0.00089\n\nThen, e^(0.00089) \u2248 1.0009\n\nSo, peq = (1.0009 - 1) / (1.0009 + 1) = 0.0009 / 2.0009 \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for t:\n\nt = 5 * ln(peq / (1 - peq)) = 5 * ln(4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 / (1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4))\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nThen, peq / (1 - peq) = 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 / 0.9995503 \u2248 4.499 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nNow, ln(4.499 \u00d7 10^-4) \u2248 -6.36\n\nSo, t = 5 * (-6.36) = -31.8 seconds\n\nBut time can't be negative. I must have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\np(t) = [1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq\n\nAnd we set this equal to 2 * peq:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nSubtract peq from both sides:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) = peq\n\nDivide both sides by [1 - peq]:\n\nexp(-t/T1) = peq / (1 - peq)\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-t/T1 = ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nMultiply both sides by -T1:\n\nt = T1 * ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nNow, peq is positive and less than 1, so peq / (1 - peq) is also positive, and ln of a positive number is real.\n\nBut in my calculation, I got a negative time, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I miscalculated peq.\n\nLet me recalculate peq:\n\nFirst, \u03b5 / (k * T) = (3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.3807 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K * 298 K) \u2248 0.00089\n\nThen, e^(0.00089) \u2248 1.0009\n\nSo, peq = (1.0009 - 1) / (1.0009 + 1) = 0.0009 / 2.0009 \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nNow, 1 - peq = 1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nThen, peq / (1 - peq) = 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 / 0.9995503 \u2248 4.499 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nNow, ln(4.499 \u00d7 10^-4) \u2248 -6.36\n\nSo, t = 5 * (-6.36) = -31.8 seconds\n\nThis still gives a negative time, which is impossible. What am I missing?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the sign in the equation. Let me double-check the equation for p(t).\n\nThe general equation for relaxation is:\n\np(t) = [p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq\n\nSetting p(t) = 2 * peq:\n\n[p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nSubtract peq:\n\n[p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) = peq\n\nDivide by [p(0) - peq]:\n\nexp(-t/T1) = peq / [p(0) - peq]\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-t/T1 = ln(peq / [p(0) - peq])\n\nMultiply by -T1:\n\nt = T1 * ln([p(0) - peq] / peq)\n\nNow, plug in p(0) = 1, peq \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4:\n\nt = 5 * ln([1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4] / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4)\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nSo, t = 5 * ln(0.9995503 / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4)\n\nFirst, divide 0.9995503 by 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 \u2248 222.22\n\nThen, ln(222.22) \u2248 5.40\n\nSo, t = 5 * 5.40 \u2248 27 seconds\n\nThat makes more sense. So, t \u2248 27 seconds.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them are 27 seconds. The options are:\n\nA. [The polarization relaxes exponentially: p(t) = [p(0) - peq]exp(-t/T1) + peq.]\n\nB. 72.0 s\n\nC. 56.6 s\n\nD. 12.7 s\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating peq.\n\nLet me recalculate peq more carefully.\n\npeq = [N_up - N_down] / [N_up + N_down] = (e^(\u03b5 / kT) - 1) / (e^(\u03b5 / kT) + 1)\n\nFirst, calculate \u03b5:\n\n\u03b5 = h * \u03bd0 = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) * (600 \u00d7 10^6 Hz) = 3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J\n\nThen, \u03b5 / (k * T) = (3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.3807 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K * 298 K) \u2248 0.00089\n\nThen, e^(0.00089) \u2248 1.0009\n\nSo, peq = (1.0009 - 1) / (1.0009 + 1) = 0.0009 / 2.0009 \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nNow, plug back into the equation:\n\nt = T1 * ln([p(0) - peq] / peq) = 5 * ln([1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4] / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4)\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nThen, 0.9995503 / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 \u2248 222.22\n\nln(222.22) \u2248 5.40\n\nSo, t = 5 * 5.40 \u2248 27 seconds\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for p(t) = 2 * peq, but peq is so small that 2 * peq is still very close to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the small value of peq and use a Taylor expansion or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that p(t) = 2 * peq is not achievable because it's greater than p(0) = 1, given that peq is positive.\n\nWait, peq is approximately 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4, which is much smaller than 1. So, 2 * peq \u2248 8.994 \u00d7 10^-4 is still much smaller than 1.\n\nBut according to the equation, p(t) starts at 1 and relaxes towards peq, so it should decrease from 1 towards peq.\n\nSo, setting p(t) = 2 * peq means we're looking for when p(t) = 8.994 \u00d7 10^-4.\n\nBut according to the equation, p(t) decreases from 1 to peq.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"how long does it take for p to reach a value equal to twice the thermal equilibrium polarization at 298 K?\"\n\nGiven that p(0) = 1 and peq \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4, then 2 * peq \u2248 8.994 \u00d7 10^-4.\n\nSo, p(t) needs to decrease from 1 to approximately 9 \u00d7 10^-4.\n\nBut according to the equation, p(t) = [1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq.\n\nWe set this equal to 2 * peq:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nSubtract peq:\n\n[1 - peq] * exp(-t/T1) = peq\n\nDivide by [1 - peq]:\n\nexp(-t/T1) = peq / (1 - peq)\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-t/T1 = ln(peq / (1 - peq))\n\nMultiply by -T1:\n\nt = T1 * ln((1 - peq) / peq)\n\nNow, plug in peq \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4:\n\nt = 5 * ln((1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4) / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4)\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nThen, 0.9995503 / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 \u2248 222.22\n\nln(222.22) \u2248 5.40\n\nSo, t = 5 * 5.40 \u2248 27 seconds\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nLet me calculate peq more precisely.\n\nFirst, \u03b5 / (k * T) = (3.9756 \u00d7 10^-25 J) / (1.3807 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K * 298 K) \u2248 0.0008903\n\nThen, e^(0.0008903) \u2248 1.0009\n\nSo, peq = (1.0009 - 1) / (1.0009 + 1) = 0.0009 / 2.0009 \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nThen, 1 - peq = 0.9995503\n\nAnd peq / (1 - peq) = 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 / 0.9995503 \u2248 4.499 \u00d7 10^-4\n\nWait, earlier I thought peq / (1 - peq), but according to the equation, it should be (1 - peq) / peq.\n\nWait, in the equation:\n\nexp(-t/T1) = peq / (1 - peq)\n\nBut earlier I had a mistake in the equation. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from:\n\np(t) = [p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq\n\nSet p(t) = 2 * peq:\n\n[p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) + peq = 2 * peq\n\nSubtract peq:\n\n[p(0) - peq] * exp(-t/T1) = peq\n\nDivide by [p(0) - peq]:\n\nexp(-t/T1) = peq / [p(0) - peq]\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-t/T1 = ln(peq / [p(0) - peq])\n\nMultiply by -T1:\n\nt = T1 * ln([p(0) - peq] / peq)\n\nGiven p(0) = 1 and peq \u2248 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4:\n\nt = 5 * ln([1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4] / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4)\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n1 - 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 = 0.9995503\n\nThen, 0.9995503 / 4.497 \u00d7 10^-4 \u2248 222.22\n\nln(222.22) \u2248 5.40\n\nSo, t = 5 * 5.40 \u2248 27 seconds\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for p(t) to reach twice the equilibrium polarization, but in reality, p(t) can't exceed p(0) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that p(t) = 2 * peq is not achievable because it's beyond the equilibrium value.\n\nWait, peq is the equilibrium polarization, and p(t) relaxes towards peq. So, p(t) starts at 1 and decreases towards peq.\n\nBut 2 * peq is greater than peq, so p(t) would have to increase beyond peq, which contradicts the relaxation process.\n\nMaybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps it's asking for p(t) to reach twice the equilibrium polarization in terms of the difference from peq.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the definition of polarization in terms of the population difference.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIn NMR, polarization p is defined as:\n\np = (N_up - N_down) / (N_up + N_down)\n\nAt equilibrium, p_eq = (N_up - N_down) / (N_up + N_down) = (e^(\u03b5 / kT) - 1) / (e^(\u03b5 / kT) + 1)\n\nWhen the system is fully polarized, p(0) = 1, meaning N_up = N"
