A change in technology.\n\nC. A change in the money supply.\n\nD. A change in spending by state governments.\n\nOkay, first things first, I should probably recall what aggregate demand is and what factors can shift it.\n\nAggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given time. It's usually represented as a curve that shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output demanded.\n\nNow, factors that can shift the aggregate demand curve include changes in consumer spending, investment spending, government spending, net exports, and the money supply.\n\nLet me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A change in consumer confidence.\n\nIf consumer confidence increases, people are more likely to spend money, which would increase aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the right. Conversely, if confidence decreases, people might save more and spend less, shifting the curve to the left. So, this definitely can shift aggregate demand.\n\nOption B: A change in technology.\n\nHmm, technology affects production and efficiency, which relates more to aggregate supply rather than aggregate demand. Aggregate supply is the total supply of goods and services in an economy at a given price level.\n\nIf technology improves, aggregate supply increases, shifting the curve to the right, because businesses can produce more at each price level.\n\nWait, but the question is about aggregate demand, not aggregate supply.\n\nSo, if technology changes, does it directly affect aggregate demand?\n\nLet me think. Technology changes can lead to changes in productivity and costs, which might affect supply and therefore prices, but does it directly shift aggregate demand?\n\nProbably not directly. Changes in technology might influence investment spending if businesses invest in new technology, which could indirectly affect aggregate demand, but that's more of a secondary effect.\n\nSo, perhaps a change in technology by itself does not directly shift the aggregate demand curve.\n\nOption C: A change in the money supply.\n\nThe money supply affects interest rates and, consequently, spending and investment in the economy.\n\nIf the money supply increases, interest rates tend to decrease, making borrowing cheaper, which stimulates spending and investment, shifting aggregate demand to the right.\n\nConversely, a decrease in the money supply leads to higher interest rates and reduced spending, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nSo, this is definitely a factor that can shift aggregate demand.\n\nOption D: A change in spending by state governments.\n\nGovernment spending is a direct component of aggregate demand.\n\nAn increase in government spending increases aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the right.\n\nA decrease in government spending reduces aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nTherefore, this is also a factor that can shift aggregate demand.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nA. Change in consumer confidence: affects aggregate demand.\n\nB. Change in technology: primarily affects aggregate supply, not directly aggregate demand.\n\nC. Change in money supply: affects aggregate demand.\n\nD. Change in spending by state governments: affects aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the option that would NOT shift the aggregate demand curve is B. A change in technology.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any way that a change in technology could directly affect aggregate demand?\n\nWell, if technology improves, making products better or more efficient, that might increase demand for those specific products, but that's more of a shift in demand for individual goods, not the overall aggregate demand.\n\nFor example, if a new smartphone is released with better features, demand for that smartphone increases, but that doesn't necessarily shift the entire aggregate demand curve for the whole economy.\n\nUnless, of course, the technological change has a broad impact that affects the entire economy's output and spending.\n\nBut generally, changes in technology are considered to affect aggregate supply more directly by improving productivity and reducing costs, which allows businesses to supply more at each price level.\n\nTherefore, a change in technology would not directly shift the aggregate demand curve.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. A change in technology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
