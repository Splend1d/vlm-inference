                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a logical fallacy. It says that arguing what's true of an entire object is also true of each part of that object is the fallacy of... and then gives me four options: A. false criteria, B. hasty generalization, C. ad crumenam, and D. division. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these describes the situation where someone assumes that what's true for the whole thing must be true for its parts.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a fallacy is. A fallacy is a mistake in reasoning, right? So, in arguments, sometimes people make logical errors, and these are called fallacies. There are many types of fallacies, and each has its own characteristics.\n\nNow, the question is specifically about the fallacy where someone argues that if something is true for the whole, it must be true for each part. That sounds a bit like dividing the properties of the whole down to its parts without proper justification.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. False criteria: I'm not entirely sure what this refers to. Maybe it's about using incorrect standards or measures to judge something. But that doesn't seem directly related to the idea of applying whole properties to parts.\n\nB. Hasty generalization: This sounds like when someone makes a broad conclusion based on a small or unrepresentative sample. For example, meeting a few people from a certain place and then assuming that all people from that place are the same. But again, that's not exactly about applying the properties of the whole to its parts.\n\nC. Ad crumenam: I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe it's a less common fallacy. A quick search in my notes shows that it's not standardly listed among the common fallacies. Perhaps it's a mistranslation or a typo.\n\nD. Division: This sounds promising. I think there's a fallacy called \"fallacy of division\" which involves assuming that parts have the same properties as the whole. Yes, that rings a bell.\n\nLet me double-check. The fallacy of division is when someone assumes that what is true of a whole must also be true of its individual parts. For example, saying that because a car is heavy, each part of the car must be heavy. But in reality, some parts of a car, like the plastic components, might not be heavy at all.\n\nOn the other hand, there's also a fallacy called \"composition,\" which is the opposite: assuming that what is true of parts must be true of the whole. For example, saying that because each brick is light, the entire wall must be light. But the wall, being composed of many bricks, can be quite heavy.\n\nSo, in this question, it's specifically about the fallacy of division, where we incorrectly attribute the properties of the whole to its parts.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. division seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could possibly relate.\n\nA. false criteria: This might relate to setting up the wrong standards for evaluation, but it's not directly about whole and part relationships.\n\nB. hasty generalization: This is more about drawing broad conclusions from limited evidence, not about the properties of wholes and parts.\n\nC. ad crumenam: This term doesn't seem to correspond to any recognized fallacy. Maybe it's a misspelling or a misinterpretation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D. division.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
