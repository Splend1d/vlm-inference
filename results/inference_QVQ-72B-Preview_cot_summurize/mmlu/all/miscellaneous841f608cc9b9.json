                    "text": "Okay, I need to figure out how to express 4:00 pm in military time. The options are A. 1600, B. 4, C. 400, and D. 4:00. I'm a bit confused about this because I usually use the 12-hour clock format, and military time seems different.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what military time is. I know that military time uses a 24-hour clock system, which eliminates the need for designating whether it's AM or PM. So, for example, 1:00 pm would be 1300 in military time, right? Because you add 12 to the hour part if it's after noon.\n\nWait, let me make sure about that. In the 24-hour format, hours range from 00 to 23. From midnight to 11:59 am, the hours are the same as the standard 12-hour clock, but from 12:00 pm to 11:59 pm, you add 12 to the hour and drop the PM indicator.\n\nSo, for 1:00 pm, it would be 13:00 in military time. Similarly, 2:00 pm would be 14:00, and so on.\n\nGiven that, let's apply this to 4:00 pm. So, 4:00 pm in the 12-hour format would be 16:00 in the 24-hour format because you add 12 to 4.\n\nWait, but one of the options is B. 4. That can't be right because that's just the hour without any minutes, and it's not specifying AM or PM. So, that seems incorrect.\n\nOption C is 400. Hmm, that might be a mistake because 400 would actually be 4:00 am in some contexts, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption D is 4:00, which is the original time, but that's the standard 12-hour format, not the military time.\n\nOption A is 1600, which seems to align with my earlier thought that 4:00 pm should be 16:00 in military time.\n\nLet me double-check this. In the 24-hour format, 12:00 pm is 12:00, and then each hour after that adds one to the hour part. So, 1:00 pm is 13:00, 2:00 pm is 14:00, and so on, up to 11:00 pm being 23:00.\n\nTherefore, 4:00 pm should indeed be 16:00 in military time. The minutes remain the same, so it's just 1600.\n\nI think the answer is A. 1600.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe in some contexts, they might omit the colon and just write 1600, which is still correct in military time notation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might write it with a colon as 16:00, but since the options provided don't include that, I should go with what's given.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm confident that A. 1600 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 1600} \\]"
