                    "text": "Okay, so I have this scenario where the sole shareholder of an S corporation is contributing equipment to the company. The equipment has a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, and there's a liability of $12,000 attached to it. I need to figure out if the shareholder has to recognize any gain from this transaction, and if so, how much.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to contribute property to an S corporation. An S corporation is a special type of corporation that elects to pass its income, losses, and credits through to its shareholders, similar to a partnership. So, when a shareholder contributes property to the S corporation, there are generally no immediate tax consequences, but there are rules about recognizing gain or loss on the transfer.\n\nThe general rule is that when a shareholder contributes property to a corporation in exchange for stock, no gain or loss is recognized, provided certain conditions are met. This is covered under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly when liabilities are assumed by the corporation.\n\nIn this case, the shareholder is contributing equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000. So, there's a difference between the fair market value and the basis, which could potentially be recognized as a gain. But more importantly, there's a liability of $12,000 attached to the equipment that's being transferred to the corporation.\n\nI need to consider how the liability affects the transaction. When a corporation takes over a liability from the shareholder, it can be treated as boot or consideration received by the shareholder, which might trigger recognition of gain.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the fair market value of the equipment is $20,000, and the basis is $6,000. So, there's a built-in gain of $14,000 ($20,000 - $6,000). Normally, under Section 351, no gain would be recognized if the shareholder receives only stock in exchange for the property. However, the presence of the liability complicates things.\n\nThe corporation is assuming a liability of $12,000. This liability assumption is generally treated as consideration paid to the shareholder. So, it's like the shareholder is receiving $12,000 in exchange for transferring the equipment.\n\nNow, to calculate the gain recognized, I need to look at the amount realized from the transaction minus the adjusted basis of the property transferred.\n\nThe amount realized would include the fair market value of the property plus any liabilities assumed by the corporation.\n\nSo, amount realized = fair market value of equipment + liability assumed\n\nAmount realized = $20,000 + $12,000 = $32,000\n\nThe adjusted basis of the equipment is $6,000.\n\nTherefore, gain recognized = amount realized - adjusted basis\n\nGain recognized = $32,000 - $6,000 = $26,000\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't match any of the options provided. The options are $0, $6,000, $8,000, or $12,000.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check the rules regarding liability assumptions in property contributions.\n\nAccording to IRS regulations, when a corporation assumes a liability of the shareholder in exchange for stock, the amount of the liability assumed is treated as boot or consideration received by the shareholder, which can lead to recognition of gain.\n\nHowever, the gain recognized is limited to the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the property transferred.\n\nIn this case, amount realized is $32,000, and adjusted basis is $6,000, so $26,000 gain should be recognized. But since that's not an option, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the fair market value of the stock received in exchange for the equipment.\n\nWait, but the shareholder is the sole shareholder, so presumably, they're receiving stock in the corporation in exchange for the equipment.\n\nBut since it's the sole shareholder, maybe there's no additional consideration beyond the equipment's basis and the liability.\n\nLet me consider the transaction from the shareholder's perspective.\n\nShareholder contributes equipment with a basis of $6,000 and a fair market value of $20,000, subject to a liability of $12,000.\n\nThe corporation assumes the liability, which is $12,000.\n\nSo, the shareholder is effectively transferring $12,000 of debt to the corporation.\n\nIn tax terms, the assumption of the liability by the corporation is treated as income to the shareholder, which could trigger gain recognition.\n\nBut again, I'm getting $26,000, which isn't an option.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the shareholder's basis in the stock increases by the amount of the liability assumed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the basis of the stock received.\n\nLet me recall the basis calculation for stock received in a Section 351 transaction.\n\nGenerally, the shareholder's basis in the stock received is equal to the basis of the property contributed, increased by any gain recognized and decreased by any boot received.\n\nIn this case, the shareholder is contributing equipment with a basis of $6,000 and there's a liability of $12,000 assumed by the corporation.\n\nThe amount realized is $20,000 (fair market value) plus $12,000 (liability assumed) = $32,000.\n\nThe basis of the property contributed is $6,000.\n\nSo, gain recognized is $32,000 - $6,000 = $26,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a limitation on how much gain can be recognized.\n\nWait, maybe the gain is limited to the amount of liability assumed.\n\nLet me check the regulations.\n\nAccording to IRS regulations, when a corporation assumes a liability of the shareholder in a Section 351 transaction, the amount of the liability assumed is treated as boot received by the shareholder, and gain is recognized to the extent of the liability assumed, but only to the extent that the amount realized exceeds the adjusted basis of the property transferred.\n\nSo, in this case, the liability assumed is $12,000.\n\nThe amount realized is $20,000 (fair market value) + $12,000 (liability assumed) = $32,000.\n\nThe adjusted basis is $6,000.\n\nSo, gain recognized is $32,000 - $6,000 = $26,000.\n\nBut the options don't include $26,000.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me consider the built-in gain on the equipment.\n\nThe equipment has a basis of $6,000 and a fair market value of $20,000, so there's a potential gain of $14,000.\n\nThe liability assumed is $12,000.\n\nPerhaps the gain recognized is limited to the lesser of the built-in gain or the liability assumed.\n\nIf that's the case, then the gain recognized would be $12,000, since that's less than the built-in gain of $14,000.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gain is limited to the liability assumed, which is $12,000, but only to the extent that it exceeds the basis of the property.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAccording to Section 357 of the Internal Revenue Code, which deals with built-in gains and losses in property contributions, if a corporation assumes a liability that exceeds the adjusted basis of the property transferred, then gain may be recognized.\n\nIn this case, the liability assumed is $12,000, and the adjusted basis is $6,000, so the excess is $6,000.\n\nPerhaps the gain recognized is limited to this excess, which would be $6,000.\n\nThat's option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gain is equal to the liability assumed, which is $12,000, but that's option D.\n\nI need to find out which one is correct.\n\nLet me look up the relevant tax laws.\n\nUpon checking, Section 357(c) provides that if the amount of the liability assumed exceeds the adjusted basis of the property transferred, then gain is recognized to the extent of that excess.\n\nSo, in this case, liability assumed is $12,000, and the adjusted basis is $6,000.\n\nTherefore, gain recognized is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the amount realized was $20,000 (fair market value) plus $12,000 (liability assumed) = $32,000, minus the basis of $6,000, equals $26,000 gain.\n\nBut according to Section 357(c), the gain recognized is the excess of the liability assumed over the adjusted basis, which is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct gain recognized is $6,000.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because according to general Section 351 rules, the amount realized includes the fair market value of the property plus the liability assumed.\n\nBut Section 357(c) seems to specify that gain is recognized only to the extent that the liability exceeds the basis.\n\nGiven that, the gain recognized should be $6,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $6,000.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
