                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of these animals is a rodent? A. Bat, B. Wolverine, C. Beaver, D. Koala.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is a rodent. I'm not entirely sure, but let me think about it.\n\nFirst off, I know that rodents are a group of mammals known for their continuously growing front teeth, called incisors. They're usually herbivores but sometimes eat meat too. Common examples that come to mind are mice, rats, squirrels, and beavers. Wait, beavers are on the list here. So maybe that's the answer?\n\nBut let me consider each option one by one to make sure.\n\nStarting with A. Bat. Bats are mammals, and they can fly, which is pretty cool. But are they rodents? I don't think so. I think bats are in their own order, called Chiroptera, which means \"hand-wing.\" Rodents are in the order Rodentia. So, probably not a rodent.\n\nNext is B. Wolverine. Wolverines are known for being tough and fierce. I believe they're part of the mustelid family, which includes weasels, otters, and ferrets. Again, not rodents. They're carnivores, right? So, unlikely to be a rodent.\n\nThen there's C. Beaver. Beavers are famous for building dams and lodges. They have those big front teeth that they use for chewing wood. That sounds a lot like what I remember about rodents. Plus, I think beavers are classified as rodents. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, D. Koala. Koalas are native to Australia and are known for their fluffy appearance and diet of eucalyptus leaves. They're marsupials, which means they're in a different class from rodents. Rodents are placental mammals, not marsupials. So, koalas are definitely not rodents.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it seems like the beaver is the only animal on this list that's a rodent. Just to double-check, I'll recall some characteristics of rodents:\n\n- Continuously growing incisors that are chisel-like and used for gnawing.\n\n- These teeth are constantly worn down by gnawing and are replaced throughout the animal's life.\n\n- Rodents are mostly herbivores, but some can be omnivores or even carnivores.\n\nBeavers fit this description perfectly. They have large, orange incisors that they use for gnawing on wood, and they're primarily herbivores, eating tree bark, roots, and aquatic plants.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly summarize why the other animals aren't rodents:\n\nA. Bat: Bats are in the order Chiroptera, which is separate from Rodentia.\n\nB. Wolverine: Wolverines are carnivorous mammals in the mustelid family, not rodents.\n\nD. Koala: Koalas are marsupials, which are not rodents; rodents are placental mammals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Beaver.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Beaver}} \\]"
