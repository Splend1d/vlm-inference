                    "text": "So I'm trying to answer this question about how global inequality might pose a threat to global security. The options are a bit tricky, but let's break them down one by one.\n\nOption A says that human security is threatened because a large portion of the world's population isn't benefiting from globalization. But it also mentions that this inequality doesn't lead to political instability or military action. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory. If people are insecure and not sharing the benefits, you'd think that could lead to some kind of instability or conflict, right? Maybe not directly military action, but certainly, it could fuel tensions and unrest.\n\nOption B suggests that global inequality creates discontented groups who, despite their dissatisfaction, lack the ability to rebel or protest. So, they're unhappy but powerless. That also seems like it could be a problem in the long run. If people feel they have no voice or way to improve their situation, that could lead to various social issues, possibly including support for extremist groups or other forms of instability.\n\nOption C is pretty stark. It says that revolutionary uprisings are likely because people left behind by neoliberal globalization might radicalize and rebel against those who have benefited from these economic policies. This seems like a direct link between inequality and political instability, possibly leading to conflict.\n\nOption D is straightforward: global inequality isn't a significant threat to global security. This contradicts a lot of what I've heard about the impacts of inequality on stability, so I'm skeptical about this choice.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these options best answers the question. The question is asking how global inequality might present a threat to global security. So, it's likely that the correct answer explains a mechanism or a way in which inequality can lead to security threats.\n\nOption A seems to acknowledge that human security is threatened by inequality, but downplays the connection to political instability or military action. But in reality, threats to human security can indeed lead to political instability over time. Maybe this option is trying to say that while there is a threat, it's not necessarily immediate or direct.\n\nOption B talks about disenfranchised populations who are discontent but lack agency to rebel. This could be a scenario where inequality leads to simmering resentment but no overt action. However, history shows that even seemingly powerless groups can organize and cause significant disruptions, especially with the help of modern communication tools.\n\nOption C directly links inequality to revolutionary uprisings and radicalization. This seems plausible, as we've seen in various parts of the world where economic disparities have fueled protests and even armed conflicts. The Arab Spring is one example where economic grievances contributed to widespread unrest.\n\nOption D dismisses the idea that inequality poses a significant threat to global security, which contradicts a lot of expert analysis. Numerous studies and reports indicate that inequality can be a driver of conflict and instability.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to provide the most direct and comprehensive answer to the question. It explains that global inequality can lead to radicalization and rebellion, which are clear threats to global security.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any truth in the other options.\n\nOption A acknowledges that human security is threatened by inequality, which is true. However, it downplays the connection to political instability or military action. While it's possible that inequality doesn't immediately translate into such actions, the potential for instability is still there and should be taken seriously.\n\nOption B suggests that disenfranchised populations lack the agency to rebel. While this might be true in some cases, it's overly simplistic. Even if these groups can't rebel openly, they might support extremist ideologies or engage in other forms of resistance that can undermine stability.\n\nOption D is clearly incorrect, as numerous examples throughout history and in current events demonstrate that inequality can be a significant factor in causing and escalating conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C: revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nThis option directly connects inequality to specific security threats, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
