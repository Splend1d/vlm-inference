                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what usually happens to popular third-party movements in politics. The options are:\n\nA. They replace one of the two big parties and become a major party themselves.\n\nB. People stop supporting them because their ideas are seen as too extreme.\n\nC. Their supporters get frustrated and just give up on politics.\n\nD. They fall apart when one or both of the big parties start agreeing with their goals.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. I know that in many countries, there are primarily two big political parties, and sometimes smaller parties or third parties come up. These third parties can gain popularity if they offer new ideas or address issues that the major parties aren't focusing on.\n\nOption A says that sometimes these third parties can replace one of the major parties. I recall that in some historical instances, this has happened. For example, in the United States, the Republican Party replaced the Whig Party in the mid-19th century. So, it is possible, but is it the most common fate?\n\nOption B suggests that the public abandons third parties because their politics are too radical. While it's true that some third parties propose more extreme or unconventional policies, not all third parties are radical. Some are more centrist and offer moderate alternatives. So, I think this might not cover all cases.\n\nOption C mentions that supporters become frustrated and withdraw from the political process. This could happen if people feel that their votes for third parties don't make a difference, especially in systems where the electoral rules favor the bigger parties. However, this doesn't necessarily describe the fate of the third-party movements themselves, but rather what happens to their supporters.\n\nOption D says that third parties disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt their goals. This makes sense because if the major parties start supporting the same policies or ideas that the third party is advocating for, then the third party might lose its unique selling point. People might think, \"Oh, well, the major parties are now supporting this idea, so I don't need to vote for the third party anymore.\"\n\nConsidering these options, I think D is the most accurate description of what usually happens to most popular third-party movements. When their ideas are adopted by the major parties, they often lose their momentum and may even dissolve, as their primary objectives have been achieved or are being addressed by the larger political entities.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is this true in most cases? I remember that in the United States, third parties like the Progressive Party in the early 20th century influenced the major parties to adopt some of their reforms, such as direct primary elections and women's suffrage. After these reforms were implemented, the Progressive Party declined in influence.\n\nSimilarly, in more recent times, the Green Party has pushed environmental issues into the mainstream, and both major parties have had to address these concerns to some extent. This could lead to a situation where the Green Party loses some of its support as voters see the major parties taking up their causes.\n\nOn the other hand, there are examples where third parties have persisted over time without being fully absorbed by the major parties. For instance, in some states in India, regional parties have maintained their influence and even formed coalitions with the national parties.\n\nHowever, in the context of the question, which is likely referring to the United States, where the two-party system is deeply entrenched, option D seems the most fitting answer.\n\nSo, my final choice would be D: They disintegrate when one or both of the major parties adopt the third party's goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
