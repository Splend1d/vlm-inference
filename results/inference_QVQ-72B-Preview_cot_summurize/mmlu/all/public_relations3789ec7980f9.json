The options are implementation, impact, attitude change, and preparation. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what summative evaluation is. From what I recall, summative evaluation is a type of assessment that happens at the end of a program or campaign. It's about evaluating the overall effectiveness or impact of the effort. So, it's focused on the final results.\n\nNow, looking at the phases of public relations audience research:\n\nA. Implementation: This seems like the phase where the actual activities of the campaign are carried out. Summative evaluation wouldn't be part of this; it's more about looking back after the fact.\n\nB. Impact: This sounds promising. Summative evaluation is all about assessing the impact of the campaign, right? So, maybe this is the correct answer.\n\nC. Attitude change: Public relations often aims to change attitudes or perceptions. Summative evaluation might measure whether those changes occurred, but is that a separate phase?\n\nD. Preparation: This is likely the planning phase before the campaign starts. Again, summative evaluation comes after the campaign is done, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me think again. Summative evaluation is performed after the campaign has been implemented to assess its overall effectiveness. So, it should be related to the impact phase because that's when you're measuring the results and determining if the campaign achieved its objectives.\n\nOption B seems to align with that. But let's consider if attitude change is a separate phase. In public relations, attitude change is often a key objective, but it's part of the impact of the campaign, isn't it?\n\nWait, maybe the impact phase includes measuring various outcomes, including attitude change, behavior change, or other impacts. Summative evaluation would be a part of that broader impact assessment.\n\nI think the best answer is B. Impact because summative evaluation is a component of assessing the campaign's impact on the audience.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider an example. Suppose a public relations campaign is launched to improve a company's reputation. The phases would be:\n\n- Preparation: Planning the campaign, setting objectives.\n\n- Implementation: Carrying out the activities planned.\n\n- Impact: Measuring the changes in public perception, attitudes, and reputation metrics.\n\nSummative evaluation would fit into the impact phase, evaluating the overall effectiveness of the campaign in achieving the desired reputation improvements.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be B. Impact.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
