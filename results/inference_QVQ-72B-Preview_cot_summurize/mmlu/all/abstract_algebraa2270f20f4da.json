                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two statements about group theory, specifically about external direct products and cyclic groups. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Statement 1 says: \"The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\" I need to figure out if that's always true. I know that a cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. For example, the integers under addition, denoted by Z, are cyclic because every element can be written as n times 1, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, the external direct product of two groups G and H is the group consisting of all ordered pairs (g, h) where g is in G and h is in H, with component-wise operation. So, if G and H are cyclic, does that mean that their direct product is also cyclic?\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose G is cyclic with generator a, so every element in G can be written as a^k for some integer k. Similarly, suppose H is cyclic with generator b, so every element in H can be written as b^m for some integer m.\n\nThen, in the direct product G \u00d7 H, an element would be of the form (a^k, b^m). Is there a single element (g, h) in G \u00d7 H that can generate the entire group through its powers?\n\nLet's try to find such an element. Consider (a, b). Then (a, b)^n = (a^n, b^n). For this to generate the entire group, every element (a^k, b^m) should be equal to (a^n, b^n) for some n. That is, for every k and m, there exists an n such that a^n = a^k and b^n = b^m.\n\nThis would require that n \u2261 k mod the order of a, and n \u2261 m mod the order of b. So, for different k and m, we need different n's, but more importantly, this seems to depend on the orders of a and b.\n\nIf the orders of a and b are coprime, meaning gcd(order of a, order of b) = 1, then perhaps it's possible. But what if they have a common factor?\n\nWait, maybe I should look up a general result. I recall that if G and H are cyclic groups with coprime orders, then G \u00d7 H is cyclic. But what if the orders are not coprime?\n\nLet me consider an example. Take G = Z_2, the cyclic group of order 2, and H = Z_2. Both are cyclic. Is Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 cyclic?\n\nLet's see. Z_2 has elements {0, 1}, and Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 has elements {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)}. Let's check if there's a single element that generates the whole group.\n\nTake (1,0). Its powers are (1,0), (1,0), ... which don't generate (0,1) or (1,1). Similarly, (0,1) doesn't generate (1,0) or (1,1). Now, (1,1): its powers are (1,1), (0,0), so it doesn't generate (1,0) or (0,1). So, no single element generates the whole group. Therefore, Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 is not cyclic.\n\nBut wait, Z_2 and Z_2 both have order 2, and gcd(2,2) = 2, which is not 1. So, maybe the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic only if their orders are coprime.\n\nLet me test this with another example. Take G = Z_3 and H = Z_4. Both are cyclic, and gcd(3,4) = 1. Then, Z_3 \u00d7 Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_{12}, which is cyclic. That seems to support my hypothesis.\n\nAnother example: take G = Z_5 and H = Z_7. Both cyclic, and gcd(5,7) = 1. Their direct product should be cyclic, specifically isomorphic to Z_{35}.\n\nNow, what if one of them is not cyclic? Wait, the statement says \"the external direct product of cyclic groups,\" so both G and H are cyclic. But in my earlier example with Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2, both are cyclic, but their product isn't cyclic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false because there are cases where the direct product of two cyclic groups is not cyclic, as shown by the Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2 example.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what D_n is. D_n is the dihedral group of order 2n, which represents the symmetries of a regular n-gon. So, D_3 is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, which has order 6, and D_4 is the symmetry group of a square, with order 8. Therefore, the direct product D_3 \u00d7 D_4 should have order 6 \u00d7 8 = 48.\n\nOn the other hand, D_12 is the dihedral group of order 24, since 2 \u00d7 12 = 24. So, D_3 \u00d7 D_4 has order 48, while D_12 has order 24. Since they have different orders, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false in this case. But wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFor Statement 1, I provided an example where the direct product of two cyclic groups is not cyclic, so that seems solid.\n\nFor Statement 2, the orders don't match: D_3 \u00d7 D_4 has order 48, while D_12 has order 24. Unless there's some other group of order 48 that's isomorphic to D_12, which I don't think is the case, this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
