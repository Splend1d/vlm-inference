After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the \"big top\" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb. If the parents assert a claim against the adjuster to recover damages for infliction of emotional distress, they will\n\nA. recover, because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency.\nB. recover, because the adjuster was trying to take unfair advantage of the parents.\nC. not recover, because the parents did not suffer emotional distress that was severe.\nD. not recover, because the parents eventually received a $250,000 settlement from the adjuster's insurance company.\n"

                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this scenario here about a circus and a boy who got injured by one of their aerial bombs. The parents are trying to settle with the insurance company, but the adjuster is giving them a hard time. Now, they want to claim for emotional distress against the adjuster. I need to figure out if they can recover damages for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what emotional distress is. It's when someone experiences mental or emotional suffering due to someone else's actions. To recover damages for emotional distress, usually, the distress has to be severe, meaning it's more than just being upset or annoyed. It has to be really bad, like causing significant anxiety, depression, or other psychological issues.\n\nSo, in this case, the parents are saying the adjuster was harassing them and causing them a lot of stress by constantly contacting them, giving them false information, and pressuring them to accept a low settlement. They were outraged by his actions and eventually had to get a lawyer involved.\n\nNow, option A says they'll recover because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency. That sounds like the behavior was particularly outrageous or unethical. Maybe that's a key point.\n\nOption B says they'll recover because the adjuster was trying to take unfair advantage of the parents. That also seems relevant, especially since he gave them false information about the law and warned them they'd get nothing if they didn't accept his offer.\n\nOption C says they won't recover because the parents didn't suffer emotional distress that was severe. But the scenario mentions that they were outraged by the adjuster's actions, which suggests they were significantly upset or distressed. Maybe that's enough to qualify as severe emotional distress.\n\nOption D says they won't recover because they eventually got a $250,000 settlement from the insurance company. But that settlement was for the boy's injury, not for the emotional distress caused by the adjuster's behavior. So, maybe that's separate.\n\nI think the key here is whether the adjuster's actions were so outrageous that they caused severe emotional distress to the parents. From what's described, he was persistent in his harassment, gave false information, and tried to intimidate them into accepting a low settlement. That sounds pretty bad.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, if someone's conduct is extreme and outrageous, intended to cause severe emotional distress, and does cause such distress, then the person can sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nSo, in this case, the adjuster's actions seem to fit that description. He was knowingly misleading the parents and pressuring them in a way that caused them significant distress.\n\nBut, I should consider if there are any exceptions or if the adjuster had some legitimate right or duty to try to settle the claim. After all, it's his job to negotiate settlements for the insurance company.\n\nHowever, there are ethical standards for insurance adjusters, and misleading clients or engaging in harassment isn't acceptable. In fact, insurance companies are supposed to deal fairly with claimants.\n\nMaybe the adjuster crossed the line by providing blatantly false information and warning them they'd get nothing, which could be seen as a threat or coercion.\n\nAlso, the fact that the parents were outraged suggests they were deeply upset by his behavior.\n\nSo, I think they do have a case for recovering damages for emotional distress.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the distress was severe enough. The scenario says they were \"outraged,\" but is that sufficient to meet the severity requirement?\n\nI think so, because being outraged implies a strong emotional reaction, possibly including anger, frustration, and perhaps anxiety about their son's injury and the financial implications.\n\nMoreover, the adjuster's conduct went on for over a month, which is a significant period, and his actions could have caused prolonged distress.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he continued to harass them despite their obvious distress suggests that his behavior was particularly egregious.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the parents can recover damages for emotional distress because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency and caused severe emotional distress.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: recover, because the adjuster's actions exceeded the bounds of common decency.\n\nOption B is similar, but option A seems more directly related to the severity and unacceptability of the adjuster's behavior.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the parents did experience severe emotional distress, as indicated by their outrage and the prolonged harassment.\n\nOption D is irrelevant because the $250,000 settlement was for the boy's injury, not for the parents' emotional distress caused by the adjuster's actions.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
