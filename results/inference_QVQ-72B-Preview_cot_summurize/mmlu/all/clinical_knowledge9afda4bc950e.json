                    "text": "So I've got this question about rectal bleeding, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: \"A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.\" I remember that an anal fissure is a tear in the anal mucosa, usually caused by hard stools or spicy foods, and it's typically very painful, especially during bowel movements. So, if a digital rectal examination is painful, it could indeed suggest the presence of an anal fissure. That seems plausible.\n\nOption B says, \"Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion.\" Hmm, a caecal lesion would be somewhere in the large intestine, and generally, brighter red blood suggests that the bleeding is coming from lower down in the gastrointestinal tract, like the rectum or anus, because it hasn't had time to mix with stool. So, if blood is bright red on the finger, it's more likely to be from a lower source, not the caecum, which is higher up. Maybe this one is not true.\n\nOption C: \"Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding.\" Proctoscopy is a procedure to examine the rectum and lower part of the colon, right? It seems like it would be quite useful in assessing rectal bleeding, as it can help identify sources of bleeding like hemorrhoids, polyps, or early signs of cancer. So, saying it's of no value seems incorrect.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding.\" While rectal cancer can cause rectal bleeding, I think that hemorrhoids are actually a much more common cause. Many people have hemorrhoids, and they can bleed, especially if they're irritated or strained. Rectal cancer, while serious, is less common than hemorrhoids as a cause of rectal bleeding.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems to be true, option B is likely false, option C is probably false, and option D is likely false. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Anal fissures are indeed painful, and a digital examination can be painful if there's a fissure present. So, yes, that makes sense. Proctoscopy is definitely valuable for assessing rectal bleeding, so option C is incorrect. And while rectal cancer is a important consideration, it's not the most common cause; that would be hemorrhoids or other benign conditions.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
