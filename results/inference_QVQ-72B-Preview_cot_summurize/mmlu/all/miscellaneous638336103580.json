                    "text": "So I came across this question: \"Who were the Know-Nothings? A. a '60's comedy troupe, B. computer designers, C. a political party, D. a spy ring.\" Hmm, I have to admit, I don't know much about this topic, but let's see if I can figure it out.\n\nFirst off, the name \"Know-Nothings\" sounds kind of vague and could refer to a few different things, but I think it's important to consider the context. Let me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests they were a '60s comedy troupe. I'm pretty familiar with comedy troupes from that era, like Monty Python or The Second City, but I don't recall any group called the Know-Nothings. Maybe they were less famous or more regional, but I doubt it, since they're being mentioned in this context. Probably not the right answer.\n\nOption B is computer designers. The '60s were a time when computers were starting to become more prominent, with the early days of mainframes and programming. But again, I don't remember any group called the Know-Nothings in that field. Maybe they were against technology or something, but that doesn't seem likely. Probably not this either.\n\nOption C is a political party. This rings a bell. I think I've heard of the Know-Nothing Party before, but I'm not sure about the details. Let me try to recall: I think it was in the 19th century, maybe around the time of the Civil War? I remember that there was a lot of political turmoil then, with issues like slavery and immigration. Maybe this party was involved in that.\n\nOption D is a spy ring. Spies have always been part of history, and the '60s were a time of Cold War tensions, with spy rings operating on both sides. But again, I don't recall any specific group called the Know-Nothings in that context. Maybe they were code-named that or something, but it seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the term \"Know-Nothings\" isn't directly tied to the '60s. Perhaps it's a misunderstanding. Wait a minute, the question might be referring to the original Know-Nothing Party from the 19th century, not the '60s. Maybe the timing is off in the options.\n\nI should consider that the Know-Nothings were a political party in the mid-19th century, known for their nativist policies, meaning they were against immigration, particularly from Catholic countries like Ireland and Germany. They were also secretive, hence the name \"Know-Nothings,\" because when asked about their activities, members were instructed to say \"I know nothing.\"\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option C, a political party, seems correct. But why are the other options there? Maybe to confuse me. The '60s comedy troupe seems like a red herring, and the computer designers and spy ring might be there to throw me off track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Know-Nothings\" is a term that has been used in different contexts over time. For example, maybe there was a group in the '60s that adopted the name for some reason. But I really don't think so; my knowledge of history doesn't recall any such group.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the question is trying to be tricky by associating the Know-Nothings with the '60s, but actually, they were from a much earlier period. If that's the case, then selecting option C, a political party, would be the correct choice.\n\nTo confirm, I'll do a quick mental check. The Know-Nothing Party, also known as the American Party, was formed in the 1850s and was known for their anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic platform. They were a significant force in American politics for a short while, even electing members to Congress and governing some states.\n\nGiven that information, it's clear that the Know-Nothings were indeed a political party. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any chance that the other options could be correct in some alternative interpretation. For instance, perhaps the term \"Know-Nothings\" was used to describe a group of computer designers who claimed no knowledge of certain things for security reasons. But that seems forced and unlikely.\n\nSimilarly, a spy ring might use the name \"Know-Nothings\" to denote their policy of compartmentalization, where members know only their part and nothing else. But again, this seems like a stretch, and I don't have any historical evidence to support it.\n\nLastly, a comedy troupe named the Know-Nothings? Well, comedians often use ironic or self-deprecating names, but I don't recall any such group from the '60s or otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, based on historical facts, the Know-Nothings were a political party, specifically from the mid-19th century known for their nativist and anti-immigrant policies. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Who were the Know-Nothings?\" is option C, a political party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
