                    "text": "Let's see. I know that two matrices A and B are similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP. Given that A and B are invertible n x n matrices and they're similar, I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nStarting with statement I: A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\n\nHmm, I wonder if I can use the similarity of A and B to show that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar. Let's think about it. If B = P^{-1}AP, then what happens if I subtract 2I from both sides?\n\nSo, B - 2I = P^{-1}AP - 2I. Can I factor this as P^{-1}A P - 2I? Wait, that doesn't seem directly helpful. Maybe I should think about conjugating A - 2I by P.\n\nLet's try: P^{-1}(A - 2I)P = P^{-1}A P - P^{-1}(2I)P. Since P^{-1}P = I, this simplifies to B - 2I. So, P^{-1}(A - 2I)P = B - 2I, which means that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices. So, statement I must be true.\n\nNext, statement II: A and B have the same trace.\n\nI recall that similar matrices have the same trace. Let's confirm this. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries, and it's invariant under similarity transformations. That is, tr(B) = tr(P^{-1}AP) = tr(A), because trace is cyclic: tr(P^{-1}AP) = tr(A P P^{-1}) = tr(A I) = tr(A). So, yes, similar matrices have the same trace. Therefore, statement II must be true.\n\nNow, statement III: A^{-1} and B^{-1} are similar matrices.\n\nGiven that A and B are similar and invertible, I need to see if A^{-1} and B^{-1} are similar. Let's see. If B = P^{-1}AP, then what is B^{-1}? Well, B^{-1} = (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P. So, B^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P. This looks similar to A^{-1}. In fact, this shows that A^{-1} and B^{-1} are similar matrices, since B^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P. Therefore, statement III must also be true.\n\nSo, all three statements I, II, and III are true. But wait, the question says \"which of the following statements must be true?\" and the options are I only, II only, III only, or I, II, and III. Based on my reasoning, it seems like I, II, and III are all true. So, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor statement I: We showed that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar via the conjugation by P, which seems correct.\n\nFor statement II: We used the property that the trace is invariant under similarity, which is a standard result in linear algebra.\n\nFor statement III: We showed that B^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P, which directly implies that A^{-1} and B^{-1} are similar.\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, the correct choice is D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{D}\\]"
