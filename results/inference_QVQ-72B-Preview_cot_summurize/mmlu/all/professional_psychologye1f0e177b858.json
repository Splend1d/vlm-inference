                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about an employee who's not really into their job at this big manufacturing firm. They're just doing the bare minimum and don't seem motivated to produce more or better work. According to F. Herzberg's two-factor theory, the question is asking what's the best way to increase this worker's self-motivation.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what Herzberg's two-factor theory is all about. I remember that Herzberg proposed that there are two types of factors that influence job satisfaction and motivation: hygiene factors and motivators.\n\nHygiene factors are things like salary, job security, working conditions, and company policies. These are important because if they're not satisfactory, they can lead to dissatisfaction among employees. However, even if these factors are good, they might not necessarily motivate employees to perform better; they just prevent dissatisfaction.\n\nOn the other hand, motivators are factors that can actually inspire employees to perform better and feel more satisfied with their jobs. These include things like achievement, recognition, responsibility, advancement, and the work itself being challenging and meaningful.\n\nSo, in this case, the employee seems to be in a situation where the hygiene factors might be okay\u2014they're staying for the money, which is a hygiene factor\u2014but they're not being motivated by the job itself. They're not finding satisfaction or challenge in their work.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Offer a raise and incentive pay for greater productivity.\n\nThis seems like it's focusing on hygiene factors, specifically salary. While it might temporarily boost motivation, it's not likely to have a long-term effect on self-motivation according to Herzberg's theory. Plus, the employee is already staying for the money, so maybe money isn't the issue here.\n\nB. Redesign the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThis sounds like it's addressing the motivator factors. By making the job more challenging and giving the employee a sense of accomplishment, you're tapping into what can truly motivate them. Herzberg would suggest that this is a better approach to increase self-motivation.\n\nC. Increase opportunities for informed social interaction.\n\nThis seems a bit vague. Social interaction can be important for some employees, but it's not directly related to Herzberg's motivator factors. It might be more related to the work environment, which could be considered a hygiene factor.\n\nD. Provide the employee with a job title carrying greater prestige.\n\nThis seems like it's related to status or recognition, which can be a motivator. However, just changing the job title might not necessarily make the work itself more challenging or meaningful, which are key aspects of motivator factors.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to be the most aligned with Herzberg's two-factor theory for increasing self-motivation. By redesigning the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment, you're directly addressing the motivator factors that can lead to greater job satisfaction and motivation.\n\nBut let me think about this more deeply. Maybe offering a raise could be a short-term solution, but in the long run, if the employee doesn't find intrinsic value in the work, they might still not be motivated. Similarly, giving them a fancier job title might make them feel better temporarily, but if the actual work doesn't change in a way that provides more challenge or meaning, the effect might be limited.\n\nIncreasing opportunities for informed social interaction could potentially help if the employee feels isolated or disconnected from their colleagues, but again, this isn't directly addressing the lack of challenge or accomplishment in the job itself.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the best approach here is to redesign the job to make it more challenging and to give the employee a clearer path to achievement and recognition. That way, you're addressing the motivator factors that Herzberg suggests are key to increasing self-motivation and job satisfaction.\n\nI should also remember that Herzberg's theory emphasizes that hygiene factors and motivators are distinct and need to be handled differently. While improving hygiene factors can help prevent dissatisfaction, only the motivators can truly drive motivation and job satisfaction.\n\nIn this scenario, since the employee is already content with the hygiene factors (they're staying for the money), the next step to increase motivation would be to enhance the motivator factors in their job.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Redesign the job to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
