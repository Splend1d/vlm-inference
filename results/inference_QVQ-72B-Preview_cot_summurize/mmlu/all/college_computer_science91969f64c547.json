                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about depth-first search (DFS) trees in graphs and some properties related to pre-order and post-order traversals, as well as lowest common ancestors (LCAs). The problem gives us a connected undirected graph G, and T is a DFS tree of G. For each vertex v in T, pre(v) is defined as the number of nodes visited up to and including v during a pre-order traversal of T, and post(v) is similarly defined for post-order traversal. We're also given that (u, v) is an edge in G that is not in T, and that pre(u) < pre(v). We need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic concepts:\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** This is a way to traverse or search a graph. It starts at a root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\n2. **DFS Tree (T):** This is the tree formed by the edges used during the DFS traversal.\n\n3. **Pre-order Traversal:** In tree traversal, pre-order means visit the root first, then traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree.\n\n4. **Post-order Traversal:** In tree traversal, post-order means traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, then visit the root.\n\n5. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):** For two nodes u and v in a tree, the LCA is the deepest node that has both u and v as descendants.\n\nGiven that (u, v) is an edge in G not in T, this is a back edge in the DFS traversal. In DFS, edges are categorized into tree edges (forming the tree T) and back edges. Back edges connect a node to an ancestor in the DFS tree.\n\nThe problem states that pre(u) < pre(v), meaning that u was visited before v in the pre-order traversal.\n\nLet's consider each statement:\n\n**I. post(u) < post(v)**\n\nIn DFS, for any two nodes u and v where there is a back edge from v to u (meaning v is a descendant of u), post(u) > post(v). However, since (u, v) is a back edge and pre(u) < pre(v), we need to determine the relationship between their post times.\n\nWait a minute, in DFS, for a back edge from v to u, v is a descendant of u, and post(u) > post(v). But here, the edge is from u to v, not v to u. So, I need to think carefully.\n\nActually, in DFS, if (u, v) is a back edge, it means that v is an ancestor of u. So, u is a descendant of v, and therefore post(v) > post(u). But the problem says pre(u) < pre(v), which might imply something else.\n\nLet me think differently. In DFS, the pre-order visit times increase as nodes are visited, and post-order times increase as nodes are finished being visited.\n\nGiven that pre(u) < pre(v), it means that u was visited before v.\n\nNow, since (u, v) is a back edge, it means that v is an ancestor of u in the DFS tree T.\n\nWait, no. In DFS, a back edge goes from a node to an ancestor. So if (u, v) is a back edge, it means that v is an ancestor of u.\n\nTherefore, v is an ancestor of u, so u is a descendant of v.\n\nIn this case, post(v) > post(u), because descendants have smaller post times than their ancestors.\n\nBut the statement is post(u) < post(v), which would be true if v is an ancestor of u.\n\nWait, but the problem says pre(u) < pre(v), and (u, v) is a back edge from u to v, implying v is an ancestor of u.\n\nTherefore, post(v) > post(u), which means post(u) < post(v).\n\nSo, statement I is true.\n\n**II. u is an ancestor of v in T.**\n\nGiven that (u, v) is a back edge, and in DFS, back edges go from a node to one of its ancestors.\n\nSo, v is an ancestor of u, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, u is a descendant of v.\n\nHence, statement II is false.\n\n**III. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.**\n\nGiven that v is an ancestor of u (since (u, v) is a back edge), the LCA of u and v would be v, because v is already an ancestor of u.\n\nWait, but the statement says w = u, which seems contradictory.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf v is an ancestor of u, then the path from u to the root passes through v.\n\nTherefore, the LCA of u and v is v, not u.\n\nSo, w = v, not u.\n\nTherefore, statement III is false.\n\nSo, only statement I is true.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that post(u) < post(v) is true, but let me double-check.\n\nIn DFS, for any two nodes where one is an ancestor of the other, the ancestor has a higher post time than the descendant.\n\nSo, since v is an ancestor of u, post(v) > post(u), which means post(u) < post(v).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, only statement I must be true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
