                    "text": "Let's see here. So, there's this 14-year-old girl who took a candy bar from a drugstore without paying for it. She was caught by the security guard, who accused her of stealing. Now, at the juvenile delinquency court hearing, the security guard wants to testify about what the girl said when she broke down and cried. Her lawyer is objecting, but there's a question about whether her statement should be admitted. The options are:\n\nA. Miranda warnings don't have to be given to juveniles.\n\nB. The security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation.\n\nC. The security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\n\nD. The girl was not in custody.\n\nHmm, I need to think about this. First off, I know that in criminal cases, statements made by defendants can sometimes be excluded if they weren't given Miranda warnings or if they were coerced. But this is a juvenile delinquency case, which is different from adult criminal proceedings. Juvenile courts focus more on rehabilitation than punishment.\n\nBut let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that Miranda warnings need not be given to juveniles. I think that's not entirely accurate. Miranda warnings are required when a person is in custody and being interrogated, regardless of age. So, even juveniles have Miranda rights. Maybe the wording is a bit tricky here.\n\nOption B says that the security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation. Well, an accusation is different from an interrogation. An interrogation is when someone is being questioned about a crime. If the security guard accused her of stealing and she admitted it, that might not be considered an interrogation. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest reason to admit her statement.\n\nOption C mentions that the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government. That could be relevant because Miranda rights apply to questioning by government officials, like police officers. If the security guard is a private employee, not a police officer, maybe Miranda warnings aren't required. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says the girl was not in custody. Custody is a key factor in determining whether Miranda warnings are needed. If she wasn't in custody, meaning she was free to leave, then her statement might be admissible without Miranda warnings.\n\nNow, let's think about this more carefully. The security guard grabbed her arm and accused her of stealing. That sounds like she wasn't free to leave at that moment. So, was she in custody? Grabbing someone's arm could be considered restraint, making her not free to leave. So, maybe she was in custody.\n\nBut, the security guard is not a government official; he's likely a private employee of the store. So, does that mean Miranda warnings aren't required in this situation because the person questioning her isn't a government agent?\n\nI think that's a strong point. Miranda rights apply to questioning by law enforcement officers or their agents. Private citizens, like security guards, aren't subject to Miranda requirements. So, even if the girl was in custody in some sense, since the security guard isn't a government official, Miranda warnings wouldn't apply.\n\nWait, but if the security guard is acting on behalf of the government, like if he's working with the police, then maybe Miranda would apply. But in this case, there's no indication that the security guard is acting as an agent of the government.\n\nSo, option C seems like a strong reason to admit her statement. The security guard wasn't employed by an agency of the government, so Miranda warnings weren't required.\n\nBut let's double-check. Was she in custody? The security guard grabbed her arm, which could be considered a temporary detention. But since he's not a police officer, and it was a private interaction, maybe the rules are different.\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, private security guards might be considered to have some law enforcement powers, especially if they're off-duty police officers or have special training. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: was the girl's statement voluntary? She broke down and cried, then told the security guard she was hungry because she hadn't eaten lunch. That seems like an explanation for why she took the candy bar. Was she coerced into making that statement?\n\nGrabbing someone's arm and accusing them of stealing could be seen as coercive, but again, since the security guard isn't a government official, Miranda might not apply.\n\nPerhaps the statement is admissible because Miranda warnings weren't necessary in the first place, given the security guard's private employment status.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is being offered for a different purpose, not as an admission of guilt, but as an explanation of her state of mind or as part of the res gestae.\n\nBut the question seems to focus on the admissibility of her statement regarding the theft, which is directly related to the charge.\n\nI think the best answer is option C: the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government. Therefore, Miranda warnings weren't required, and her statement is admissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
