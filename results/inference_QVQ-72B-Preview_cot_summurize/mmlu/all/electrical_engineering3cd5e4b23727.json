                    "text": "So I have this question: \"How many entries will be in the truth table of a 3 input NAND gate?\" And the options are A. 3, B. 6, C. 8, D. 9. Hmm, I need to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on truth tables and logic gates, but let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that a NAND gate is a digital logic gate that outputs true or 1 only when at least one of its input arguments is false or 0. Wait, actually, that sounds more like an OR gate. Let me correct that. A NAND gate outputs 0 only when all its inputs are 1; otherwise, it outputs 1. Okay, that's clearer.\n\nSo, it's a 3-input NAND gate. That means there are three inputs, and I need to determine how many possible combinations of inputs there are, which will give me the number of entries in the truth table.\n\nFor a single input gate, like a NOT gate, there are 2 possibilities: input is 0 or 1.\n\nFor a two-input gate, like an AND or OR gate, there are 2^2 = 4 possibilities: 00, 01, 10, 11.\n\nSimilarly, for a three-input gate, it should be 2^3 = 8 possibilities: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.\n\nSo, the truth table would have 8 rows, each corresponding to one of these input combinations, and then a column for the output.\n\nWait a minute, but the question mentions a 3-input NAND gate. Is there anything special about NAND that might change the number of entries? I don't think so. It's still a 3-input gate, so there should be 8 possible combinations.\n\nLet me double-check this. In digital electronics, the number of possible input combinations for a gate with n inputs is always 2^n. So for n=3, it's 8. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what a NAND gate does. As I recalled earlier, a NAND gate produces a 0 output only when all its inputs are 1; otherwise, it outputs 1. So, in a 3-input NAND gate, the only combination that would produce a 0 is when all three inputs are 1, i.e., 111. All other combinations will produce 1.\n\nBut does that change the number of entries in the truth table? No, because all combinations are still possible, and each has a corresponding output.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that for each possible input combination, there is one output, so the total number of entries is equal to the number of input combinations, which is 8 for 3 inputs.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The answer should simply be C. 8.\n\nWait, but let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nIs there any scenario where it wouldn't be 8 for a 3-input gate? Not that I can think of right now. It's a standard truth table for a 3-input digital logic gate.\n\nMaybe the confusion comes from the fact that sometimes truth tables are presented with certain symmetries or by grouping similar outputs together, but that doesn't reduce the number of entries; it just organizes them differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what constitutes an \"entry\" in the truth table. But in standard notation, each row represents one input combination and its corresponding output, so for 3 inputs, there are 8 rows.\n\nI think I'm confident with that. So, the number of entries in the truth table of a 3-input NAND gate is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
