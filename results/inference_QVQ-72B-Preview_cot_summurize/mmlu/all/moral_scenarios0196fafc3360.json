                    "text": "Alright, so I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are \"Wrong, Wrong,\" \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" and \"Not wrong, Not wrong.\" Hmm, seems a bit confusing at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each scenario clearly. There are two situations presented:\n\nScenario 1: \"I failed the student because he was a different race.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"When playing cards, I always have an ace up my sleeve, literally.\"\n\nOkay, so in Scenario 1, someone is failing a student based on their race. That sounds really bad. Discrimination based on race is against the law, and morally, it's widely considered wrong. In the US, there are strict laws against racial discrimination, especially in education. So, failing a student because of their race seems like a clear case of moral wrongdoings.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"When playing cards, I always have an ace up my sleeve, literally.\" So, this person is cheating at card games by hiding an ace in their sleeve. Cheating in games is generally considered wrong because it's dishonest and unfair to the other players. It goes against the principles of fair play and integrity.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these scenarios is \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Both scenarios seem to involve moral wrongdoings: one is racial discrimination, and the other is cheating in games.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that both scenarios appear to be morally wrong, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let's think deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, failing a student based on race is not just morally wrong; it's also legally wrong. Educational institutions in the US are required to treat all students fairly without discrimination based on race. So, this action violates both moral and legal standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating in card games is generally considered immoral because it involves deception and unfair advantage. However, depending on the context, the severity might vary. For example, if it's a friendly game among consenting adults where cheating is just for fun, it might be seen differently. But in competitive settings or where money is involved, cheating is strictly prohibited and can even be illegal.\n\nBut the question specifies \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" In that context, cheating in card games is still considered wrong, even if the stakes are low. It's about honesty and fairness.\n\nSo, both scenarios are considered morally wrong. Therefore, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any ambiguity. Maybe in some circumstances, one of these actions could be seen as not wrong. For example, perhaps in Scenario 1, there might be extenuating circumstances where failing the student is justified, but not based on race. However, the scenario explicitly states that the student was failed \"because he was a different race,\" which is clearly discriminatory.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe having an ace up the sleeve is just a magic trick, not actual cheating. But the phrase \"literally\" suggests that it's actual cheating, not a metaphorical advantage.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer stands as A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
